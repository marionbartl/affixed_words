Mr Kennedy is fighting cancer Veteran US senator Ted Kennedy is to be awarded an honorary knighthood .
The Queen has agreed the honour for the brother of former US president John F Kennedy for services to the US - UK relationship and to Northern Ireland .
Gordon Brown formally announced the award to the 77 - year - old during his address to both houses of Congress .
The prime minister 's speech came on the second full day of his visit to the US , which featured brief talks with President Obama on Tuesday .
We owe a great debt to the life and courage of Senator Edward Kennedy
Gordon Brown Senator Kennedy , who is being treated for a brain tumour , was unable to attend Congress for the speech .
In his address Mr Brown said : " I hope that you will allow me to single out for special mention today one of your most distinguished senators , known in every continent and a great friend .
" Northern Ireland is today at peace , more Americans have health care , more children around the world are going to school and for all those things we owe a great debt to the life and courage of Senator Edward Kennedy .
" And so today , having talked to him last night , I want to announce that Her Majesty the Queen has awarded an honorary knighthood for Sir Edward Kennedy . "
Mr Kennedy has been a senator for his home state of Massachusetts for more than 46 years .
The most senior living member of the famous Irish - American political dynasty , he was diagnosed with brain cancer in May last year after being rushed to hospital with stroke - like symptoms .
Seizure
He has since had chemotherapy and radiation to treat the malignant glioma , an aggressive type of brain tumour .
Mr Kennedy suffered another seizure during President Barack Obama 's inaugural lunch in January , but was released from hospital a day later .
The father - of - five was elected to the US Senate as a Democrat in 1962 following the election of his brother as president .
Apart from his famous family connections , he is probably best known in the UK for his work on the Northern Ireland peace process .
Steven Spielberg is another American with an honorary knighthood
He has been intricately involved in politics there , meeting Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and other politicians during and beyond the Good Friday agreement .
He famously snubbed Adams during the latter 's St Patrick 's Day trip to the US in 2005 following the brutal killing of Robert McCartney .
The IRA , closely allied to Sinn Fein , was accused of involvement in his murder .
Mr Kennedy joins a select band of overseas nationals given an honorary knighthood .
Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates , former president George Bush senior , former mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani and the film director Steven Spielberg have also received the honour .

While overall music sales were up 10 percent in 2008 , the year saw a drop not only in CD sales , but in the number of customers actually purchasing music .
But according to a new report , the act of music listening is actually on the rise .
While digital music purchases remain strong , the numbers show that there is still much more work to be done in the industry 's transition to a new , more diverse set of business models .
Sympathy for the devil ?
NPD 's annual Digital Music Study found that there were 17 million fewer CD customers in 2008 than in past years .
CD sales have been dropping for quite some time , and while 1.5 billion songs were sold digitally last year , the number of Internet users paying for digital music only increased by 8 million in 2008 .
NPD saw all demographics pulling back on CD purchases , but the most significant groups were teenagers and those over 50 .
The primary reason for cutting down on CD purchases was a simple slashing of entertainment budgets across all demographics .
Cheaper prices for digital albums also affected consumers ' thinking about physical CD prices ( which suddenly seem more expensive ) , but the pick - and - chose nature of buying individual songs and instant delivery also provided a boost for digital downloads .
Gaming also helped to steal attention away from music , as the industry experienced record billion - dollar growth in 2007 and 2008 .
As CD sales continue their nosedive into oblivion and the worldwide recession takes hold , the companies that used to make physical media are feeling the effects .
Last week , laid - off workers in a French Sony media plant effectively held boss Serge Foucher and head of Human Resources Roland Bentz hostage overnight by blocking the factory doors .
The employees , who made tapes and other recordable media , were upset over the terms of their severance package ( they would only get thousands of euros in relocation assistance and up to a year of severance pay , which was apparently offensive to their " dignity " ) .
The executives were allowed to leave the building after agreeing to restart talks over the terms .
Not all news is grim
One trend that may finally be going mainstream is music streaming services .
NPD 's report notes that awareness and usage of Pandora doubled year - over - year to 18 percent of Internet users .
Social network music streaming is also on the rise , as usage rose from 15 to 19 percent year - over - year .
Nearly half of US teens are " engaging with music on social networks " now , so new revenue opportunities like premium account memberships and advertising are following .
Finally , NPD 's report notes that " the music industry now has to redouble efforts to intercept and engage these listeners " in order to harness new revenue options like " upselling music , videos , concert tickets , and related merchandise . "
This is an idea that MySpace Music launched with last September , as the service offers merchandise like band t- shirts and Amazon goods when users purchase DRM - free MP3s .
The music industry is certainly experiencing a tough transition into the digital realm , but there 's still money to made off of recorded music .
The iTunes Store reached a digital music milestone in 2008 by passing Wal - Mart to become the number one music retailer in the US .
There are now 36 million digital music customers , and digital music downloads now account for 33 percent of all music tracks purchased in the US .
Convincing customers to buy complete albums , though , now relies on overall album quality , not on forcing people to buy full CDs — and that means overall industry revenues may not recover to the levels seen during the CD boom years anytime soon .

AN Islamic school in Camden would be " a breeding ground for terrorists " , says a resident who gave evidence in support of Camden Council at an appeal against its decision to block the school .
Judith Bond said the school would teach war and how to kill .

" Values of violence will be emphasised .
It will be a breeding ground for terrorists …
There will be a surge of gang rapes , looting and attacking infidels , " Ms Bond said .
Camden residents presented evidence via DVD at the second day of a hearing to decide whether the $ 19 million Islamic school should be built on the outskirts of the town south - west of Sydney .
Newsday columnist Ellis Henican took on Bill O'Reilly last night to talk about President Obama 's decision to leave the door open for prosecutions of Bush administration officials for creating its now - defunct torture regime .
And frankly , he did as well I 've ever seen anyone do in the canned , no -win setup that is The O'Reilly Factor .
He went toe - to - toe with O'Reilly on the factual points -- and in fact started scoring so well that O'Reilly was reduced to blurting out increasingly outrageous pronouncements .
First , it 's clear that O'Reilly was only familiar with the GOP Talking Points [ tm ] version of the letter written by National Intelligence Director Dennis Blair in which he talks about " high value information " obtained through these techniques .
But here 's the actual letter .
As you can see from reading it , unlike the edited - down version O'Reilly and the GOPTP offer , Blair makes clear that he probably would have opposed the use of torture and clearly disapproves of it now :
Those methods , read on a bright , sunny , safe day in April 2009 , appear graphic and disturbing .
As the President has made clear , and as both CIA Director Panetta and I have stated , we will not use those techniques in the future .
I like to think I would not have approved those methods in the past , but I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time , and I will absolutely defend those who carried out the interrogations within the orders they were given .
Moreover , Blair further clarified himself the next day in the New York Times , explaining exactly why he would not have approved it :
" The information gained from these techniques was valuable in some instances , but there is no way of knowing whether the same information could have been obtained through other means , " Admiral Blair said in a written statement issued last night .
" The bottom line is these techniques have hurt our image around the world , the damage they have done to our interests far outweighed whatever benefit they gave us and they are not essential to our national security . "
O'Reilly clearly was unaware of this , so when Henican tosses it in his lap , he's at first confused , continuing to think that Blair and Henican have opposing views when they do n't .
It 's kind of an amusing instance of O'Reilly so enrapt with his own narrative he does n't recognize when it 's been knocked out from under him .
Indeed , Henican essentially repeats Blair 's words , and O'Reilly resorts to claiming that 's " not exactly " what he said .
From then on , O'Reilly is reduced to barking increasingly strident charges at Henican :
O'Reilly :
This was done to protect your life , you live in New York City .
You -- this was done to protect your life , and it worked !
That 's No. 1 . Henican :
We do n't know whether it worked .
O'Reilly : Yeah , we know it worked , you 're still alive !
And the attack on Los Angeles was aborted .
[ Crosstalk ]
O'Reilly : Wait , wait , wait .
We can establish facts .
And the facts are , this worked .
Henican :
Well , you say that .
O'Reilly :
They did it to protect us .
Henican :
You assert that .
Well , let me assert a couple of things .
O'Reilly : That 's the overwhelming evidence .
Henican :
Well , that 's what you 're focused on .
Let me focus on some other facts .
One is that these kinds of things cause huge problems for us afterward .
O'Reilly : Oh , now we 're in Theory World .
Here we go !
Henican :
You cannot face torture -- I know you like avoid that word , you prefer the euphemisms , but let 's call it what it is -- O'Reilly : No , it is n't !
That 's your opinion !*
Henican :
And you think waterboarding is lovely .
O'Reilly : I think it 's harsh interrogation .
Henican :
When they do it do our guys it 's not so lovely , is it ?
O'Reilly : Oh , stop it .
They behead our guys !
That 's ridiculous !
All right , wait a minute .
Now let me get into another -- I want to stay in facts .
Today , today , the two organizations that came out to encourage Obama to put the show trial on , are George Soros and MoveOn !
Henican : I do n't need to respond to MoveOn .
O'Reilly : No , you 're on the side of Soros and MoveOn !
Henican : I 'm on the side of doing something very simple here .
Let 's have an investigation -- let it be -- O'Reilly : Headed by who ?!
Henican : Let the Justice Department decide if a crime has been committed here -- O'Reilly : Oh , Holder ?
You want Holder in charge of that ?
Henican :
Let the facts be gathered here .
And let the facts be --
Why are you scared of the facts ?
Why wo n't you let the facts be gathered here , and take us where they lead ?
O'Reilly : You know who Eric Holder is ?
Henican :
He 's the Attorney General of the United States .
And the professionals in that office are going to make this decision , and not Eric Holder .
O'Reilly : OK , you listen to me .
You listen to me .
Eric Holder was second in command to Janet Reno .
Eric Holder and Janet Reno put the wall up between the FBI and the CIA , which led to the 9/11 attack !*
If anybody should be prosecuted , it 's him ! [ / snip ] ...
Holder is not qualified to do this .
And , and , here 's the deal : If Obama does this , it is the end of the Obama Presidency .
No , it 's the end !
It 's the end !
And if he gets hit , if we get hit after he does this , it 's over !
O'Reilly and the conservatives are trying their damnedest to sell everyone the notion that the end justifies the means .
It 's not working very well .
* Note : O'Reilly keeps yammering about facts , but he can't get any of them straight here .
For instance :
The " wall " O'Reilly references as having the blame for the 9/11 attacks -- at least on Planet Wingnuttia -- had nothing to do with a barrier between the CIA and the FBI ( Janet Reno erected no such wall ) .
The wall frequently blamed by the Right ( including O'Reilly ) for causing 9/11 was known as " Gorelick Wall , " which was based on a memo written by then - Deputy AG Jamie Gorelick ( who is not Eric Holder ) .
Moreover , " as the 1995 guidelines clearly state , the Gorelick memo and the guidelines applied only to intelligence sharing ' between the FBI and the Criminal Division ' within the Justice Department " -- and thus blaming it for the internal - intelligence failures that helped lead to 9/11 is a transcontinental leap at best .
Anyway , the answer to Henican 's question should be obvious : Bill O'Reilly is scared of the facts because he has been estranged from them for so long .
The extension of the fira de barcelona in montjuïc is planned half inside and half outside Barcelona ’s municipal term , at the back of the Montjuïc hill , following the Gran Via avenue straight to L’Hospitalet de Llobregat .
Japanese architect Toyo Ito won the competition for the masterplan of the project .
The exposition center will be composed of 9 pavilions and two 114 - meter towers , which will be used for hotels and offices .
The two towers will be the highest buildings in Hospitalet .
The hotel will also be the second highest hotel in the Barcelona metropolitan area .
The buildings feature energy saving devises , a water recovery system waste and the use of solar energy .
Each building has a symbolic organic shape , which should bring to mind elements found in nature such as rivers and clouds .
Natural light , well - conceived interior illumination and an adequate , functional organization , accessible to the different areas of the grounds , all dominate this design .
The towers ( and the whole project ) are due to be finished in 2009 and are conceived as a landmark , one ( a curvilinear red tower , the hotel ) being the counterpart of the other ( red , organic tower , placed inside a translucid prism , for offices ) .
This much is now clear .
Their clear and open intent is to do all they can , however they can , to sabotage the new administration ( and the economy to boot ) .
They want failure .
Even now .
Even after the last eight years .
Even in a recession as steeply dangerous as this one .
There are legitimate debates to be had ; and then there is the cynicism and surrealism of total political war .
We now should have even less doubt about what kind of people they are .
And the mountain of partisan vitriol Obama will have to climb every day of the next four or eight years .
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
THE top gun at driving formula one cars very fast , Lewis Hamilton , has expressed concerns that new restrictions on testing will potentially reduce the reliability of this year 's cars .
The new cars are technically untried in many areas beyond the controversial Kinetic Energy Recovery System .
There are new slick Bridgestone tyres with untried compounds , a mandated new aerodynamic package that could reduce downforce by as much as 50 per cent and all the usual pioneering technology seen before every new season .
It takes a same - sex marriage controversy to get anyone to care , talk about , or remember the Miss USA pageant even took place .
So : Well done , America !
( No , really , WELL DONE . )
When Miss California Carrie Prejean — a “ motivational speaker ” hopeful — responded to a question about whether she believes same - sex marriage should be legal , the Golden State ’s reigning beauty had the audacity to say “ no . ” OMG !
Even pretty people can be hateful !
( She did say “ no offense , ” so , uh , none taken ? )
But question asker and judge -y blogger Perez Hilton did n’t let it end there .
And neither did Prejean .
Immediately after the broadcast , Hilton made a video diary of his disgust in Prejean ’s response , calling her a “ bitch . ”
Then he went on MSNBC today and apologized for it .
AND THEN TOOK BACK HIS APOLOGY .
Prejean , meanwhile , this morning told Miss USA host Billy Bush that her own sister , who is straight , is a gay rights activist ( and Air Force lieutenant ) .
And her sister — did we mention the sister is not gay ?
— told Prejean she was n’t “ offended by anything you said , we have two different opinions , and I love you because of it .
I love you because you stood up for what was right , and it ’s not a matter of being gay or not gay .
It ’s a matter of you competing for Miss USA and getting a question and answering it to the best of your ability . ”
Adds Prejean : “ And should I have gotten that question ?
I do n’t think I should have . ”
Well , glad to know a heterosexual person does n’t take offense to a family member not supporting civil rights .
Losing the crown to Miss North Carolina , Prejean now says it was Hilton ’s question ( or her answer ) that cost her the crown .
Perhaps — because what type of PR shitstorm would Miss USA , a pageant that would n’t function without gay folks , invite upon itself if it crowned a homophobe ?
Illinois ' child welfare agency released an 84 - page report Friday detailing violence and abuse at one of Illinois ' largest psychiatric hospitals , as well as troubles throughout the 95 - hospital chain owned by Nashville - based Psychiatric Solutions .
The review comes after ProPublica and the Chicago Tribune reported in February about juvenile sexual assaults and an unreported death at Riveredge Hospital .
Last July , a Tribune investigation disclosed unreported violence among juvenile patients and spurred the child welfare agency to stop sending youths in state care to the facility .
" This facility remains on intake hold , " said Kendall Marlowe , spokesman for the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services , of Riveredge Hospital .
" The care provided by Riveredge was completely unacceptable , and we remain outraged at the pain and violence suffered by innocent children in this facility 's care . "
The state 's announcement came with the release of the critical report by researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago .
The report chronicles abuses at Riveredge and many of the hospitals owned by Psychatric Solutions Inc. of Nashville , Tenn .
Officials from the company , which operates in 30 states , could not immediately be reached for comment .
ProPublica and the Los Angeles Times reported in November about lapses in patient care at the company 's hospitals .
Riveredge owner Psychiatric Solutions Inc. issued a written statement to the Tribune saying that " from a historical perspective , we are disappointed with any incidents that occurred at the facility and deeply regret and apologize for any harm to one of our patients .
However , since September 2008 , we have not had any significant incidents at the facility and have provided quality care to our patients in a safe , therapeutic environment .
Based on the care being provided today , we disagree with the report 's focus , conclusions , and final recommendations . "
The report says DCFS " can have no reliable basis at this time " to send youth in state custody to the hospital .
The Illinois hospital review faulted Psychiatric Solutions executives for " blaming downward or blaming outward when things go wrong , " saying executives too easily rationalized problems by pointing to staff lapses or patients who fail to follow the rules .
" While this sort of organizational firewall provides a certain level of deniability for the hospital and corporate leadership , ( the state ) has a right to expect more with regard to systemic accountability from a major healthcare provider to whom it entrusts the treatment and safety of its wards , " said the report , written by Ronald Davidson , director of the UIC Mental Health Policy Program .
The report details " longstanding and recurring problems " throughout the hospital chain , including " unreliable incident reporting , " multiple patient deaths and the sexual assault of one 5 - year - old patient .
Corporate officials did not know about patient care problems " until the issues were dragged into the sunlight by the state investigators or – in some instances – the news media , " the report said .
" As the leadership of the largest psychiatric hospital corporation in the United States , however , they should have known , " the report says .
The researchers delved far into Riveredge Hospital records , examining the case of a 12 - year - old boy who alleged in 2006 that he was raped three times by a 15 - year - old boy .
Riveredge 's internal documents described the boy as " easily agitated " with a " tendency to fight with others . "
The hospital 's report to a regulatory body had concluded that the 12 - year - old 's claim of being a rape victim " appears inconsistent with the passive behaviors he describes for these incidents . "
The researchers challenged that characterization .
" Such an offensive innuendo , if made by a defense attorney cross-examining a rape victim , would likely be slapped down hard and fast by the judge as grossly improper , " the report says .
" … Implying that the victim might not be entirely truthful , it nevertheless raises some very troubling questions about the integrity of system - related accountability within this organization . "
Child welfare officials also said Friday that they will seek to increase the number of psychiatric hospital monitors within the department and will work with other state and federal agencies to explore policy changes .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Radiation has affected animals living near the site of Ukraine ’s Chernobyl nuclear disaster far more than was previously thought , a study showed Wednesday , challenging beliefs that local wildlife was on the rebound .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The study showed that numbers of bumble - bees , butterflies , spiders , grasshoppers and other invertebrates were lower in contaminated sites than other areas because of high levels of radiation left over from the blast more than 20 years ago .
The findings challenge earlier research that suggested animal populations were rebounding around the site of the Chernobyl explosion in Ukraine , which forced thousands to abandon their homes and evacuate the area .
Estimates of the number of deaths directly related to the accident vary .
The World Health Organization estimates the figure at 9,000 while the environmental group Greenpeace predicts an eventual death toll of 93,000 .
“ We were amazed to see that there had been no studies on this subject , ” Anders Moller , a researcher at the National Center for Scientific Research in France , who led the study , said in telephone interview .
“ Ours was the first study to focus on the abundance of animal populations . ”
Researchers said they had compared animal populations in radioactive areas with less contaminated plots and found that some were nearly completed depleted of animal life .
“ There are areas with an abundance of 100 animals per square meter , ” Moller said .
“ And then there are areas with less than one specimen per square meter on average ; the same goes for all groups of species . ”
The researchers also found that animals living near the Chernobyl reactor -- which was covered in a protective shell after it exploded in April 1986 -- had more deformities , including discoloration and stunted limbs , than normal .
“ Usually ( deformed ) animals get eaten quickly , as it ’s hard to escape if your wings are not the same length , ” Moller said .
“ In this case we found a high incidence of deformed animals . ”
The findings challenge the view of Chernobyl as ecologically sound , despite the fact that Ukrainian officials have turned it into a nature reserve , with wolves , bison and bears .
Earlier research into the area ignored the fact that animal populations had grown unimpeded in the absence of humans for many years after the blast , Moller said .
“ We wanted to ask the question :
Are there more or fewer animals in the contaminated areas ?
Clearly there were fewer , ” said Moller , who has worked on Chernobyl since 1991 .
While researchers focused on the 30 kilometer radius around the Chernobyl reactor , the fallout from the explosion covered a vast swathe of Eastern Europe , including parts of Russia , Ukraine and Belarus .
The findings probably apply to those areas as well , Moller said , adding that any decontamination effort was unlikely due to the extent of the fallout .

Dahlia Lithwick writes in Slate about the insane smear campaign being waged by the wingnut right against Harold Koh , Obama ’s nominee for legal adviser to the State Department :
Every one of the anti-Koh rants dutifully repeats a canard that first appeared in a hatchet piece in the New York Post by former Bush administration speechwriter Meghan Clyne .
She asserts that Koh believes “ Sharia law could apply to disputes in US courts . ”
The evidence for her claim ?
“ A New York lawyer , Steven Stein , says that , in addressing the Yale Club of Greenwich in 2007 , Koh claimed that ‘ in an appropriate case , he did n’t see any reason why Sharia law would not be applied to govern a case in the United States . ’ “ …. But , of course , Koh believes nothing of the sort .
And the only real revelation here is that truth ca n’t be measured in Google hit counts or partisan hysteria . …. Clyne ’s gross distortions of Koh ’s views have gone completely unanswered in the mainstream press .
You can certainly argue that ignoring the whole story signals that it ’s beneath notice … .
[ But ] when moderate Americans and the mainstream media allow a handful of right - wing zealots to occupy the field in the public discussions of an Obama nominee , they become complicit in a character assassination .
The right - wing nutcase machine really does seem to have picked up from its Clinton - era follies without missing a beat .
But although Lithwick right about the moral dimensions of this kind of smear campaign , there ’s also a practical aspect : it ’s yet another part of the increasingly dismal Senate kabuki show that makes it harder and harder to fill high - level administration positions .
It ’s one thing to go through this kind of harangue to become Secretary of State , but it ’s quite another to go through it to become merely a high - level aide , and as this stuff gets more and more rabid , fewer and fewer people are willing to put up with it .
So let ’s knock it off .
We ca n’t stop the wingnuts , but we can take the wind out of their sails by taking away their platform .
After all , is there really any reason why the Senate needs to confirm the legal advisor to the State Deparment in the first place ?
No ?
I did n’t think so .
Saying that calls for prosecution of Bush officials can never let up , the director of the staid and respectable Center for Constitutional Rights , who is a legal scholar , has said that the legal arguments made in the infamous
Yoo memos amount to treason against the nation 's institutions , similar to the " Fuhrer 's law " of Nazi Germany .
Naomi Wolf , a non-lawyer , mused before her interview with Michael Ratner :
The memos [ revealed in early March ] lay the legal groundwork for the president to send the military to wage war against U.S. citizens ; take them from their homes to Navy brigs without trial and keep them forever ; close down the First Amendment ; and invade whatever country he chooses without regard to any treaty or objection by Congress ...
The memos could not be clearer :
This was the legal groundwork of an attempted coup .
I expected massive front page headlines from the revelation that these memos exited .
Almost nothing .
I was shocked .
Wolf then sought out the Center for Constitutional Rights ' Michael Ratner to understand what she was missing .
The Yoo memos seemed to say that the president 's authority as commander in chief is not bound by any law , any treaty , or the protections of free speech , due process and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures .
" The First , Fourth and Fifth amendments -- gone , " she wrote .
Legal expert Michal Ratner agreed :
What [ the Yoo memos ] actually mean is that the president can order the military to operate in the U.S. and to operate without constitutional restrictions .
They -- the military -- can pick you or me up in the U.S. for any reason and without any legal process .
They would not have any restrictions on entering your house to search it , or to seize you .
They can put you into a brig without any due process or going to court .
( That 's the Fourth and Fifth amendments . )
Who has suspended the law this way in the past ?
It is like a Caesar 's law in Rome ; a Mussolini 's law in Italy ; a Fuhrer 's law in Germany ; a Stalin 's law in the Soviet Union .
It is right down the line .
It is enforcing the will of the dictator through the military .
Ratner says the biggest hint we had that this was coming was when the military picked up Jose Padilla , going to a civilian prison and " snatching " him off to a brig under the orders of the president .
During his 3 1/2 year military detention , Padilla 's lawyers said he was subject to hooding , stress positions , assaults , and threats of imminent execution .
Warren Richey of the Christian Science Monitor reported :
" Padilla 's cell measured nine feet by seven feet .
The windows were covered over .
There was a toilet and sink .
The steel bunk was missing its mattress .
He had no pillow .
No sheet .
No clock .
No calendar .
No radio .
No television .
No telephone calls .
No visitors .
Even Padilla 's lawyer was prevented from seeing him for nearly two years .... [ Padilla 's captors ] punctured the extreme sensory deprivation with sensory overload , blasting him with harsh lights and pounding sounds . "
Padilla also stated that he was " injected with a ' truth serum , ' a substance his lawyers believe was LSD or PCP .
Deprived of any view of the outside world , with the lights always kept on , Padilla had no way of knowing what time of day it was or what day of the week .
Padilla 's attorney Andrew Patel said , " I was told by members of the brig staff that Mr. Padilla 's temperament was so docile and inactive that his behavior was like that of ' a piece of furniture . ' "
Patel described how it was difficult to work with Padilla in his defense , because " Mr. Padilla remains unsure if I and the other attorneys working on his case are actually his attorneys or another component of the government 's interrogation scheme . "
Padilla was found guilty based on the testimony of a terrorist suspect whose interrogation tapes were among those ordered destroyed by CIA chief General Michael Hayden .
Paul Craig Roberts , former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan and an editor of the Wall Street Journal , criticized the jury 's verdict in the Padilla case as having " overthrown " the Constitution and doing far more damage to the US ' liberty than any terrorist could .
Ratner states
" We need the deterrence of prosecution so this does not happen again . "
He said in the interview with Wolf :
Treason need not involve another state .
Aaron Burr was tried for treason .
The authority given by these memos that could be used to raid every congressional office , raid and search every home , detain tens of thousands , would certainly fit a definition of treason .
This would be the president making war against the institutions of the United States .

1st release of ocaml - autoconf
A couple of months ago , I joined an effort by Richard Jones to give a decent shape to autoconf macros for OCaml .
The situation was a tad annoying before , because we had unofficial ocaml .m4 files floating around , which have diverged one from another , with unclear licensing terms , incompatible features , ecc .
So we started a project on the ocamlforge to coordinate all this , injected the best we could find around , add docs , polish features , and contacted copyright owner to uniform licensing terms ( to a 3 - clause BSD ) .
Yesterday we finally released ocaml - autoconf 1.0 .
Rich 's blog post on the subject contains a nice how to to kick start your OCaml project using autotools up to automake .
A brief feature overview is in order :
single macro to detect main executables of the ocaml toolchain and whether native code compilation * is available or not
cross-compilation support
findlib detection and package checking , with support for alternative package names ( e.g. " zip " vs " camlzip " on GODI vs Debian )
detection of OCaml module by module path
Enjoy , and give us feedback ( bug reports , feature requests , ... ) using our tracker .
Film maker Rob Spence has already fitted an LED light inside his prosthetic eye .

Canadian filmmaker Rob Spence damaged his right eye in a childhood accident and was later given a prosthetic replacement .
Like any other false eye , it was designed to be purely an aesthetic replacement , but he realised that the vacant bit of face real estate could be put to better use in his art .
Now Spence is attempting to build a wireless video camera into his synthetic eye , turning himself into a self - proclaimed “ Eyeborg “ .

The camera will record anything and anyone that enters Spence ’s field of vision and relay the footage back to a computer .
That video will provide a unique perspective on the way video surveillance is becoming more popular in western societies , he told New Scientist .
This week , Spence and engineer Kosta Grammatis have succeeded in placing a working red LED in Spence ’s eye ( see image , above right ) , giving him a look not dissimilar from Arnold Schwarzenegger ’s cyborg in The Terminator .
Although this is a diversion from the main goal , it is the first time the team has fitted a working electronic device , complete with power source , into the eye socket , says Spence .
An LED may even be fitted alongside the camera in the final Eyeborg prosthetic if the battery can spare enough power , he adds .
Apart from the aesthetic value , it could provide lighting in dark conditions .

Children in this suburb of New York will just have to suffer being unfashionable , at least during school hours , because the slap - bracelet has been banned at two elementary schools .
The low - budget bracelets , which come in wild patterns and neon colors and coil around a wrist after a well - placed slap against the skin , are not allowed at Colonial and Siwanoy schools because of the possibility of injury , their principal , Joseph Longobardi , said Tuesday .
The bracelets are nine - inch flexible metal slats , much like Venetian blind material , covered with bright colored fabric .
If the fabric wears away , Mr. Longobardi said , a sharp edge could be exposed and cut hands and arms .
He banned the bracelets after hearing of injuries in the West Orchard Elementary School in Chappaqua , N.Y .
Officials there said a pupil who had removed the cloth covering required three stitches in her hand after she was cut with an exposed bracelet edge .

How to Buy an IT Product
Suppose your IT organization is in the market for a new IT product ( or service , but I ’ll use the word “ product ” here to simplify the discussion ) .
It could be a computer , network device or other hardware item , or it could be a software package or SaaS ( software as a service ) .
Regardless of what you ’re looking for , you ’ll probably go through a process that you ’ve used over and over again for product selection .
And there ’s a good chance that your process is flawed .
You wo n’t select the best product , and you ’ll be burdened with having to support the wrong product for years to come .
It does n’t have to be that way .
In this article I ’ll go through a list of common criteria for IT product selection , and I ’ll give you my recommendations for change .
Use this article to fine - tune your product selection process , and the result will be the selection of a product that ’s a better fit for your true business needs .
The Most Common Product Selection Criteria
Here ’s my list of the most common criteria for product selection , in descending sequence by the popularity I ’ve seen .
There ’s no science here , and I have n’t taken a survey .
These ratings are based on my own experience :
1. A checklist of “ requirements ”
This sounds like it ought to be a good way to select a product , but unfortunately the checklist is usually based on a wish list generated by the business users , with no distinction among what ’s essential now , what ’s important in the future , and what ’s a nice - to - have .
In simple pass / fail product selection , you narrow your list of product candidates by eliminating all candidates which have omissions on this checklist .
The vendors know how this game is played , so most vendors have included capabilities in their feature lists which match the most common checklist items .
Unfortunately , the vendor need to provide these checklist items is so great that most vendors stretch the truth .
If their product really does n’t provide a certain capability , they ’ll figure out a narrow case in which the product sort - of fits the checklist description .
Or they ’ll provide a clumsy workaround to address the need , and then claim to have the capability .
My advice : Using a checklist of requirements is fine if , and only if , you :
Limit the requirements to what you really need , plus what you think you ’ll need in the future .
Include nice - to - have features in a separate list if you want to , but do n’t use the nice - to - have items in your product selection process to eliminate potential products .
Push the vendors to show you exactly how each checklist item is provided by their product .
If the explanation seems the least bit contrived , then talk to current customers of the vendor who are using the capability the vendor claims to have .
Make absolutely sure that the vendor is n’t trying to satisfy the requirement in name only , with no commitment to provide the complete capability in an easily usable way .
2 . The one your boss wants
This is the second most widely used selection criterion .
It might even be a good way to pick a product , but you wo n’t know unless you know how your boss made the choice .
My advice :
Do n’t just take your boss ’s word for it .
Follow through with the other selection criteria and decide independently whether you agree with the boss ’s recommendation / edict .
If you end up agreeing , then fine ; now you ’ll have some reasons to support the decision .
And if you disagree , then you ’ll need all the ammunition you can get to make the case that you ought to go with an alternate vendor .
3 . You trust the vendor
This is a popular selection criterion , but it is n’t usually stated as the explicit reason for the decision .
Realistically , your job is on the line based on the product decision you make , and you ’ll feel more comfortable going with a vendor you trust .
That trust can come from the size of the vendor , the vendor ’s financial stability , or a proven track record of vendor sales to your company in the past .
It will often come from personal relationships that you ’ve built with vendor representatives .
My advice : Make an effort to build a relationship with competing vendors .
Find out whether you can trust them as well .
If you only go with vendors you already have a trusting relationship with , then you ’ll always go with the same vendors .
That ’s not necessarily a bad thing if your IT group is wildly successful with its current technology , if none of your competitors are doing any better than you , and if there are no technology breakthroughs in the future which might make your current technology obsolete .
But given that all three of these things probably are n’t true , you owe it to yourself to look at other vendors and products .
4 . The vendor or product is a “ name brand . ”
This is a variation on the “ trust the vendor ” criterion .
If you hear a lot about a vendor or product in the press – even if the vendor is using its marketing skills to generate most of that publicity – then you ’re more likely to trust the vendor or product .
For my advice on this , see # 3 .
There ’s a second aspect of name brands that ought to be considered .
Vendors and products which are recognized as leaders often have a larger availability of skilled talent in the use of the product , and there ’s likely to be more third - party training available .
My advice : think about how you will install , customize , support and train for the product if you buy it .
If external resources are in short supply , what alternatives do you have ?
Factor their price ( including any travel required to bring in support or training from outside your city ) into your total cost decision .
5 . Recent publicity for the product
This makes the name brand even more apparent .
In fact , recent publicity for a product is often the impetus for looking at a product in the first place .
Very often your CEO , COO , or other executive will hear about the tremendous advantage that a certain product is providing to another company , and will request the product for your own business .
My advice :
The recent publicity tends to make the publicized product the front runner in an evaluation , but try to be objective .
Look at the other criteria and decide whether the publicity is justified .
Sometimes a less publicized product will be a better fit for your business .
6 . You like the salesperson , or – perhaps worse from an objective evaluation viewpoint – your boss likes the salesperson .
This is once again a variation of the trust / name - brand / publicity criteria .
It ’s not really a good reason to buy a product , but it can end up being a reason why you do n’t buy a competing product .
See # 3 and # 2 .
7 . The cost of the product .
There are three variations of this criterion .
Some people like to go with the least expensive product , feeling that they ’re getting a bargain .
Others like to go with the most expensive product , feeling that they ’re paying extra for the best .
And still others like to go with a product that is neither the most expensive nor the least expensive , like the idea of throwing out the highest and lowest score in judging certain Olympic events .
My advice :
Do n’t look at price ; look at total cost and return instead .
The total cost of a product is the price of the product plus all of the installation , customization , migration , training , adaptation , maintenance and support you ’ll have to do or pay for .
That is often quite different from the simple price .
For example , a product that is less expensive might not have a key capability that your business needs , and you ’ll have to pay for obtaining or developing a custom version of that capability .
Make sure the work on that capability is factored into your total cost .
Similarly , look at the return to your business from buying and installing the product as a ratio to the total cost .
Business people understand this as Return on Investment ( ROI ) , but be careful to calculate ROI based on real expectations of costs and benefits .
See Chapter 5 in my book to get a good feel for how to calculate a valid ROI .
8 . The product fits your current or future architecture
Is n’t it sad that this criterion – possibly one of the most important criteria for determining the long - term impact of the product on your IT organization and budget – is relegated to number 8 ?
In my book , Boiling the IT Frog , I say that , “ The fewer [ IT ] products you have , the better off you ’ll be , as long as you ’ve chosen good products . ”
One of the primary contributors to excessive IT cost is the maintenance and support of a hodgepodge of divergent architectures and platforms due to a bunch of product decisions that have been made without taking architecture into account .
And picking a product that does n’t fit your current or future architecture will lead to inordinate amounts of time and money spent on integration , interfaces , training , wasted effort , and eventually migration to another product .
My advice : Know your current architecture , and decide how you want to change that architecture for the future ( that ’s part of your IT Strategy , which is an absolute necessity for a good IT organization ) .
Do n’t buy a product that conflicts with your architectural direction unless there ’s an overwhelmingly compelling reason .
To help justify an architecture - based product selection to your boss , estimate the long - term cost of a divergent platform .
Do n’t cave in on this issue – it ’s important .
9 . The reliability , resilience , security and auditability of the product
These are all factors which should be in your requirements ( see # 1 ) but are often omitted .
The business tends to take them for granted and so everyone assumes that all products are equal in this area , but that ’s not the case .
New products ( including even operating systems like Microsoft Vista ) are often released before they ’re mature enough for critical business use .
They may work 99.9 % of the time , but that .1 % failure rate will wreak havoc on a business that requires a reliability of virtually 100 % .
And even if the product works most of the time , how much trouble is it to deal with the occasional failure ?
Can the product be properly supported in a resilient environment that automatically deals with hardware or network failure ?
Will the product increase the likelihood of security breaches or data leaks ?
And how easy is it to investigate transactions which appear to be invalid , inappropriate , or even illegal ?
My advice : Include minimum standards for these factors in your requirements , and insist on hard evidence from the vendors that your standards will be met .
And do n’t just do this for new products – some products never mature .
10 . Ease of Use
Here ’s another factor that is often ignored in product evaluations .
Our focus on requirements checklists ( see # 1 ) often neglects the way in which a particular requirement is met , even though the usability of the product will be critical in the long run .
The problem with considering ease of use in product selection is that there are just too many different product capabilities in large products , and it ’s impossible to investigate ease of use for every capability in every prospective product .
My advice :
The answer to the overwhelming ease - of - use problem lies in the 80/20 rule , which states that 80 % of the time using the system will be spent in 20 % of the system ’s capabilities .
So look at what the users of the new product will do with the product , possibly by observing how time is spent in the current business process .
Identify the processes and capabilities that will get the most use and attention , and focus on determining the ease of use for those capabilities .
In extreme cases , you might even do benchmarks on two competing products ( for example , measuring the time it takes to enter a batch of new orders using each product ) .
At a minimum , you ’ll assure your product ’s future users that you ’re paying attention to their needs .
And you may prevent a potential disaster by choosing to stay away from a product that has a bad or inefficient user interface .
11 . Flexibility
There are two kinds of flexibility that you ought to look for in any prospective products .
First , you want the flexibility to be able to fit the product into your current environment .
Vendors typically provide two ways to do this :
Parameterization ( this is my term – vendors may call it something else ) .
This allows the adaptation of the software or hardware by changing settings , values or parameters .
No actual change to the product is required , and no software code has to be written .
Customization ( again , this is my term ) .
This will require actual software to be written , possibly as subroutines , extensions , or interfaces .
Or for hardware , it will require add - on devices , fittings or fixtures .
A product which can be adapted to your needs using parameterization is preferable to a product which requires customization .
The fundamental problem with customization is that you ’re adding on to the product beyond the product itself .
Then when the vendor modifies the product in future releases , your customization may no longer work correctly .
In the long run , customization will be a big pain , and maintenance of customization will be a significant expense .
The second kind of flexibility you ought to consider is the flexibility associated with unknown future changes in your company , your business and your requirements .
Businesses have a habit of evolving to meet the needs of their customers and their environment .
This is a good thing , but it plays havoc with processes and systems that have become rigid in a quest for temporary optimization .
The second kind of flexibility – which you may want to call adaptability – is extremely important for any industry .
It protects your product investment against future needs .
My advice : make flexibility and adaptability important criteria , particularly as a tie - breaker between two more - than - adequate alternatives .
Go with the product that supports your current needs through parameterization rather than customization , and that seems to be more adaptable to handle any business changes you might see on the horizon .
12 . Do you really need the product at all ?
Last , we have to wonder whether we ’re asking the right question .
Should the question be , “ Which product do we want ? ” or should the real question be , “ Do we need a product at all ? ”
There ’s a natural tendency among human beings to want to simplify their lives by employing the latest and greatest tools .
This tendency leads business people to want an IT product because – they believe – it will simplify their lives .
But we have to remember Larry Tesler ’s Law of the Conservation of Complexity : “ Every application must have an inherent amount of irreducible complexity .
The only question is who will have to deal with it . ”
To apply the law in a slightly different context , every attempt to simplify the life of business people by adding new IT products will increase the complexity of life for the IT organization .
It will also make the business more vulnerable to systemic errors that can lead to major business outages and vulnerabilities .
My advice :
Try not to buy a product for emotional reasons .
Look at the real total cost of the product ( see # 7 ) and the real total benefit from getting the product .
Make sure that the difference ( benefit minus cost ) exceeds the risk of all of the issues possibly introduced by using such a product .
If the difference does n’t exceed the risk , then stay with what you have – do n’t buy a new product .
Conclusion
Product selection is one of the most important aspects of a CIO ’s job .
This is particularly true for cornerstone products that form the basis of your IT architecture .
The biggest mistake you can make is to turn the product selection process entirely over to the business users of a product .
They know what bothers them about their current process , but they do n’t understand the architectural environment in which the system must operate , they frequently do n’t understand how their business processes fit into the overall corporate picture , and they often get distracted by product bells and whistles that wo n’t matter in the successful day - to - day business use of the product .
Focus on core requirements , work jointly with business users , get a product that fits your architecture , and buy from a stable vendor , and you ’ll be rewarded with happy users and fewer headaches .
Sure , some of the business complexity will be shifted to the IT organization , but that ’s what they ’re paying you for .
These notes , developed over a period of six years , were written for an eighteen lectures course in category theory .
Although heavily based on Mac Lane 's Categories for the Working Mathematician , the course was designed to be self - contained , drawing most of the examples from category theory itself .
The course was intended for post - graduate students in theoretical computer science at the Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science , University of Edinburgh , but was attended by a varied audience .
Most sections are a reasonable account of the material presented during the lectures , but some , most notably the sections on Lawvere theories , topoi and Kan extensions , are little more than a collection of definitions and facts .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Republican Sen . Ted Stevens of Alaska has been " cleared " by the Justice Department 's request to dismiss his federal corruption convictions and drop all charges against him , his lawyer said Wednesday .
Former Sen. Ted Stevens , 85 , of Alaska lost his re-election bid in November .
Prosecutors accused Stevens of failing to disclose hundreds of thousands of dollars of " freebies " from an oilfield services company on Senate ethics forms .
But in December , an unnamed FBI whistle - blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense , and the Justice Department asked a judge to dismiss the charges against Stevens on Wednesday .
" His name is cleared , " Stevens ' lawyer , Brendan Sullivan , told reporters .
" He is innocent of the charges , as if they 'd never been brought . "
Stevens , 85 , lost his bid for a seventh full term in November after his conviction on seven counts of lying on Senate ethics forms .
Sullivan said the Justice Department was forced to request the dismissal because of " extraordinary evidence of government corruption . "
Watch more on the dismissal of the case »
" Not only did the government fail to provide evidence to the defense that the law requires them to provide , but they created false testimony that they gave us and actually presented false testimony in the courtroom , " he said .
And one of Stevens ' longtime friends , Utah Sen .
Orrin Hatch , said Wednesday that Stevens was " screwed by our own Justice Department . "
In a statement issued Wednesday morning , Stevens thanked the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder for requesting that the charges be dropped .
" I always knew that there would be a day when the cloud that surrounded me would be removed , " Stevens said .
" That day has finally come . "
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has set a Tuesday hearing on the Justice Department 's request to dismiss the case .
Sullivan , who is not related to Stevens ' lawyer , excoriated prosecutors during the trial and held the prosecution in contempt at one point .
In December , two months after the guilty verdicts , the FBI whistle - blower accused prosecutors of withholding evidence from the defense and reported that someone with the government had had an inappropriate relationship with Bill Allen , an oil industry executive who was the government 's key witness .
In the motion it filed Wednesday , the Justice Department acknowledged that Stevens was not given access to notes taken by prosecutors during an April 2008 interview with Allen , the former chairman of an oilfield services company at the center of a corruption probe in Alaska .
The notes show that responses by Allen , the prosecution 's star witness , were inconsistent with testimony he gave against Stevens , and that information from the interview could have benefited Stevens at trial , the motion says .
" In light of this conclusion , and in consideration of the totality of the circumstances of this particular case , I have determined that it is in the interest of justice to dismiss the indictment and not proceed with a new trial , " Holder said in a written statement .
Hatch , a senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he called Stevens in Alaska on Wednesday and the former senator sounded " elated , as anyone would . "
" Here 's a guy who gave better than 60 years ' service to the country and was screwed -- screwed by our own Justice Department , " Hatch said .
But he praised Holder for " standing up and fixing this foul situation . "
" I think he 's more than shown integrity and decency in this matter , and it's not an easy thing for him to do that , " Hatch said .
" He has , in looking at it , realized now what people like myself have been saying is 100 percent right . "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , also commented on the Justice Department 's request , saying , " Ted Stevens is 85 years old .
He 's already been punished enough .
I 'm satisfied . "
And in a statement Wednesday , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin said that Stevens " deserves to be very happy today .
What a horrible thing he has endured .
The blatant attempts by adversaries to destroy one 's reputation , career and finances are an abuse of our well - guarded process and violate our God - given rights afforded in the Constitution .
" It is a frightening thing to contemplate what we may be witnessing here -- the undermining of the political process through unscrupulous ploys and professional misconduct .
Senator Stevens ... never gave up hope .
It is unfortunate that , as a result of the questionable proceedings which led to Senator Stevens ' conviction days before the election , Alaskans lost an esteemed statesman on Capitol Hill .
His presence is missed . "
The Justice Department 's Office of Professional Responsibility will review the prosecution team 's conduct in Stevens ' case , Holder said .
Asked whether the prosecutors should be charged themselves , Sullivan told reporters , " That is not my job .
I 'm a defense lawyer . "
During the trial , Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich said Stevens hid " hundreds of thousands of dollars of freebies " he received from Allen 's company , VECO , and from Allen himself .
Many of the allegedly free services were given as part of the renovation of Stevens ' Alaska home , prosecutors said .
CNN 's Terry Frieden , Paul Courson , Ted Barrett and Deb Krajnak contributed to this report .

A state Senate panel late Wednesday evening approved a bill to require law enforcement officials to collect DNA samples from anyone arrested for a felony in Colorado , over strong objections from one lawmaker who said “ Katie ’s Law ” — named after a New Mexico college student whose brutal rape and murder was solved using DNA evidence — does “ permanent damage ” to constitutional protections against unreasonable search and seizure .
“ There are great costs and consequences in not passing this law , ” Jayann Sepich , the mother of the law ’s namesake , told the Senate Judiciary Committee after displaying slides of her slain daughter , Katie Sepich .
Sepich has been traveling the country urging states to pass similar laws since New Mexico adopted it in 2006 .
So far , 16 states now require suspected felons to give DNA samples upon arrest .
Proponents claim having more samples on file in a federal database gives law enforcement officials a better chance of matching DNA evidence found at crime scenes .
They also say the bill will save investigators money , as they ’ll be able to rule out some suspects whose DNA does n’t match evidence , and that innocent convicts are freed from prison when perpetrators are found through DNA matches .
Every state , including Colorado , requires DNA samples from convicted felons – and that ’s the rub , with opponents of the law arguing it ’s contrary to the Fourth Amendment to gather and store genetic material from those who are n’t eventually convicted .
“ This bill flies in the face of the fundamental right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty , ” Cathryn L. Hazouri , executive director of the Colorado American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) , told the committee .
Under Senate Bill 241 , sponsored by Democratic state Sen. John Morse , a former police chief of Fountain , suspects would render a DNA sample — taken by a swab inside the cheek , by force if necessary — at the same time they ’re photographed and fingerprinted .
The bill ’s supporters argued the genetic sample — which is retained by law enforcement officials for further , corroborative testing — works the same as photographs and fingerprints , simply identifying suspects .
But opponents disagree .
“ It is not a fingerprint .
This contains your past , your present , and your future , ” Hazouri testified .
State Sen. Morgan Carroll , an Aurora Democrat , made an impassioned plea to reject the bill without added safeguards — based on a version of Katie ’s Law adopted in Maryland recently — and wound up casting the lone vote against it after several restrictive amendments failed to gain enough support .
“ The only way this works is if we assume they ’re guilty and we have n’t proven it yet , ” Carroll said .
Moments later , acknowledging the bill was likely to pass out of committee , Carroll delivered a scathing assessment of the proposed law .
“ I think we have really done damage — probably permanent damage — to everything we hold dear in the Constitution , ” she said .
Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey estimated prosecutors do n’t even file felony charges against 40 percent of those arrested on felonies in Denver each year — which would mean as many as 24,000 people a year in Colorado would give DNA samples and then have to petition authorities to remove their genetic markers from a federal database , according to estimates from the Colorado Bureau of Investigation .
Two Republican members of the committee , Sens. Kevin Lundberg of Berthoud and Scott Renfroe of Greeley , notably among the chamber ’s most conservative , joined Carroll in questioning the bill ’s requirement that those who are arrested but ultimately not convicted of felonies — either because prosecutors do n’t file felony charges or they ’re found not guilty in court — bear the burden of asking the state to remove their DNA from the database .
In the end , however , both Lundberg and Renfroe voted to approve bill after Morse promised he ’d work on their objections before it comes to a vote of the full Senate .
The bill moves to the Senate Appropriations Committee , where Morse said he would try to come up with a way to pay for its estimated $ 1.7 million cost .
A 53 - year - old businessman decapitated himself after his marriage broke up , an inquest has heard .
The headless body of Thomas Anthony Hopkins was found with the keys in the ignition of his car near his company 's offices in Llanelli , Carmarthenshire .
The inquest at Llanelli was told he had been prescribed a short course of medicine for depression by his GP .
Carmarthenshire coroner William John Owen ruled that Mr Hopkins , of Killay , Swansea , killed himself .
Mr Hopkins 's headless body was found in his Ford Mondeo last month at the industrial park where he ran Red Dragon Security Systems .
Some clothes and paperwork were on the back seat of the car but no note was found in the vehicle , his office or his home , the hearing in Llanelli was told .
Marriage break - up
Mr Hopkins 's marriage had broken up , leading to a divorce .
The inquest heard he had been prescribed a short course of medicine for depression by his GP , but did not complain of the problem when he went back to the doctor .
Mr Hopkins was arrested in February 2008 , but the court was not told why .
In a statement , coroner 's officer Tudor Rees said there were no suspicious circumstances and no one else was involved in the death .
The coroner gave the cause of death as decapitation .
He offered his sympathies to relatives , saying : " This gentleman was probably under some stress at the time of this incident and decided to kill himself in this very unfortunate manner .
" My verdict is that the deceased killed himself . "

If you are wondering why the U.S. housing market is a mess , watch this video about a $ 103,000 mortgage that was used to finance a shack –literally , a shack .
Of course , the mortgage was packaged with a bunch of others into a mortgage backed security , which was rated AAA .
This scenario sums up the mess that was the U.S. housing market pretty nicely .
Wait until you hear what this piece of property recently sold for .
UPDATE 5/6/2009 : I just noticed a post “ Meet Lady Subprime ” by Richard Cohen of the Washington Post from January which referenced this situation .
He said :
The French have the comely Marianne , the British have the fetching Britannia , and we have the welcoming Lady Liberty .
May I now suggest , at least for the duration of the current recession , a new feminine emblem of our times : Marvene Halterman of Avondale , Ariz .
At age 61 , after 13 years of uninterrupted unemployment and at least as many years of living on welfare , she got a mortgage .
She got that mortgage less than two years ago .
She got it even though at one time she had 23 people living in the house ( 576 square feet , one bath ) and some ramshackle outbuildings .
She got it for $ 103,000 , an amount that far exceeded the value of the house .
The place has since been condemned .
This tale , unfortunately as American as apple pie , was recounted recently in the Wall Street Journal .
Since the story ran over a long , holiday weekend , it is possible that you , not to mention the occasional member of Congress or , God forbid , the various government regulatory agencies , missed it .
It is the only possible explanation for why there have been no executions , never mind arrests .
Halterman ’s house was never exactly a showcase — the city has since cited her for all the junk ( clothes , tires , etc. ) on her lawn .
Nonetheless , a local financial institution with the cover - your - wallet name of Integrity Funding LLC gave her a mortgage , valuing the house at about twice what a nearby and comparable property sold for .
According to the Journal , Integrity Funding then sold the loan to Wells Fargo & Co. , which sold it to HSBC Holdings PLC , which then packaged it with thousands of other risky mortgages and offered this indigestible porridge to investors .
Standard & Poor ’s and Moody ’s Investors Service took a look at it all , as they are supposed to do , and pronounced it “ triple - A . ” “ Double - A ” must mean no running water .
At each step of this mortgage process , a moral crime was committed .
Halterman ’s interest rate would have ballooned to 15.25 percent , when in all likelihood 1 percent would have been a reach for her .
( Her welfare and disability payments totaled about $ 3,000 a month . )
After paying off all her debts and the usual fees , Halterman got $ 11,090 at the closing .
After processing her mortgage , Integrity cleared nearly as much : $ 9,243 .
Photosynth takes many snapshots of a place and arranges them into a 3D environment ( Image : Microsoft )
Innovation is our new column that highlights the latest emerging technological ideas and where they could lead
For years , consumers have been sold digital cameras largely on the basis of one number – the megapixels crammed onto its image sensor .
But recently an industry bigwig admitted that squeezing in ever more resolution has become meaningless .
Akira Watanabe , head of Olympus ’ SLR planning department , said that 12 megapixels is plenty for most photography purposes and that his company will henceforth be focusing on improving colour accuracy and low - light performance .
Advertisement
That will surely raise the quality of most home snaps , but his admission suggests something much bigger for the future of photography .
As most of the technological hurdles of capturing still and moving images on consumer - grade cameras have been met , the real frontier of innovation now lies in what happens to images after they have been captured .
New dimensions
Already we are seeing how powerful software tools are making still photos just an intermediate on the way to something more interactive .
One example , Microsoft ’s Photosynth , which organises collections of photos of the same scene as a 3D space .
It ’s an approach that can be more easily understood by watching video of it in action .
The latest project on Photosynth meshes photos into an almost seamless 3D environment in which you can even walk inside buildings ( see video ) .
The way Google Street View presents realistic views of the world using linked still images is another example of the potential of this kind of technology .
Gigapixel gains
A recently released robotic tripod called Gigapan that makes it much simpler to stitch together incredibly large , detailed images from hundreds or thousands of individual shots , puts new powers in amateur hands .
The technology is also helping scientists to record vulnerable environments , or create super - accurate photographic archives .
Another technique , dubbed super resolution , combines multiple photos to reveal detail not visible in any of the originals .
One - click methods to make a face in a photo more attractive , or turn 2D photos into realistic 3D models are also now possible .
Special effects
And it ’s not just stills photography that is benefitting from advances in tech .
Sites like YouTube have got us used to the idea that anyone can edit and share a rough and ready video , but the tricks of Hollywood studios are also being democratised .
Researchers from the Weizmann Institute of Science , Israel , have made a package that lets you edit the surface of objects in a movie just once and have the changes persist throughout the footage – with more traditional techniques , every frame would have to be edited .
Software firm Adobe is working on a similar package that also makes it possible to move objects inside a movie with just a few clicks .
Smart software can make previously unthinkable post - production techniques available to anyone .
So , in the future , our cameras will no longer merely provide snapshots and footage to be viewed in the traditional ways – increasingly , their output will be aimed at feeding software and online tools that roll them into novel ways to experience photography .
The basics of capturing images will still undergo gradual evolution , but for a technological revolution we should look to the software that works on a camera ’s output .

Would it not be easier to believe that there are a number of crucial factors that need are needed for the formation of life and as a result of a certain combination this has resulted in our own existence , but it could be that other combinations are possible , which might not lead to life that is incomprehensible to us , rather than an exact sequence of unique events and factors , the chances of which are extremely remote in occuring , to have produced life as we know it by random chance ?

It astounds me that the anthropic principle is used in physics .
One problem I perceive is distinguishing it from the lottery fallacy .
I would like a justification for the idea that the universe is amenable to life at all , much less the “ VERY LIFE FRIENDLY ” claims frequently made .
For example , contrast the cosmology of the Old Testament , which I argue presents a much greater life - friendly universe : a flat , densely inhabited earth with crystal firmament separating “ the waters above from the waters below ” , and surrounded by heaven .
This universe appears vastly better - designed for humans , animals , plants , and their postulated Creator .
In contrast : our universe .
Is there a negative exponent low enough to indicate how little volume life occupies ?
The proposal that the more rare a phenomena is constitutes evidence of very favorable conditions suggests a significant observer centric bias beyond the dreams of Bronze Age prophets , does it not ?
Are massive concentrations of radioactively fusing matter ( stars ) objectively special or meaningful ?
Would we not assess favorable conditions for something like replicating life by detectiong abundance rather than scarcity ?

Why should the existence of a multiverse disprove there being a God ?
If God does exist as an omniscient , omnipotent being then why not make several universes ?
Who are we to say what an all - powerful being would or would n't do ?
Personally if I 'd been the creator of mankind I 'd have been tempted to have another try at a model that was a little more farsighted and less violent ... so maybe another universe would have also looked like a good idea .
It seems to me that at present the existence of God can neither be proved nor disproved by anybody - obviously , hence the ongoing existence of several different equally convinced faiths side by side with atheism !

report post as inappropriate I guess I consider myself a reluctant atheist , who wishes he was a deist .
However interesting these arguments rarely go anywhere , but being the devils advocate as I usually am I would like to postulate some arguments for discussion .
One being the argument from a " reverse anthropic principle "
Things only appear to be finely tuned from our perspective because we are already here to observe them and it is outside of our abilities to ( truely ) understand the universes being another way ( not that we fully understand it in the first place . )
However we do still live in a universe which is cold and inhospitable and yet we are still here .
From the stance from the multiverse theory , though there is a good possibility I am bastardizing my understanding of it .
But I always took the " infinte worlds " notion to mean that any and all concepts exist in some form in another dimension , this would also extend to the concept of god .
And being omnipotent and omniscent s( he ) would transcend the boundaries of all universes .
Lastly I was wondering if anyone has ever pondered that a cosmological event such as the big bang could create an entity such as " god . "
I guess that 's it , thanks for your time !

Even if every single one of the constants , such as the strength of gravity , electromagnetism , the strong force , the weak force , and the cosmological constant could be explained by the theory of everything , it still does not explain the quantities such as the ratio of matter to antimatter , the expansion rate of the universe , and the low entropy .

With the AdS ~ CFT dualism or equivalency there is an interesting prospect .
The endpoint in this flow provides additional data .
This data is then isomorphic to additional spatial data on AdS spacetime to determine its conformal infinity .
This conformal infinity I^{oo}is a Minkowski spacetime M^{3,1} of four dimensions , which requires more data than pure spatial data in three dimensions .
So the universe is " fine tuned " because the cosmology is a path integral , where the " end point , " equivalent to the AdS I^{oo} , is a determinant in the entire set wave functional .
I think the unvierse is fine tuned because it could not be any other way .
No magical creator or other universes needed , and no anthropic principle either .
The amplitudes for other cosmologies are then attentuated out in a grand decoherence process , a sort of cosmic einselection process .
These other universes are then reduced to near infiniitesimal amplitudes and the einselected cosmos becomes classical ( like ) .

report post as inappropriate I am up to my keester in an argument with somebody over this .
A different " tuning " to the universe would mean that the renormalization group flow of the universe is different .
At high energy this is not too hard to understand in principle , for the field theory is conformal .
The difficulty is understanding the trajectory of that flow and how it ends .
Once the electroweak breaking sets in ( Higgs mechanism etc ) the conformal structure is broken and such theory breaks down .

Mathematics gives rise to life and intelligence .
That is Fortunate .
We can display mathematics on a piece of paper .
So the essence of life is on paper and prudently protected under glass for display to the public ?
I always thought that mathematics was just a tool for the mechanical interpretation of the universe .
So the Higgs particle has been found ?
So someone has isolated a part of space and used it in their experiments ?
So time has been captured and encapsulated and mixed with that part of space , and , there is now on display a piece of space - time ?
So the fine tuning of the universe had to be that way because it is that way .
And , the " amplitude 's of other cosmologies " are where ?
Are they on another piece of paper as insignificant magnitudes that can be disregarded with no need to be proven ?
One thing though , with regard to magic :
What is electric charge ?

The Graviton ’s energy - mass dualism derives from its gravity , self - attraction , and its compactness .
Gravity : the propensity of the gravitons – the elementary particles of the mass of the universe - to return to their singularity state of zero motion , of compacted zero inter- particle distance .
Compactness : the default particle ’s size and shape that enable zero inter-particle distance at singularity .
This , commonsensically , is the matrix of the universe .

A. The Universe
From the Big - Bang it is a rationally commonsensical conjecture that the gravitons , the smallest base primal particles of the universe , must be both mass and energy , i.e. inert mass yet in motion even at the briefest fraction of a second of the pre Big Bang singularity .
This is rationally commonsensical since otherwise the Big would not have Banged , the superposition of mass and energy would not have been resolved .
The universe originates , derives and evolves from this energy - mass dualism which is possible and probable due to the small size of the gravitons .
Since gravitation
Is the propensity of energy reconversion to mass and energy is mass in motion , gravity is the force exerted between mass formats .
All the matter of the universe is a progeny of the gravitons evolutions , of the natural selection of mass , i.e. of some of the mass formats attaining temporary augmented energy constraint in their successive generations , with energy drained from other mass formats , to temporarily postpone , survive , the reversion of their own constitutional mass to the pool of cosmic energy fueling the galactic clusters expansion set in motion by the Big Bang .
B. Earth Life
Earth Life is just another mass format .
A self - replicating mass format .
Self - replication is its mode of evolution , natural selection .
Its smallest base primal units are the RNAs genes .
The genesis of RNAs genes , life ’s primal organisms , is rationally commonsensical thus highly probable , the “ naturally - selected ” RNA nucleotides .
Life began / evolved on Earth with the natural selection of inanimate RNA , then of some RNA nucleotides , then arriving at the ultimate mode of natural selection , self - replication .
C. Know Thyself .
Life Is Simpler Than We Are Told , Including Origin - Nature Of Brain - Consciousness -“ Spirituality ” ***
The origin - reason and the purpose - fate of life are mechanistic , ethically and practically valueless .

The Graviton ’s energy - mass dualism derives from its gravity , self - attraction , and its compactness .
Gravity : the propensity of the gravitons – the elementary particles of the mass of the universe - to return to their singularity state of zero motion , of compacted zero inter- particle distance .
Compactness : the default particle ’s size and shape that enable zero inter-particle distance at singularity .
This , commonsensically , is the matrix of the universe .

The UniverseFrom the Big - Bang it is a rationally commonsensical conjecture that the gravitons , the smallest base primal particles of the universe , must be both mass and energy , i.e. inert mass yet in motion even at the briefest fraction of a second of the pre Big Bang singularity .
This is rationally commonsensical since otherwise the Big would not have Banged , the superposition of mass and energy would not have been resolved .
The universe originates , derives and evolves from this energy - mass dualism which is possible and probable due to the small size of the gravitons .
Since gravitation
Is the propensity of energy reconversion to mass and energy is mass in motion , gravity is the force exerted between mass formats .
All the matter of the universe is a progeny of the gravitons evolutions , of the natural selection of mass , i.e. of some of the mass formats attaining temporary augmented energy constraint in their successive generations , with energy drained from other mass formats , to temporarily postpone , survive , the reversion of their own constitutional mass to the pool of cosmic energy fueling the galactic clusters expansion set in motion by the Big Bang .

It was a child of the Sixties , shaped by the baby boom and now staring down its 50th birthday – no wonder York University seems such a hotbed of activists .
As the sprawling campus sits suspended by labour turmoil for the third time in a dozen years , the growing buzz among students and parents is :
Why is York so wild ?
" It was a brand new university in the 1960s that was hiring like crazy – we even had enough for a professors ' soccer team – and this big wave of young , socially concerned newcomers had a greater impact than they would have at a university with more older , established faculty , " says historian Michiel Horn , who has just published a history of the university .
" York soon got the image of a bunch of lefties – even I 'm not sure it 's always justified . "
It seems to ring true these days .
A strike by 3,340 teaching assistants , contract faculty and graduate assistants has shut down classes since Nov. 6 , throwing 50,000 undergraduates into often heartbreaking personal anguish , which may continue for another week until the provincial government holds a vote for union members to approve or reject York 's latest offer .
The university asked for this one - time - only " supervised vote " Friday , after the Canadian Union of Public Employees 3903 refused to put the three - year offer of increased wages and benefits to its members , saying it was a step back , especially with regard to job security .
But it 's merely the latest example of activism in an era known more for Facebook than facing off against authority .
Over the past 12 years ,
York alone among Ontario universities has had its school year lengthened by strikes twice , and this latest stoppage almost surely will do it again .
York grabbed headlines around the world four years ago for expelling a student for protesting with a bullhorn .
That student became the first in Canada to sue his university president for defamation .
A York professor took his bosses to the Ontario Human Rights Commission in a complaint over cancelling classes on Jewish holidays .
Social criticism seems fixed in its bedrock .
" As president , I used to go out fundraising and CEOs would ask me , `How are you getting on with all those pinkos ? ' " recalls economist H. Ian Macdonald , who served as president from 1974 to 1984 .
" Remember , York began with a focus on the arts and social science and humanities – disciplines whose business is social criticism – and that 's exactly what a university is supposed to be concerned with . "
He cites with pride how York kept contact with Soviet scholars during the Cold War , despite taking heat from other academics .
But Harry Arthurs , who took over from Macdonald in 1985 , believes York 's strong union tradition was born of something else – a tough new provincial funding formula introduced during the 1970s recession that penalized university growth just as York was starting to boom .
" York was at the epicentre of university growth in Ontario , if not Canada – yet the economy was in trouble and we were shortchanged by a new funding formula that not only hit salaries , but meant we could n't even buy books for the library or fix the air circulation , " recounts Arthurs , a specialist in labour law .
" We could n't do a damn thing ; it was awful – we were working in substandard conditions back then and that 's why unionism grew .
" A lot of York 's feistiness was attributable to the dire circumstances people faced ; they were angry and rightly so – and you can't erase the legacy of these problems .

" A whole generation of groups can remain bitter . "
To Horn , York 's official historian , being a young university on a hiring spree during the 1960s led to more open employment practices than normal for the ivory tower , and hiring a more diverse faculty may have helped shape York 's upstart campus culture .
" To get the top people in the 1960s necessitated looking beyond the usual candidates , and there was n't the same prejudice against women and Jews at York as there were at many other established universities , " recalls Horn , an expert in academic freedom in Canada .
" Universities were lily - white institutions for a long time – women were tolerated and it was okay to be Jewish if you were n't observant , but that was n't the case at York ; they hired more Jewish faculty .
Perhaps , who knows , among Jews of a certain age and their parents , there is a greater awareness of social justice . "
But in some ways , Horn says
York 's activism is partly an optical illusion ; it just seems radical when compared to its more staid colleague downtown .
To this day , University of Toronto professors have not unionized , and at Ryerson University , the professors ' union has agreed not to strike , but to turn disputes over to binding arbitration .
To philosophy professor Joe Gonda , York 's personality can be traced back to the spirit of the times .
" York began in the Sixties , and when you say the Sixties , what do you think of ?
Sex , drugs , rock and roll – and activism . "
Those traits are in York 's DNA , says the philosopher .
" It 's how it was born , just as people are born blond or six feet tall . "
These Sixties activists may have founded a school that can seem " chaotic " to outsiders , says Gonda , but inside , all this turmoil makes for lively dialogue , or what he says economist Joseph Schumpeter called " creative destruction . "
" We 're not the ' Old Boys ' Network ' at York ; we 're more like a cranky , fractious family . "
" Woz " joins entertainment and sport figures as a hopeful on the show
Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak will be among the 13 competitors on the new season of Dancing with the Stars , US television network ABC has announced .
The Strictly Come Dancing spinoff will feature a range of entertainment and sport figures and former competitors from the show .
The roster includes singers Jewel and Belinda Carlisle , rapper Lil ' Kim , and 17 - year - old Olympic gold medal - winning gymnast Shawn Johnson .
The new season will start on 9 March .
Among the other competitors will be star of MTV's Jackass Steve - O and former Bond girl Denise Richards .
The list also includes couples ; Jewel will be joined by her rodeo champion husband Ty Murray .
Two - time champion of the show Julianne Hough will feature alongside her beau , country music singer Chuck Wicks .
Wozniak made his name as the designer of the electronics inside the first Apple computer , joining up with Steve Jobs to form the company in 1976 .
He ceased full - time employment at the company in 1987 but is still on the payroll .
Marijuana , a commonly abused drug among high school and college students is linked to a severe form of vomiting syndrome and compulsive bathing behavior .
This form of severe vomiting sickness is increasingly recognized with widespread abuse of marijuana .
The syndrome usually subsides with strict abstinence from marijuana abuse .
This obscure clinical manifestation of severe vomiting sickness due to chronic abuse of marijuana , recognized by Dr. Sontineni and his colleagues at the Creighton University of Omaha , NE , was published on March 14 , 2009 World Journal of Gastroenterology .
Recent research into the neurobiology of cannabis has led to the identification of different receptor types including two specific types that mediate neuropsychiatric and immunologic effects .
According to Dr. Sontineni , doctors and health care workers currently under recognize the syndrome leading to delayed diagnosis and expensive diagnostic investigations .
Increasing consistent use of marijuana among United States populations , particularly young people , over several years will see a steady rise in the number of cases diagnosed each year .
The syndrome was first recognized in Australia around the Adelaide hills .
The exact mechanism leading to generation of these symptoms , why it appears only after several years of marijuana abuse and why compulsive hot showering behavior relieves the symptoms is still under scientific investigation .
The recognition of this novel syndrome and increasing physician awareness is supported by the Department of Medicine at Creighton University Medical Center .
Similarly , scientists and doctors at other institutions worldwide are beginning to identify more cases with this new syndrome as a result of chronic marijuana abuse among populations .

Compiler technology is one of my hobbies , most recently satisfied with my project to write a series of post of how to write a ( Ruby ) compiler in Ruby .
Since I really like Ruby , it 's natural that I 've done a fair amount of thinking about compiling Ruby , and what the problems with that are , and I decided it was time I wrote some of them down along with some thoughts on how they can be solved -- ideally without changing Ruby .
Even more so since I decided I DO want to take the leap towards making my compiler project focus on actually compiling Ruby , and not just something somewhat like Ruby .
All of the issues here affect a traditional " ahead of time " compiler - one that takes source in and spits out a binary , but many also affects JIT's .
I 'll start with the problems , in no particular order :
Problem # 1 : No delineation of compile time and runtime
Problem # 2 : A very costly method dispatch
A Ruby method call involves first identifying the class of an object .
This either requires following the " class " pointer of an object , OR a " decoding scheme " ( as used in MRI ) to allow small objects like Fixnum , True , False , Symbol and Nil to be encoded without a pointer .
Then we must follow the " super " chain from class to class , potentially all the way to Object , to determine which class can satisfy the method call .
Then if that fails , it needs to do the same for #method_missing .
Because the type of the object stored in any variable is unknown , a compiler can not assume anything about the type of an object based on where it is stored .
Unlike , say , C++ , where the compiler will happily assume that a Foo * will hold a pointer to an object of class
Foo or a subclass , and treat it accordingly , a Ruby compiler could not .
This also largely affect inlining of methods as a viable optimization .
.. and anyway , since Ruby classes are open , users can add , alias and remove methods at will ( with some minor restrictions ) , so a Ruby compiler largely can't assume a method stays the same through the lifetime of the object .
... even worse , thanks to meta - classes in Ruby , there may conceptually be a new " almost " superclass inserted for an object .
Problem # 3 : Meta-programming
Problem # 4 : No statically defined set of instance variables
Problem # 5 : Method visibility , default arguments and method arity
, honest ! " ( or used # __send__ etc. to bypass the check ) , but handling that without imposing overhead on calls that do n't need it is non-trivial as well .
Default arguments , and more generally method arity , suffers from the same problem .
In C++ the caller can take responsibility for initializing default arguments when not providing values for all of the arguments .
In Ruby , the compiler wo n't know when you are calling a method that has default arguments vs. one that just have fewer arguments ( for that matter , you do n't know for sure if the number of arguments is right at all ) , and so this has to be handled by the callee .
That means the callee needs to get an argument count , or have another method of determining how many arguments were passed .
That 's not to bad .
But the callee then also have to contain the logic to initialize missing arguments .
That 's messier as it means either manipulating the stack frame , handling multiple ways of accessing an argument , making the arguments a " real " Ruby array and push the default arguments onto it , or otherwise moving arguments around to get them in a consistent location .
There are simple ways of doing this ( shove it all into a " real " Ruby Array object for example and convert the default argument initializers into the equivalent of | |= calls ) , and there are faster ways ( keep things on the stack as much as possible , possible mess with the stack frame , and only convert to a Ruby Array object for methods where it 's actually treated as one ) .
Solutions
Below are some of my thoughts on how to address the bigger ones of these problems .
Solution # 1 : Speeding up method dispatch with a multilevel approach to dispatch In " Protocol Extension : A Technique for Structuring Large Extensible Software Systems " ( 1994 ; original Postscript file ; PDF from Citeseer X ) , Michael Franz , presents a method for " protocol extension " in Oberon - a way of relatively effectively adding methods at runtime .
The basic idea is that method changes ( addition , overriding or removal ) are rare , and method dispatch is frequent , so it makes sense to do more work when modifying the methods than it does when calling them .
Franz suggested that the " vtable " for each subclass is made to contain pointers to all the methods for the entire hierarchy .
A method that is overridden in a subclass has its method pointer overwritten in that subclass and all descendants of that subclass that has not overridden it themselves .
The problem he noted is that in a big class hierarchy the vtables for each class may grow prohibitively large , while remaining mostly unchanged .
This can be counteracted in a number of ways - one of them being splitting the vtable into chunks for " interfaces " , and making each vtable a set of pointers to vtables for interfaces .
Another way is this :
The compiler ( or compiler - writer ) can make educated guesses about which methods are most likely to exist in all classes , and which methods are less likely to get called :
Methods in classes high up in the hierarchy are more likely to remain present .
In Ruby , methods on Object will exist in almost all classes ( the only exception will be cases where the methods have been explicitly removed or aliased away ) .
Methods that are referenced in inner loops may be more important to make fast to call than others .
Analysis of number of call - sites can also give an indication of how frequent a method will be called .
Methods that are present in more than a certain threshold of classes , or that are judged to be particularly performance sensitive can be allocated an offset in a per-class vtable .
Methods that are slightly less likely can be grouped into " interfaces " , and require a one level indirection .
As a last resort the implementation can be forced to fall back on a #send call that does lookups the way MRI does now .
But see solution # 2
Solution # 2 : Polymorphic Inline Caches Otherwise expensive method lookups can be cached .
This caching can even be done " inline " in he code path by dynamically inlining the code for the classes that are seen at a call site in practice .
Polymorphic inline caches were introduced in Optimizing Dynamically - Typed Object - Oriented Programming Languages with Polymorphic Inline Caches by Urs Hlzle , Craig Chambers , and David Ungar .
This does not remove the problem of potentially expensive lookups , but it drastically reduces the impact in cases where the type used is relatively stable ( which in practice is the common case - the same variable is rarely assigned more than a handful different types ) .
The key to PIC for languages like Ruby is that you still need to check the type , and you either need to invalidate the old type when a class is modified , or you need to invalidate the caches .
Maintaining that logic can be complicated ( compare to the approach in solution # 1 , where all that is required is updating the vtables ) .
PIC 's can be combined with the approach above : Solution # 1 provides cheap lookups , but # 2 can still allow inlining of whole methods where appropriate , in a way that is safe .
Solution # 3 : Trace Trees Dr. Michael Franz and Andreas Gal have been working on a technique called Trace Trees .
Possibly the best introduction is in a blog post by Andreas Gal , but the papers are also fairly accessible .
Trace trees is the " hot new thing " - you 'll find it used in the new JS JIT for Mozilla for example ( " Tracemonkey " ) .
The short description is that trace trees consists of tracking the execution of bits of an application - typically in a bytecode interpreter , and when a certain part is executed often enough , you " trace " the code execution and create a " tree " of code fragments .
You use this to identify loops or frequently executed code paths that are optimized ( in the bytecode interpreter case , this would involve JIT compilation ) , and protected by a " guard " that verify whether to keep executing the new native generated code path .
While the approach is intended for a bytecode interpreter , it has scope for being used to handle dynamic runtime optimization and inlining of specific code paths generated by an " ahead of time " compiler as well .
The compiler can generate the best code it can , but inject timing and tracing code where appropriate to allow it to use information gathered at runtime to inline specific method calls into inner loops etc. .
An in - between alternative is to let the AOT compiler use profiling data gathered from past runs to built trees on subsequent compiles ( this approach is also suggested in the papers on polymorphic inline caches ) Solution # 4 : Dynamic object packing ( for instance variables )
We 've already explored the building blocks for handling the troublesome issue of dynamic instance variables above .
There are two parts to that problem : Quick access , which is hindered by having to resort to schemes that requires expensive instance variable lookups , and space which is hindered by a potentially dynamically changing set of instance variables .
First of all it is possible to apply a similar analysis to that suggested for vtables :
Identify the most likely set of instance variables for objects of a class .
Assign specific offsets for those instance variables , and compile code using static offsets for code internal to the class .
For instance variables that are not guaranteed to be ever used , there 's a value judgement :
If information is available to determine a rough likelihood you can use a cutoff to decide which to always include in the object .
This has the potential for huge space overhead if the guess is wrong .
The alternative is to fall back on a hash table referenced from the object to handle additional instance variables .
This is costly in space and time if the number of objects with extra instance variables is high .
However the latter method can be combined with the earlier solutions to reduce the time overhead .
To reduce space usage further , we can dynamically pack the object :
We can potentially cooperate with the garbage collector to identify pointers to an object , and then reallocate the object elsewhere and change the layout , and then use tracing similar to the one mentioned above to created optimized code paths that rely on the new static layout .
If we do n't want to move all objects , we can handle this by inserting " proxy classes " and making specific subsets of these objects instances of specific proxy classes .
In fact , Ruby already sort - of does this by inserting proxies for Module 's that are " hidden " for normal Ruby code when walking the inheritance chain .
This is a fairly complex solution , but one that can potentially allow very tight packing of objects , and avoiding a significant percentage of hash table lookups for instance variables .
Combined with trace trees and PIC's , a significant part of the code overhead for method accessors used from outside the class can also be removed .
Many scripting languages fall in this category , but Ruby does it one better , by making the class definitions executable .
Where a compiler for a language like C++ can do a lot of work to analyze and optimize code at compile time , and can build most structures related to classes at compile time , in Ruby it may in some cases be hard to avoid executing code at runtime to determine what the class will look like .
A potential Ruby compiler also needs to solve the issue of what files are compiled once at compile time and linked into the application , and what files are evaluated ( and possibly JIT compiled ) at runtime .
This is a possibly tricky tradeoff - reloading code has become a common solution for Ruby web applications to avoid shutdown and restarts , for example , but there are no formal hints in Ruby code that tells the application what may or may not be attempted reloaded later .
Reloading in Ruby tends to depend on the ability of the Ruby object model to replace classes and methods , so the most natural solution for handling reloading may simply be to compile the classes in statically but retain this ability .
That still does n't solve the first part of the problem , though :
If my app starts with " require ' foo ' " , do I expect " foo " to be loaded when compiling or each time ?
You probably would n't be surprised if the compiler loaded it once .
But what if it starts with code that reads the contents of a directory , and require 's each file in turn ?
That one is trickier - some scripts may use that method as a crude " plugin " mechanism , for example .
My compiler project has reached the point where dealing with something supposedly simple like " require " is now actually a stumbling block .
Even something " simple " like Mspec from Rubyspec actually depends on Ruby code being executed to determine what files to require , and I have to decide whether to for now use " hacks " to get around it ( Mspec and a lot of other Ruby code use a small set of common idiomatic ways of modifying the load path for the code being required - a tiny interpreter subset could take care of the basic cases ) or do it " properly " ( compiling to shared objects and use dynamic loading at runtime , but this kills a lot of optimizations ; or JIT compilation of files that get required this way ; or even JIT compilation as a means of executing the code to determine the files to require and then requiring them statically ) .
Or I could just skip the problem for now , and just handle the specific case where files are required using a static string and / or add a hack that will use a substitution table or regexp to rewrite the require 's ( eww ... )
Anyway , the point is that this is a big hurdle for anyone hoping to write an ahead of time compiler for Ruby without resorting to JIT compiling most of the program anyway .
Part of the appeal of ahead of time compilation is to avoid JIT compilation ( and avoid lugging around a ton of source files ) , so while supporting JIT compilation for pathological cases is good and / or necessary depending on how you look at it , for an ahead of time compiler to make sense you want to make that a " last resort " if there is no sensible alternative .
Let me count the number of ways Ruby makes method dispatch expensive in aimplementation ( see also my post on the Ruby Object Model as implemented in MRI ) Luckily , there are a number of solutions that can vastly improve on the naive implementation of Ruby method dispatch .
Unfortunately most ( though not all ) of them make the compiler and runtime more complex .
It 's alluded to above .
Ruby allows extensive modification of classes and even objects at runtime .
Defining new methods , inserting new modules or otherwise messing with the structure makes static analysis to optimize other problematic aspects of compiling Ruby very hard .
Take even something simple like integer arithmetic .
Never mind that Ruby automatically handles overflow and turns Fixnum 's into Bignum 's , which means that even if you do try to make it cheaper than a method call , you first have to check whether you deal with a Fixnum ( which is not an ordinary object ) or a Bignum ( which is an ordinary object ) , but if both values ARE Fixnum 's you still face the uncertainty of whether or not a method of Fixnum has been replaced by unscrupulous monkey patchers ...
In a language like C++ , object size is kept down because the compiler knows at compile time what instance variables exist for any given object .
As a result , it can pack them tightly together .
In Ruby , theoretically an object can have new instance variables show up at any time , through mechanisms such as #instance_variable_set , #instance_eval etc..
MRI solved this by making the instance variables stored in a hash table , which is incredibly wasteful for otherwise small objects .
Ruby 1.9 has reduced this impact somewhat by storing up to 3 instance variables in the object itself ( see the Ruby1.9 section ) , and then falling back to an external structure .
Luckily , in practiceobjects will have a small and mostly statically determinable instance variable set , and some of the same methods that can speed up method dispatch can be used to handle this more effectively as well .
In C++ for example , you can easily know at compile time if a method is private or protected .
In Ruby , since you do n't know the class of the object you will be passed , you can't know that until runtime .
This means this needs to be checked at runtime as well .
We could imagine checking this only in private or protected methods , since use of them is relatively rare in Ruby code , but that 's not easy either : Private methods in Ruby require self as an explicit receiver , which means they are only allowed to be called from within a method , and on the same object as the method is operating on .
Slight little problem ...
How will the executed method know that this is the case ?
And then there 's the ways of bypassing the check .
An alternative for handling this is to pass along a flag saying " I promise I was called with self .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The online world has gone totally multimedia : Web video and images have proliferated in recent years .
Yet the go - to method for finding stuff on the Internet remains text - based .
Looking for a site ?
Type words into a search bar , and the text results offer a hint of the relevant pages .
Even if you 're looking for images or video , the results are notated with words .
But a few companies are looking for ways to spruce up search by making it more visually driven .
Not only do the results look better than what we 're accustomed to , they might just save you time as you 're searching .
Consider Cooliris , a browser plug - in that takes groups of images and videos and presents them on a slick interactive wall .
Instead of clicking through endless pages of results to find the image you want , Cooliris lets you fly through hundreds of pictures at once and then zoom in and out on the ones that interest you .
It works for image searches on Google ( GOOG , Fortune 500 ) , AOL , Yahoo ( YHOO , Fortune 500 ) , and others and it's also helpful for sharing photos on sites like Flickr and Facebook .
The plug - in is still in beta , but Cooliris says it 's already attracted more than 10 million users with 50,000 downloads a day .
Plus , earlier this month , Cooliris received $ 15.5 million of funding from Kleiner Perkins , DAG Ventures , the Westly Group and T - Mobile 's T - Ventures .
The company 's first round of funding , $ 3 million two years ago , also came from Kleiner .
Another site that 's putting visuals front and center in Web browsing is Searchme .
The big difference between Cooliris and Searchme is that the latter is actually developing its own search algorithm .
By contrast , Cooliris is layering its interface onto other search tools .
Searchme has the same business model as a standard search engine - it sells ads against key words - but the search results and ads come up as snapshots of the relevant sites .
So if you look up news stories on Oracle 's purchase of Sun Microsystems , you 'll actually see the articles lined up next to each other so you can read them immediately without having to click through .
The idea is this saves you the trouble of having to toggle back and forth between the search results page and the content behind the links .
Over the last few years , Searchme has received funding from Sequoia , DAG Ventures and Lehman Brothers .
But if Google has about 70 % of the search market , how does a company like Searchme fit in ?
" I like the fact that Google is a monopoly , " says Randy Adams , CEO and founder of Searchme .
" It means I 'm free to turn on a dime and do things that are disruptive to the marketplace . "
Google responded by pointing to a few recent tools the company has added to improve searches .
For instance , there 's a new feature on image searches called " similar images , " where you can click on a link below an image search result to find pictures along the same lines .
Late last year Google introduced Search Wiki , which lets users re-rank and comment on search results .
The company 's also experimenting with alternative views for search results - for instance , putting them on a timeline or a map .
Said a spokesperson : " We 're constantly innovating new ways for users to experience search and search results . "
The only question is whether users are ready to change the way they navigate for information online .
" It kind of requires us to decide that the new way not only has advantages but can be grasped quickly enough that the disadvantage inherent in the learning curve does n't make it too costly to switch , " says Susan Aldrich , senior VP at the Patricia Seybold Group , a technology consulting and research firm .
" So if I 'm going to be really inefficient for two weeks , then , hmm , it 's gotta be really wonderful . "
The executives at Cooliris think that so long as the amount of visual content online continues to expand ( about 850 million new photos are added on Facebook every month ) , people will need quicker ways to scan the images .
Still , it could take some time to convince enough people to make a switch .
" Our studies say it takes two months to get someone to use this on a regular basis , " says Adams , who says it 's hard to re-condition people who have spent years and years thinking text is the best way to search .
" But once you get them over and they 're able to do this kind of search , we have these zealots .
Once we have them , we do n't lose them . "

Winter brought unfamiliarly cold weather to large swathes of Europe
The world in 2008 has been cooler than at any time since the turn of the century , scientists say .
Cooling La Nina conditions in the Pacific brought temperatures down to levels last seen in the year 2000 .
The World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) notes that temperatures remained about 0.3C above the 1961 -1990 average .
Computer models suggest that natural cycles may cool the Earth 's surface in the next few years , masking the warming impact of rising greenhouse gas levels .
Human influence , particularly emission of greenhouse gases , has greatly increased the chance of having such warm years
Peter Stott , UK Met Office
El Nino / La Nina explained
One recent analysis suggested there may be no warming for about the next decade , though other scientists dispute the conclusion .
What is beyond dispute is that 2008 saw temperatures a shade below preceding years .
Using data from two major monitoring networks , one co-ordinated by the UK's Hadley Centre and University of East Anglia ( UEA ) and the other by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) , the WMO reports that despite the cooling , 2008 still ranks among the 10 warmest years on record .
At 14.3C , the average temperature for the year was significantly above the 14.0C average for the 1961- 1990 period , a commonly used baseline .
Temperatures are about 0.7C above pre-industrial times .
Peter Stott , head of climate monitoring and attribution at the UK Met Office of which the Hadley Centre is a part , suggested that in previous decades 2008 would have stood out as unusually warm .
Data is recorded at thousands of weather stations " Human influence , particularly emission of greenhouse gases , has greatly increased the chance of having such warm years , " he said .
Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies ( Giss ) , which produces its own record of atmospheric temperature , agreed that 2008 was the coolest year since the turn of the century .
But Giss still ranks it as the ninth warmest since 1880 .
The warmest of all remains 1998 , when exceptionally strong El Nino conditions added to rising greenhouse gas levels sent thermometers to an average of about 14.5C .
" The most important component of year - to - year variability in global average temperatures is the phase and amplitude of equatorial sea surface temperatures in the Pacific that lead to La Nina and El Nino events , " observed UEA 's Dr Phil Jones .
Millennial warmth John Christy , a scientist noted for taking a cautious approach to the likely impacts of human - induced climate change , agreed that the Earth 's atmosphere had warmed by about 0.4C over 30 years .
His own research team at the University of Alabama in Huntsville ( UAH ) produces global temperature data from satellite readings , and uses weather balloons to verify the satellite record .
Professor Christy suggested that the trend in the immediate future would be decided by whether conditions in the Pacific veer towards El Nino or La Nina .
THE 10 WARMEST YEARS 1998 - 14.52C 2005 - 14.48C 2003 - 14.46C 2002 - 14.46C 2004 - 14.43C 2006 - 14.42C 2007 - 14.40C 2001 - 14.40C 1997 - 14.36C 2008 - 14.31C Data : Met Office Hadley Centre " If you look at the 30 - year graph of month - to - month temperature anomalies , the most obvious feature is the series of warmer than normal months that followed the major El Nino Pacific Ocean warming event of 1997 - 1998 , " he said .
" Right now we are coming out of one La Nina Pacific Ocean cooling event , and we might be heading into another .
" It should be interesting over the next several years to see whether the post La Nina climate ' re - sets ' to the cooler seasonal norms we saw before 1997 , or the warmer levels seen since then . "
The effect of El Nino and La Nina conditions are one reason why scientists prefer to average temperatures over 10 - year periods , which smoothes out the annual variations and gives a better picture of long - term trends .
On average , the decade from 1990 to 1999 was 0.23C above the 1961-1990 baseline , while in the period 2000 - 2008 it was 0.40C over , indicating a warming trend .
It is almost certain that the first decade of this century will turn out to have been significantly warmer than the last decade of the last century , notwithstanding the freak El Nino year of 1998 .
The question for the next decade or so will be whether natural cycles such as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation continue to moderate the warming effect of rising greenhouse gas concentrations .

Troops in Baghdad Cheer President Obama 's Surprise Visit President flies out of Baghdad after four hour visit with troops , Iraqi leaders .
April 7 , 2009  -- President Obama swooped into Baghdad under a cloak of secrecy today , but his presence quickly turned into a raucous meeting with several hundred U.S. troops who cheered wildly when he told them it is time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their country .
By the time Air Force One was " wheels up " four hours later , the president has consulted with his top commander in Iraq , the president and prime minister of Iraq , and shook hands with dozens of delighted American soldiers who tried to photograph their commander - in - chief with cell phones .
At one point Obama 's motorcade was flanked by a cordon of U.S. troops five deep , standing at attention and saluting .
" It was wonderful seeing those troops out there , " Obama said .
In a brief address that was part pep talk and part pat on the back , Obama said that the next 18 months will be a " critical period " in Iraq , referring to the August 2010 deadline for the withdrawal of all U.S. combat forces from Iraq .
" You have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country .
That is an extraordinary achievement and for that you have the thanks of the American people , " Obama told about 700 U.S. service members , including Vice President Biden 's son Beau , at Camp Victory the sprawling American camping that is a short car drive from Baghdad airport .
" You will be critical in terms of us being able to make sure Iraq is stable , that it is not a safe haven for terrorists , and we can start bringing our folks home , " Obama said at the Al Faw Palace , a former palace for Saddam Hussein .
Obama got one of his biggest cheers when he told the troops it is time for the Iraqis to step up and take over .
" It is time for us to transition to the Iraqis .
They need to take responsibility for their country , " he said to a chorus of cheers .
Obama told the troops he understood how difficult the tours overseas have been on their families back home and said he and his wife Michelle are working to provide additional resources .
" We have not forgotten what you have done , grateful for what you will do and as long as I 'm in White House you will get support you need and the thanks you deserve , " he said , citing increases in his budget for military families .
Obama received a raucous welcome from the troops gathered at the palace .
Many held up digital cameras above their head to try and snap a picture of the president on the stage .
Someone in the crowd shouted , " I love you , " to which the president replied , " I love you back . "
Obama said he would keep his remarks short in order to shake as many hands as possible , and after he finished speaking , he worked the ropeline , greeting the troops .
The president made the surprise detour on his way home from his European trip , stopping in Baghdad today to meet with U.S. commanders and consult with Iraqi officials .
Obama said there has been " significant political progress " in Iraq but noted there is still " a lot of work to be done . "
After a 30 minute meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki , Obama stood with the prime minister and said the U.S. is committed to an orderly transition from American to Iraqi forces and said the planned drawdown will ultimately result in the removal of all U.S. troops by 2011 .
He also had a sit - down with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani .
Earlier he met with Gen. Ray Odierno , the top U.S. army commander in Iraq , at the airport and then drove to Camp Victory .
Obama told Odierno he came to thank the American troops for their " extraordinary work " and said there is " nothing better than getting a face to face " meeting .
The president was expected to hand out 10 Medals of Valor .
Odierno told Obama that even with recent bombings , the number of incidents in Iraq are at their lowest since the war began .
The president 's stopover was marked by the rise in violence that Odierno mentioned to Obama .
In the capital , a car bomb killed nine people and wounded 20 in the Shiite neighborhood of Kadhimiya .
The blast came one day after a series of explosions ripped through the city killing more than 30 people .
And in Fallujah , a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb at a police checkpoint , killing one policeman .
This was Obama 's first visit to a war zone as president and his third trip to Iraq .
Last July , at the height of the general election , Obama traveled to Afghanistan and Iraq and met with U.S. commanders and troops there as part of a congressional delegation .
Obama visited Iraq one previous time , in January 2006 .
Today 's visit was made in complete secrecy because of security concerns .
The White House gave no advanced details of the trip and his arrival in Iraq was not made public until he had landed at Baghdad 's airport .
Obama Goes From Turkey to Iraq
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs told reporters traveling on Air Force
One that the decision was made to travel to Iraq instead of Afghanistan for three key reasons : first , Iraq 's proximity to Turkey , where he was today ; second , the need to consult with Iraqi officials on the political situation there ; and third , to visit with U.S. troops .
There are currently 139,000 U.S. troops in Iraq .
Under the president 's withdrawal plan , by September those numbers will be reduced by 12,000 troops .
Odierno has said he will assess at that time whether the security climate will allow the drawdown of an additional combat brigade by year 's end .
Odierno wants to maintain the bulk of his forces in place for December 's national election .
After that , U.S. troops levels will be reduced by the end of August 2010 to the 35,000 to 50,000 that will remain in Iraq as a training force .
The Status of Forces Agreement between the U.S. and Iraq calls for all American troops to be out of Iraq by the end of 2011 .
The president talked a great deal about Iraq while in Turkey the last two days , noting that tensions between the U.S. and the majority Muslim nation broke out after Turkey refused to let the U.S. -- a fellow NATO member -- bring troops through that country at the start of the Iraq war .
Obama currently is trying to get Turkey to allow Amercian troops entry into Turkey on their way out of Iraq .
Earlier today Obama told a group of Turkish university students that he opposed the war in Iraq because he thought it was a " bad idea , " but now he is responsible for bringing troops home in a way that does not result in " a complete collapse into violence . "
" So some people might say , wait , I thought you were opposed to the war , why do n't you just get them all out right away ?
Well , just because I was opposed at the outset it does n't mean that I do n't have now responsibilities to make sure that we do things in a responsible fashion , " Obama said in Istanbul .
Obama 's opposition to the war in Iraq was a critical part of his campaign for the presidency .
In a speech in October 2002 Obama stated his opposition to the war in Iraq and said while he did not oppose " all wars " he did oppose " dumb wars . "
The Baghdad stop wrapped up the president 's first overseas trip which aides declared to be " enormously productive . "
Obama ended his trip with cultural events and a town hall meeting in Istanbul , Turkey , with about 100 Turkish university students .
As he has done several times before on this trip , Obama spoke to the students about change and looked toward the future , promising a " new chapter in American engagement " with the rest of the world .
Building New Ties to World Leaders
" When people come together and speak to one another and share a common experience , than their common humanity is revealed , " the president said .
" When that happens , mistrust begins to fade and our smaller differences no longer overshadow the things that we share . "
Senior Obama adviser David Axelrod declared the trip to be " enormously productive , " both in terms of substance and building relationships with world leaders and their populations .
The accomplishments on the trip that Axelrod highlighted include securing the commitment of G - 20 nations for greater regulation of financial institutions , support among NATO nations for the president 's Afghanistan strategy and building a number of stronger relationships with foreign leaders .
" Throughout the campaign , the president spoke about the need to repair our relationships in the world , to mend our frayed alliances and begin again a dialogue with our allies and discussions with our adversaries to try to move America 's agenda forward , to try to make our country safer , to set the conditions for a better future , " Axelrod said .
" We feel that we 've taken a great step forward on this trip . "
Axelrod said the president had the opportunity to establish personal relationships with many leaders who will prove to be key to " promoting America 's interest in the world and the world 's security in the future . "
White House aides believe that Obama 's popularity abroad will make it easier for world leaders to cooperate with the United States .
Axelrod joked that some seeking to gauge the success of the trip seem to be asking , " ' Why did n't the waters part , the sun shine and all the ills of the world disappear because President Obama came to Europe this week ? '
That was n't our expectation , " he said .
" That will take at least a few weeks . "
Obama Gets Pat on Back for Basketball Picks
Earlier this morning , Obama met with Christian , Muslim and Jewish religious leaders , including Grand Mufti of Istanbul professor Mustafa Çagrici , Chief Rabbi Isak Haleva and Syrian Orthodox Archbishop Yusuf Cetin .
Obama talked more than religion and politics during a separate meeting with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I , the archbishop of Constantinople , according to a White House aide .
After detailing a long list of items accomplished by Obama on this trip , including his speech to the Turkish Parliament Monday , Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I threw in a little hoops talk .
" Oh , and by the way , congratulations on North Carolina , " the archbishop said , referring to Obama 's successful pick of the Tar Heels to win the NCAA college basketball tournament Monday night in Detroit .
The president , according to the White House aide , laughed and smiled .
Obama later took a tour of the Hagia Sofia Basilica with Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan .
Obama called the site " spectacular . "
In keeping with Muslim tradition , Obama took off his shoes to visit the Blue Mosque , Istanbul 's most famous landmark

5500 - year - old horse teeth , like this one , found at Botai settlements show distinct parallel wear lines typical of bridled horses ( Image : courtesy of AAAS )
High up in the steppes of Kazakhstan is where it may have first happened : a human decided to climb atop a horse instead of killing it for meat .
The act seems trivial today , but nearly 5500 years ago it would have been revolutionary .
“ Horse domestication was a landmark moment , a bit like the invention of the wheel , ” says Alan Outram of the University of Exeter , UK .
By domesticating horses , humans created the first form of land transportation , vastly expanded the region within which goods could be traded and wars waged , and spread culture over huge swathes of land .

Outram and colleagues have now found the world ’s first “ horse farms ” , in Kasakhstan ’s ancient Botai settlements .
The sites date back to 3500 BC , pushing back the domestication of horses by 1000 years .
The researchers studied horse remains from four settlements in the steppes of north - central Kazakhstan .
Before the Botai built villages dug out of the ground , the region was home to nomadic hunter gatherers that followed and killed wild herds of horses .
What made them suddenly settle in villages , the largest of which comprises some 100 houses , is something of a mystery .
Dental wear and tear
More than 90 % of bones in Botai settlements are horse bones , far outnumbering human remains .
The researchers found their structure closely related to domesticated Bronze Age horses .
Outram recruited the help of Robin Bendrey , of France ’s Museum of Natural History .
After years spent poring over horse teeth , Bendrey had found that bits and bridles leave distinct deep , parallel wear lines on the animals ’ teeth .
The wearing can take away the enamel and dig into the dentine , and appears only on the pre-molars , in places where wild horses show no sign of wear and tear .
Bendrey found bit wear marks on the horse teeth collected from Botai settlements , and concluded that the animals must have been domesticated .
There is no way of saying for sure whether or not the Botai rode their horses , says Outram , but he believes it is very likely .
For starters , stone tools found at the settlements are not made from locally - sourced stone , so it ’s likely the people travelled great distances .
The Botai , whose ancestors hunted wild horses , probably also kept the animals for food .
Cattle cannot graze under snow and would not have survived the steppe ’s harsh winters .
There is also no archaeological evidence of agriculture , making it unlikely that the horses were used to till fields .
It seems they did milk them , though .
Modern day Kazakhs drink a fermented milk drink called “ koumiss ” and Outram and his colleagues found traces of horse milk fat on Botai pottery vessels .
Shifted world view
“ Domestication is a major shift in mentality and world view , ” says Outram .
“ Before , people go out into world to collect things , and their only interest in animals is to kill them .
After , they move into a production mode , and are interested in taking care of animals and their progeny . ”
The shift is also accompanied by new social power .
“ Hunter - gatherer societies tend to be egalitarian .
But as soon as you domesticate animals , the question becomes ‘ who owns them ? ' ”
Answering that – establishing people who own more or less – creates a social hierarchy .
Outram now wants to look deeper into the site – literally .
He has recently completed a geophysical survey to detect building structures beneath the steppe ’s surface , and will analyse these in an attempt to understand more about Botai society .
In the meantime , one mystery may have just been solved .
Anthropologists have long wondered what made the Botai settle down .
Learning to domesticate horses , possibly from distant groups that had domesticated cows , may have meant they no longer had to chase after their food all the year round .

Bill to help remove people remove themselves from TSA watch list passes House John Byrne
Published : Wednesday February 4 , 2009
Print This Email This Almost unanimously , the House of Representatives adopted a bill late Tuesday night aiming to help people remove themselves from the flawed US " terror watch list . "
The bill , sponsored by Rep. Yvette Clarke ( D - NY ) , passed 413-3 .
The bill requires Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to establish a " timely and fair " appeal process and provide relief for those wrongly delayed or prevented from boarding a flight .
Its passage reflects a widespread belief that the list has caused undue difficulty for thousands of travelers -- many of whom were prevented from traveling simply because their names shared similarities with suspects .
The bill would also spur the creation of an Office of Appeals and Redress to create a " comprehensive cleared list " of people who 've been inappropriately added to watch lists or government databases .
" The watch list is only as good as the information on it , " House Homeland Security Chairman Bennie Thompson ( D - MS ) told CQ .
The " cleared " list would then be supplied to DHS agencies such as the Transportation Security Administration .
" When the terror watch lists hit one million records last summer , it became painfully clear that this system is fatally flawed , " Timothy Sparapani , ACLU Senior Legislative Counsel , said in a statement to Raw Story .
" Representative Clarke 's bill is significant in that it provides the individual with a means of seeking redress through appeal , and those erroneously caught up in the web of watch lists will be well - served .
But the burden of correcting the error still remains on the victim and not those responsible for allowing the lists to grow exponentially . "
" In order to make the current watch lists more effective in keeping our nation safe , they need to be scrubbed , retaining only individuals for whom there is credible evidence of terrorist ties or activities , " he added .
" But it remains critical that Congress and the Obama administration reexamine and reform our whole approach to the watch list system . "
FedEx Corp. said Thursday that quarterly profit slid 75 % , more than analysts expected , and sales fell for the first time in at least a decade .
FedEx Chief Executive Fred Smith said he did n’t expect a “ further significant decline ” in the U.S. economy this year , however , boosting the company ’s shares almost 5 % .
The Memphis , Tenn. , company is seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy because it delivers products as varied as clothing , electronics and auto parts .
A need for companies to replenish depleted inventories later this year should prevent a further decline in the gross domestic product , Smith said .
Net income for the company ’s fiscal third quarter ended Feb. 28 was $ 97 million , or 31 cents a share , down from $ 393 million , or $ 1.26 , a year earlier , FedEx said .
The average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg was for 46 cents a share .
Revenue declined 14 % to $ 8.14 billion .

FedEx said it expected earnings of 45 to 70 cents a share for the current period , the fiscal fourth quarter , and narrowed its full - year per-share earnings forecast to a range of $ 3.57 to $ 3.82 from $ 3.50 to $ 4.75 .
Shares of FedEx rose $ 2.05 , or 4.8 % , to $ 45.10

Related to : Priming and Contamination
Psychologists define " priming " as the ability of a stimulus to activate the brain in such a way as to affect responses to later stimuli .
If that does n't sound sufficiently ominous , feel free to re-word it as " any random thing that happens to you can hijack your judgment and personality for the next few minutes . "
For example , let 's say you walk into a room and notice a briefcase in the corner .
Your brain is now the proud owner of the activated concept " briefcase " .
It is " primed " to think about briefcases , and by extension about offices , business , competition , and ambition .
For the next few minutes , you will shift ever so slightly towards perceiving all social interactions as competitive , and towards behaving competitively yourself .
These slight shifts will be large enough to be measured by , for example , how much money you offer during the Ultimatum Game .
If that sounds too much like some sort of weird New Age sympathetic magic to believe , all I can say is Kay , Wheeler , Bargh , and Ross , 2004.1
We 've been discussing the costs and benefits of Santa Claus recently .
Well , here 's one benefit : show Dutch children an image of St. Nicholas ' hat , and they 'll be more likely to share candy with others .
Why ?
The researchers hypothesize that the hat activates the concept of St. Nicholas , and St. Nicholas activates an idealized concept of sharing and giving .
The child is now primed to view sharing positively .
Of course , the same effect can be used for evil .
In the same study , kids shown the Toys ' R ' Us logo refused to share their precious candy with anyone .
But this effect is limited to a few psych laboratories , right ?
It has n't done anything like , you know , determine the outcome of a bunch of major elections ?
I am aware of two good studies on the effect of priming in politics .
In the first , subjects were subliminally 2 primed with either alphanumeric combinations that recalled the 9/11 WTC attacks ( ie " 911 " or " WTC " ) , or random alphanumeric combinations .
Then they were asked to rate the Bush administration 's policies .
Those who saw the random strings rated Bush at an unenthusiastic 42 % ( 2.1/5 ) .
Those who were primed to be thinking about the War on Terror gave him an astounding 75 % ( 3.75/5 ) .
This dramatic a change , even though none of them could consciously recall seeing terrorism - related stimuli .
In the second study , scientists analyzed data from the 2000 election in Arizona , and found that polling location had a moderate effect on voting results .
That is , people who voted in a school were more likely to support education - friendly policies , people who voted in a church were more likely to support socially conservative policies , et cetera .
The effect seems to have shifted results by about three percentage points .
Think about all the elections that were won or lost by less than three percent ...
Objection : correlation is not causation !
Religious people probably live closer to churches , and are more likely to know where their local church is , and so on .
So the scientists performed an impressive battery of regression analyses and adjustments on their data .
Same response .
Objection : maybe their adjustments were n't good enough !
The same scientists then called voters into their laboratory , showed them pictures of buildings , and asked them to cast a mock vote on the education initiatives .
Voters who saw pictures of schools were more likely to vote yes on the pro-education initiatives than voters who saw control buildings .
What techniques do these studies suggest for rationalists ?
I 'm tempted to say the optimal technique is to never leave your room , but there are still a few less extreme things you can do .
First , avoid exposure to any salient stimuli in the few minutes before making an important decision .
Everyone knows about the 9 - 11 terrorist attacks , but the War on Terror only hijacked the decision - making process when the subjects were exposed to the related stimuli directly before performing the rating task3 .
Second , try to make decisions in a neutral environment and then stick to them .
The easiest way to avoid having your vote hijacked by the location of your polling place is to decide how to vote while you 're at home , and then stick to that decision unless you have some amazing revelation on your way to the voting booth .
Instead of never leaving your room , you can make decisions in your room and then carry them out later in the stimulus - laden world .
I can't help but think of the long tradition of master rationalists " blanking their mind " to make an important decision .
Jeffreyssai's brain " carefully put in idle " as he descends to a bare white room to stage his crisis of faith .
Anasûrimbor Kellhus withdrawing into himself and entering a probability trance before he finds the Shortest Path .
Your grandmother telling you to " sleep on it " before you make an important life choice .
Whether or not you try anything as formal as that , waiting a few minutes in a stimulus - free environment before a big decision might be a good idea .
1 : I bet that sympathetic magic probably does have strong placebo - type effects for exactly these reasons , though .
2 : Priming is one of the phenomena behind all the hype about subliminal advertising and other subliminal effects .
The bad news is that it 's real : a picture of popcorn flashed subliminally on a movie screen can make you think of popcorn .
The good news is that it 's not particularly dangerous : your thoughts of popcorn are n't any stronger or any different than they'd be if you just saw a normal picture of popcorn .
3 : The obvious objection is that if you 're evaluating George Bush , it would be very strange if you did n't think of the 9 - 11 terror attacks yourself in the course of the evaluation .
I have n't seen any research addressing this possibility , but maybe hearing an external reference to it outside the context of your own thought processes is a stronger activation than the one you would get by coming up with the idea yourself .
Today , a news story came out where a company planned on purchasing chicken processing plants and the government was going to match the private company ’s bid dollar for dollar .
This plan is proposed under the guise of saving jobs .
Now let me give you a hint who this socialist leader is ; he ’s a national leader .
Is it Barack Obama ’s latest “ stimulus ” plan ?
Is it Harry Reid ?
Is this Ed Rendell or some other big state Democratic governor ?
Could it be even Charlie Crist or Arnold Schwarzenegger ?
If you guessed any of the above , you ’re wrong .
The person proposing to give the government 50 % ownership of certain chicken processing plants is none other the guy who came in second in the CPAC straw poll , Louisiana Governor and Republican Party savior , Bobby Jindal .
From the Monroe News Star
Gov. Bobby Jindal ’s chief of staff said the state has found a buyer for Pilgrim ’s Pride ’s northeastern Louisiana operations and that an offer was expected to be made to the bankrupt company Tuesday night .
Timmy Teepell said the buyer will put up $ 20 million and the state will match it for a $ 40 million offer .
“ ( Jindal ) has agreed to match it dollar for dollar with the stipulation that the company must keep the work force intact for five years , ” Teepell said .
Pilgrim ’s chief executive Don Jackson said at 7 p.m.
Tuesday that he had not yet received an offer .
“ I stated from the beginning that we would be receptive to any meaningful offer , ” Jackson said .
The company announced Feb. 27 that it will close the Farmerville processing plants and the support infrastructure in April because of a glut of chicken on the market .
So the man who railed in a boring , self - centered speech against Barack Obama ’s big government agenda plans to have the State of Louisiana own 50 % of chicken processing plants .
At least Obama in his takeover of Citigroup is only buying 36 % of it .
Maybe Rush Limbaugh can see if this is what Reagan would ’ve done .
One other disturbing aspect of this proposal :
Teepell would not identify the company that made the offer to Pilgrim ’s Pride , but he did say the company ’s chief executive contacted Jackson before deciding to make the offer .
Bobby Jindal likes to talk about he cleaned up the most corrupt state in the country and how he reformed Louisiana ’s ethics laws and improved transparency .
Well , he passed some unenforceable new ethics laws while at the same time fought any attempts to bring transparency to the governor ’s office .
This secretive way of conducting business is the norm for the Jindal regime .
America , if you elect Bobby Jindal president in 2012 , you can expect more socialism and more of the shadow government .
If this is what the Republican Party has to offer , they wo n’t be returning to power anytime soon .
UPDATE : Pilgrim ’s Pride rejected the offer from the State of Louisiana to buy the plant .
“ Gov. Jindal and ( Pilgrim ’s chief executive Don ) Jackson spoke by phone ( on Tuesday night ) , ” Pilgrim ’s spokesman Ray Atkinson said in a written statement .
“ Dr. Jackson explained to the governor that the offer for the Farmerville complex was below our requirements .
“ It would essentially put Foster ( Farms ) in business at a cost of entry of $ 20 million , well below the real cost and at a level with which neither Pilgrim ’s Pride nor the rest of the industry could effectively compete .
“ Dr. Jackson did not rule out a possible sale , but noted that it would have to be at a price well beyond $ 40 million .
He also reiterated that selling the facility would not address the fundamental problem facing our industry : an oversupply of low - value commodity chicken . ”
Data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) suggest the discovery of ancient springs in the Vernal Crater , sites where life forms may have evolved on Mars , according to a report in Astrobiology .
Data from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) suggest the discovery of ancient springs in the Vernal Crater , sites where life forms may have evolved on Mars , according to a report in Astrobiology , a peer - reviewed journal published by Mary Ann Liebert , Inc .
Several key papers in the issue are available free online at www.liebertpub.com/ast
Hot springs have great astrobiological significance , as the closest relatives of many of the most ancient organisms on Earth can thrive in and around hydrothermal springs .
If life forms have ever been present on Mars , hot spring deposits would be ideal locations to search for physical or chemical evidence of these organisms and could be target areas for future exploratory missions .
In the research paper entitled , “ A Case for Ancient Springs in Arabia Terra , Mars , ” Carlton C. Allen and Dorothy Z. Oehler , from the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science Directorate at the NASA Johnson Space Center , Houston , Texas , propose that new image data from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) on MRO depict structures in Vernal Crater that appear to have arisen as part of a major area of ancient spring activity .
The data suggest that the southern part of Vernal Crater has experienced episodes of water flow from underground to the surface and may be a site where martian life could have developed .
“ Hot spring deposits are key target areas for future Mars missions , ” says Sherry L. Cady , PhD , Editor of Astrobiology and Associate Professor in the Department of Geology at Portland State University .
“ Such deposits on Earth preserve evidence of the fossilized remains of the microbial communities that inhabited the hot springs over a wide range of spatial scales .
The potential to find key evidence indicative of life––biofabrics , microbial remains , chemical fossils in minerals––is high when sedimentary deposits form from hydrothermal fluids .
Hot spring fluids are typically laden with dissolved mineral ions that , when they precipitate out and create the hydrothermal deposit , enhance fossilization of all types of biosignatures . ”
I first attempted to use GIMP to fix a photograph or two of mine , but was quickly bogged down in the many options available in the program .
That is why I was happy to get my hands on a copy of .
The book is based mainly on GIMP 2.4 , but the author included a preview of GIMP 2.6 in Appendix D. When I downloaded the latest verson of GIMP from gimp.org , I received GIMP 2.6.0 .
So I used the PortableApps version of GIMP ( 2.4.6 ) on Windows XP while reviewing the book and found only minor variations from the text .
One thing that strikes you as you open the book is the extensive use of color .
Most texts are black - and - white throughout , but here you are presented with a pleasantly colorful tome .
To follow the examples as best as I could , I downloaded the images available on the gimpbook.com web site .
Although the images are supposed to be for the 2nd edition , several of those shown in the text for demonstrations purposes are not included .
It appears that the images for the tools new to GIMP 2.4 are missing from the web site .
This is surprising , since the 1st edition of the book covered version 2.4 , so you would expect the images to be there .
The book begins by giving the reader a brief tour of the three main windows of GIMP : the Toolbox window , the Layer / Channels / Path / Undo window , and the Image window .
Some basic navigation is presented , along with tear - off menus and how to modify tool placement .
It concludes with a simple project layering a small image onto a larger one was given .
Unfortunately , the files supplied from the web site did not include the PNG file used in the text , so it 's difficult to reproduce the picture as shown .
I later found the missing image in a GIMP - format file called wilber.xcf.gz .
Unfortunately , xcf files are not discussed until the next chapter .
After the simple introduction , the author , Akkana Peck , gets into the most common adjustments a beginning user might need : re-sizing , cropping , rotating , brightening and darkening , and fixing red-eye .
Each manipulation is presented with careful step - by - step instructions .
I was able to match the pictures shown in the book , providing me with a level of comfort that I was learning the right way to fix photos .
One of the most common and useful methods of altering photographs uses the concept of layers .
Layers act like cinematic cels , being mostly transparent with some opaque portions to lay on top of other layers .
Chapter 3 gives a clear description of how to use layers to make changes .
Two sample projects use layers to add text and another image to an existing photo , and to create an animated GIF using a series of layers for each frame of the animation .
While I found minor differences between the text and the version of GIMP I used , I had no real problem understanding how the concept is applied .
You will probably need to do some freehand drawing from time to time , and chapter 4 covers the tools you 'll need .
While these tools are familiar to anyone who has used a basic painting program like Microsoft Paint , there are enough differences in how they are applied to warrant their own chapter .
After creating some basic shapes ( rectangle and circles ) , outlining and filling them , the author explores various fills and patterns .
The chapter ends with a tutorial of creating a tree in a planter box , using just the drawing tools .
Every tool you use in GIMP works on the current selection .
Knowing how to select just the parts of the image you want affected is important to getting the results you want .
The author devotes an entire chapter to the numerous ways to select areas , add to or subtract from the selections , and fine - tuning them to only touch the parts you want touched .
Basic rectangle , ellipse , and free - hand selections are followed by more sophisticated methods including the intelligent scissors and SIOX ( Simple Interactive Object Extraction ) .
The book also shows how to save selections as channels , so you can return to them in future editing sessions .
Sometimes , however , all you really need to do is a little touch - up on a photograph .
Is someone 's face in shadow or too much sun ?
Did you wish to get rid of some little irritating extra in a photo ?
Maybe you just wanted to draw attention to one subject and blur out the rest .
Chapter 6 provides the information on how to make these basic adjustments .
Darkroom techniques called dodging and burning provide minor adjustments to brightness , while cloning and healing can completely eradicate unwanted portions of the image .
To draw attention to portions of the picture , you can enhance it using the blur and sharpen tools .
In addition to simple adjustments , GIMP offers a plethora of various tools to modify or create images .
Under the Filters menu , you will find a large selection of tools .
When I first looked , I felt that there were so many , who would need all of them ?
In the Filters and Effects chapter , Akkana Peck goes through them all , showing how they can be used to enhance your image .
Because there are so many , she does not provide examples of each effect , but each one is described and you are encouraged to play .
Remember , Undo is your friend here !
Chapter 8 delves into a very important aspect of your photos and drawings — the colors .
First , the concepts of the RGB ( Red- Green - Blue ) and CMY ( Cyan - Magenta - Yellow ) colorspaces are described , followed by the HSV ( Hue - Saturation - Value ) space .
A lot of time is used reviewing how these different colorspaces are used , and how they can be manipulated .
The tools for breaking the image into its component layers , and demonstrations on how manipulating them can enhance your photo follow .
The chapter concludes with some discussion on color profiles .
Now that you 've learned quite a few niceties of GIMP , you need to learn more advanced techniques .
The next two chapters go into more detail about drawing and compositing .
The chapter on Advanced Drawing covers three main topics : mask and layer modes , realism using perspective and shading , and making new brushes , patterns and gradients .
The Layer Mode section is the most interesting , showing how blending layers using various modes other than simple overlays can produce interesting effects .
There are a number of examples , all easily followed and replicated .
Once you 've got a basic understanding of the advanced drawing techniques , it 's time to put them to use on photographs .
The chapter on Advanced Compositing shows how to use layer modes to play with images to improve their looks .
You can brighten images , improve contrast , create eerie landscapes , fix noisy photos , and create panoramas , all using various layer modes .
Many examples are shown , so you can get a good feel for the technique .
GIMP plug -ins provide automated tasks for the user .
In fact , a number of GIMP 's tools are provided by plug-ins .
A variety of languages is supported .
Plug - in scripts can be written in Scheme ( the default — always installed ) , Python , and Perl ( if available on your computer ) .
If you need greater speed , you can write a plug - in in C. Chapter 11 uses the sphere plug - in as an example .
Xtns — Misc —
Sphere creates a sphere on a solid background .
Akkana explains how to modify the script to provide a transparent background .
A full discussion of the programming of the original script follows .
Each step is carefully explained so only a minimal amount of programming background is needed to understand the concepts .
Finally , examples in Python , Perl and C round out the chapter .
Also included are explanations of how to find plug-ins and help on callable routines .
Unfortunately , there is so much to GIMP that one medium - sized book cannot contain it all .
There is a potpourri of topics in the final chapter , including printing , scanning , setting preferences and the configuration files .
The chapter ends with information on where to go for more help , source code , and images .
The appendices offer information on how to get and install GIMP , how to install it on older systems , and how to build it from source .
Naturally , GIMP is always evolving , and Appendix D offers a list of enhancements in GIMP 2.6 that were not incorporated into the main text .
Over the course of reading the book , I had very little trouble reproducing the examples as demonstrated .
I must admit that , despite the book 's subtitle : From Novice to Professional , I am now at best an intermediate user .
The depth of the capabilities available within GIMP is much deeper than the author could provide in the text .
At almost 600 pages , this book is just about the right size , and provides the right amount of instruction for most people .
The Additional Topics chapter provides information and links for further study and training , for those so inclined .
If you are a beginner to image manipulation , and want to get fairly proficient with GIMP , then definitely get Beginning GIMP .
It 's not leaving my desk any time soon .
You can purchase Beginning GIMP : From Novice to Professional , Second Edition from amazon.com .

We live in a decaying age .
Young people no longer respect their parents .
They are rude and impatient .
They frequently inhabit taverns and have no self - control . "
These words - expressing the all - too - familiar contemporary condemnation of young people - were actually inscribed on a 6,000 - year - old Egyptian tomb .
Later , in the fourth century BC , Plato was heard to remark : " What is happening to our young people ?
They disrespect their elders , they disobey their parents .
They ignore the law .
They riot in the streets , inflamed with wild notions .
Their morals are decaying .
What is to become of them ? "
And then , a few hundred years later , in AD1274 , Peter the Hermit joined the chorus .
" The young people of today think of nothing but themselves .
They have no reverence for parents or old age .
They are impatient of all restraint ...
As for the girls , they are forward , immodest and unladylike in speech , behaviour and dress . "
Such quotes illustrate what I believe has become a historically nurtured and culturally damaging phenomenon : ephebiphobia - the fear of youth .
But today this problem is worse than ever .
We live in an increasingly risk - averse culture , where many children 's behaviour is constrained .
We raise them and educate them " in captivity " because of our anxieties .
We are continually hypervigilant , as our anxieties are fuelled by stories and images of violent and aggressive crimes .
And then we label children as troublemakers or failures because , as a society , we often fail to see their potential .
Even little children are now becoming victims of our ephebiphobic culture , as powerless teachers seem helpless in the face of nursery hooligans - paedophobia is born .
As a mother and a specialist in child and adolescent mental health , I despair for today 's young people , who are feared because of the actions of a minority population - the violent , aggressive and antisocial ; a population that has always existed .
We see young people as so pestilent that we create the Mosquito , a device only they can hear , designed to frighten them away .
Our distorted perception of young people creates a self - fulfilling prophecy : why bother to try when you are told that you are a failure ?
Why bother to strive when your existence is seen as a nuisance ?
I am not denying that there are some really destructive children and young people - as there are adults .
They are mostly those who exist in deprivation and are anxious and aggressive .
They are made to feel worthless and so they become destructive .
They are incredibly vulnerable .
However , there are many young people who want to make a go of their lives but are blocked at many turns and so give up .
Blocked by an education system that narrows the definition of achievement because it is built around targets and testing , and staffed by creatively compromised and disempowered teachers .
Blocked by a higher education system that is mostly riven with elitist and narrowly defined notions of academic competence .
Blocked by a society that discriminates against youth and so reduces the participation of upcoming generations in the development of the social and cultural landscape .
How can we turn this around ?
Children first become negatively labelled in nurseries and schools , and often these labels stick .
We so often forget that children misbehave because they are struggling in a learning environment .
Schools need more input from child development specialists , who can support teachers to understand and manage the needs of children they see as " difficult " .
The educational culture of targets and testing places enormous pressure on school staff who have to manage large classes of children of mixed abilities , and with a huge diversity of needs .
It creates a herd mentality .
Little boys , in particular , seem to struggle in the worksheet culture of many classrooms .
Clinically , I see many children with sensory integration difficulties ( often wrongly labelled as ADHD - attention - deficit hyperactivity disorder ) .
These children can do well with one - to - one support and directed guidance .
Paediatric occupational therapy has shown good outcomes with such children , as does a school - family behavioural approach , underpinned by an understanding of the child 's strengths and needs .
Sadly , many of these children ( mostly boys ) get lost in huge classrooms , develop behaviours to compensate for their difficulties , and get labelled as the class clown - or worse .
Schools need support and resources to individualise teaching again .
We need to have the courage to see child development from the perspective of difference , not sameness .
Outcomes in terms of Sats and league tables show nothing more than a herd approach to attainment , and push the focus away from the individual child .
Children labelled as failures in primary and secondary education have no hope of further or higher education , given the limited and mostly elitist way we assess their abilities .
At Edge Hill University , where I am chancellor , we value personal achievement alongside academic attainment , and this helps many young people to broaden their personal and academic horizons .
Our fast - track and fast - forward programmes enable 500 learners a year , of all ages , who do not have A - levels , to realise their potential without incurring any financial cost .
The selection process for these unique gateway courses is based on the individuals ' potential and motivation , opening career doors that would ordinarily be shut to them .
At Edge Hill , we try to see those that are defensive , underachieving and at times hostile as young people who need the most support - not to be written off - and so we uncover the most extraordinary young people .
My wish would be that those universities that " protect " their reputations via elitist and narrow assessment criteria , which rely on attainment in a traditionalist sense , start to look more broadly at criteria of success that encompass the whole person and not just their grades .
Many universities lack robust student diversity and so do not allow themselves to benefit from young people who bring varied life experiences to their student population .
If their school was not able to meet the needs of the more complex learner , many of these young people have lost any thought of higher education before they 've even made the transition to secondary school .
We are an ephebiphobic society and we should be ashamed of ourselves .
• Professor Tanya Byron will give a lecture , The Trouble with Kids , at Edge Hill University , Ormskirk , on Tuesday 24 March at 6 pm .

The misunderstood
Joe White , 16 , Shropshire
I 've had people cross the road to avoid me .
It 's worst when you 're wearing a hoodie .
The problem is that people have read all this bad stuff in newspapers .
They focus on the small minority of teenagers who get up to things , and the rest of us are tarred with that brush .
It 's unfair to label us all like that .

I 'm a member of the youth parliament , and we 're trying to organise an event at the House of Commons .
One MP has been really negative about it , saying we 're bound to make trouble .
Last year , at the same event , the peer who organised it said we were a lot better behaved than a lot of MPs .

I got on a train with a friend whose dad had bought us first - class tickets .
Straight away the guard arrived and was quite rude to us .
He just assumed we were somewhere we should n't be .
He treated us with a total lack of respect .

Depending on how much time and space you have , you can grow your own food in most urban areas .
Of course , weather constraints will limit how much you will be able to grow and when , but residents of more temperate cities like Los Angeles can have thriving little gardens in small spaces all year round .
Even if you live in the middle of Manhattan , though , there are lots of inventive ways to grow your own food in the city .
1. Grow Potatoes in a Box
On top of a small patch of fertile soil , you can grow as many as 25 pounds of potatoes from a single pound of seeds .
You will need an 18x18 a wooden box with an open top that stands about 24 to 30 inches tall .
In this small space , you simply fill the box with soil or mulch and plant your seeds .
Cover the seeds with four inches of soil and water regularly .
As the vines grow , you should fill the box with mellow compost , mulch or soil to encourage growth .
In these containers , you can see 200 % to 3,000 % yield !
Popular types of potatoes to grow this way include : Yellow Finn , Indian Pit , Red Pontiac , or the fingerling types .
2. Grow Upside Down Tomatoes
For the price of seeds and a five - gallon bucket , you can grow your own tomatoes in a small space !
Simply drill a two - inch hole in the bottom of the bucket and another in the lid .
Fill the bucket with soft soil and place a coffee filter on top of the dirt .
Replace the lid and flip the bucket upside down .
Place your tomato plant in the hole in the bottom of the bucket ( now facing the top ) and water it for a week so that it takes root .
Then , hang your bucket upside down on a clothesline and you will have juicy , ripe tomatoes in several weeks !
3. Sprout a One - Pot Herb Garden
You will need a large ( seven gallons or more ) clay pot and a tray to catch excess water ( these are usually sold together at nurseries ) .
Place a few small stones or gravel at the bottom of the pot for drainage and fill with soft potting soil , leaving three inches of space at the top of the pot .
Plant a variety of herbs , such as basil , thyme , sage and rosemary .
Water until the soil is muddy and harvest when the herbs are vibrant in color and fragrant .
4. Vegetable Pots
For small veggies like green onion , parsley and shallots , you can use a six to 10 - inch clay pot for indoor gardening .
Simply fill with a small layer of rocks , and then fill 85 % of the pot with fertile soil like MiracleGro ( www.miraclegro.com).
Water regularly until your veggies are ready to harvest .
5. Bucket Gardens
Use five - gallon buckets on an urban patio to grow larger food items like peppers and eggplant .
Organizations like Bucket Brigade specialize in providing city dwellers with small bucket - gardening kits .

A team of Oregon State University researchers say they have implemented a classroom - based intervention that reduces the amount of violent TV that children watch - by 18 percent among first - through fourth - grade children .
And that 's good , they say , because youth violence is a big issue , though not so much as 30 years ago when everyone assumed we would be living out scenarios from either " The Warriors " or " Escape From New York " by now .
Thanks to effective poison awareness , worries about gunshots are more prevalent , they say , though strangely swimming pools and auto accidents fail to make the list even though they kill a lot more kids than guns .
So we need to take action but there are n't a lot of swimming pool accidents in TV shows - that leaves just violence for concerned scientists to research .
Should children that young be be watching any violent TV , is probably what you are asking ?
Well , no , but unfortunately they mean ' violent ' television like Bugs Bunny and Superman , which no serial killer in history has ever listed among their influences .
They list those with a rating in an index along with programs like " Buffy The Vampire Slayer " in their appendix .
We all agree that is pretty violent .
They had first graders watching people get impaled by wooden stakes ?
Who designed this study , Torquemada ?
Obviously , any parent can reduce the violent television being watched by getting rid of the actual violent television programs , and that would include Buffy .
Heck , you can eliminate violent television completely by getting rid of actual televisions , although another study today says violent video games improve vision so you 'll need to sacrifice their eyesight for their mental health if you take away all the fun stuff .
Sharon Rosenkoetter , who co-authored the study with Lawrence Rosenkoetter , retired professor in the Department of Psychology at Oregon State University , and Alan Acock in the Department of Human Development and Family Sciences , says that research pointing to the impact of violent television shows a need to steer children to " healthier " viewing habits .
Okay , that is common sense , but what do these guys have against Superman ?
He fights for truth , justice and the American way ( which is in and of itself truth , justice and ... you get the point ) but they were pleased that their curriculm reduced the students ' identification with ' superheroes ' compared to children in a control group .
Not me .
We want to raise children who do not want to defend the defenseless and right wrongs ?
What evil genius came up with that ?
It must be one of them evil Republicans academics are always going on about because no social scientist could ever endorse such a crazy notion .
I have spent my whole life making decisions based on a " What Would Thor Do ? " outlook and , sure , that involved a lot of smashing things with a hammer and saying " thou " to my mother , but I turned out okay .
In the upcoming Thor movie , they have failed to cast me .
I think this is a mistake .
" We have a significant body of research now that shows that children who watch violent TV tend to be more violent , to overestimate the threat of crime , and to think that the world is a more dangerous place than it is , " she said .
" So if there is a connection between violent TV and violent behavior – and research shows that there is – then it is in society 's interest to reduce the viewing of violence . "
You know what I shut off so my kids do n't know what a violent place the world is ?
" The Today Show " on NBC .
They should subtitle themselves " the missing children 's " show .
Literally just this morning I had to shut it off again so my kids could play with their Thomas The Tank Engine train set without worrying if the Fat Conductor would turn into the Fat Child Abductor .
In their first of three studies , they found a reduction in viewing of violent shows by girls - but not boys - in the intervention group .
In the control group , neither gender changed its viewing habits , as you would expect .
The second and latest study found an 18 percent reduction in viewing of violent television for both genders , while again nothing changed in the control group .
Who got to choose which kids were doomed to become homocidal maniacs due to watching " Power Rangers " ?
It 's too big an issue for me .
So they let teachers do it .
More on that in a bit .
One of the achievements they highlighted was that kids reported identifying less with violent superheroes ( " Superman " , " Powerpuff Girls " , " Power Rangers " ) and having more critical attitudes about violence on TV after the intervention .
The curriculum did this by highlighting the " pretend " nature of the superheroes actions while extolling the " real " heroes such as police officers and rescue personnel , apparently like the ones in " Cops " , " Wildest Police Videos " , " Wild Rescues " and " Walker , Texas Ranger " , all of which were high on their violence index .
Why not throw an episode of " Dexter " in there and see if that helps kids ?
Back to the kids in the study .
Unsurprisingly , the researchers noted that even when they could get teachers to participate ( since , thanks to No Child Left Behind , they actually have to teach and can't let their kids spend 15 hours a week watching violent television ) a number of permission slips were unreturned by parents .
No kidding .
You know what that means , right ?
The kids in this study already had parents willing to let them be experimented on about watching violent television - which connotes a variety of other possible home living conditions that are n't exactly making them model citizens .
Meanwhile , the teachers most likely to volunteer were the ones most likely to be concerned about violent television watching , which means they may have discussed it with the kids any number of times during the school year , something less likely in the control group .
" Getting children to watch less violent television is crucial , " Lawrence Rosenkoetter said .
" We compare it to the kids eating junk food versus eating healthy food that makes you grow strong .
They really grasp that comparison .
We tell them , there is junk TV and nutritious TV , and here is how you tell the difference . "
Sure , it 's a daily struggle to get kids to eat broccoli but you also let them have some delicious cake once in a while too - life can be enjoyed , just do things in moderation .
Have these researchers seen what people who only eat food from the GNC look like ?
Imagine that , except in a kid 's brain .
Like anything , you have to use some sense .
Obviously , " Buffy The Vampire Slayer " should not be seen by anyone not a teenager .
I know this , you know this , Joss Whedon knows this .
The researchers agree that there is an increasing amount of good television programming for children as well as the bad ones and say children should balance television viewing with other activities .
Presumably not body slamming each other in real life , like they do on " WCW Wrestling " , which the kids got to watch too .
" We ask them questions like ' What could you do instead of sitting in front of the television set ? '
' How might you help someone in your neighborhood ? '
' Did you ever read the book that suggested that TV show ? ' " Sharon Rosenkoetter said .
" The students come up with really creative answers , and it appears from the data that they are acting on those answers . "
What else has been proven to work is having only one TV station you can get .
As a kid in the country , we had a huge antenna in the attic that had to be turned by a very large pipe wrench if you wanted to try and get a different station .
Let me tell you , kids find other things to do when a lousy show is on TV if they have to crawl into an attic to change the channel .
But that 's too much like eating broccoli all of the time .
Just control the remote yourself .
And do n't let them watch " Speed Racer " , because car crashes kill more kids than violence every year and you do n't want them to get crazy ideas about driving backwards on a racetrack .
NOTES :
Their intervention program was the second phase of a three - part study conducted over a four - year period .
Their research was funded through $ 850,000 in grants from the U.S. Department of Education and the Northwest Health Foundation .
The curriculum used in the intervention is called The REViEW Project Curriculum ( Reducing Early Violence : Education Works ) .
It was developed by the Rosenkoetters , colleagues , and students , drawing upon earlier work by leaders in this field .
The curriculum is available online under Community Outreach at : http://www.hhs.oregonstate.edu/hdfs/hdfs-research

Hydroelectricity has become a buzzword in the renewable energy industry , promising emissions - free electricity generated by the force of moving water .
Tidal power farms could be a major source of sustainable power in the future , but smaller water - powered gadgets , batteries and even vehicles already exist .
Recent advancements in hydropower technology have resulted in a surprising variety of awesome water - powered designs .
James Bond - Style Water - Powered Jet Pack
Imagine soaring up into the air with a James Bond - style jet pack strapped to your back – powered by water .
A German entrepreneur , Hermann Ramke , created the JetLev-Flyer which can power the rider to a height of 50 feet with a top speed of 30 mph and can travel almost 200 miles before it needs to be refuelled .
A floating pump powered by a 150 horsepower four - stroke engine sends water through a 140 - foot long hose to a pair of nozzles mounted on the jet pack , which can be angled to propel the rider forward in steady , controlled flight .
It can be yours for just £ 160,000 .
Bedol Water - Powered Alarm Clock
Take your alarm clock with you anywhere and do n’t worry about whether there ’s a power source – you can just use the leftover water in your glass on the nightstand .
The Eco-Friendly Water - Powered Clock by Bedol runs on water and lemon .
You just fill up the tank with water and squeeze in some lemon juice , which makes it run more efficiently .
The clock even has a memory function that saves the time while you ’re switching out the water , so you do n’t have to reset it .
Batteries Powered by Water – or Urine
NoPoPo – which stands for non-pollution power – are a brand of Japanese batteries that will run on just about any liquid , including urine .
That might sound strange , but in an emergency situation when you do n’t have water to spare , it could be immensely useful .
These batteries do n’t last forever – the life cycle is about 3 to 5 charges – and they ’re only available in Japan , but they ’re a pretty neat concept .
Ireland ’s Water - Powered Street Lights
In Donegal County , Ireland , residents will soon enjoy street lamps powered with water instead of electricity or gas .
LH Ecotech ’s € 3,000 “ hydro light ” is being installed for a test run on a footbridge over the River Finn in Ballybofey .
Water flowing downstream in the river passes through a 110 watt turbine , which charges batteries that run each 30 watt LED .
Stan Meyer ’s Water - Powered Dune Buggy
Inventor Stanley Meyer created a dune buggy that ran on water back in the ‘ 80s , the first vehicle to do what physicists had previously deemed impossible .
When Meyer debuted his creation , which turned water into hydrogen fuel , he attracted a lot of attention .
Meyer died moments after raising a glass with his brother and two Belgian investors to celebrate the vehicle , and his last words were “ They poisoned me ” , giving way to conspiracy theories about people who fear the end of fossil fuels enough to commit murder .
Years later , in 2007 , it was discovered that the dune buggy had been kept safe all this time in the basement of a friend of Meyer ’s , who has since put it up for sale .
Water Powered Calculator
Next time you ’re lounging in the pool and suddenly find a need to do a few calculations , just whip out this baby and dunk it in .
When any liquid comes into contact with the fuel cells on the Water Powered Calculator , a chemical reaction between its zinc anode and cathode produces an electrical current that provides the calculator ’s power .
Best of all , just a little bit of water powers it for a month .
Nano - Tech Aqua Drop Puzzle
Who needs high technology when you can spend hours playing with water ?
The Nano - Tech Water Drop Puzzle is ultra water - resistant , allowing you to maneuver drops of water through the maze .
Water Powered Car
There ’s an intense debate about whether water - powered vehicles are really viable , but one Japanese company decided to prove the naysayers wrong .
Genepax , a water - fuel car developer , created a prototype car that travels at the speed of about 80 k for about an hour on just a liter of water .
The Genepax car differs from Stan Meyer ’s water - powered dune buggy in that it uses hydrogen electrons from water to make electricity , while the dune buggy had an on - board oxygen generator that fueled an internal combustion engine .
Mini Hydro Turbine Gadget Charger
The Mini Hydro Turbine , a concept design by Jin Woo Han , hooks up to your faucet to capture the “ free ” energy of your tap to spin a miniature generator that could theoretically provide enough power to charge an electric toothbrush or shaver .
It ’s eco-friendly as long as you do n’t turn the water on just to power it up .
Water Powered Cell Phone
Water - powered cell phones sound like something from the distant future , but they could be available as soon as 2010 .
Samsung has successfully developed a micro- fuel cell and hydrogen generator powered by nothing but water .
The water and metal in the phone react whenever it ’s turned on , producing hydrogen gas that reacts with hydrogen in the air to create power .
Each micro - fuel cell produces up to three watts of electricity , so it can power small phones for up to 10 hours .
Wash Your Electric Car and Power it , Too
Everybody needs to wash their car every now and then – but owners of electric vehicles would want to keep theirs immaculate if they owned a POWA Water Generator , which uses water power to produce electricity .
A small turbine is placed in between the hose pipe , and as water surges through the pipe , it turns the blades and generates electricity which can then be fed directly into an electric vehicle .
Toilet - Powered Turbine
A turbine powered by water pressure could turn your toilet into an electricity generator .
The Benkatine Turbine by Leviathan Energy can get power from any pipe that water rushes through , making it a great choice for shower drains and rain gutters as well ( particularly for those who try not to flush their toilets too often ) .
According to the company , the Benkatine Turbine is meant to be scalable so it can be applied in both municipal water and sewer systems as well as in smaller pipes .
Forty - two year old Isaac Davis has a romanticized view of his hometown , New York City , most specifically Manhattan , as channeled through the lead character in the first book he is writing , despite his own Manhattan - based life being more of a tragicomedy .
He has just quit his job as a hack writer for a bad television comedy , he , beyond the ten second rush of endorphins during the actual act of quitting , now regretting the decision , especially as he is n't sure he can live off his book writing career .
He is paying two alimonies , his second ex-wife , Jill Davis , a lesbian , who is writing her own tell - all book of their acrimonious split .
The one somewhat positive aspect of his life is that he is dating a young woman named Tracy , although she is only seventeen and still in high school .
Largely because of their differences a big part of which is due to their ages , he does not see a long term future with her .
His life has the potential to be even more tragicomical when he meets journalist Mary .

WARSAW ( Reuters ) - A Polish politician has criticized his local zoo for acquiring a “ gay ” elephant named Ninio who prefers male companions and will probably not procreate , local media reported Friday .
“ We did n’t pay 37 million zlotys ( $ 11 million ) for the largest elephant house in Europe to have a gay elephant live there , ” Michal Grzes , a conservative councilor in the city of Poznan in western Poland , was quoted as saying .
“ We were supposed to have a herd , but as Ninio prefers male friends over females how will he produce offspring ? ” said Grzes , who is from the right - wing opposition Law and Justice party .
The head of the Poznan zoo said 10 - year - old Ninio may be too young to decide whether he prefers males or females as elephants only reach sexual maturity at 14 .
The 2009 Honda Element is already the choice of pet -lovers because of its washable floor .
Now the Honda Element Dog Friendly Concept adds a cushioned bed , pet restraints , and other neat features for pampered pets .
If dog is man 's best friend , this Element concept may be a dog - owner 's co-best friend .
Ignoring the silly " dog friendly " exterior emblems and dog- pattern design , this little CUV actually has the bite to match its bark .
The rear has a cushioned pet bed , pet restraint systems , a rear ventilation fan , and a spill resistant bowl for long trips .
If you and your beagle are in the market for such a vehicle you 'll be excited to hear it goes on sale sometime this fall and should include most of these features .
If only it came with a bumper sticker proclaiming " my bitches ride in the back . "
Dog-friendly Honda Element Concept Transforms SUV into Pet- hauling Champ
04/08/2009 - TORRANCE , Calif . -
New dog-friendly transportation concepts designed for the Honda Element add canine - specific enhancements to one of the most dog- friendly vehicles available , American Honda Motor Co. , Inc. , announced today at the New York International Auto Show .
Developed specifically for the Element , the Dog Friendly ™ components demonstrate the potential for a dedicated pet restraint system designed to meet the needs of dog owners .
A finalized version of the Dog Friendly Element is scheduled to debut this fall .
Major components will likely include :
a cushioned pet bed in the cargo area with an elevated platform ;
second row and cargo area pet restraint systems ;
an extendable cargo area load - in ramp ;
a 12V DC rear ventilation fan ;
second - row seat covers with a dog pattern design ( matches the bed fabric ) ;
all - season rubber floor mats with a toy bone pattern ;
a spill - resistant water bowl ; and
Dog Friendly exterior emblems .
" In an interesting turn of events , cars are now chasing dogs , " said John Mendel , executive vice president of American Honda .
" Factory integration of a cushioned pet bed , restraint systems and other components are intended to transform the Element into the ultimate dog car . "
The Dog Friendly equipment , engineered specifically for the Element , is designed to accommodate the transportation of dogs in the second - row passenger seats or in the cargo area .
The restraint system concepts were designed and fabricated by Takata Corporation , one of the world 's leading automotive safety systems suppliers , exclusively for display on the Dog Friendly Honda Element concept vehicle .
The restraint concepts are intended to complement the potential of the vehicle 's existing restraint systems by helping to protect the dog and helping to prevent injuries to other vehicle occupants due to an unrestrained dog impacting them in a collision .
For convenience , a ramp is included to help dogs access the rear cargo area .
The ramp stores underneath the bed platform and can be conveniently accessed when the rear tailgate is down .
" In - vehicle pet restraints should be part of every dog owner 's safe travel practices , " said Wayne Pacelle , President and CEO of The Humane Society of the United States .
" The expanded availability of manufacturer - based restraints and features can help elevate pet comfort and convenience for owners .
Good ventilation and access to water on longer trips should also be primary concerns . "
The Element has long been recognized for its dog- friendly interior with an easy - to - clean urethane floor and expansive , flat cargo area ( up to 74.6 cu- ft. with rear seats removed ) , wide - opening side cargo doors , low lift - in height , and accommodating dimensions for tall items .
The consumer pet travel advice Web site , Dogcars.com , honored the 2007 Honda Element with its first - ever " Dog Car of the Year " award .
According to the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association , Inc. , 39 percent of all households own at least one dog with an estimated total U.S. dog population of 74.8 million .
All pet purchases and related products and services comprise an estimated total market value of more than $ 43 billion ( 2008 est . ) .
Substantially restyled for the 2009 model year and available with new features , the Honda Element builds on its spacious and versatile SUV character with a more chiseled exterior appearance and a refreshed interior design .
Three unique Element styles are available that range from the rugged and simple Element LX , to the more refined Element EX , to the sporty Element SC .
Powered by a 2.4 - liter i-VTEC ® 4 - cylinder engine , the Element is available with either a 5 - speed manual transmission ( standard ) or an available 5 - speed automatic transmission .
Available Real Time 4WD ™ can enhance all - weather traction .
The interior provides seating for up to four people along with a cargo area that adapts to large items with its flip - up rear seats that fold flat , fold up and to the side , or can be removed altogether ( 64 - plus seating arrangements ) .
The Element EX has a water resistant urethane - coated utility floor that wipes down for ease - of - cleaning and seat fabric that resists moisture .
For 2009 , all Elements incorporate significant exterior styling changes that include new front grille and bumper designs , restyled front fenders ( now metal , previously composite material ) , a new hood design , squared wheel arches , and new headlight and taillight configurations .
Interior enhancements include revised dashboard color combinations with titanium - look side linings , new fabric patterns , and enhanced switchgear designs and instrument panel meter graphics .
The Element EX exclusively adds a new convertible center console with a removable cooler / storage box .

Even if the “ moderate Islam ” conspiracy theorists were off base , it is true that ever since Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan came to power in 2003 , Washington has viewed Turkey as a simplistic duality : pious masses led by the Justice and Development Party against the small secular elite and the military .
As Americans banked on the government ’s electoral majority , they lost touch with the rest of the population .
No doubt President Obama was briefed , just as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was before she came here last month , to never speak of “ moderate Islam . ”
And he has n’t so far .
In fact , he has done the opposite .
The new American president  whose dark skin and Muslim middle name of Hussein have made him a folk hero here  went out of his way on Monday to acknowledge Turkey ’s plurality in all its colors , and telling Europe that in welcoming Turkey it would gain “ by diversity of ethnicity , tradition and faith . ”
Mr. Obama ’s visit to Ankara was a carefully calibrated series of messages and symbolic gestures that spoke to Turkey ’s different segments .
He met with the government leadership as well as opposition leaders from secular , nationalist and Kurdish parties .
He pledged to support “ Ataturk ’s vision of Turkey as a modern and prosperous democracy , " as he wrote in the guestbook at the mausoleum of the founder of secular Turkey .
In our eternal identity crisis , we Turks have lately been thinking only in opposites  that you are either secular or religious , Kurd or Turk , European or Middle Eastern .
It took a young foreign leader on his first visit here to remind us that we are all of those things , and much more .
It was n’t all roses , of course .
In his speech to Parliament , President Obama urged Ankara to face up to the mass killings of Armenians in 1915 , something most voters here object to .
To renew and reinvent our lives we need a plan .
Here it is : a seven - day process to work with over and over .
This plan incorporates physical , mental and spiritual work .
Use the whole seven - day process , or choose any one of the days to work with as you create the life you want .
DAY 1 : RE - CHARGE A Day of Commitment
Focus on changing your mind - set :
This is the day to change the thought patterns playing in your mind .
Get rid of phrases such as “ I can ’t . ”
“ Why does this happen to me ? ” “ Things always seem to go wrong . ”
“ After three bad things happen , life will change for the better . ”
Insert thoughts such as “ I can do it . ” ” There are creative solutions to any problem . ”
Create a visual logo that works for you : Imagine the ocean or the lake , water falls , butterflies , sunshine , moonshine — whatever works for you .
Note the image or images that work for you , and if you begin to feel negative , simply bring one of your positive images to mind .
Your image is your logo for positive energy .
Tools for Day 1 : Motivational books , music , dance , art , all that is inspirational .
DAY 2 : RE - VAMP A Day of Planning
What changes do you need to make in your home ?
What changes do you need to make in your office ?
What changes do you need to make in your exercise routine , OR do you need to begin an exercise routine ( with doctor ’s permission of course ) ?
What changes do you need to make in your diet ?
Tools for Day 2 : A notebook and pen , or computer .
DAY 3 : RE - CYCLE A Day of Throwing Out
Choose an area of your home , your garage , your backyard , and clean it out thoroughly .
Have three boxes set up : one for things to keep , one for things to repair , and one for things to give to others .
The hard work begins .
Do not tackle your whole house on this one - day .
This seven - day program can be repeated again , and each time you can choose a new area .
You can repeat Day 3 every week for six weeks .
Tools for Day 4 : Boxes to sort things in , vacuum cleaner , broom , dust rags , music to play to cheer yourself on through this hard day of work .
DAY 4 : RE- FRESH A Day of Refreshment
This is a day of reward .
If you cleaned out your office or home on day 3 , then refresh this space with a new plant or bunch of flowers .
Give yourself a present .
Open the windows and make sure the light can shine in .
Tools for Day 4 : A present for yourself .
DAY 5 : RE - TURN A Day of Spiritual Contemplation
This is a day to contemplate your spiritual values and re-turn to the values that are important to you .
This is a quiet day of soul searching .
In the past two days you have re-cycled some of your belongings and you have refreshed an area of your house or office : you did a lot of physical work .
You were involved with a lot of “ things . ”
Today , focus on the soul level .
Sit and connect with the God of your understanding and ask questions :
What is the meaning of my life ?
What am I here to do in this lifetime ?
What am I proud of and what advances have I made in my life ?
Which areas of my life need work ?
This is the day to take an honest look at the way you spend your time , the people you associate with , the worries that occupy you too much , the fears that you allow to control you , the anger you may have towards others .
Tools for Day 5 : An honest heart and an inquiring mind .
DAY 6 : RE-INVENT
A Day to Change Patterns
Yesterday was an assessment day .
It was a hard day .
Today is a day to make plans to change the parts of your life that need changing .
Do you have health problems you are not facing ?
Make an appointment with a health professional or get back to taking care of yourself in the way that you know is best for you .
Are you allowing the problems of others to dominate your life ?
If so this is a day to make plans to change your schedule .
If you are a caregiver , find creative ways to get time off .
And do not say , “ There is no way . ”
Find out what your community has to offer .
If the person you are taking care of does not want to receive care from others , then you must be strong and explain that you have to have time off .
If you spend all your time compassionately listening to others , remember that you will burn out if you do not have time for yourself .
We all know this , but we do not always allow time for ourselves .
Tools for Day 6 : A notebook , pen , computer , a telephone , appointment book .
DAY 7 : RE-INVEST A Investment Day in All That is Positive
While I hesitate to use the word “ re-invest ” during this financial crisis , it is time to think about how to best spend your money , how to best spend your time .
You have spent an entire week taking a look at your physical and spiritual life .
Today is the day to take a good look at your financial life as well .
Another coffee for five dollars may not be the best way to go .
A lot of takeout food costs money .
Are there ways to organize your cooking so that you do not pick up as much food ?
Tools for Day 7 : Your financial records , your checkbook , a willingness to make changes .
How do you renew your life ?

Hey , guys , thanks for stopping by our office .
We know you have a lot of work this morning , but would you mind stepping inside for a second ?
This wo n't take long .
Please , have a seat .
And close the door behind you .
Thanks .
Look , we know it 's been unusually warm weather outside and we 're happy you 're enjoying it .
But we 've heard from a few others that some of you have been showing in wildly inappropriate attire .
Take , for example , what happened at right .
Can you explain this ?
OK .
Fine .
Yes , it was hot out , but this kind of look at Dolores Park on a child 's swing set is not okay .
It 's just not .
And you know this .
While we 've reluctantly relaxed the dress code on teevas ( ugh ) , flip flops ( vomit ) , and crocs ( only you can stop foot rape ) due to the heat , sporting a g - string ( with an XY chromosome , no less ) is verboten .
From this point forward , we need you to not do this , OK ?
That , or take this kind of aesthetic to the other side of Valencia Street or the Playa where it belongs .
Let us know if none of this is clear to you .
Other than that , you all have been doing a bang - up job .
That 's all .
Gordon Brown came under fire both at home and abroad yesterday over the state of Britain 's finances .
On a visit to Poland , he had to listen to its Prime Minister pointedly criticise countries that tried to spend their way of recession .
And back in Britain Mr Brown was accused by Frank Field , a former Labour minister , of " irresponsible " mismanagement of the public finances after the Budget signalled record borrowing of £ 175 bn this year .
Mr Field warned that Britain was " sleepwalking into a mega- crisis " .
Amid scepticism over the Government 's economic strategy , The Independent has learned that the National Audit Office , the public spending watchdog , is to investigate the drive to save tens of billions of pounds in Whitehall costs .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Meanwhile , Labour was facing a potentially embarrassing revolt over its new legislation for Gurkha veterans , after it emerged that dozens of its own backbenchers could vote against the Government in a Commons motion that will be triggered today by the Liberal Democrats .
Standing alongside Mr Brown at a press conference in Warsaw yesterday , the Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said his policy of " strict supervision " of the banking sector and a refusal to live on credit had proved the best way of averting economic disaster .
Poland has managed to avoid the ravages of the credit crunch , enjoying 12 consecutive years of growth , while Britain 's national debt is set to double by 2013 .
Mr Tusk said : " The Polish government at a time of financial crisis behaved with full responsibility in terms of its public funds and the budget deficit .
The method we have taken in respect to the crisis is not to multiply public expenditure but to be responsible with public funds . "
Mr Tusk is not the first world leader to discomfort the Prime Minister over his stewardship of the economy .
Last month , the Chilean leader Michelle Bachelet said savings built up during the years of plenty had eased the impact of the recession in her country .
George Osborne , the shadow Chancellor , said the Prime Minister had been given a " lecture on prudence " by the Polish premier .
He added : " We are used to Polish builders telling us to fix the roof while the sun was shining , not the Polish Prime Minister as well . "
Mr Field joined forces with Vince Cable , the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman , to deliver a withering critique of last week 's Budget .
They forecast that the Government could be forced into " slash and burn " cuts to reduce the mountain of public debt .
The MPs said the Government had failed to set out a clear strategy for cutting the Budget deficit , protesting that it had delayed detailed plans on tax and spending until after the election expected next spring .
In a Commons motion yesterday , they warned of , " the real danger the country faces in borrowing relatively more than any other G8 country to balance the national accounts " .
They echoed warnings that ministers could be forced to axe major spending programmes beyond the efficiency savings already outlined in the Budget by Alistair Darling .
The Chancellor demanded further savings of £ 15 bn over the next two years when he announced his Budget last week , on top of a long - running efficiency drive which the Government claims has already saved £ 26bn .
But economists have warned that the savings can be very hard to achieve and measure .
Edward Leigh , the Tory chairman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee , has asked the National Audit Office to investigate cost - cutting .
The Independent disclosed yesterday that Cabinet ministers are privately questioning the future of the identity card scheme , while many Labour MPs believe the planned £ 25 bn replacement to Trident should be axed .
David Blunkett , the former home secretary , yesterday suggested the Government should scrap plans to introduce ID cards for British nationals and issue universal biometric passports instead .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
As researchers strive to increase the density and functionality of circuit elements onto computer chips , one newer option they have is a memory resistor ( or “ memristor ” ) , the fourth passive circuit element .
First predicted to exist in 1971 and fabricated in 2008 , memristors are two - terminal devices that change their resistance in response to the total amount of current flowing through them .
By dynamically changing the doping profile inside the memristive materials , scientists can control the current - voltage relationship of the device , thus controlling the “ memristance . ”
Since they do n’t lose their state when the electrical power is turned off , memristors also have nonvolatile memory .
However , memristors are passive elements , meaning they cannot introduce energy into a circuit .
In order to function , memristors need to be integrated into circuits that contain active elements , such as transistors , which can amplify or switch electronic signals .
A circuit containing both memristors and transistors could have the advantage of providing enhanced functionality with fewer components , in turn minimizing chip area and power consumption .
In a recent study , a team of researchers from Hewlett - Packard Laboratories in Palo Alto , California , have fabricated and demonstrated a hybrid memristor / transistor circuit for the first time .
The team demonstrated conditional programming of a nanomemristor by the hybrid circuit , showing that the same elements in a circuit can be configured to act as logic , signal routing , and memory .
By routing a logic operation ’s output signal back onto a memristor , the circuit could even reconfigure itself , opening the doors to a variety of self - programming circuits .
“ It actually takes at least a dozen transistors to mimic the electrical properties of a single memristor , ” Stan Williams of HP told PhysOrg.com .
“ Thus , for circuits that require some type of latching or other function performed by a memristor , it is at least conceivable for a designer to replace several active transistors with one passive memristor , which is much smaller than a single transistor .
This maintains the capability of the chip while decreasing the number of transistors , which saves both silicon area and power .
Thus , it may be possible to continue the equivalent of Moore 's law for a couple of generations not by making transistors smaller , but by replacing some subset of them with memristors . ”
The HP team ’s memristor design consisted of two sets of 21 parallel 40 - nm - wide wires crossing over each other to form a crossbar array , fabricated using nanoimprint lithography .
A 20 - nm - thick layer of the semiconductor titanium dioxide ( TiO2 ) was sandwiched between the horizontal and vertical nanowires , forming a memristor at the intersection of each wire pair .
An array of field effect transistors surrounded the memristor crossbar array , and the memristors and transistors were connected to each other through metal traces .
Then the researchers tested the device by performing a basic logic function ( AB + CD ) from four voltage inputs representing the four values .
The operations were performed on two different rows of the memristor crossbar , and the results were routed through the transistors , which amplified the signals and fed the corresponding signal back to the memristor crossbars for programming purposes .
In other words , the output signal from the simple logic function of the memristor circuits could be used to reprogram a memristor for a new operation .
“ Self - programming is a form of learning , ” Williams explained .
“ Thus , circuits with memristors may have the capacity to learn how to perform a task , rather than have to be programmed to do it . ”
As the researchers explained , the basis of the memristor is that the resistance of the device can be changed and be remembered , which is physically manifested by the movement of positively charged oxygen vacancies , which are dopants in a semiconducting TiO2 film .
A positive bias voltage can push the vacancies away from an electrode and increase the resistance , whereas a negative bias will attract the vacancies and decrease the resistance .
If left alone , the programmed state will remain as it is for at least one year .
The researchers hope that this prototype of a hybrid memristor / transistor circuit will lead to further integrations of memristors with conventional CMOS circuits .
In addition , the demonstration of a system that can alter its own programming could lead the way toward a variety of new architectures , such as adaptive synaptic circuits .

A Canadian surveillance project has discovered that 1,295 computers in 103 countries have been the victims of an international band of hackers .
If that is n't scary enough , there is now circumstantial evidence that suggests the Chinese government may have played a role .
The 53 - page report , submitted by the Information Warfare Monitor , a joint venture shared between the SecDev group of Ottawa and the University of Toronto , classified almost 30 percent of the infected machines as being of " high value " , namely the databases of international embassies , ministries of foreign affairs and other international organizations .
Among the embassies affected included those located in Cyprus , Germany and India .
Also targeted were the ministries of foreign affairs in Bangladesh , Iran , and the Philippines .
In addition , the international organizations ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations ) , SAARC ( South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation ) and an unclassified NATO computer were also the victims of similar attacks .
( Source : pcworld.com )
Social Malware : Cyber Weapon of Choice
The hackers are believed to have used social malware viruses .
This means that at one point , users logged onto the computers listed above were enticed to click onto an email attachment , link or URL under false pretences , and when doing so , exposed confidential information saved onto the hard drive .
The hackers then assumed control through a network called GhostNet , which uses a malicious software program called gh0st RAT ( Remote Access Tool ) to steal sensitive documents , control web cameras and take over the entire computer database .
The Information Warfare Monitor now has evidence proving that the servers collecting the data from these infected computers are located in China .
( Source : wsj.com )
Is the Chinese government involved ?
While it can be proven that the hackers are receiving their stolen information via Chinese servers , allegations of the Chinese government being in full support of these efforts is a bit more complicated .
The Government of China has been using the Internet since the 1990s to keep tabs on the military progress of other nations .
Many feel that over a decade later , very little has changed .
Still , others feel that calling out the Chinese government based on gut instincts is " wrong and misleading , " especially since the stolen information is not known to have contained anything of importance or value .
Branching in git is easier than you ’d think .
It ’s fast ( 40 characters written to a file ) , simple ( one command to create a branch ) , and efficient ( it does n’t create a whole copy of your current working state ) .
The branches you create do n’t have to exist in the remote repository , so you can use them to test out new features or bug fixes without breaking what ’s already working .
Perhaps Why Git is Better Than X puts it best :
Git will allow you to have multiple local branches that can be entirely independent of each other and the creation , merging and deletion of those lines of development take seconds . [… ]
Git makes this process incredibly easy and it changes the way most developers work when they learn it .
That ’s nice and all , but you may still be afraid to use branches just because of the stigmas associated with your previous ( or lack thereof ) version control system ’s way of handling this topic .
Worry no longer , we ’re going to go over a simple example of branching and merging , and resolving a conflict .
I ’m working once again with the jekyll repository .
I ’m going to check out a new branch , make some changes in a file , and then merge it back into the master branch .
$ git checkout - b fixes Switched to a new branch " fixes " $ vim lib / jekyll /core_ext.rb $ git commit - am " Adding cutoff method to String " Created commit 670e353 : Adding cutoff method to string 1 files changed , 15 insertions (+ ) , 1 deletions (-) $ git checkout master Switched to branch " master " $ git merge fixes Updating e53ac7a..670e353
Fast forward lib/ jekyll/core_ext.rb |
16 +++++++++++++++- 1 files changed , 15 insertions (+ ) , 1 deletions (-)
And that ’s it !
If we wanted to delete the branch , doing a git branch -d fixes would remove it .
Since it ’s so easy to create a branch and work on it separately , integrating this proces into your workflow can be quite beneficial .
For instance , Josh Susser has a great post about how he uses branches to work on user stories .
That ’s a really simple example of a fast - forward merge though , and is not always the case of what happens .
Let ’s go through a change I made on the same line of a file in both my master branch and a new branch and see how Git reacts :
$ vim lib / jekyll / core.rb $ git commit - am " Causing a merge on purpose " Created commit 8 aba87e : Causing a merge on purpose 1 files changed , 2 insertions (+ ) , 2 deletions (-) $ git checkout - b conflicts $ vim lib / jekyll / core.rb $ git commit - am " Changing cutoff default " Created commit 6041ddd : Changing cutoff default 1 files changed , 1 insertions (+ ) , 1 deletions (-) $ git checkout master Switched to branch " master " $ git merge conflicts Auto - merged lib / jekyll/core_ext.rb CONFLICT ( content ) : Merge conflict in lib / jekyll/core_ext.rb
Automatic merge failed ; fix conflicts and then commit the result .
Opening up the file will reveal that git shows us the difference in versions for this hunk of text :
If we do a git status it should still show our conflict .
Since we want to keep the one from my new version , simply delete the lines that Git plopped in there and the old version .
Then just add and commit the file as normal , and your merge is resolved !
$ git status #
On branch master # # Changed but not updated : # ( use " git add < file > ... " to update what will be committed ) # # unmerged : lib/ jekyll/core_ext.rb # $ vim lib / jekyll / core.rb $ git commit - am " Fixing conflict ! "
Created commit 9c8e9fd : Fixing conflict !
This creates a special commit that has two parent commits from each of the branches that we merged :
$ git show HEAD commit 9c8e9fd335381fe6a97708f7b3cd1d5acf670d2d Merge : 8 aba87e ... 6041ddd ...

We were starving and it was late , and we 'd just stepped off the train from Hiroshima .
We saw a line of people snaking around the corner from this restaurant and figured it was a quality place .
After about 45 minutes outside in the cold , we were finally seated , ordered a couple of rounds and ate some of the best sushi we 'd ever had in Japan .
I was looking through the pictures on my camera and said that it'd be fun to put the camera on the conveyor .
My girlfriend thought it was a great idea and asked the sushi chef if we could and he got really excited and told everybody to smile and wave , so I set it up there and let it go .
The result was fantastic and completely unexpected .
Unfortunately the camera 's memory stick filled up just before it circled back to us , but we got almost everything .
The style of restaurant is a " kaitenzushi " , which literally means revolving sushi , and the name of the place is Maguro - bito , which can be found in the Asakasa neighborhood of Tokyo , just around the corner from the Nakamise shopping arcade , a very popular and busy Japanese bazaar .
Enjoy !
Who does n't know the Type Tool ?
This is maybe one of the most powerful and useful tools of Photoshop .
We 've all used it at least once , but do you know all its potential ?
That 's why I decided to write a comprehensive guide about Photoshop 's Type tool , including do's and don'ts of the most important features of this tool .
1. The Basics
Type is the Photoshop tool to create vector outlines and mathematical shapes to define the symbols of a typeface .
It 's located on the standard Tool Bar as a tiny T .
The keyboard shortcut of this is the letter ( T ) , and if you hold click over that tool ( or Shift + T several times ) you 'll see four options : Horizontal Type , Vertical Type , Horizontal Type Mask and Vertical Type Mask .
Horizontal Type Tool :
This enables the tool to create horizontal standard text ( left to right and top to bottom ) .
Vertical Type Tool : Enables the tool to create vertical text ( top to bottom and right to left ) , useful to write in oriental languages like Japanese or Chinese , or if you want to experiment with typographic design .
Horizontal Type Mask Tool , Vertical Type Mask Tool : Creates a Quick mask using the Type shape as a Selection .
We 'll see more application of these modes shortly .
Once you 've select your desired Type Tool , you 'll notice the mouse cursor changes into the standard Type cursor , something like an I , this means the document is ready to put text on it .
2. Creating a Type Layer
There 's two ways to create a text layer , which are Point and Paragraph Type :
Point Type :
This option will create a Type layer into a single line , the break lines must be placed by you hitting Return or Enter in the keyboard .
To create a Point Type layer select your desired Type Tool ( Horizontal or Vertical text ) , and click one time with the cursor anywhere you want to put the text in .
Then just start writing , when you have finished to add the text you can either click the tiny Commit button on the Option bar , hit the Enter key on the numeric pad of your keyboard or just hit Command +
Enter .
Paragraph Type :
This option will create a Text layer with text wrapping into a bounding box .
Is pretty useful for both print and web design .
To add a Paragraph layer you must create the bounding box first .
You can Click and Drag the cursor diagonally until you 've got your desired size .
Does n't matter if there 's a background image , or any other object , the Type tool will create a new layer for the new text .
Besides , you can easily switch between Point to Paragraph type or vice versa by going to Layer > Type >
Convert to Paragraph Text / Convert to Point Text .
3. Resize and Transform
Obviously , you can resize and transform each text layer as any other , do it by using the Move Tool ( V ) , selecting the layer and Showing Transform controls .
Anyway this kind of transforming will stretch , enlarge , or badly distort the type shape .
If you really want a good result on a Paragraph Type layer , you must do the following : Select the Type tool , and click over the Paragraph text , then go to one of the transform handles and click and drag to resize the box , the text will automatically reflow inside the new box .
Shift - drag to preserve the proportion or keep a constant rotation increment , Command - drag to scale the type , Command - drag on a center handle to skew the type box , and Option - drag to resize the box from its center .
4. Character Options
Basic Formatting
It 's time to move forward .
After typing some text , you obviously want to change the font face , color and more , this is really simple .
First show the Character window by going to Window > Character .
The Character window has several Options to format characters , following there 're some examples about formatting Font Family , Style , Size and Color ( you must double - click on color sample to see the color picker ) .
After committing the type , you can either click on the text miniature in the Layers panel and change the entire text layer format or with the Type tool selected , click on the text layer you want to edit , make a selection and change the character format of the selected text .
Kerning and Tracking
You can easily customize both Kerning and Tracking in Photoshop .
Select a text layer or make a text selection and look in Character window for the Kern and Track values .
You 're able to customize the kern ( space between specific pairs of characters ) by selecting between Metrics Kerning or Optical Kerning .
Metrics will automate adjust kern using the included pairs of the font you 're using .
Optical will adjust the kern based on the font shape .
Besides you can customize the kern values by typing a numeric value ( positive or negative ) in the Kerning field or select one of the presets .
Tracking is very similar , just set a numeric value ( positive or negative ) to increase / reduce space between the letters .
Besides you can combine both Kern and Track to obtain a nice result .
Vertical and Horizontal Scaling
Scale the text layer both horizontally and vertically by changing the Scale values in the Character window .
Just as advice , I almost never use those scaling values because when you distort a typeface you 're distorting the shape itself , and sometimes creating an undesirable result , look at the image below , the nice Century Gothic 's ' O ' character is a perfect circle without scaling it , and it turns into an oval when you change the scaling values .
Besides notice the shapes are n't regular , i.e. the line width is wider at top and bottom of the ' O ' character when you change the vertical scaling .
Baseline Shift
This is very useful when you want to make your text layer fit somewhere , such as around an image .
Change this value to move the baseline of a text selection above or below the baseline of the rest of the text layer .
Faux Bold and Faux Italic
Photoshop has the option to auto create a Faux Bold and Italic variation for any typeface , pretty useful sometimes , but you must take special care in order to distort the type shape as little as possible .
Below there are examples of Faux Bold on the Arial typeface , which is n't distorting the type shape that much , but applying Faux Italic on Myriad Pro actually distorts the original italic style of the typeface ( look at the ' a ' character for example ) .
Font Variants and Text Decoration
You can easily customize the font variant , Capitalizing all the characters , or convert it to Small Caps .
To do so , just select a text layer , or make a text selection , and click on the respective button in the Character Window .
Besides , you can edit the text decoration as Underline or Strikethrough .
Anti-aliasing , Where and When
Anti-aliasing produces smooth - edged text making the text borders blend into the background layer / image .
There 're four anti-aliasing options : Sharp , Crisp , Strong and Smooth , and obviously the option None .
Often , you must apply some anti-aliasing to every text layer in your design for easily reading in particular into Serif typefaces .
There 're some exceptions when you should set None as anti-aliasing value , i.e. when you 're adding sample text for web design content , when using a pixel typeface , etc .
Leading
Either in both Point or Paragraph text layer you can adjust the leading ( vertical space ) between lines .
Leave it as an automatic value by selecting ( auto ) for the Leading value , or type a custom value to adjust the space by yourself .
5. Paragraph Options
Basic Alignment
Since a Paragraph Text Layer can contain multiple lines , formatting them is very important for the quality of any design , that 's what the Paragraph window is about .
Open it by going to Window > Paragraph .
Create a paragraph text layer , type something , commit the text and click on the layer miniature to activate the options for the entire text .
Alternatively , you can make a text selection by using the Type tool , and apply paragraph formatting only into the selected lines of your text layer .
Of course , the basic feature on Paragraph text is Align .
You can easily customize the alignment ( Left , Center , Right or Justify ) by clicking on the icons in the Paragraph window , besides there are three more options for Justify Alignment , changing the alignment of the last line of the text layer or the selected text ( Left , Center , Right ) .
To customize the Justify alignment , go to the Paragraph palette menu and click on Justification , there you 'll be able to configure Word and Letter Spacing , Glyph Scaling and Auto Leading percentages .
Hyphenation
The settings you choose for hyphenation affects the horizontal spacing of the paragraph , making it wider or stretching it , depending on the words of each line .
To apply hyphenation into a Paragraph Text Layer , just choose the language in the Character Window , and activate Hyphenation in the Paragraph window .
To disable Hyphenation , just uncheck the option box in the Paragraph window .
Most of time the automatic Hyphenation will work just fine for you , but sometimes you 'll need to customize it .
To enable advanced Hyphenation options click on the Paragraph panel menu and select Hyphenation .
You 'll see the following options :
Words Longer Than # Letters : set the minimum number of characters for your hyphenated words ; i.e. if you set a value of 5 , the word ' photo ' will be not hyphenate , but if you set the value ' 3 ' you 'll get ' pho - to . '
The default value is ' 2 . '
After First # Letters and Before Last # Letters : specifies the minimum number of characters at the beginning or end of a word that can be broken by a hyphen , i.e. if you set any of those values as ' 1 ' you could have an undesirable hyphenation , such as " h- ello " or " actio-n . "
By default both values are set as ' 2 . '
Hyphen Limit : set the maximum number of consecutive lines on which hyphenation may occur .
Hyphenation Zone : set a distance from the right edge of a paragraph .
Hyphenate Capitalized Words : prevents hyphenation of capitalized words .
Indent and Space Between Paragraphs
Indenting is quite easy .
Just select a text layer , or make a text selection , and write or slice both left or right Indent values .
You can indent a text selection left or right , or indent the first line of a Paragraph as shown in the second image below .
Besides , you can easily add space between paragraphs ( before or after ) in the Paragraph window , just type a custom value in the Space Before or the Space After paragraph .
Warp Text
One of the most powerful features of the Type Tool is the capability to Warp any text layer according to your particular needs .
To Warp a type layer double - click on the Text Layer Miniature and click over the Create Warped Text button in the Options Menu .
You 'll be prompted to select a Warp Style orientation ( Vertical or Horizontal ) , then you 'll have three sliders to increase or decrease the values of Bend , Horizontal and Vertical Distortion .
Below is a single example of how to warp Point text by using Arc Warp and different values of Bend and Distortion .
Of course you can Warp a Paragraph Text Layer as well , see the image below .
It shows a simple way to get the famous " Star Wars " intro effect just by increasing the Vertical Distortion and with the help of a small Gradient Layer Mask .
Warping text is really funny , try it with different warp options .
There 're a few restrictions though , you cannot Warp a Text Layer if you applied previously Faux Bold , or Faux Italic styles in the Character panel .
Type on a Path
You can create a type layer that flows along a work path created by using the Pen Tool or Vector Shape Tool .
To create a Type on a path , first draw a path by using the Pen Tool , then select the Type Tool and place the cursor anywhere on the path , you 'll see the shape of the cursor changes the baseline for an S shaped line .
Click on the path and write some text .
Path on a Shape
The process to add a text layer on a vector shape is the same .
First , ensure the vector shapes is selected , do this by using the Path Selection Tool to select the shape .
Once the path is visible , select the Type Tool and click anywhere over the path and write something .
You can edit any Character option , a good example is increasing the Baseline Shift a little bit to create a space between text and shape .
Edit Type on a Path
Sometimes you 'll need to change the orientation and position of the type on a path .
For this , select the Path Selection Tool , place the cursor over the text until you get a little black arrow on the type cursor , then Drag the cursor below the baseline to flip the type .
Use the same method to flip the text and place it inside a shape .
Obviously , you can add any layer style to the text layer and this will continue being editable .
Convert Type into Shape
Several times we 'll need to be able to change or modify the shape of a character , for several purposes , like logo design , Photoshop makes this easy .
Just create a text layer or select one and go to Layer > Type >
Convert to Shape .
This tool will convert the type into a Vector Layer Mask , which can be edited as any other vector shape .
You can also create a Work path by going to Layer > Type > Convert Work Path .
Type Mask Tool
Finally , you can do most of the described features of the type tool , but using Selections instead type shapes .
For this click and hold on the Type Tool until more options appears .
There select Horizontal ( or Vertical ) Type Mask .
By selecting this tool you 'll be able to create a quick selection with the shape , which is pretty useful on either Layer Mask or Quick Mask mode .
Below is a small example of a word written using the Type Mask Tool .
I used that selection to create a Layer Mask over a picture .
6. Conclusion
Type tool is one of the most powerful features of Photoshop .
With practice you 'll become a master after playing with characters and paragraphs .
There are no limits of what you can create with this wonderful tool .

Some things are just too good to be true .
Former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich might be dumped into a Costa Rican jungle as part of a reality TV show called , " I 'm a celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! "
The impeached ex-governor appeared in a Chicago courthouse today and pleaded not guilty to 16 charges of criminal corruption including racketeering conspiracy and wire fraud .
During the proceedings , he asked if he could travel if his bond was increased .
CBS2 in Chicago is reporting that the possibility of appearing on the reality show is why he asked the question .
Too far fetched ?
NBC released a statement confirming their interest in Blago .
" Based on the hit U.K. reality show , " I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here ! " is a groundbreaking live series event premiering June 1 and stripped over four weeks in June .
Ten celebrities of various backgrounds will be dropped into the heart of the Costa Rican jungle to face challenges designed to test their skills in adapting to the wilderness and to raise money for their favorite charities .
Rod Blagojevich will be a participant on the show pending the court 's approval .
The Associated Press reports that an attorney close to his legal defense says ...
Blagojevich wants permission to leave the country to appear on [ the reality show ] .
It gets better .
WGN reports that figure skater Nancy Kerrigan could be one of his opponents .
Wow .

Walter Gibson is a university freshman going through a dry spell .

Das BKA lügt .
Das wird jetzt niemanden besonders überraschen .
Ein paar pikante Details sind heute von den Anwältinnen im mg - Verfahren ans Tageslicht geholt worden .
Hintergrund : die militante gruppe ( mg ) hat nicht nur selber reichlich und lange Texte geschrieben , sondern auch dazu aufgefordert , sich an einer sog .
‚ Militanzdebatte ‘ zu beteiligen .
AutorInnen namens „ Die zwei von der Muppetshow “ beteiligten sich daran .
Auf die Frage , ob er wisse , wer das sei , verneinte der heute in Moabit vernommene Zeuge Damm vom BKA .
Offenbar waren aber in die Akten der AnwältInnen ein paar Sachen geraten , die das BKA eigentlich für sich behalten wollte : u.a. der Vermerk
Nur für die Handakte : Der
Text wurde vom BKA verfasst und an die Interim versandt , um eine Reaktion bei der „ militante gruppe ( mg ) “ zu provozieren und gleichzeitig auf die Homepage des BKA ( Homepageüberwachung ) hinzuweisen .
Als ihm das präsentiert wurde , musste er dann zugeben , dass er doch wusste , von wem der war .
Und auch noch ein anderer Text .
Damit kann ja dann wohl festgestellt werden , dass
das BKA lügt das BKA Akten fälscht das BKA noch schrecklichere
Texe schreibt als bisher bekannt der BKA - Honeypot eine noch größere Sauerei war als bisher angenommen
Update : Im Prozessbericht steht , dass die AnwältInnen beantragt haben , 1 . die Aussage des Zeugen ins Protokoll aufzunehmen und 2 . seine Akte beschlagnahmen zu lassen .
Um herauszufinden , was das BKA noch so für sich behalten wollte .
Überraschung .
Richter Hoch hat beides abgelehnt .
Update 2 : Die Geschichte macht die Runde .
Für Heise haben sich welche Mühe gemacht , zu recherchieren und haben noch ein paar hübsche Kleinigkeiten zu Tage gefördert :
Die gesamte Aktion des BKA erbrachte offenbar keine Erkentnisse zur Struktur der militanten gruppe .
Nach dem Muppetshow - Kommentar wurden 417 IP - Adressen ermittelt .
Zum Gros dieser IP - Adressen konnten keine Nutzerdaten ermittelt werden , weil die Provider seinerzeit die Daten zu kurz speicherten .
Weitere Daten gehörten Behörden und Presseorganen .
Nur die deutsche Telekom konnte für 120 IP - Adressen Nutzerdaten vorlegen , die im aktuellen Verfahren keine Rolle spielen .
Die Presseerklärung der AnwältInnen :
BKA - Zeuge lügt -­ Bundeskriminalamt manipuliert Akten Pressemitteilung der Verteidigung im „ mg “ - Verfahren Am heutigen Tag wurde die Vernehmung des BKA - Zeugen Oliver Damm vor dem Kammergericht fortgesetzt .
Auf ausdrückliche Fragen der Verteidigung nach der Urheberschaft eines veröffentlichten Diskussionsbeitrages zu militanten Aktionen erklärte der Zeuge Damm nicht zu wissen , wer den Text verfasst hat obwohl der Text von Mitarbeitern des Bundeskriminalamtes stammt .
Erst nachdem ihm sein eigener Vermerk , der dem Gericht allerdings nicht vorliegt und aus dem sich die Urheberschaft des BKA ergibt , vorgelegt wurde , gab er zu , dass dieser
Text vom BKA stammt und dass es daneben noch einen weiteren Beitrag des BKA in der so genannten Militanzdebatte* gab .
Seit dem 25.09.2009 wird unseren Mandanten vom 1 .
Senat des Kammergerichts der Prozess wegen Mitgliedschaft in einer kriminellen Vereinigung gemacht , mittlerweile also seit einem halben Jahr .
Bereits vor Beginn der Hauptverhandlung hat die Verteidigung gerügt , dass die Akten unvollständig sind und die Bundesanwaltschaft ( BAW ) sowohl der Verteidigung als auch dem Gericht eine Vielzahl von Akten vorenthält .
Unter anderem wurden fehlende Sachstandsberichte vom Ermittlungsführer KHK Damm vom BKA bemängelt .
Diese waren nach Aktenvermerken nicht zu den Akten gelangt , weil sie angeblich „ zu umfangreich “ seien .
Am 19.02.2009 ­ vor der vom Gericht geplanten Vernehmung des Zeugen Damm ­ beantragte die Verteidigung erneut Einsicht in diese Sachstandsberichte .
Diese wurden kurze Zeit später der Verteidigung zur Verfügung gestellt .
Diese Aktenbestandteile wurden vor der Übergabe an die Verteidigung offensichtlich vom BKA nur unzureichend kontrolliert .
Denn aus dem BKA - Sachstandsbericht vom 07.06.2006 ergibt sich nun , dass das BKA im Rahmen der sog .
„ Militanzdebatte “ * unter ausgedachtem Namen selbst heimlich daran teilgenommen hat .
Es findet sich im Anhang 4 , wo jeder Beitrag der Militanzdebatte aufgeführt ist , hinsichtlich eines Textes aus der Interim 611 vom 10.02.2005 , der unter dem Namen „ Die zwei aus der Muppetshow “ veröffentlicht wurde , folgender Hinweis : „ Nur für die Handakte : Der Text wurde vom BKA verfasst und an die Interim versandt , um eine Reaktion bei der „ militante gruppe ( mg ) “ zu provozieren und gleichzeitig auf die Homepage des BKA ( Homepageüberwachung ) hinzuweisen . “
Dieser Anhang 4 findet sich ­ bis auf obigen Satz ­ identisch in jedem anderen Sachstandsbericht .
Die anderen Berichte sind also offensichtlich gesäubert worden oder es wurden von vornherein verschiedene Versionen produziert .
Der BKA - Zeuge Damm hat in seiner bisherigen Vernehmung vor dem Gericht diesen
Text als einen allgemeinen Beitrag bezeichnet und kommentiert .
Er hat entgegen seiner Wahrheitspflicht bewusst verschwiegen , dass das BKA dieses Schreiben selbst verfasst hat .
Die sog .
Homepageüberwachung wurde mittlerweile vom Bundesinnenministerium als illegal eingestuft und das BKA angewiesen , diese Methode nicht mehr anzuwenden ( vgl. Der SPIEGEL von dieser Woche ) .
Das BKA manipuliert die Akten und enthält sowohl dem Gericht als auch der Verteidigung Entscheidendes vor .
Beim BKA und eventuell bei der BAW werden parallele Geheimakten ( „ Handakte “ ) geführt , welche offensichtlich brisant sind .
Spätestens jetzt kann der Prozess gegen unsere Mandanten nicht mehr als faires Verfahren bezeichnet werden .
Als Konsequenz muss er eingestellt werden .
Der BKA - Text befindet sich im Anhang .

Anlage : BKA - Text aus der Interim 611 vom 10.02.2005 , Seite 11

In a light - filled classroom in Sherman Oaks , gregarious teacher Jenna Zucker dons a straw hat and , in an exaggerated Southern drawl , invites the gathered first - and second - graders to an imaginary picnic .
The children , taking part in an after - school program at Kester Avenue Elementary , must tell Zucker what they plan to bring ; she will then decide if they can join her .
Alex wants to bring apples ; he gets the nod .
But Athena and her offer of brownies are turned down , as are Samantha and her macaroni and cheese .
Elijah suggests eels and Matthew melons ; both are accepted .
The students soon realize they must bring something that starts with the first letter of their name .
Zucker , 28 , tells them that once they figured out the rules of the game , the reward was “ greater satisfaction . ”
“ What does greater satisfaction bring ? ” she asks .
Matthew replies : “ Spiritual power ! ”
Advertisement
Zucker asks him where the power comes from ?
“ Your inner light , ” the boy answers .
And where is that light found ?
“ In your heart , ” he says .
The exchange is part of “ Spirituality for Kids , ” a class offered in several Los Angeles public elementary schools during the day or after school .
Created by a leader of the Los Angeles - based Kabbalah Centre International , a spiritual and educational organization , the program is promoted as a nondenominational effort to teach children to make wise choices .
But it is drawing fire from parents and others who say it is illegally bringing religion into public schools under the guise of ethics training .
Advertisement
“ I think it breaches the separation between church and state , ” said Margie Mulder , a guidance counselor at Utah Street and Noble Avenue elementary schools .
“ I would n’t send my children to the group . ”
But others say it provides children with essential skills .
“ ‘ Spirituality for Kids ’ is not religious , ” said Karen Timko , who is in charge of elementary counselors for the Los Angeles Unified School District and has included the group in a resource fair for counselors .
“ It ’s tools for navigating your life . ”
Timko noted that school programs run by better - known faith - linked organizations , such as the YMCA , have not met with similar controversy .
Advertisement
The spirituality program was created in 2001 by Karen Berg , who leads the Los Angeles kabbalah center with her husband , Rabbi Philip Berg .
Kabbalah is an ancient form of Jewish mysticism , but critics of the Berg center say it departs from many traditional practices .
The center ’s website says it offers a nonreligious “ way of creating a better life , ” and that if students work to become more sharing , caring and tolerant , they will experience previously unknown fulfillment .
The center has a deep roster of celebrity adherents , including Madonna and Ashton Kutcher .
The program is offered in schools and community centers around the globe , from New York and Florida to Mexico and Malawi .
Since 2006 , nearly 4,400 Los Angeles children have taken part .
Its use in London schools has generated controversy .
The Spirituality for Kids Foundation , which runs the program , listed nearly $ 18 million in assets on IRS disclosure forms for 2007 , the most recent available .
Celebrity kabbalah devotees , including Madonna , are among its funders .

Public school students cannot legally be subject to proselytizing , although religious groups are allowed to sponsor school programming as long as it does not favor one faith .
But programs linked to groups outside the mainstream often come under scrutiny .
Others that have drawn fire include “ study technology , ” a learning method created by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard , and Transcendental Meditation offered by the David Lynch Foundation .
This year , Spirituality for Kids has been offered at nine local elementary schools and three community sites .
Children are taught that their actions cause reactions , and to allow their inner “ light ” to shine by overcoming an internal “ opponent ” who urges them to make bad decisions .
The word “ kabbalah ” was not mentioned in the Kester class , but its presence seemed unmistakable .
Zucker and a facilitator wore red knotted strings -- frequently used by kabbalah practitioners to ward off the evil eye -- around their left wrists .
They also used terms -- such as “ light ” and “ the opponent ” -- that are found throughout the L.A. center ’s website and its IRS filings .
Officials with the spirituality program say such words are common to many faiths .

“ ‘ Inner light ’ is a universal term , ” spokeswoman Esther Weinberg wrote in an e-mailed response to questions .
“ If you look it up , you ’ll see it is used by Christianity , Islam , Judaism , Buddhism , Oprah , Eckhart Tolle , Deepak Chopra , many yoga practitioners , and it actually originated with the Quakers . ”
Karen
Berg said she does n’t use the term “ inner light ” in her teachings , but said it may be used at the kabbalah center .
“ There are clearly some similarities between the vernacular we of the Kabbalah Centre use and SFK , ” she wrote in an e-mail .
“ That is because both organizations strive for simple , universal language that makes sense to everyone , including children . ”
At Beachy Avenue Elementary , Principal Alan Lewis said the program ’s easy - to - grasp message is one reason he supports it .
He said he saw improvements in children ’s behavior after it was used there last year .

Principal Priscilla Currie of 109th Street Elementary agreed .
“ When they come into the office , we talk about the good guy and the opponent , ” she said .
When “ they make the wrong choice , they [ say ] , ‘ I should have listened to the good guy . ’ ”
A 2008 Rand Corp. study funded by $ 80,000 from the spirituality program found that it improved children ’s social and study skills , leadership and communications , and helped with behavioral problems .
But others are skeptical , including Orthodox Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein , an adjunct chair in Jewish law and ethics at Loyola Law School , who does n’t believe the program belongs in public schools .
He said that as the nation has grown more diverse and religion has been removed from the public square , there is a yearning for moral teaching .
But he said the program ’s founders offer more hype than substance .
“ Whenever there is a hunger , there is a danger that hucksters will feed the hunger with phony food , ” he said .
Advertisement
The program was discontinued at Stoner Avenue Elementary in Culver City .
When asked why , Principal Pamela Williams said the school lacked funding .
Reminded that the class was free , she declined to comment further and hung up .
When officials at Wonderland Avenue Elementary tried to expand the class into its magnet program this year , some parents were incensed .
“ I think they ’re trying to spread [ kabbalah ] without using the word , ” said Carolyn McKnight , whose daughter is in fifth grade at the school .
Another mother , who asked that her name not be used because she works in Hollywood and fears repercussions and because her daughter remains at Wonderland , said she met with school and Spirituality for Kids officials .
It did not assuage her doubts .
Advertisement
“ It was really teaching a belief system as opposed to teaching situational ethics or ethics in general , ” she said .
“ It was a way of approaching life , which I just did n’t feel was appropriate for a public school . ”
Donald Wilson , who said the program was approved before he became Wonderland ’s principal last year , was concerned about it but changed his mind after he read the curriculum and sat in on the class .
Wilson said he saw no evidence the program was religious and found it pedagogically sound .
“ They are more than sound , they ’re engaging , ” he said .
“ The lessons are lessons that parents want their kids to have . ”
Wilson and other principals said they allowed the program only after notifying and meeting with parents .
Still , some Wonderland parents -- including several conservative Christians -- remained opposed , so Wilson did not expand the program to their children ’s classrooms .
He plans to have district staff review it before allowing it next year .
Meanwhile , at Kester Avenue Elementary , Zucker was marking the final session of the 10 - week program .
She presented each student with a certificate marking completion of Level One , “ The Game of Life , ” and handed out cookies and red lollipops imprinted with “ SFK . ”

As the children streamed out of the room , Zucker handed each a card with the suggested spiritual exercise for the week : “ Find a friend with whom you would like to share the Rules of the Game of Life .
Invite them to SFK . ”

What is moral attention , you might ask ?
Moral attention is recognizing that the broken windows theory is real : if people seeing others getting away with breaking the rules , they ’re more likely to break the rules .
Therefore , tolerate no actions which are destructive to the collective or the non-deviant individual .
( You can do both at the same time ; this places you out of the left , which only protects the individual , and the extremists who only protect the collective . )
Here ’s someone who spotted this condition in the microcosm offered by web communities :
It was once a well - kept garden of intelligent discussion , where knowledgeable and interested folk came , attracted by the high quality of speech they saw ongoing .
But into this garden comes a fool , and the level of discussion drops a little – or more than a little , if the fool is very prolific in their posting .
( It is worse if the fool is just articulate enough that the former inhabitants of the garden feel obliged to respond , and correct misapprehensions – for then the fool dominates conversations . )
So the garden is tainted now , and it is less fun to play in ; the old inhabitants , already invested there , will stay , but they are that much less likely to attract new blood .
Or if there are new members , their quality also has gone down .
Then another fool joins , and the two fools begin talking to each other , and at that point some of the old members , those with the highest standards and the best opportunities elsewhere , leave … { snip }
But when the fools begin their invasion , some communities think themselves too good to use their banhammer for – gasp !
– censorship .
After all – anyone acculturated by academia knows that censorship is a very grave sin… in their walled gardens where it costs thousands and thousands of dollars to enter , and students fear their professors ’ grading , and heaven forbid the janitors should speak up in the middle of a colloquium .
It is easy to be naive about the evils of censorship when you already live in a carefully kept garden .
Just like it is easy to be naive about the universal virtue of unconditional nonviolent pacifism , when your country already has armed soldiers on the borders , and your city already has police .
It costs you nothing to be righteous , so long as the police stay on their jobs .
{ snip }
And after all – who will be the censor ?
Who can possibly be trusted with such power ?
Quite a lot of people , probably , in any well - kept garden .
But if the garden is even a little divided within itself – if there are factions – if there are people who hang out in the community despite not much trusting the moderator or whoever could potentially wield the banhammer – { snip } Maybe I understand on a gut level that the opposite of censorship is not academia but 4 chan ( which probably still has mechanisms to prevent spam ) .
Maybe because I grew up in that wide open space where the freedom that mattered was the freedom to choose a well - kept garden that you liked and that liked you , as if you actually could find a country with good laws .
{ snip } I confess , for a while I did n’t even understand why communities had such trouble defending themselves – I thought it was pure naivete .
It did n’t occur to me that it was an egalitarian instinct to prevent chieftains from getting too much power .
“ None of us are bigger than one another , all of us are men and can fight ; I am going to get my arrows ” , was the saying in one hunter - gatherer tribe whose name I forget .
( Because among humans , unlike chimpanzees , weapons are an equalizer – the tribal chieftain seems to be an invention of agriculture , when people ca n’t just walk away any more . )
Less Wrong
Plato would agree , but he ’d point out that it ’s not just agricultural societies : any civilization imposes a collectivist obligation .
You ca n’t just walk away .
You ca n’t just do it your way , and take your toys and go home , like libertarians or anarchists .
Instead , you need to stand your ground and separate the smart from the fools , and either censor the fools or removing them , but either way , keep them from lowering the standard of your community , because they will , and soon your community will be only populated by people too silly to see they are selfish and destructive .
Common sense observations of someone who survived through discipline and careful perception :
“ I ’m not sure if it ’s good to have freedom or not , ” Chan said .
“ I ’m really confused now .
If you ’re too free , you ’re like the way Hong Kong is now .
It ’s very chaotic .
Taiwan is also chaotic . ”
Chan added : “ I ’m gradually beginning to feel that we Chinese need to be controlled .
If we ’re not being controlled , we ’ll just do what we want . ”
Chan said the problem with Chinese youth is that “ they like other people ’s things .
They do n’t like their own things . ”
Young people need to spend more time developing their own style , he added .
Excite
He ’s not talking about just the Chinese , but the human species as a whole .
If we are given no constraints , we do what is selfish , and then disorder occurs .
With too much constraint , we rebel .
I suggest another form of society : the cooperative where we do n’t overrate each other ’s egos through polite conversation , but clearly view where we each stand and what our abilities are .
That way it ’s no surprise when a king ’s a king and a peasant is a peasant , even if he pretends to be a king on the internet .
We need direction .
What we do n’t need are calcified power structures that no longer provide that direction .

I have finally released the first version of BiteScript , my little DSL for generating JVM bytecode .
Install it as a gem with " gem install bitescript " .
BiteScript grew out of my work on Duby .
I did not want to call directly into a Java bytecode API like ASM , so I wrapped it with a nice Ruby - like layer .
I also wanted the option of having blocks of bytecode look like raw assembly , but also callable as an API .
Currently only two projects I know of make use of BiteScript : Duby and the upcoming Ruby - to - Java " compiler2 " in JRuby , which will also be released as a gem .
For a longer example , you can look at tool / compiler2.rb in JRuby , lib / duby / jvm/ jvm_compiler.rb in Duby , or an example implementation of Fibonacci in BiteScript I 'm open to suggestions for how to improve the API , and I 'd also like to add the missing Java 5 features .
The better BiteScript works , the better Duby and " compiler2 " will work .
Did Apple Just Fire 1,600 Retail Workers ?
Nope .
Question of the day : Did Apple somehow lay off 10 percent of its retail staff in the last quarter without anyone noticing until today ?
Answer : No .
My bloggy brethren are hopped up about Apple ’s disclosure , via its most recent quarterly filing with the SEC , that its retail group had “ approximately 14,000 full - time equivalent employees ” at the end of March .
Three months earlier , that number had been 15,600 .
But let ’s be clear :
Those are n’t 14,000 , or 15,600 , employees .
Those are 14,000 , or 15,600 full - time equivalents –basically , an accounting term that measures the number of man-hours Apple ( AAPL ) is paying for , not the number of men ( or women ) it employs .
So the very strong likelihood here is that Apple cut a lot of workers ’ hours , but not workers themselves .
I asked Apple officials for a definitive statement on this , but they referred me back to their 10 - Q .
Still , there ’s no denying that sales have slowed at Apple ’s 252 retail stores .
Just ask CFO Peter Oppenheimer , who said this week that average revenue per store in the last quarter was $ 5.9 million , down from $ 7.1 million a year earlier , and that margins for the retail unit had shrunk accordingly .
From the company ’s earnings call , via Seeking Alpha :
“ We believe that the year - over - year decline in average store sales and segment margin is a reflection of the continued weakness in the spending environment , coupled with third party channel expansions relative to the year - ago quarter . ”
So the cutbacks make sense , as did the fact that the company only opened one store in the last quarter .
It says it still intends to open 25 this year .
That ’s down from 50 a year ago , though that disparity may be a bit deceiving since Apple opened 17 stores in September –the last month of its 2008 fiscal quarter .
Had a few of those opened a week later , the numbers would have evened out a bit .

Core77 is proud to be a sponsor of a new competition aimed squarely at E - waste .
Valiant Technology in association with the Per Scholas , Core 77 , Metropolis Magazine , and The Architect 's Newspaper has just launched " Design The 4th BIN " a competition aimed at designing the next generation E - waste logo and an E - waste BIN for New York City .
The winning logo is to be released as a public domain / creative commons design , to be as familiar as the " mobius strip " on every paper and plastic recycling bin .
The winning bin is intended as inspiration for the next generation of E - waste collection system in New York City , to help building owners , businesses and residences comply with the new laws going into effect in 2010 restricting the disposal of electronic waste .
In 2005 the U.S. generated over two million tons of electronic waste ; 250,000 tons from New York City alone .
That figure is projected to double in the decade to come .
These obsolete or broken electronics are typically just dumped in with regular trash , though most of this E - waste contains toxic components that leech into the soil and poison the groundwater .
Although our collective " green " conscience has certainly evolved , our infrastructure has not .
We need a place to safely and easily deposit our E - waste : The 4th Bin .
In response to this clear need , and to coincide with the upcoming changes to New York City 's law 's regarding E - waste , Valiant Technology is calling for entries in an international competition .
Your aim : to design a logo to represent E - waste recycling and a bin to collect it for proper disposal or recovery .

I have just spent the last four and a half minutes , brow furrowed , teeth gritted , watching the entirety of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak ’s first appearance on Dancing with the Stars , which we reported on last month .
How was it ?
In a word : MY EYES .
Now , some of you will nitpick and say “ Hey , that ’s two words . ”
To you I say “ MY $ # %^! EYES . ”
Let me offer you a few more choice words : Pink .
Feathered .
Boa .
I do n’t know if I can go any further than that without some serious counseling .
And that 's nice compared to the recaps from Television Without Pity and Entertainment Weekly .
If you think this is all too harsh , then brace yourself , because you have n’t heard the judges yet .
Woz ended up scoring at the bottom of the pack with a 13 out of a possible 30 .
To be fair , Woz was a good sport about it , even attempting to crack a joke about … drug - testing ?
Really ?
( Honestly though , it beat out the most awkward joke of the night , a misplaced one - liner about Safari by host Tom Bergeron — whatsamatter , Tom , producers nix your shot about getting Xcode to cross compile ? )
For your safety , we 've tucked the video after the jump .
You 've been warned .

Let ’s go to the video t—oh god :
Fortunately for Steve , his fate does not rest entirely in the hands of the professionals , as the American public also factors in the elimination decisions that start next week .
Woz ’s geek following is likely to mobilize a fair number of people , and that could save Steve and his partner from having to depart the show in disgrace .
Wait .
Does that mean I have to watch another five minutes of him dancing ?
How about we mobilize the Internet to get me a raise ?
Visiting aliens may be the stuff of legend , but if a scientific team working at the National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) is right , we may be able to find extraterrestrial life even before it leaves its home planet -- by looking for left - ( or right - ) handed light .
The technique the team has developed * for detecting life elsewhere in the universe will not spot aliens directly .
Rather , it could allow spaceborne instruments to see a telltale sign that life may have influenced a landscape : a preponderance of molecules that have a certain " chirality , " or handedness .
A right - handed molecule has the same composition as its left - handed cousin , but their chemical behavior differs .
Because many substances critical to life favor a particular handedness , Thom Germer and his colleagues think chirality might reveal life 's presence at great distances , and have built a device to detect it .
" You do n't want to limit yourself to looking for specific materials like oxygen that Earth creatures use , because that makes assumptions about what life is , " says Germer , a physicist at NIST .
" But amino acids , sugars , DNA - - each of these substances is either right - or left - handed in every living thing . "
Many molecules not associated with life exhibit handedness as well .
But when organisms reproduce , their offspring possess chiral molecules that have the same handedness as those in their parents ' bodies .
As life spreads , the team theorizes , the landscape will eventually have a large amount of molecules that favor one handedness .
" If the surface had just a collection of random chiral molecules , half would go left , half right , " Germer says .
" But life 's self - assembly means they all would go one way .
It 's hard to imagine a planet 's surface exhibiting handedness without the presence of self assembly , which is an essential component of life . "
Because chiral molecules reflect light in a way that indicates their handedness , the research team built a device to shine light on plant leaves and bacteria , and then detect the polarized reflections from the organisms ' chlorophyll from a short distance away .
The device detected chirality from both sources .
The team intends to improve its detector so it can look at pond surfaces and then landscape - sized regions on Earth .
Provided the team continues to get good results , Germer says , they will propose that it be built into a large telescope or mounted on a space probe .
" We need to be sure we get a signal from our own planet before we can look at others , " he says .
" But what 's neat about the concept is that it is sensitive to something that comes from the process behind organic self - assembly , but not necessarily life as we know it . "

In a bid to conquer the web bit - by - bit , The Pirate Bay has launched a new feature to allow it to penetrate the social networking site Facebook .
With only a single click Facebook users can add their favorite torrents to their profile to share them with friends .
The IFPI is not pleased with the new feature , while FaceBook declined to comment .
With the recent trial out of the way , it seems The Pirate Bay team have had more time for development of the site .
Just last week they announced the addition of personal RSS feeds .
This week we revealed that they will also offer a new IPRED - busting VPN service .
That ’s not all though , the team has recently rolled out a new feature which is almost guaranteed to spark controversy .
Visitors to a torrent details page on the site – such as this random Ubuntu torrent – will notice the addition of a brand new button labeled ‘ Share on Facebook ’ .
Users clicking this button will be taken to the Facebook where the torrent will be added to the user ’s profile .
Anyone browsing the user ’s profile page can simply click on the torrent and provided a torrent client is installed , download begins straightaway with no need to visit the Pirate Bay site .
The entertainment industries are obviously not amused by this new feature .
A representative from the IFPI told the Swiss newspaper 20 Minuten that offering links to torrents that point to copyright works is illegal in Switzerland , while referring to the ShareReactor case .
Increasingly , social networking sites such as Facebook are used to share files with users linking to BitTorrent sites or file - hosters such as Rapidshare and Megaupload .
Anti-piracy outfits see this as a new threat and request the site ’s operators to remove the links .
Two weeks ago the Brazilian recording industry took action and managed to pressure the moderators of one of the largest groups on Google ’s social network Orkut to shut down their group .
But , when the 921,000 member group was closed , new ones soon took its place and the sharing continued .
Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde says that they have n’t seen any complaints regarding the new feature .
“ As far as I know , no rights - holders have complained to us yet , ” while noting that any complaints they do receive get deleted immediately .
When asked if The Pirate Bay had permission from FaceBook to implement the new feature , Sunde said they did n’t feel the need to ask .
“ They monitoring their protal every day – they should have noticed it long ago , ” he added .
Facebook declined to comment on the issue .
BASEL , Switzerland -- Farasi , a hippopotamus calf born Nov. 6 , is 220 pounds of chunky , doe - eyed star power .
The Basel Zoo's biggest attraction , he is so popular he was named " Swiss of the Year " for 2008 , beating out tennis star Roger Federer .
But this zoo is not big enough for two male hippos , even if they are father and son .
And in Europe , a homeless hippo is a dead hippo .
American zoos believe in birth control or sexual abstinence for their animal populations .
But Europe 's 4,000 zoos take a more continental approach to reproductive rights : Animals should be free to do what comes naturally .
The result is a surplus of offspring .
And if zookeepers can't find a home for the babies , zoos typically kill them .
Some carcasses are used for research .
Meatier cuts -- and Farasi surely qualifies -- are thrown to the lions .
That harsh reality has shocked the famously peace - loving Swiss .
Amid the joy of Farasi 's birth , zoo spokeswoman Tanja Dietrich said he'd be put up for adoption .
Or else ?
Zoo policy , she said , is to " put down excess animals and feed them to carnivores . "
Switzerland 's popular commuter tabloids pounced like caged cats , with headlines like " Little Farasi is going to die ! " and " Help !
Who will rescue me ? "
To : Alan Kay
From : The Program Committee
Subject : FAIL
Dear Dr. Kay ,
The program committee thanks you for the submission of your paper “ Object Orientation : A New Paradigm of Programming ” .
Unfortunately your paper has been rejected .
We had many fine submissions this year , but as you know we must accept no more than 15 % of submissions to be considered a premier conference .
The reviewers ’ comments are attached below .
Reviewer 1 comments :
You propose three new language features : encapsulation , polymorphism , and inheritance .
Even though your paper was the maximum 12 pages , it discussed each of these concepts only informally , and did not do any rigorous evaluation .
The general rule is that evaluation should comprise 75 % of the paper , leaving 3 pages to explain your ideas .
To do proper Computer Science , you must evaluate new ideas incrementally .
I recommend you write three separate papers each evaluating the addition of one of these features to Fortran and doing detailed case studies of the result .
In the future , please avoid excessive novelty .
Reviewer 1 evaluation : FAIL
Reviewer 2 comments :
You claim that object orientation is in some sense more “ natural ”  and “ intuitive ”  than procedural programming , but offer only anecdotes and hand - picked examples as justification .
To do proper Computer Science , such claims must be empirically evaluated .
I suggest you do user studies on experienced Fortran and Cobol programmers , measuring how well they can write scientific and accounting programs in your new language compared to existing languages .
I strongly suspect you will get negative results , because such professional programmers will find your ideas not at all natural , but in fact quite different from the proven techniques of programming they have mastered .
I will not even bother to criticize the claim of having invented a new paradigm , for I can think of no experiment to falsify that statement , rendering it scientifically meaningless .
Reviewer 2 evaluation : FAIL
Reviewer 3 comments :
You propose to add layers of overhead on every subroutine call , and worse , to dynamically allocate working storage .
Yet you offer no controlled performance benchmarks to show that you can compete with proven technology .
Memory and CPU are scarce resources , and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future .
In my opinion , the performance of the language features you propose could only become competitive after 20 years of further research .
Such long time horizons are out of the question , both for those in industry as well as those on a tenure track .
Proper Computer Science demonstrates immediate quantifiable benefits .
Reviewer 3 evaluation : FAIL
Reviewer 4 comments :
The paper shows an ignorance of important related work .
For example , there is extensive prior research on inheritance in Legal Software .
Also , polymorphism  reminds me of polynomials , the topic of my dissertation , which was n’t cited .
When I summarized your paper in 5 minutes to the committee members who had n’t read it , one of them said it sounded just like what Joe Blow did in the 80’s , so it appears your work is neither novel nor properly researched .
To do proper Computer Science you must demonstrate knowledge of the research literature and show how your work is a contribution in addition to it , even if it only seems vaguely similar after reading the paper ’s title .

What we know about stardust continues to get more granular , thanks to increasingly sophisticated nano - analysis of interstellar particles .
Using particles collected by NASA aircraft after the Earth passed through a comet's wake , researchers found grains of dust from the nebula out of which our solar system formed .
“ We found an extraordinary wealth of primitive chemical " fingerprints " , including abundant pre-solar grains , true stardust ... associated with extremely pristine organic matter that must pre-date the formation of our planets , ” said Henner Busemann of the University of Manchester , who presented the results Tuesday at the European Week of Astronomy and Space Science .
The grains of dust are considered samples of our solar system 's building blocks , almost like time capsules of what our neighborhood was like before the sun and planets formed four - and - a - half billion years ago .
Scientists try to find the primitive materials on comets — as in the Stardust mission — but that 's difficult and expensive .
In this case , Busemann 's team got NASA to fly a high - altitude plane at just the time when the Earth was passing through the 26P / Grigg - Skjellerup comet .

Tackling the problem of spam is a problem in communication .
If spam is noise as against wanted communications , then the spam problem is a signal to noise filtering problem .
Unwanted emails , especially broadcast spam emails , consume about 80 % of currently available bandwidth .
We need to filter out the 80 % noise so as to increase the efficiency of the web in distributing the 20 % of traffic that is the wanted signal .
In using the internet we find spam in various forms .
The most widely known is the spam email .
Less widely known is comment spam .
Comment spam takes many forms .
Usually , a comment is made on a blog or forum which appears to be innocuous , something on the lines of " Nice article . " or " I agree . "
The primary hallmark of comment spam is that it contains one or more links to commercial websites .
The secondary hallmark of comment spam is that it is most frequently ' content free ' , i.e. it adds nothing to the discussion .
A favourite tactic of the comment spammer is to place a url in the spammer 's profile .
Frequently , a site moderator will delete the comment but leave the profile .
A small piece of code in a comment or spam email , and to some extent the spammer 's url is used by spammers as a beacon .
The persistence of the beacon code is used by ' spammer kings ' as a measure of the economic costs of placing further comment spam on that particular web site .
It is not generally realised that spam filters operate on a mail server or on a user 's computer only after the spam emails have been dispatched .
In order to reach the filter , the spam must first travel over the backbone of the web .
The fact that a well - protected individual user receives little spam should not be taken as in any way related to the network bandwidth consumed by global spam .
If we use the term ' webspam ' to refer to all of the variants of spam , then it is easy to determine that at least 80 % of bandwidth is used by spam .
One of the methods used by spammers is the faking of the source of the spam .
Most email users do not know how to analyse email headers to determine the real source .
Indeed , most email reader programs do not show the full header .
Whilst individual users may have reason to use email encryption , most users communicate using plain ASCII or HTML script .
Such messages are easily faked .
I propose an automated encryption scheme whereby security of communication is combined with source verification in such a way as to counter the source faking and scatter - gun methods used by spammers .
It is traditional in cryptology to use the names Alice , Bob and Carol .
These are merely more readable substitutes for the letters A , B and C .
The use of these names should not be taken as implying that a particular encryption method requires human intervention , or even communication .
When ' Alice ' communicates with ' Bob ' , these may be computer programs which are hand - shaking in a communications network such as the internet .
The basis of all encryption is the need to ensure that Alice and Bob can communicate secretly and that it is computationally infeasible for Carol , an eavesdropper , to either read a secret message or insert a fake message .
This could have a real - world application in spam filtering : Alice and Bob can reject any unauthorised message by proving a lack of authentic origin .
If a method could be found by which every ' Alice ' on the web could use such a blocking filter , the effective bandwidth of the web could be increased .
Ordinary encryption of a message can be modelled as placing a message in a locked box .
If Alice locks a message in a box , and Bob has a key to that padlock , then they can communicate secretly .
It should also be obvious if the box has been tampered with by Carol .
The chances of Carol creating a fake box which is locked with an identical padlock are remote .
The problem is , how does Bob get the key ?
If Alice wants to broadcast a message , then she has to send out a lot of keys by a secure means .
This adds costs , and there is always a risk of key interception .
That is a fundamental problem in cryptology : the key distribution problem .
How do you prevent Carol from getting hold of the key and copying it ?
One method is to have a padlock which can be secured by snapping it shut , but only unlocked with a single , private key .
Alice makes these locks publicly available , but keeps the key private .
In effect , one may think of the padlock as being locked by a public key and unlocked by a private key .
The inherent problem with a public key - private key model is that the fact that one component is public gives a means of attack .
Analysis of the public component is a step towards determination of the private component .
Carol has a lever with which to crack the box open .
Mathematical public - private key methods rely on the use of large prime numbers .
The security of the method relies on the computational infeasibility of determining the exact numbers used , that is , even using the fastest computers , cracking the code takes ridiculous amounts of time .
However , an attack remains computationally infeasible only for so long as there exists no known method for the fast determination of prime numbers .
If a new discovery were made in prime number theory , many encryption schemes would be immediately rendered insecure .
In order to remove the need for a public key , Alice and Bob could use a box with a locking mechanism which can accomodate more than one padlock .
Alice locks a message in a box and send it to Bob , who adds his padlock and returns the box .
Alice removes her padlock and sends the box once more to Bob .
Bob can now unlock the box and read the message .
Carol cannot access the contents of the box .
If Carol creates a fake message and sends it to Alice , Alice will add a lock and send the box ' back ' to Bob .
Bob sees a box with two locks , neither of which he can open , so he determines that the message is fake .
The problem with real encryption has been that encryption is a LIFO problem .
However many times a message is encrypted , the last encryption put on must be the first encryption taken off .
A mathematical solution to the multiple padlock problem must allow for the encryption layers to be taken off in at least reverse order .
This is the commutative encryption problem .
An ideal solution would allow for encryptions to be removed in any order .
The message to be encrypted is arranged in an array of N dimensions .
This might be visualised as a page , a folio , a book , a set of volumes , a shelf , a library etc .
For each dimension , a communicator can create a completely private key and use it to add an encryption scheme which does not affect the other dimensions .
In the case of two communicators , Alice and Bob , Alice could encrypt all odd dimensions whilst Bob could encrypt all even dimensions .
It may be seen that shuffling pages in a book does not affect the page contents , and shuffling of page contents does not affect page sequence .
In this dimensional transpositionally encrypted model , there are two advantages : no key is exchanged , and the network location of each transmitter is verified during exchanges .
Suppose that Carol sends a message with a faked header to Bob .
Bob will be recrypt the message and send it to Alice , the purported original sender .
Since Alice has no record of the message , she determines the message to be fake , she destroys it and sends a message to Bob so that Bob can destroy his unwanted key .
This demonstration uses a message formatted in two dimensions , as it might appear on a sheet of paper .
The encryption scheme used for demonstration is roughly character , or byte sized .
In practice , the message would first be padded and compressed so as to disguise its inherent structure .
It would then be encrypted using variable size slices .
The method is demonstrated using a sheet of paper which has been coloured to help keep track of the rows and columns .
The scrambling has been minimised for clarity .
In a real application , more than two dimensions would be used .
The message is first scrambled in the x dimension by Alice .
In practice , the key would be an array of slice widths with their original locations .
The key contains no data from the message and is entirely private .
Bob keeps a copy of the x-scrambled message and sends a y - scrambled copy to Alice .
Again , the private key is an array of slice widths with original locations .
Alice descrambles the x dimension and returns a copy which is now scrambled only in the y dimension .
Bob descrambles the y dimension and retrieves the original message .
In practice the message could be any data .
It is padded as needed and then compressed .
The padding data is chosen so that the message + padding when converted to binary gives equal counts of 1s and 0s .
The compression algorithm is chosen so as to make the transmitted data appear more randomly distributed before the encryption scheme is applied .
By creating a different key for each odd dimension , Alice can multiply encrypt the outgoing message in a method that is as computationally secure as a one - time pad .
Similar considerations apply to Bob 's multiple encryption in the even dimensions .
Each applied encryption is done using a key generated at the time of use and destroyed after being used for decryption .
In effect , the data is encrypted using a one time pad for each dimension of encryption .
It is important to note that the communicators must not encrypt any single dimension twice .
It is only by encrypting separate dimensions through transposition of ' strips ' that the method is independent of encryption sequence .
Such a method could be used in an email communications sytem .
Because of the need for the communications programs to handshake , it is necessary for an email sender to provide a genuine return address .
Although the system as described needs three passes to send one message , that message might contain a secret one - time pad for a batch of follow - up messages .
This would reduce the bandwidth overhead .
It must be remembered that currently 80 % of network bandwidth is used by spam .
By blocking spam , even if every single message were to be sent three times , there would be a net freeing up of bandwidth .
I have chosen to make this theoretical model of a commutative encryption scheme public in order to stimulate research into commutative encryption and to make the model available for real world testing and possible implementation as open source code .

The Pentagon 's senior military leaders worry that the security situation is stalemated or deteriorating .
Preparing for years in Afghanistan
The Pentagon ’s senior military leaders are worried that the security situation in Afghanistan is stalemated or deteriorating , and now are preparing a far - reaching plan that would prepare the U.S. military for a war that could last three to five more years , officials said .
The effort , which is being coordinated by the Joint Staff and is still in its early stages , is designed to create an experienced cadre of officers and senior enlisted soldiers , who would rotate between assignments in Afghanistan and at their home stations until the end of hostilities .

By doing so , the Pentagon hopes to end a problem that has plagued the effort in Afghanistan — the lack of familiarity with local conditions by U.S. forces who rotate in and then depart after a year , just when they are beginning to understand the area or the mission where they are assigned .
“ These would be small groups who would deploy together for shorter periods , going back and forth to the same place and the same mission again and again , so they would know the culture and the terrain , ” said a senior Pentagon official briefed on the plan , who said the teams could be asked to conduct training or other specialized counterinsurgency missions .
Until now , officers involved say , the Afghanistan war has been a secondary concern for the Pentagon , which has tended to view it as a short - term mission that took a back seat to the war in Iraq .
“ This is about finding an alternative scheme that allows us to provide continuity in Afghanistan without burning people out , ” said the senior military official .
The plan envisions adding hundreds of personnel to the effort – on top of the 21,000 additional troops that President Barack Obama has ordered to Afghanistan .
But the Joint Staff ideas may conflict to some degree with Obama ’s timetable .
He has seemed reluctant about getting involved in a long - term effort in Afghanistan , though he not yet to made explicit his own timetable for the war .
In announcing his strategy last month , he made clear his desire for turning over the lead combat role as quickly as possible to Afghan Army and police units .
When the plan was briefed to military services and combatant commands earlier this month , senior Joint Staff officers bluntly declared that the security situation across Afghanistan is “ poor , stalemated , or deteriorating , ” according to an official who was present .
They also warned that the military ought to prepare for the conflict to last another three to five years .
That message — that winning in Afghanistan will require a long - term commitment — was intentionally blunt and meant to make clear to the hidebound Pentagon that changes in the way it has conducted the war will be required , officers involved said .
The idea of using shorter tours and returning to the same places repeatedly has been used for years by Marines and Special Forces units operated in Iraq .
But the Joint Staff plan would clash with longstanding practices in the Army and other services , disrupting promotion schedules and normal deployment practices .
In the Army , for example , most officers do a tour in a combat unit , and then are reassigned to a new unit in an entirely different job .
The Joint staff plan would change those practices , at least for the officers and enlisted soldiers chosen as members of these new teams .
One of the issues still to be resolved is how to restructure promotion system so that top - flight officers would not worry their careers could suffer if they spend multiple years in the same assignment , officials said .
“ If we do n’t do this , it will show we ’re still not serious , ” about the war in Afghanistan , said a Pentagon official briefed on the plan .
The architect of the new approach is General Stan McCrystal , who commanded the Special Forces effort in Iraq and now is the head of the Joint Staff , officials said .
The concept is also supported by Admiral Mike Mullen , the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs ,
Mullen returned recently from a trip to the region in which he heard repeated complaints that U.S. officers assigned to the war finish their tours and rotate out just as they are finally becoming familiar enough with Afghanistan to be truly effective .
One of the factors driving the Pentagon to step up its effort is concern that public support for the war both in the U.S. and Europe could wane , forcing a withdrawal before the security situation has stabilized , officials said .
Obama has also called for greater civilian effort in Afghanistan , but the Pentagon , with its massive resources , is in some ways in a better position to expand its effort than the State Departtment and other civilian agencies .
This article tagged under : Foreign Policy
Just to continue on the theme of No. 10 petitions that came up on the other thread , the Government has now published an official response to this one .
As you can see , the original petition called for :
“ the Prime Minister to take urgent action to end the postcode lottery in violence against women support services , such as Rape Crisis Centres , to stem the tide of closures and ensure all women have access to these vital services .
Every year , 3 million women in the UK are victims of gender - based violence .
Specialised services are essential to support these women , yet provision is patchy and in some places there are no services at all .
Map of Gaps , an End Violence Against Women and Equality and Human Rights Commission report , highlights that : – A third of local authorities in the UK have no specialised support services – Most women in the UK have no access to a Rape Crisis Centre – Less than one in ten local authorities have specialist services for ethnic minority women
We call on the government to take a more strategic approach to ending all forms of violence against women , including a commitment to long - term funding of specialised violence against women services . ”
And the response ?
More blah about the amount the Government has invested in Sexual Assault Referral Centres aka SARCs , which we can all acknowledge is a good thing , but which is also most definitely not the same as investing in Rape Crisis centres .
SARCs only help women in the immediate aftermath of a rape or sexual assault , whereas Rape Crisis provides “ a service to women with historic experiences of sexual violence , many of them victims of childhood sexual abuse .
Sixty one per cent of Rape Crisis clients have been raped or sexually assaulted three or more years prior to accessing their services . ”
And while we ’re on the subject of the postcode lottery in violence against women support services , I would just point out yet again that there is still no SARC in the East of England .
So if you ’re unfortunate enough to be the victim of a sexual assault in Norfolk , Suffolk etc , then what ?
Luckily we ’ve still got some Rape Crisis Centres here , but for how much longer ?
Cambridge Rape Crisis for instance , “ can currently only afford to open two hours a week . ”
It ’s absolutely fucking shameful .
But back to the response .
The Government also says that it acknowledges :
“ that rape crisis centres and other support services continue to face significant challenges , and we are working closely with them to identify what more can be done to assist in increasing their capacity and stability .
A stakeholder working group ( which includes members of Rape Crisis ) has been set up to look specifically at this issue , and will report to Ministers shortly .
We have already implemented some of their earlier recommendations .
In addition , the Minister for Women , Harriet Harman , announced in March 2008 a special fund of £ 1 million to assist rape crisis centres at risk of closure .
This money has now been distributed .
The Government has also ensured that grant awards to rape crisis centres for 2007 / 8 were renewed in 2008 / 9 . ”
Let ’s hope the grant awards are bigger than the £ 683 Cambs RC received after applying for a grant of £ 11,000 !
“ In relation to taking a more strategic approach to ending violence against women , the Government has already developed a number of linked national action plans on a variety of issues .
These include rape and other forms of sexual violence , domestic violence , prostitution and human trafficking .
Each of these areas of work identifies a number of joined - up work streams that are being pursued across Government departments .
The Government is committed to ensuring that women and girls are not subject to any form of violence , and it is currently taking a fresh look at our work in this area specifically through the prism of gender .
We are developing a cross-government consultation on violence against women .
Further information on this will be made available shortly . ”
Action plans , work streams and consultations are welcome , and hopefully something good will eventually come out of them , but all this takes time .
In the meantime , while all this bureaucratic yackety yackety yack is going on , Rape Crisis Centres up and down the country are once again in serious danger of going under .
They do n’t have time to wait for the outcome of yet more policy meetings , yet more working groups , and yet more ministerial bumbling around , they need funding , and they need that funding now .
And not just short - term emergency funding , but funding that ’s long - term and that enables them not only to cope with their current workloads , but which enables them to plan ahead , secure in the knowledge that they ’ll be there for years to come to help future victims of these heinous crimes .
So come on Harriet et al , time to put your money where your mouth is .
Do n’t just talk about your commitment to violence against women services , do something about it : before even more Rape Crisis centres are forced to close , and before even more Rape Crisis workers are forced to remortgage their homes to pay for your neglect .
Investment trumps environmental regulation
A little more than four years after we started a debate about the future of environmentalism , President Obama has largely ended it .
In his State of the Union address , Obama called for the most far - reaching program ever proposed by an American president to remake America 's energy economy - with hardly a mention of the environment .
In our 2004 essay , " The Death of Environmentalism , " we argued that global warming was an unprecedented ecological challenge that would lead to the death of environmentalism .
What we meant was that the environmental movement , as America had known it for the better part of four decades , would be forced to reconsider the central role that environmental protection and nature preservation played in its politics and policy proposals .
Reaction from many environmentalists was swift and harsh .
Yet , today , environmental organizations have largely relegated images of polar bears and melting ice flows to the back pages of their magazines .
Green jobs and clean energy investment are the eco-ideas of the moment .
This new post - environmental politics is only beginning to reveal itself and , like any revolution , will continue to advance in fits and starts .
Along with the rhetorical shift that has already occurred , there is an important policy shift that is just beginning to take shape .
Just a year or two ago , most advocates for climate change action viewed carbon caps and carbon trading as the central front in the effort to reduce emissions .
And while green groups and President Obama are still overly reliant on these strategies , there is a growing acknowledgement that carbon regulations and carbon pricing alone will not be sufficient to achieve the goal of deep reductions in global carbon emissions .
This consensus has emerged as evidence has mounted that similar policies have failed to either reduce carbon emissions or create a thriving clean energy economy in the European Union .
Today a growing number of energy scientists , economists and even environmentalists have recognized that only enormous public investments in research , development and deployment of clean energy technologies ( several times larger than the $ 15 billion in annual investments that President Obama has proposed ) will bring us the cheap and scalable clean energy technologies that we need .
Such an approach will not be cheap .
The best estimates of how much the United States needs to spend annually on research , development and deployment of clean energy technologies in order to drive down their costs so they are a cost - effective alternative to fossil - fuel based energy is somewhere between $ 50 billion and $ 80 billion .
It was never realistic to have expected pollution regulations and carbon taxes to drive a global energy modernization project of the scale necessary to transform the global energy economy .
We did not invent the personal computer by placing a " market - based cap " on typewriters nor create the Internet by taxing telegraphs and fax machines .
To the contrary , government investment was largely responsible for bringing these revolutionary technologies , and a raft of others , into our lives .
This included not only funding research and development at universities and national laboratories but also directly procuring and deploying cutting - edge technologies that were not yet ready for broad commercialization .
In the coming years , as recognition of the failure of carbon regulation and pricing to make much progress toward reducing global carbon emissions becomes ever more apparent , advocates for climate action , including environmentalists , will increasingly embrace a technology - and - investment centered framework .
For as surely as the politics of climate and energy has forced environmentalists to abandon their nature - based rhetoric , the economic and technological challenges inherent to the climate crisis will ultimately force them to abandon their pollution - focused remedies .
Let us hope that President Obama is quick to recognize this reality and moves quickly to make a commitment to invest in our clean energy future commensurate with the scale of the transformation we must make .
FriendFeed 's founders left Google to create a social media platform .
If Google wants to rule social search , it might want to bring them back
Google wants to organise all the world 's information .
That 's the official line , at least , but what it really wants to do is organise all the world 's information and stick ads on it .
It 's the king of web search and search advertising , but what about the other things we do online ?
If Google went shopping , these are the six sites and services they should choose to help make it even more powerful .
1. StumbleUpon
Back in 2007 , eBay bought StumbleUpon for around $ 75 million .
By the end of 2008 it was rumoured to be looking for a buyer , possibly because hits are down considerably , but more likely because it did n't have a clue what to do with it .
It 's still an important site , though : at the time of writing it has 7.2 million members telling one another about interesting stuff they 've found online .
In many respects it 's the anti-Google : where Google helps you find what you 're looking for , StumbleUpon finds things that you did n't know you were looking for .
It also offers a different kind of advertising .
StumbleUpon knows not just what you 're looking at , but what interests , amuses or delights you - and that means it can offer advertisers something a bit more interesting than plain old AdWords .
Lots of user data , targeted advertising : we 're amazed Google has n't snapped it up already .
2. Twitter
Google 's search spiders are amazing things , but they can't do what Twitter Search does : let you see in real time what six million people are saying .
Bringing Twitter into the fold could work in two ways : as a search tool in its own right , and as a way to refine web results based on ' trending ' - that is , up and coming - topics people are chatting about .
For Twitter users , Google could offer better reliability : while Google Mail has been up and down a bit over the last few months , you 're still much more likely to see the Twitter Fail Whale than have problems with a Google site .
Twitter might be open to an approach : negotiations with Facebook for a $ 500 m sale fell apart not because Twitter did n't like the amount being offered , but because the deal included Facebook stock that the social network was apparently valuing far too highly .
According to Business
Week , the offer was $ 100 m in cash and the rest in shares , but Twitter wanted the Facebook shares to be based on their real market value , not Facebook 's own valuation .
Facebook did n't like that idea and the deal collapsed .
3. Valve
Everyone thought Google was buying Valve Software in September , but it did n't happen .
That does n't mean it should n't , though .
As we argued at the time , " There 's still room for an iTunes of gaming , one giant that defines an entire up - and - coming industry , and everyone 's going to want to be it .
Valve and its Steam service have both the content and credibility to become it , and Google is one of very few companies that could theoretically scoop up this notoriously independent firm . "
The rationale still stands : Google would make money from every game sold , could rent servers to clans , could sell anonymised usage data to publishers and it could sell in - game ads , too .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. Representative Barney Frank , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , said on Sunday the government needs to determine if millions in employee bonuses at American International Group Inc can be recovered .
“ We need to find out whether these bonuses are legally recoverable , ” Frank , a Democrat , told the “ Fox News Sunday ” program , adding that the timing of the company ’s commitment to make the awards to its employees was important .
Embattled insurer AIG , which has received three government bailouts totaling $ 180 billion , had promised to pay about $ 1 billion in retention bonuses over a period of several years , half of which has already been paid .
AIG Chairman Edward Liddy said in a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner that the firm was legally obligated to make already - committed 2008 employee - retention payments , the value of which were set early last year before problems at the Financial Products unit became public .
About half of the $ 1 billion was due to be paid to staff of AIG ’s main insurance businesses and the rest to employees of the largely unregulated AIG Financial Products .
AIG Financial Products was the unit that made bad bets on toxic mortgages and credit default swap contracts that led to the company ’s near collapse .
According to company documents obtained by Reuters on Saturday , the financial products unit is obligated to pay $ 220 million in employee retention payments for 2008 , $ 55 million of which were paid in December and $ 165 million required to be paid by Sunday .
Liddy said in the letter the company agreed to revamp its system for paying bonuses after the Obama administration objected to the payouts .
Installing KVM Guests
With virt - install On Ubuntu 8.10 Server
Version 1.0
Author : Falko Timme
Unlike virt - manager , virt - install is a command line tool that allows you to create KVM guests on a headless server .
You may ask yourself : " But I can use vmbuilder to do this , why do I need virt - install ? "
The difference between virt - install and vmbuilder is that vmbuilder is for creating Ubuntu - based guests , whereas virt - install lets you install all kinds of operating systems ( e.g. Linux , Windows , Solaris , FreeBSD , OpenBSD ) and distributions in a guest , just like virt - manager .
This article shows how you can use it on an Ubuntu 8.10 KVM server .
I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you !
1 Preliminary Note
I 'm assuming that KVM is already installed ( e.g. as shown here : Virtualization With KVM On Ubuntu 8.10 ) .
My KVM host has the IP address 192.168.0.100 .
I will show how to install a CentOS 5.2 guest in this tutorial .
We also need an Ubuntu 8.10 desktop so that we can connect to the graphical console of our KVM guests .
It does n't matter if the desktop is installed on the Ubuntu 8.10 KVM server or on a remote system .
2 Installing virt - install
Open a terminal and install virt - install :
sudo apt - get install python - virtinst
3 Installing virt - viewer Or virt - manager On Your Ubuntu 8.10 Desktop
We need a means of connecting to the graphical console of our guests - we can use virt - viewer or virt - manager ( see KVM Guest Management With Virt - Manager On Ubuntu 8.10 ) for this .
I 'm assuming that you 're using an Ubuntu 8.10 desktop ( it does n't matter if it is a remote desktop of if the desktop is installed on the Ubuntu 8.10 KVM server ! ) .
If you want to use virt - viewer , run
sudo apt - get install virt - viewer
If you want to use virt - manager , run
sudo apt - get install virt - manager
4 Creating A CentOS 5.2 Guest
Take a look at
man virt - install
to learn how to use it .
To create a CentOS 5.2 guest ( in bridging mode ) with the name vm10 , 512MB of RAM , two virtual CPUs , and the disk image ~/ vm10.qcow2 ( with a size of 12GB ) , insert the CentOS DVD into the CD drive and run
sudo virt - install -- connect qemu:///system -n vm10 -r 512 -- vcpus=2 -f ~/vm10.qcow2 -s 12 -c /dev/cdrom --vnc --noautoconsole -- os - type linux -- accelerate --network=bridge:br0 --hvm
Of course , you can also create an ISO image of the CentOS DVD ...
sudo dd if=/ dev/cdrom of=~/CentOS-5.2-x86_64-bin-DVD.iso
... and use the ISO image in the virt - install command :
sudo virt - install -- connect qemu:///system -n vm10 -r 512 -- vcpus=2 -f ~/vm10.qcow2 -s 12 -c ~/CentOS-5.2-x86_64-bin-DVD.iso --vnc --noautoconsole -- os - type linux -- accelerate --network=bridge:br0 --hvm
( I 've left out the -- os - variant=centos5 switch because virt - install was complaining that it does n't know the operating system variant centos5 , although the man pages says something else .
Anyway , the installation worked flawlessly even without that switch . )
Advertisement Advertisement
5 Connecting To The Guest
The KVM guest will now boot from the CentOS 5.2 DVD and start the graphical CentOS installer - that 's why we need to connect to the graphical console of the guest .
You can either do this with virt - manager ( see KVM Guest Management With Virt - Manager On Ubuntu 8.10 ) or with virt - viewer .
I will show how to do this with virt - viewer .
If virt - viewer is installed on the KVM server , you can run
sudo virt - viewer vm10
If virt - viewer is installed on a remote Ubuntu desktop , run
( Replace 192.168.0.100 with the IP address or hostname of the KVM host .
Please note that the root account must be enabled on the KVM host , and that root logins must be allowed on the KVM host .
To enable the root login on an Ubuntu system , run Advertisement
sudo passwd root
To check if root logins are allowed check the directive PermitRootLogin in / etc / ssh / sshd_config - you might have to restart the SSH daemon afterwards . )
You should now be connected to the graphical console of the guest and see the CentOS installer :
Now install CentOS as you would normally do on a physical system .
Please note that at the end of the installation , the CentOS system needs a reboot .
The guest will then stop , so you need to start it again , either with virt - manager or like this on the KVM host 's command line :
sudo virsh -- connect qemu:///system
start vm10
quit
Afterwards , you can connect to the guest again with virt - viewer or virt - manager and complete the installation .
6 Cloning Guests
The python - virtinst package comes with a second tool , virt - clone , that lets you clone guests .
To clone vm10 and name the clone vm11 with the disk image ~/vm11.qcow2 , you simply run
sudo virt - clone -- connect qemu:///system -o vm10 -n vm11 -f ~/vm11.qcow2
Afterwards , you can start vm11 with virt - manager or like this ...
sudo virsh -- connect qemu:///system
start vm11
quit
... and connect to it using virt - manager or virt - viewer .

If regular cars represent personal freedom , supercars surely represent personal transcendence .
A movement to something above and beyond the normal human condition and limitations .
Therefore supercars must by definition push the edge of the envelope in regards to technology and the laws of physics .
Or in other words , push the limits of what 's possible for a combination of man and machine to accomplish .
The very best supercars do all this and more -- thereby expanding the very boundaries of human imagination itself .
Surprise !
Folks of average financial means CAN own supercars !
Most people seem to think only the rich can ever own a supercar .
But that 's been proven wrong time and time again !
If you can afford an average priced used car , you can theoretically wrangle your way into supercar territory .
How ?
Low cost sleeper supercars
There 's plenty of older cars with supercar potential .
When the need for another car in your life is nearing anyway , just do your homework about the best sleeper candidates which might be available to you on the used market , then go shopping !
I 'm talking here about used cars which were ( when new ) perhaps the low end of a sports car line , or around the mid-range performance - wise of a pony car or muscle car -- and a decent handler on curves , too .
Such cars as these can usually be relatively easily and cheaply boosted performance - wise with various replacement parts from their originally superior cousins , either via the new parts route , or salvaging such items from wrecks .
It 's been a long time since I built my own supercar this way .
But back then the optimal age range for such a sleeper candidate seemed to be a car at least three years old , but not more than seven or so .
That time frame seems to help minimize general costs while still allowing a reasonable amount of life to be left in a given automobile , in terms of most of its original parts , plus the market availability of repair and performance parts for the machine .
Of course , the more you know ( or learn ) about all these facets of sleeper supercars -- and the more shoe leather and elbow grease you 're willing to add to the mix -- the better your final results will be .
Heck : if you study up enough on the subject -- plus enjoy a sufficient bout of good luck -- you may even run across a fantastic deal on a rare , little - known , and hard - to - find model of showroom floor supercar which was lovingly kept garaged and driven only on Sundays to church by a staid old lady its whole life ( it 's happened before ! ) .
Beyond all that , any personalization or customization you do to your vehicle will be limited more by your imagination than your financial status .
So long as you do it largely yourself .
From the ground up
Heck : for that matter you can also start from scratch and build your supercar from the ground up -- something almost no one but fabulously wealthy people usually can do .
The main difference between you and them will be where the rich employs a specialty car maker company to do the build , you 'll choose a car kit and build it yourself .
Although this might be a bit more expensive than the modified used car route ( plus take more time to complete ) it could also allow you to end up with even greater performance than the other route -- and more choices in regards to a unique or wild appearance too for your ride .
Below are links to all that -- including lots more information on how to acquire , modify , or build from scratch your own .
Enjoy !
It is a widely accepted fact that Lake Superior , with an area of 31,820 square miles , is the world 's largest freshwater lake .
However , this fact is based on a historical inaccuracy in the naming of Lake Huron and Lake Michigan .
What should have been considered one body of water , Lake Michigan - Huron with an area of 45,410 square miles , was mistakenly given two names , one for each lobe .
The explorers in colonial times incorrectly believed each lobe to be a separate lake because of their great size .
Why should the two lakes be considered one ?
The Huron Lobe and the Michigan Lobe are at the same elevation and are connected by the 120 - foot - deep Mackinac Strait , also at the same elevation .
Lakes are separated from each other by streams and rivers .
The Strait of Mackinac is not a river .
It is 3.6 to 5 miles wide , wider than most lakes are long .
In essence , it is just a narrowing , not a separation of the two lobes of Lake Michigan - Huron .
The flow between the two lakes can reverse .
Because of the large connecting channel , the two can equalize rapidly whenever a water level imbalance occurs .
Gauge records for the lakes clearly show them to have identical water level regimes and mean long - term behavior ; that is , they are hydrologically considered to be one lake .
Historical names are not easily changed .
The separate names for the lake are a part of history and are also legally institutionalized since Lake Michigan is treated as American and Lake Huron is bisected by the international boundary between the United States and Canada .
Of all the world 's freshwater lakes , North America 's Great Lakes are unique .
Their five basins combine to form a single watershed with one common outlet to the ocean .
The total volume of the lakes is about 5,475 cubic miles , more than 6,000 trillion gallons .
The Great Lakes are Superior , with an area of 31,820 square miles ( 82,414 km ) shared by the United States and Canada ; Huron , with an area of 23,010 square miles ( 59,596 sq. km ) shared by the United States and Canada ; Michigan , with an area of 22,400 square miles ( 58,016 sq. km ) entirely in the United States ; Erie , with an area of 9,930 square miles ( 25,719 km ) shared by the United States and Canada ; and Ontario , with an area of 7,520 square miles ( 19,477 km ) shared by the United States and Canada .
The Eucalyptus project , which aims to provide open source infrastructure for cloud computing , is growing beyond its university roots and is heading straight for enterprise data centers .
The key developers behind the project have launched a company with the intent of commercializing the technology , and have received $ 5.5 million in venture capital funding to get them started .
Eucalyptus can be used to build elastic computing environments — like Amazon EC2 — on top of conventional clusters .
It provides infrastructure for automating virtual machine provisioning and management so that a cluster 's computational resources can be made accessible to users in a more flexible way .
It leverages the open source Xen hypervisor and it is designed to run on the Linux platform .
Its management APIs are modeled after those provided by EC2 , which means that it is largely compatible with tools that are built to work with Amazon 's service .
Eucalyptus originated in UCSB 's MAYHEM lab , which studies Middleware and Applications Yielding Heterogenous Environments for Metacomputing .
The original purpose of the project was to facilitate the study of cloud technology and to provide researchers with a way to roll out an elastic computing sandbox in a controlled environment for testing and experimentation .
The project proved to have practical value outside of the laboratory setting and it's beginning to see adoption as a tool for building self - hosted elastic clouds in enterprise data centers .
The developers have launched a company called Eucalyptus Systems that will provide commercial support , integration , and development services for Eucalyptus users while continuing to develop the core code base under an open source license .
The company officially launched on Wednesday after receiving series A funding from Benchmark Capital .
" Eucalyptus Systems will ensure the viability and growth of Eucalyptus well beyond its life as a university research project , while also extending the technology to meet the needs of organizations that require high scalability , reliability , and enterprise - grade support , " said cofounder and CTO Dr. Rich Wolski in a statement .
" Eucalyptus Systems will enable businesses of any size to leverage their own IT resources to get the benefits of cloud computing without the concerns of lock - in , security ambiguity , and unexpected storage costs that can be associated with public clouds . "
The software is already being integrated into popular Linux distributions , such as Ubuntu .
Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu , is using Eucalyptus as the basis for its Ubuntu Enterprise Cloud system , which is included as a preview in Ubuntu 9.04 Server Edition .
Stronger Eucalyptus integration is a high priority for Ubuntu 9.10 , which is codenamed Karmic Koala .
The emergence of commercial backing for Eucalyptus will likely boost the visibility of the project and accelerate its development .
As it matures , it could help improve the efficacy of virtualization on the Linux platform in enterprise data centers .

Resource Link Worth Mentioning
Netbook web surfers beware .
That low - cost netbook you 're using could be a high - speed gateway into your life , bank accounts , passwords and other personal data .
Netbooks have made headlines since their 2007 launch , making PCs accessible to millions of non-traditional users .
But their cheap cost could also carry a steep price tag due to lax security that makes them easier prey for viruses and hackers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Since their introduction less than two years ago by Taiwan 's Asustek , nearly all major PC makers , including Hewlett - Packard , Dell , Acer and Lenovo , have jumped on the netbook bandwagon .
But their no frills nature , combined with low computing power and relative lack of sophistication among their users could combine to create the perfect storm for hackers and virus creators looking for easy targets , analysts say .
" The Internet is full of dangers , regardless of what computer you are using , " said Sam Yen , greater China marketing manager at anti-virus software maker Symantec .
" But keeping in mind that the netbook is primarily used to surf the Internet , those dangers are possibly multiplied many - fold , especially if there is no anti-virus software installed in the machine . "
Price tags as low as £ 200 mean that netbooks often lack such standard gear as firewalls and other anti-virus software typically found in other computers , leaving them highly vulnerable to attacks .
" Frankly , netbook security is not there yet , " said Pranab Sarmah , an analyst at the Daiwa Institute of Research .
" The positioning of the netbook means PC brands are going to do whatever it takes to make the price point attractive to consumers , which means keeping costs low . "
Many netbook users are relative Internet newcomers , and may not be aware of precautions they can take to protect themselves .
Low computing power also means savvy netbook users may shut down critical security programs to boost speed .
" It 's a Catch - 22 situation , " said Gartner analyst Lillian Tay .
" If you 're running too many security programs at the same time , it slows the computer down .
Do n't run any , and you are at risk . "
Netbooks were a glimmer of light in the tech sector last year , and IDC research firm says they could dramatically outperform the overall PC market in 2009 .
It forecasts netbook shipments will more than double to nearly 21 million units this year , compared with about 4 percent growth to 305 million units for all PCs .
Netbook pioneer Asustek believes its models already include built - in security features and other options that are sufficient for the typical user , said Samson Hu , who runs the company 's netbook operations .
" We 've got a tie - up with Symantec where users who want to can pay a little more for that additional security , " he said .
" We 've received lots of good feedback from users , but of course , everyone should be aware of Internet security issues when they are connected to any network . "
Some experts say netbooks ' inability to run effective security could crimp future growth , scaring away lucrative corporate users who regularly deal with sensitive data .
Corporate buyers now account for more than half of all PC sales .
" For most companies , they 'll still choose conventional laptops that allow them to run software that protects the information hidden inside it , " said Eric Ashdown , senior director for security strategy and risk management at Accenture .
" If I 'm somebody doing corporate IT work , I would n't be looking at netbooks as a viable option .
I would need more security , which they can't offer right now . "
But Ashdown also pointed out that netbooks could be protected by the types of customers that buy them , casual users who tend to store less valuable information on their computers .
" Most attacks go to where the data is , where the economic value is , " said Accenture 's Ashdown .
" If I were a hacker , I 'm not sure I would go for netbooks .
What would I find there ?
Family photos ? "
For the last few weeks Republicans have been ranting about the Democrat raid of the U. S. Treasury .
They were using the financial crisis like the Reichstag Fire , we were told , as an excuse to consolidate their power , paying off political constituencies and pushing through spending bills that are loaded with extras totally unrelated to any resolution of the crisis .
Even moderates have been alarmed .
To be sure , there is still good will toward our new President Barack Obama .
Everyone is too pleased with the idea of an African American president to blame him for anything .
The tomatoes are usually tossed at Nancy Pelosi and her partisan gang in the House .
Surely the president who firmly promised he would end ear marks and examine each spending bill , line by line , has not lied to us already , this early into his term in office ?
But now it turns out that the whiney Republican Party ’s own leaders are right in the thick of it all .
Six of the top ten pork barrel spenders in the U. S. Senate are in the GOP .
Here is that inglorious list .
1. Thad Cochran , R - Miss. : $ 474 million
2. Roger Wicker , R- Miss. : $ 391 million
3. Mary Landrieu , D - La. : $ 332 million
4. Tom Harkin , D - Iowa : $ 292 million
5. David Vitter , R - La. : $ 249 million
6. Christopher Bond , R - Mo. : $ 248 million
7. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. : $ 235 million
8. Daniel Inouye , D - Hawaii : $ 225 million
9. Richard Shelby , R - Ala. : $ 219 million
10 . Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa : $ 199 million
( Source http://fray.slate.com/discuss/forums/thread/2557139.aspx)
Just making the cut , you ’ll notice , is Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa who was upset last summer at Pentecostal - Charismatic television preachers , calling for an investigation , because evangelists like Joyce Meyers , who earns $ 250,000 a year , are too extravagant with donations .
At a time when America is on the verge of the Second Great Depression and unemployment is mounting , he bagged almost $ 200 million in pork barrel goodies for his buddies back home .
At least the people who give to Joyce Meyers ’ ministry do so voluntarily .
( By the way , maybe we should have the government run the Churches too , that would make a clean sweep of things .
Banks ,
Insurance , Autos and Churches , as well .
Hmmm . )
Is there anyone who can save us from this insanity ?
There is really only one option left .
Ron Paul .
It is a long shot , but if the madness goes far enough and the reaction sets in , the Paulistas just might stage a takeover of the Grand Old Party and Ron Paul would offer America a real choice .
It ’s a long shot .
But four more years of this and America may actually be ready .

Humpback whales have come up with a novel way for getting an easy snack - stealing a bird 's dinner .
A BBC crew filmed seabirds carefully corralling unwieldy shoals of herring into tightly packed bait balls , which are easy to pluck fish from .
But they discovered that passing whales would wait for the birds to complete their hard graft before devouring the ball of fish in a single gulp .
The team said this was the first time they had seen this behaviour .

Hoping to earn some extra money to pay her mounting bills , Francesca Nichols posted an ad on Craigslist : “ Giant Yard Sale -- Everything Must Go ! ”
So at 5:30 a.m. last Saturday morning , she and her husband filled their Valencia driveway with purchases made during better times : a wooden dresser , top - of - the - line child car seats , a hand - painted mirror and piles of expensive clothes .
Two hours later , Nichols waved a wad of bills and smiled .
“ Wow , honey , ” she said to her husband .
Unfortunately , their total earnings for the day -- $ 275 ( plus $ 8 from their son ’s lemonade stand ) -- wo n’t go far .
Nichols and her husband are both unemployed ; he was laid off from Wells Fargo last summer , and she recently took a stress leave from a car sales company after her pay was cut four times in six months .
They have more than $ 30,000 in credit card debt and a $ 2,400 monthly mortgage payment .
But Nichols , 40 , said every bit helps .

“ I have never been in this situation before , ” she said .
“ I have got to find a way out . ”
Garage sale season is getting underway in Southern California , but in yet another sign of the recession , many families are holding sales out of necessity .
And some buyers are new to the yard sale circuit , realizing they can no longer afford to shop at the mall .
“ I believe that this year will see more garage sales than ever before , ” said Bruce Littlefield , author of the 2007 book “ Garage Sale America . ”
“ The recession sort of shook us a little bit and made us realize we all have more than we really need .
That includes big - ticket items . ”
Littlefield , who maintains a blog about garage sales , said they are good for both sides .

“ The win for the seller is that they are getting rid of things that they no longer need or want , and they are getting some pocket change , ” he said .
“ For the buyer , they are going to get things for dimes on the dollar , and they are going to discover that spending a little cash money is a lot easier at the end of the month when the credit card bill comes . ”
Over the last year , garage sale postings on Craigslist have increased by 50 % in the Los Angeles area and 80 % nationwide .
The site has seen a “ strong uptick ” in garage sale postings as users “ de- clutter their homes and make a few spare dollars to pad their wallets , ” said spokeswoman Susan MacTavish Best .
Nichols said that when she and her husband were both doing well , they did n’t think about money -- buying themselves and their 5 - year - old son , Noah , anything they wanted .
Now , she said , they are selling everything they do n’t need , including a turtle tank , sheets , an inflatable pool , a massage chair , a TV stand and an air mattress .
During the sale , a shopper paid $ 10 and walked away with a T - ball set , stuffed animals , shower curtain rods , a cloth high - chair cover and Spider - Man glasses .

“ Mom , I wanted the Spider - Man glasses to keep ! ” Noah protested .
Another shopper , Maria Ual , who is nine months pregnant , said she bought everything new for her first child but is shopping at garage sales for her second .
Though she still has a nursing job , Ual , 33 , said she was looking for ways to cut costs .
Ual held up a baby carrier .
“ How about $ 10 ? ” Nichols said .
“ It was only $ 150 new . ” Ual passed , but bought a book , a few toy cars and a rattle , all for $ 3 .
Sean Nichols , 38 , said he was optimistic that their situation would improve .
He borrowed money from his grandmother to complete a course in medical billing and hoped to find a job soon .

“ You ca n’t sit around and hope when you have children , ” he said .
“ You ca n’t afford to . ”
Several sellers , including Wesley Wong , said that in the past , they donated belongings they no longer wanted to the Salvation Army or Goodwill .
But now it ’s different .
In February , Wong , 44 , lost his six - figure job as a director of warehouse operations .
His wife still had her job as a clerk for the city of Alhambra , but Wong said they could use some extra cash .
“ We have to be a little more modest about what we do , ” he said as he sat in front of his Monterey Park house , waiting for customers to buy shoes , a Disney music box and an old backpack , among other items .
Advertisement
“ Do n’t you need a typewriter ? ” he asked customers Alejandro Granados , 42 , and his wife , Maria , 48 .
“ With the recession , they ’ll be coming back in style . ”
The Granadoses laughed .
They owned a store in South L.A. , but business was down .
Worse , a home they purchased two years ago had dropped in value and they had recently stopped paying their mortgage , the first step toward foreclosure .
Wong said that right now he was n’t feeling too stressed about being unemployed because he still had some savings .
Although he felt confident he’d be able to find a job eventually , Wong said he hoped it would n’t take longer than expected .
“ I do n’t need to make as much money as before for us to live comfortably , ” he said .

Rhonda Johnson , 50 , has n’t lost her job to the recession .
In fact , she has two .
But the economic crisis still had her hurriedly arranging years of belongings on a recent Sunday -- Coach bags , books , CDs , designer jeans -- in front of the garage at her Arcadia condominium .
Her yard sale was about getting rid of clutter and making extra money during uncertain times , but it was also a recession - induced exorcism of her old self .
“ The days of buying things to impress people I do n’t know , with money I do n’t have , are over , ” she said .
“ I no longer need to make a fashion statement .
I ’m taking the path of meat and potatoes , and forget trying to be a fashionista .
My days of running in high heels are over . ”
Johnson recently sold her condominium for $ 388,000 and escrow had closed for her buyers just days before .
But now -- with institutions antsy about lending -- she is struggling to get financing for a home in Duarte she had planned to move to with her three children .

“ This whole economic crisis has forced me to get a lot of stuff gone from my life and sold so that I can find a temporary place to stay for now , ” said Johnson , who works as a secretary at a lab in Monrovia and does medical transcriptions from home .
Erika Perez , 35 , picked up a Coach bag that Johnson had bought for $ 300 .
Johnson wanted $ 40 .
Perez asked if she would take $ 30 .
They agreed on $ 35 .
Perez , a Guatemalan immigrant who works at a bakery , said she stumbled upon a yard sale two weeks ago where the prices were so low that she wondered whether the seller was n’t being driven by desperation .
Perez said she bought two living room tables for $ 50 .
“ Everything was almost free , ” she said .
“ I got some stuff for my house , for my kitchen , my living room .
It was nice . ”
Steve Seay , 30 , and his fiancee had another reason for their Woodland Hills sale over the weekend -- their upcoming wedding .
The recession forced them to abandon plans to marry in Hawaii , but they still needed to raise money to pay for their reception .

Seay said his fiancee works at a home - building company and has seen her hours cut in recent months .
And business for Seay , a personal chef , has dropped by half .
In the past , he said , he would cook a family dinner on Friday night .
“ Now it ’s pizza night , ” he said .
“ That ’s all Domino’s . ”
They are able to pay the bills on their town house , Seay said , but are behind on their homeowners association dues .
When they announced they were having a garage sale , friends and family rallied , donating tables , DVD players , vintage clothes , jewelry and Civil War books .
And the couple set out several of their own rugs , a couch , electronics and DVDs .
Altogether the couple cleared more than $ 1,000 .

“ It ’s kind of cool in one way , because we have a lot more space , ” he said .
“ In the other way , it ’s depressing .
. . .
This stuff was from a time when you were doing OK and you could afford to be frivolous .
I ca n’t remember the last time it was like that . ”

One of the most striking sentiments expressed by Mizrahis in Israel is a sense of disbelief .
Some of these Jewish migrants from Arab countries are still stunned at the level of ignorance and prejudice that greeted them in the new Israel .
For some reason , their new Jewish co-nationalists – who often came from the ghettos of Eastern Europe – thought the Mizrahis were backward and inferior , or , as Lyn Julius puts it , " badly educated " and " unwashed " .
The Europeans could n't get their heads around the fact of Mizrahis being poets or communists , driving cars or using toilets .
How could they not know , wondered the Mizrahis , about the manner of life in Baghdad , Beirut , Cairo or Casablanca ?
What was at first a sense of shock swiftly turned into despair , as Mizrahis understood that the prevailing preconceptions among those in power would shape social status in Israel .
It would also dictate the type of Jewish individual that would come to represent the country .
Zionism , the ideology that built the Jewish state , was conceived in Europe and was , inevitably , set to a European tune .
This would be fine , were it not for the fact that half of Israel 's Jewish population ( and until recently a clear majority ) is of Oriental origin .
Or for the geographic inconvenience of Israel being in the Middle East .
Israel has a particular narrative about the " ingathering of the exiles " , the Jewish migrants that arrived after its creation in 1948 from all corners of the world .
The talk is of equality , melting pots and a " new Israeli " , an amalgam of all those composite cultures .
But in reality , Mizrahi culture was , and still is , considered to be an oxymoron .
It was channelled into harmless outlets such as cuisine , craftwork and folklore – inconsequential gloss , the presence of which could then be used to bat off complaints of underrepresentation .
Meanwhile , proper , high culture is maintained as a European preserve .
That 's why former Jewish musical legends of the Arab world – feted performers , whose names still inspire adoration in the Middle East – ended up selling pots in the city slums of Israel .
That 's also why there are over 20 European classical music ensembles in the Jewish state , and just one Mizrahi outfit – currently on the verge of extinction .
You could , as Julius has done in this section , say that such prejudice is ancient history , the teething problems of a struggling new state .
Many Israelis would emphatically agree with you .
Others simply do n't .
The ones that still feel the daily impact of prejudice will laugh in your face – as I experienced , many times – if you declare social inequities to be done with .
How can it be over , they 'll ask , when it is etched into the county 's DNA ?
Those Mizrahis will shake their heads at your folly in suggesting – as I did – that the army , the Jewish intermarrying , the Mizrahi politicians and Israeli society at large have all hammered out all those early hitches .
If it were over , they 'll ask , then why would the recent , first Israeli series of Big Brother dissolve into an ethnic spat ?
If it were over , why would Mizrahi kids still be refused admission into central city clubs ?
Why would there still be pathetically wide ethnic gaps in education or professional attainment ?
Why would the majority of Israel 's judges have European surnames , while most blue - collar criminals are Mizrahi ?
If it were truly over , then the country would reflect its Mizrahi composition equally , be visibly proud of its Judeo - Arabic heritage and of the longstanding Jewish affiliation with the Arab world .
Then , as a confident , credible and socially cohesive country , it might have an entirely different take on relations with its neighbours in the Middle East .
Recognising that is not to suggest that Mizrahis did n't experience persecution in the Arab world .
They did , as Julius ( whose family fled from Iraq ) points out .
Researching my book , I heard many Mizrahi recollections of fear , suffering and discrimination in former homelands .
But just as many readily share other memories : of happy lives , equal rights and considerate neighbours .
" Our doors were always open , " Mizrahis often told me , when they spoke of past lives in Arab or Muslim countries .
So what happens if we foreground the good times rather than the sporadic suffering ?
One history teacher at an Israeli school set up to rescue drop - out Mizrahis from the failing education system told me that kids typically turn up to class with set views .
They think that the Arab world , in its manifest animosity towards the Jewish state , is continuing a long tradition of hating Jews .
When the pupils find out that it was n't always like that , they start to ask different questions : " Hang on , so why are they so against us today ? "
The accepted view of the conflict , as centuries - old and defined by innate hatreds , suddenly collapses .
A new narrative emerges , of a relatively recent struggle within a wide - frame of historic Arab - Jewish co-existence , creativity , productivity and plain old friendship .
All of which might explain why this other story , the story of the Mizrahis , is so threatening to those who insist on holding tight to a monochrome script – one that helps to keep Arabs and Israelis stuck in a locked - down conflict , with no possible hope of escape .
Here we go : another list on how to save money on groceries .
You would be surprised , however , at how many people do not put these tips into practice .
Doing so can help you save serious money on your grocery bill .
Coupon Shop .
This is not anything new to those who know and understand how coupons can save money .
And not just on groceries .
There are several popular sites on the Internet that can provide coupons on anything that you plan to purchase , but do not have a coupon for from the tradition outlets .
Be sure that you do n’t coupon shop and miss out on sales prices that are lower .
Tunnel vision is not a good thing in shopping either .
Plant a Garden .
Now more than ever , more people are planting gardens to grow their own vegetables .
Not only are they better for you , but they are even more tasty than store bought .
If you do not like the idea of planting your own , consider a farmer ’s market locally where you can purchase good quality , fresh produce .
Just watch the prices and do not be afraid to ask if they will take a slightly lower price .
Shop Around .
The mega - store is not the only place that has good prices .
You can find some competitive prices on comparable or same items if you are not afraid to shop around .
Keep in mind , however , that the distance that you have to travel can eat up any savings in the output of gasoline taken to get that great price .
Price Match .
Many stores will match prices of competitors .
Just be sure to take an ad with you so that you can verify the existence of the price at the other store .
This can help you keep your shopping to one location .
Buy Store Labels .
Many store labels are just as good quality as their major brand name counterparts .
This is particularly true for items that you purchase to cook with and add to other items .
The difference in taste is often negligible .
But the money saved and be significant .
Using these tips , you can lower your overall food expenditure by 25 % very easily .
One final tip for you is to keep in touch with friends and family members on where they shop and what they are finding in prices .
That can help you make decisions based on the good fortunes of others .
Finally , an innovative laptop that will actually be released .
The ASUS Fold / Unfold laptop has a keyboard that “ slides backwards as you open the display to maximize room for keys , trackpad and palm rest . ”
Video after the break .
It may sound like sheer insanity , but it ’s the right sort of crazy sauce if you ask us .
ASUS is planning to make its Fold / Unfold laptop concept into a for - reals product this year , with plans to ship by Q3 .
Most networking discussions are a jumble of acronyms .
Forget the configuration details — what are the insights ?
Networking is about communication
Text is the simplest way to communicate
Protocols are standards for reading and writing text
Beneath the details , networking is an IM conversation .
Here ’s what I wish someone told me when learning how computers communicate .
TCP : The Text Layer
The Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) provides the handy illusion that we can “ just ” send text between two computers .
TCP relies on lower levels and can send binary data , but ignore that for now :
TCP lets us Instant Message between computers
We IM with Telnet , the ‘ notepad ’ of networking : telnet sends and receives plain text using TCP .
It ’s a chat client peacefully free of ads and unsolicited buddy requests .
Let ’s talk to Google using telnet ( or putty , a better utility ) :
telnet google.com 80 [ connecting ... ]
Hello Mr. Google !
We connect to google.com on port 80 ( the default for web requests ) and send the message “ Hello Mr. Google ! ” .
We press Enter a few times and await the reply :
< html > ... < h1 > Bad Request </h1 >
Your client has issued a malformed or illegal request ... </html >
Malformed ?
Illegal ?
The mighty Google is not pleased .
It did n’t understand us and sent HTML telling the same .
But , we had a conversation : text went in , and text came back .
In other words :
Protocols : The Forms To Fill Out
Unstructured chats are too carefree — how does the server know what we want to do ?
We need a protocol ( standard way of communicating ) if we ’re going to make sense .
We use protocols all the time
Putting “ to ” and “ from ” addresses in special places on an envelope
Filling out bank forms ( special place for account number , deposit amount , etc. )
Saying “ Roger ” or “ 10 - 4 ” to indicate a radio request was understood
Protocols make communication clear .
Case Study : The HTTP Protocol
We see HTTP in every url : http://google.com/.
What does it mean ?
Connect to server google.com ( Using TCP , port 80 by default )
Ask for the resource “ / ” ( the default resource )
Format the request using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol
HTTP is the “ form to fill out ” when asking for the resource .
Using the HTTP format , the above request looks like this :
GET / HTTP/1.0
Remember , it ’s just text !
We ’re asking for a file , through an IM session , using the format : [ Command ] [ Resource ] [ Protocol Name / Version ] .
This command is “ IM ’d ” to the server ( your browser adds extra info , a detail for another time ) .
Google ’s server returns this response :
HTTP/1.0 200 OK Cache - Control : private , max - age=0 Date : Sun , 15 Mar 2009 03:13:39 GMT
Expires : - 1 Content - Type : text / html ; charset=ISO -8859 -1 Set - Cookie : PREF=ID=5cc6 … Server : gws Connection : Close < html >
( Google web page , search box , and cute logo ) </html >
Yowza .
The bottom part is HTML for the browser to display .
But why the junk up top ?
Well , suppose we just got the raw HTML to display .
But what about errors : if the server crashed , the file was n’t there , or google just did n’t like us ?
Some metadata ( data about data ) is useful .
When we order a book from Amazon we expect a packing slip describing the order : the intended recipient , price , return information , etc .
You do n’t want a naked book just thrown on your doorstep .
Protocols are similar : the recipient wants to know if everything was OK .
Here we see infamous status codes like 404 ( resource not found ) or 200 ( everything OK ) .
These headers are n’t the real data — they ’re the packing slip from the server .
Insights From Protocols
Studying existing , popular systems is a great way to understand engineering decisions .
Here are a few :
Binary vs Plain Text
Binary data is more efficient than text , but more difficult to debug and generate ( how many hex editors do you know to use ? ) .
Lower - level protocols , the backbone of the internet , use binary data to maintain performance .
Application - level protocols ( HTTP and above ) use text data for ease of interoperability .
You do n’t have religious wars about endian issues with HTTP .
Stateful vs. Stateless
Some protocols are stateful , which means the server remembers the chat with the client .
With SMTP , for example , the client opens a connection and issues commands one at a time ( such as adding recipients to an email ) , and closes the connection .
Stateful communication is useful in transactions that have many steps or conditions .
Stateless communication is simpler : you send the entire transaction as one request .
Each “ instant message ” stands on its own and does n’t need the others .
HTTP is stateless : you can request a webpage without introducing yourself to the server .
Extensibility
We ca n’t think of everything beforehand .
How do we extend old protocols for new users ?
HTTP has a simple and effective “ header ” structure : a metadata preamble that looks like “ Header : Value ” .
If you do n’t recognize the header sent ( new client , old server ) just ignore it .
If you were expecting a header but do n’t see it ( old client , new server ) , just use a default .
It ’s like having an “ Anything else to tell us ? ” section in a survey .
Error Correction & Reliability
It ’s the job of lower - level protocols like TCP to make sure data is transmitted reliably .
But higher - level protocols ( like HTTP ) need to make sure it ’s the right data .
How are errors handled and communicated ?
Can the client just retry or does the server need to reset state ?
HTTP comes with its own set of error codes to handle a variety of situations .
Availability
The neat thing about networking is that works on one computer .
Memcached is a great service to cache data .
And guess what ?
It uses plain - old text commands ( over TCP ) to save and retrieve data .
You do n’t need complex COM objects or DLLs – you start a Memcached server , send text in , and get text out .
It ’s language - neutral and easy to access because any decent OS supports networking .
You can even telnet into Memcached to debug it .
Wireless routers are similar : they have a control panel available through HTTP .
There ’s no “ router configuration program ” — you just connect to it with your browser .
The router serves up webpages , and when you submit data it makes the necessary configuration changes .
Protocols like HTTP are so popular you can assume the user has a client .
Layering Protocols
Protocols can be layered .
We might write a resume , which is part of a larger application , which is stuffed into an envelope .
Each segment has its own format , blissfully unaware of the others .
Your envelope does n’t care about the resume — it just wants the to : and from : addresses written correctly .
Many protocols rely on HTTP because it ’s so widely used ( rather than starting from scratch , like Memcached , which needs efficiency ) .
HTTP has well - understood methods to define resources ( URLs ) and commands ( GET and POST ) , so why not use them ?
Web services do just that .
The SOAP protocol crams XML inside of HTTP commands .
The REST protocol embraces HTTP and uses the existing verbs as much as possible .
Remember : It ’s All Made Up
Networking involves human conventions .
Because plain text is ubiquitous and easy to use , it is the basis for most protocols .
And TCP is the simplest , most - supported way to exchange text .
Remembering that everything is a plain text IM conversation helps me wrap my head around the inevitable networking issues .
And sometimes you need to jump into HTTP to understand compression and caching .
Do n’t just memorize the details ; see protocols as strategies to solve communication problems .
Happy networking .

Di Montezemolo spoke out in Bahrain , where Ferrari won their first points of 2009
By Andrew Benson
BBC Sport in Bahrain
Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo has blamed " badly written rules " and his team 's " presumptuous approach " for their continued struggles this season .
The Italian listed those among four reasons for Ferrari 's lack of pace .
The others were that the Kers power - boost systems were not mandatory and that Ferrari started designing its 2009 car late due to its 2008 title battle .
" I have a big confidence in the team , " he said .
" I am sure that we will be back - not immediately , but very soon . "
Speaking at Sunday 's Bahrain Grand Prix in which Kimi Raikkonnen won the team 's first points of a disastrous season after finishing sixth , Di Montezemolo said he was " totally unhappy " about Ferrari 's performance , which he described as being in a " black tunnel " .
We have seen very badly written rules .
They are what I call grey rules , with different interpretations
Luca di Montezemolo
" The stability of the team and confidence of the team for me since 1992 was my main goal and I will continue , " he said as he contemplated Ferrari 's worst start to a season since 1981 , vowing to revive the team .
" This team is exactly the same team that was very close , crossed the line not 20 years ago but a few months ago winning the championship , so there is no problem , " added Montezemelo , referring to the team 's success in winning the constructors ' crown in 2008 .
" When I know the reason I am confident , and when I do n't know the reason I am worried .
" I know the reason , my people know the reason - and they are fully committed , so I am very confident .
But then I am very upset for other reasons that are nothing to do with the team . "
Asked to explain Ferrari's lack of pace , he first brought up the row over the new F1 aerodynamic rules , which some teams interpreted differently from the traditional leading runners .
The Brawn , Toyota and Williams teams exploited a loophole in the regulations governing diffusers , the influential part of the floor of the car between the rear wheels .
The row was settled in F1's Court of Appeal between the second and third races , and now all the teams are racing to implement their own version of the ' double - decker ' diffuser .
Montezemolo said : " We have seen very badly written rules .
They are what I call grey rules , with different interpretations .
" And if teams that have won the last three world championships , like Renault , McLaren and Ferrari , and important team and car manufacturers like BMW and even Red Bull , have one interpretation , it means that at least the rules are not clear .
So , very unclear rules means different interpretations , which means different cars in the field . "
Ferrari's boss also revealed his frustration at the introduction of Kers this season .
" It represents a lot of money .
It represents something that has been introduced to have a link between F1 and advanced research for road cars in terms of energy , and in terms of green [ technology ] and in terms of innovation .
" We have done the Kers immediately , even if it means a lot of money , safety , and reliability and it means to project a completely different car - as McLaren have done and as a lot of other teams have done .
" But we have been surprised to see Kers was just a suggestion , not a [ requirement ] .
And today we are facing a very strange and in my opinion not positive situation .
" We have three different F1 on the grid - we have F1 competition cars with Kers , F1 competition between cars with no Kers and a different floor , and third competitors with no Kers and no floor .
" This is bad , and it is one of the reasons why unfortunately we are not competitive and we are forced to invest time , and extra money in such a difficult moment , to do a heavy modification to our car .
ANDREW BENSON'S BLOG
In Michael Schumacher 's days , the team - marshalled by their ruthless French sporting director Jean Todt and their brilliant British technical director Ross Brawn - evolved into the most efficient winning machine in F1 history ...
Montezemolo admitted that in trying to win the 2008 F1 crown when Lewis Hamilton pipped Felipe Massa to the title at the Brazilian GP , Ferrari was unable to devote time to developing a car for the 2009 season .
" Another reason is that we have started to work in a hard way to the new car late , " said Montezemolo .
" And this was a pity , particularly in a year in which the rules have been completely new .
It is not , in other words , an evolution of last year 's car , and this is a second reason why we have not been competitive .
" And the last reason is that I feel inside the team there has been a little bit too much of a presumptuous approach .
" Sometimes to put the head down in the ground is useful to looking ahead , but I must say that sometimes having your whole head , feet , everything in the ground , even more underground , is better . "
Ahead of the China GP , Ferrari revamped their pit team , handing team manager Luca Baldisserri's track duties to engineer Chris Dyer .

( CNN ) -- Rioting has flared near Belfast on Saturday after the arrests of three men in the killings of two soldiers in Northern Ireland last week , police said .
Two people in masks prepare to throw petrol bombs Saturday in Lurgan , Northern Ireland .
Petrol bombs have been hurled at police in Lurgan , a town in County Armagh , 20 miles west of Belfast , police in Northern Ireland said .
There are gangs of youths on the streets , authorities said , but there have been no arrests or injuries .
Police announced the arrests on Saturday and said the three men have been taken to the police service 's Serious Crime Suite in County Antrim .
One of them , a dissident republican named Colin Duffy , is from Lurgan .
They are the first arrests in connection with the March 7 shootings , which were the first fatal attack on British troops in the province for more than 12 years .
The two British soldiers were shot dead at a base in Massereene , in Antrim , as they were preparing to ship out for duty in Afghanistan .
The soldiers , Cengiz " Pat " Azimkar , 21 , and Mark Quinsey , 23 , had already packed their bags and changed into desert uniforms , authorities said .
Two masked gunmen with automatic rifles shot them as the soldiers picked up a pizza delivery at the barracks , authorities said .
Two other soldiers and the two pizza delivery men were seriously wounded .
The shooting has sparked fears of a return to the sectarian violence that Northern Ireland suffered until the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 , a period known as The Troubles .
A militant splinter group , the Real IRA , reportedly claimed it had carried out the attack on the soldiers .
Two days after the soldiers were killed , a police officer was killed in a shooting southwest of Belfast .
Constable Stephen Carroll was one of four officers who were responding to call in Craigavon when his vehicle came under fire and he was killed .
Three people have been arrested in connection with the police officer 's death .
The Continuity IRA , a republican splinter group that does not accept the Good Friday Agreement , said it had killed Carroll , Britain 's Press Association reported .
Politicians from across the political spectrum have condemned the killings , with Sinn Fein deputy leader Martin McGuinness calling the killers " traitors to the island of Ireland . "
Sinn Fein is a predominantly Catholic party that wants Northern Ireland to leave the United Kingdom and become part of the Republic of Ireland .
The party is widely thought to be linked to the Irish Republican Army .
Danny Kennedy , deputy leader of the loyalist Ulster Unionist Party , which wants Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom , also condemned the attack as " wicked and murderous . "

Renowned Pentagon tech - tomfoolery agency DARPA has announced a new plan to create mighty artificial intelligences .
The so - called " Deep Learning " machines will be used to trawl through petabytes of video from robot aircraft prowling the skies - initially , apparently , seeking out threatening horses and cows .
According to DARPA boffinry chiefs , setting out the rationale for " Deep Learning " technology , the US military and spook communities are hip - deep in surveillance and intel data , and sinking fast .
Hence the need for artificial intelligence ( ha ha ) :
A rapidly increasing volume of intelligence , surveillance , and reconnaissance ( ISR ) information is available to the Department of Defense ( DOD ) as a result of the increasing numbers , sophistication , and resolution of ISR resources and capabilities .
The amount of video data produced annually by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) alone is in the petabyte range , and growing rapidly .
Full exploitation of this information is a major challenge .
Human observation and analysis of ISR assets is essential , but the training of humans is both expensive and time - consuming .
Human performance also varies due to individuals ’ capabilities and training , fatigue , boredom , and human attentional capacity .
One response to this situation is to employ machines ...
It seems there are already plenty of basic " shallow learning "
AIs in use , including such Stone Age expedients as " Support Vector Machines ( SVMs ) , two - layer Neural Networks ( NNs ) , and Hidden Markov Models ( HMMs ) " .
But these are scarcely better than a human with poor " attentional capacity " * .
The trouble with the shallow learners is that they can learn , erm , only at a shallow level :
Shallow methods may be effective in creating simple internal representations ...
A classification task such as recognizing a horse in an image will use these simple representations in many different configurations to recognize horses in various poses , orientations and sizes .
Such a task requires large amounts of labelled images of horses and non-horses .
This means that if the task were to change to recognizing cows , one would have to start nearly from scratch with a new , large set of labelled data .
In essence , a specialised horse - spotter machine unable to recognise a cow is n't much use for sorting the sheep from the goats .
( We 're plainly in the War On Livestock here . )
That 's why DARPA want " deeply layered " learning machines , able to apply horse sense to recognising cows , sheep and goats .
Deeply layered methods should create richer representations that may include furry , four - legged mammals at higher levels , resulting in a head start for learning cows and thereby requiring much less labelled data when compared to a shallow method .
A Deep Learning system exposed to unlabelled natural images will automatically create high - level concepts of four - legged mammals on its own , even without labels .
Chuck Norris Advocating Armed Revolution and Terrorist â€ œCellâ€ Tactics
Chuck Norris says it may soon be time to violently overthrow the U.S. government , and he ’s organizing “ cells ” around the country .
In his column at the far - right WorldNetDaily , he cites the national debt , Obama administration , and a lack of religious values , as reasons for putting out his call to action :
How much more will Americans take ?
When will enough be enough ?
And , when that time comes , will our leaders finally listen or will history need to record a second American Revolution ?
He says Texas will be leading the revolution , he quotes Sam Houston , he remembers the Alamo , he promises to “ run for president of Texas , ” and … wait , it keeps getting better !
He says he and Fox ’s Glenn Beck ( who says the Obama administration will put conservatives in FEMA internment camps ) have organized a telecast called “ We Surround Them , ” in which “ thousands of cell groups will be united . ”
And , to top it all off , he puts in a promo for his next martial arts event , so folks can see “ a good example of the raw Texas fighting spirit ” that ’s he is advocating .
Let me catch my breath .
Ok .
Wait .
Ok .
I can barely process how hilarious and absurd and infuriating this is .
Chuck Norris is advocating violent revolution , and having a conference call about it .
If an animal rights activist , environmentalist , anarchist , or any other “ domestic terrorist ” had put out an oped like this , and organized a conference call with cells , A CONFERENCE CALL WITH CELLS , the Joint Terrorism Task Forces would be kicking in doors RNC - style .
Geez , an American Idol star was labeled a “ terrorist ” for giving money to the Humane Society .
Animal rights activists in California have been indicted as “ terrorists ” for home protests .
Activists in Utah have been arrested as “ terrorists ” for allegedly releasing mink from fur farms .
Environmentalists have been sentenced to 20 years in prison for “ conspiring ” to destroy property .
And none of those people have harmed anyone , advocating harming anyone , or armed themselves to harm anyone .
This is n’t an isolated example of the blatant hypocrisy of the War on Terrorism .
Right - wing groups , for example , are n’t on the Department of Homeland Security ’s list of terrorist threats .
So why is n’t Chuck Norris a threat ?
Because the government crackdown on activists as “ terrorists ” has nothing to do with crimes or the potential for violence , it ’s about prosecuting ideology and chilling dissent .
Even though Chuck Norris is using extreme rhetoric , the ideology behind the rhetoric–religious fervor , capitalism , empire–is n’t a threat .
It ’s not dissent .
It ’s the norm .
And that ’s why , no matter how powerful his roundhouse kicks , and how many “ cells ” he organizes , Chuck Norris is less of a threat than animal rights activists with chalk .
RESTON , Virginia ( Reuters ) -
The finance chief of troubled U.S. mortgage giant Freddie Mac , David Kellermann , was found dead on Wednesday after apparently committing suicide , a police source said .
Kellermann , promoted to acting chief financial officer last September after the government took control of the company , was found hanging in the basement of his home in an affluent Washington suburb at around 5 a.m. ( 0900 GMT ) .
There was no immediate indication what would have driven 41 - year - old Kellermann , who was married and had a young daughter , to kill himself .
Kellermann , a 16 - year veteran of Freddie Mac , had played a key role in helping it to navigate past accounting scandals and answer questions from regulators and investors who put the company under intense scrutiny as a five - year U.S. housing market boom ended in 2006 .
Last year ’s government takeover of Freddie Mac and its sibling mortgage agency Fannie Mae came as the companies , known as government enterprises , faced deep losses and the effects of the housing crash engulfed other financial institutions .
Freddie Mac is currently being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission .
It has provided documents and made employees available for interview in the case but neither the company nor the SEC have given details .
“ Freddie Mac knows of no connections between this terrible personal tragedy and the ongoing regulatory inquiries discussed in our SEC filings , ” said Freddie Mac spokesman David Palombi .
The current probe is far less intense than the grilling several years ago after accounting and political fundraising scandals , several Freddie Mac employees said .
“ Back then , investigators took everything .
You ’d be lucky if they left your kids ’ pictures , ” said one long - time employee .
OUTGOING PERSONALITY
There have been several high - profile suicides of business executives around the world in the last six months as the financial crisis took hold .
While former colleagues said Kellermann and the accounting team had been under intense stress , he had an outgoing personality .
“ He was not like some introverted recluse of some sort , ” said Byron Boston , chief investment officer at mortgage REIT Dynex Capital , who was vice president and co-manager of Freddie Mac ’s mortgage portfolio group from 1997 to 2003 .
“ If you sat and worked with him every day , he was a fun guy . ”
Fairfax County police officials would not confirm the death as a suicide but said officers were called to Kellermann ’s home in Reston before dawn and found him dead in the basement .
“ We do not suspect foul play , ” said Fairfax County police spokesman Eddy Azcarate .
The county medical examiner would have no decision on Wednesday about the manner and cause of death , police said .
In September , Kellermann was awarded a retention bonus of $ 850,000 to be paid out over 18 months , Freddie Mac said .

Kellermann hired a private security firm after reporters came to his house to ask about his bonus several weeks ago when there was a public outcry over compensation at companies that have received government aid , the New York Times said .
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had a hand in about half of the entire U.S. mortgage market and were taken over in an effort to ward off further damage to the housing market .
“ From my understanding , he was working very , very hard , ” Boston said of Kellermann .
“ Accounting issues , the company gets taken over by the government , it ’s just a complete mess .
I could just imagine what kind of pressure that would put on you . ”
While Freddie Mac has seen its executive ranks churn since accounting improprieties first emerged in 2003 and it has booked multibillion - dollar losses in recent quarters , those who knew Kellermann spoke of his good character .

“ For many years , we have known David as a person of the utmost ethical standards who was hard - working and knowledgeable in his field , ” the Federal Housing Finance Board , Freddie Mac ’s chief regulator , said in a statement .
Before taking over as acting CFO , Kellermann had been senior vice president , corporate controller and principal accounting officer .
BOW TIES , CHRISTMAS DECORATIONS
He was known as a cheerful personality around the office with a light - hearted manner .
Former colleagues said he sometimes wore a bow tie .
He volunteered in the community with a charity for the homeless .
He and his wife had a daughter who neighbors said is aged about 5 or 6 .
“ They were the last people in the world you ’d think this would happen to , ” said Susan Unger , who lives across the street from the Kellermanns in the Hunter Mills Estates of million - dollar homes .
Unger and her husband said the Kellermanns were known on the street for having the fanciest Christmas decorations .
They even decorated their brick house for Halloween and with hearts for Valentine ’s Day .
Freddie Mac ’s interim chief executive , John Koskinen , visited the Kellermann home on Wednesday morning and later addressed employees , encouraging them to take time off if they needed to grieve .
Freddie Mac delayed for at least one day the routine sale of new notes .
The executive ’s death was the latest of several recent blows to Freddie Mac , including David Moffett ’s resignation as chief executive in March after just seven months on the job .
Kellermann ’s death followed several high - profile suicides in the global financial crisis .
German billionaire businessman Adolf Merckle threw himself in front of a train in January after heavy losses on the stock market .
Frenchman Thierry Magon de la Villehuchet , co-founder of money manager Access International , slit his wrists with boxcutters and was found dead in a New York office building in December , reportedly distraught over losing up to $ 1.4 billion in client money to Bernard Madoff ’s fraud .
Technology.am ( Apr. 9 , 2009 ) — Wind and solar are growing .
Coal is not .
As a result , those new electrons in the U.S. are green , says a new report from the Prometheus Institute .
The U.S. still derives the vast majority of its electricity from coal , natural gas and nuclear reactors , but the growth is all in renewables .
Approximately 90 percent of the new electrical capacity that will be brought on line in the U.S. in 2012 will come from renewables like solar , wind , geothermal , biomass and hydroelectric power , according to a new study from the Prometheus Institute .
The vast majority of the 18.6 gigawatts of renewable capacity that will come on line that year will consist of wind power .
Wind capacity will grow by 15.9 gigawatts in 2012 while solar will trail with 2.1 gigawatts .
Still , even solar should do better than fossil fuels in 2012 , according to Travis Bradford , president of Prometheus .
Fossil fuel capacity should grow by just over a gigawatt .
Although the growth rates may sound outlandish , they come as a result of pre-existing circumstances and trends .
States , such as California , are mandating that utilities increase the power they harvest from renewable resources and a national renewable standard seems likely .
By contrast , banks have pulled away from funding coal plants out of fears that carbon trading or taxing may come soon and increase the cost of power .
Ironically , in the U.K. , researchers are building wind turbine facilities on Old coal mines .
The study , though , assumes wind will grow at 17.5 percent and biomass will grow by 10 percent annually .
Nonetheless , renewables have been growing rapidly .
In 2000 , renewables accounted for a whopping 1 percent , or 279 megawatts of new generation capacity .
In 2005 , it jumped to 2.7 gigawatts or 17 percent .
Fossil fuel plants , meanwhile , dived in 2003 from 44 gigawatts of new capacity to 15.9 a year later .
The flip occurred last year .
9,015 megawatts worth of renewable capacity was added last year while only 8,407 megawatts worth of fossil fuel capacity was added .
An additional 720 megawatts of “ other ” power , i.e. , nuclear and fuel cells , was added to bring the total of new capacity to 18.1 gigawatts .
Overall , though , renewables account for only a small fraction of the U.S. energy diet .
Renewables accounted for only 7 percent of all of the energy consumed in America in 2007 , including petroleum , which clocked in a number one with 40 percent of the pie , according to the Energy Information Administration .
That 7 percent almost entirely consisted of hydroelectric power and biomass .
Solar and wind together represented only 6 percent of the seven percent .
Compton , Calif. , may keep it rocking but Denmark knows how to party .
Known as the “ Happiest Place on Earth , ” — sorry Disney , the Danes have the survey results to prove it — this Scandinavian hot spot offers a heap of fun , food and fabulousness .
But if you ’re stuck on a tour guide book or glued to a tourist Web site you just might miss the best Denmark has to offer .
So ditch the Lonely Planet and strap on your seatbelts because you ’re about to take a journey to 10 Places in Denmark Your Tour Guide Knows Absolutely Nothing About .
1. Cafe Globen
A travelers ’ café located in the heart of downtown Copenhagen , this non-profit establishment is run by travelers for travelers .
It ’s a unique gathering place where local Danes mix it up with visitors from all over the world .
The café serves drinks only but – get this – you can bring your own food !
That ’s a rarity in this tourist - sprinkled trendy district just off H.C. Andersen ’s Boulevard .
Show up and you just might see a slide show on someone ’s latest trip to Iran or sip on a Thai Beer .
The volunteers who run the café have plates and silverware .
Copenhagen native Claus Andersen who , along with a host of volunteers , runs the Café Globen , says meeting up with Danes at the beginning of your trip could make your trip in Denmark a whole lot easier .
“ A few contacts in advance [ are ] a very good thing in Denmark , ” he says , “ as they are not the most talkative bunch toward strangers . ”
Location : Turesensgade 000 13 .
Hours :
The café is only open after 5 p.m. until around 11 p.m. , local time .
If you get there early and are hungry try the Turesen , next door .
It ’s a restaurant that Andersen ’s says serves a traditional Danish meal for a wonderful price .
2. Folkets Hus
Denmark is legendary for its party scene as most of the bars do n’t close until 5 a .m.
But Folkets
Hus is more than a party – it ’s a revolution .
This counter - culture , post - modernist gathering place is like the American ‘ 60s revolution wrapped up in music , food and technology .
Its name translates into “ The People ’s House , ” and this denizen structure has been serving the people whatever they want for 25 years .
Folkets
Hus demonstrates the true Bohemian nature of Danes .
The gathering place has everything from music and dancing twice a month on Fridays , a choir that sings on Monday nights , Arabian dancing and something called “ folkekokken , ” which Tue Rasmussen at SpottedbyLocals.com describes as “ ecological meals . ”
In addition , you can find protestors and underground television and radio broadcasts .
Entry to the Folkets
Hus is free however they do ask for donations especially in their Cafe Under Construction .
Proceeds go to support causes selected by the Under Construction Fund , ran by the spot ’s duly elected board .
If heavy politics is n’t your thing just stop by Folkets Hus to see what all the fuss is about .
It ’s guaranteed to be an experience .
Location : Stengade 50 2200 N ( not far from Frederiksberg Hospital ) .
Café is closed on Monday but opened from 2 - 11 p.m. every other night .
3. WAS ( Wonderland Art Space )
Want to SEE the revolution but not BE the revolution ?
Then WAS , the Wonderland Art Space , is the place for you .
This independent art gallery showcases the work of local Danish artists as well as international folks .
This is n’t the Louvre but you are guaranteed to see some memorable styles and collections .
Ran by the Wonderland Magazine , WAS is an interesting stop on your tour of Denmark .
Location : Absalonsgade 21b , 1658 Copenhagen .
Just off of Vesterbrogade in Frederiksberg .
4. Grantoftegaard
O.K. , enough of the avant garde .
If you have children , or even if you do n’t , how about experiencing some old fashioned Danish countryside ?
For that take a jaunt to Ballerup County .
A place “ Where Towns Meets Country , ” Ballerup is about 15 KM ( 9 miles ) northwest of Copenhagen .
It has all the old world charm made famous by Hans Christen Andersen books and a lot of sophistication .
While there , check out Grantoftegaard , an organic farm where the kiddos can feed baby goats and partake of scrumptious green leafy stuff .
Location : Pederstrupvej 69 2750 Ballerup
5. Legelandet
And if the children still have too much energy then take them to this indoor play land .
A Danish Chucky Cheese , this protected playground offers hours and hours of harmless fun for young children .
Location : Legelandet Vejle , Friis Hansensvej 12 7100 Vejle and Legelandet Århus Holmstrupgaardvej 18 8220 Brabrand
6. Bjoernoe
Being voted off this island would sure be a bummer as it is one of the most beautiful secrets of the Danish landscape .
Denmark is , of course , partially surrounded by water and dozens of little islands dot its coastline .
But Bijoernoe , an archipelago , offers families , lovers and peace seekers a beautiful sanctuary .
Located off the coast of Faaborg , Denmark , this small island was once a safe haven for smugglers and WWII freedom fighters .
Now , however , it offers camping , a bed - and - breakfast and a few other comforts for wayward tourists .
Oh and it ’s a toad sanctuary .
Location : Faaborg is a two - hour drive from Copenhagen Airport and the island is a short ferry ride from there .
7. Egeskov Castle
For family fun , every guide book will list Tivoli Gardens a famous amusement park and “ pleasure garden , ” in Copenhagen but if you want something a little less touristy but still visitor - friendly then try Egeskov Castle .
Open from May 1 to October 4 this year , Egeskov offers parks , museums , camping , a playground and even mazes .
And of course there ’s the castle .
Completed in 1554 , Egeskov Castle is the “ best preserved moat castle in Europe , ” so its press promotion says .
It boasts more than 66 rooms , 200 windows , 171 doors and four mazes .
Let ’s you think this structure outdated the Egeskov ’s has a bioenergy company creating sustainable energy products including wood materials .
Location : Kvaerndrup is about two hours from the Copenhagen Airport .
Egeskov ’s Castle is Egeskov Gade 18 5772 Kværndrup
8. Vesterbro
If you ’re done exploring the hinterland come back to Copenhagen to trip the light fantastic with some Danish nightlife .
Vesterbro is n’t a place it ’s a destination .
Once a red - light district with all kinds of sinful pleasures available Vesterbro has been gentrified into a hip , classy , art district where everyone wants to be .
Now this is cheating because Vesterbro is in many tour guide books but try these local - holes - in - the - walls to soak up some local flavor while being fleeced like a tourist .
For eats and drinks try Lé Lé nhá hang , a Vietnamese restaurant with the flare for the dramatic .
Location : Vesterbrogade 40 .
For cinema try Vestervovvov , a small art - house theater with a café and a great avant garde line - up .
Location : Absalonsgade 5 1658 Kobenhavn V. And to party , well you can do that just about anywhere in Vesterbro .
9. Cafe Bartof
Where the locals go to eat , drink and listen to merry music , this small local hang out is intimate and intriguing .
Decked out in more wood than a pirate ship Bartof has the feel of a local bar and the charm of a post - modern gathering place .
( It has an art gallery upstairs . )
On any given day you can hear Irish lads sing songs of old or hill billy cowboys sing the blues .
If you want a leisurely bite and a even more laid - back good time then Café Bartof is for you .
Location : Nordre Fasanvej 46 2000 Frederiksberg .
10 . Frederiksberg Have
For a bit of the green check out Frederiksberg Have , a huge swath of green space in the middle of a bustling metropolis .
The park has a waterfall , romantic garden , beautiful landscaping and green grass as far as the eye can see .
The park is also close to the Copenhagen Zoo .
This is a wonderful place to wind down from your tour of Denmark .
Location : Frederiksberg Runddel 1A 2000 Frederiksberg .
And More
We ’re at the end of our story and we have n’t even scratched the surface of what Denmark has to offer .
There ’s Odense where famed fairytale writer Hans Christian was born .
There are the windmills in Kerteminde , a small town on the island of Funen in central Denmark .
But this list is n’t meant to be all inclusive .
Even if you do n’t visit all these places – know that Denmark has much more to offer than fish , fairytales and free health care .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday to allow U.S. citizens to travel freely to Cuba and predicted Congress would approve it as a step toward ending the five - decade - old U.S. embargo .
Vacationing Cubans sit in the waters near a beachfront hotel in Varadero , 90 miles ( 145 km ) east of Havana August 5 , 2008 .

“ I think there ’s sufficient votes in both the House ( of Representatives ) and the Senate to finally get it passed , ” Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan said at a news conference .
Dorgan , whose home state of North Dakota could benefit from increased agricultural sales to Cuba , introduced the bill along with fellow Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd and Republican Senators Richard Lugar and Mike Enzi .
Seventeen other senators also are sponsoring the measure .
A companion bill introduced in the House earlier this year has 121 co-sponsors .
Congressional opponents of any move to ease the embargo promised a tough fight to keep this measure from becoming law .
“ This is the time to support pro-democracy activists in Cuba , not provide the Castro regime with a resource windfall , ” Senator Mel Martinez , a Florida Republican who was the first Cuban - American elected to the Senate , said in a statement .
President Barack Obama said during last year ’s presidential campaign he favored easing U.S. restrictions on family travel to Cuba and the sending of cash to family members .
But he stopped short of supporting the lifting of the trade embargo , which a growing number of U.S. lawmakers believe has failed to bring about democratic change in communist - led Cuba .
Vice President Joe Biden told reporters “ no ” when asked in Chile on Saturday whether the United States would lift the embargo , as many in Latin American favor .
Obama is expected to face pressure from regional leaders to improve U.S. relations with Cuba when he travels to Trinidad in mid-April for the Summit of the Americas meeting .
COLD WAR ROOTS
Washington slapped economic sanctions on Cuba in 1960 after Fidel Castro ’s leftist government nationalized U.S. sugar mills , oil refineries and other assets .
A full U.S. embargo was enforced in 1962 as Cuba became a close Soviet ally .
Travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens was banned after the Cuban missile crisis , which brought the world close to nuclear war .
Efforts to loosen the embargo remain politically difficult because of the influence of Cuban - American emigres in Florida , a state often important in deciding U.S. elections .
Staunch anti-Castro exiles argue that allowing tourism and more trade with Cuba will help prop up communism on the island .
Dodd told reporters there were not enough votes in Congress to end the embargo completely .
“ My sense at this point is that ’s a step too far , ” Dodd said .
U.S. farm and business groups promised to lobby hard for removal of the travel restrictions .
“ The U.S. embargo on Cuba is a 50 - year failure , and lifting the ban on travel is a good first step toward a more rational policy , ” said Myron Brilliant , a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
The United States sold $ 710 million worth of soybeans , wheat , poultry and other agricultural goods to Cuba last year under a law passed in 2000 that allowed food sales as long as they were paid in cash in advance .
The Bush administration interpreted that law narrowly to frustrate sales and so far the Obama administration has said it would follow the same policy , despite recent legislation passed by Congress to overturn it .
Dorgan told reporters he expected Congress to pass new legislation to “ fix ” that problem blocking additional farm exports to Cuba .

JOHANNESBURG
Researchers have estimated that 1.2 million deaths in Africa were averted between 2004 and 2007 as a direct result of interventions funded by the US President 's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief ( PEPFAR ) .
Since former President George Bush launched the programme in 2003 , it has been widely praised as the largest and most ambitious health initiative dedicated to combating a single disease , but until recently the outcomes of this multibillion - dollar effort had never been measured .
Using figures from UNAIDS , researchers from Stanford University in the US compared HIV - related deaths , the number of people living with HIV , and HIV prevalence in 12 " focus " countries , selected by PEPFAR to receive funding , with 29 other countries in sub-Saharan Africa that are also experiencing generalised HIV epidemics .
They found that in the four years after PEPFAR 's activities started , the annual number of HIV - related deaths in the focus countries was 10.5 percent lower .
In an article published on the website of the Annals of Internal Medicine , the authors of the study noted that nearly half of PEPFAR 's expenditures went to providing antiretroviral ( ARV ) treatment , and that better ARV treatment coverage in the focus countries probably accounted for the lower death rates .
Based on the more than US $ 6 billion that PEPFAR had spent in the 12 countries by the end of 2007 , the researchers estimated the cost of each death averted at $ 2,450 .
In the focus countries , a slightly steeper increase in the number of HIV - positive people might also have been because those on ARV treatment were living longer .
However , the researchers found no evidence that PEPFAR 's activities had affected prevalence rates .
About one - fifth of PEPFAR 's resources were spent on prevention programmes during the study period , of which one - third were earmarked for abstinence - only programmes .
The authors raised the concern that , as the number of people receiving life - long ARV treatment in the focus countries increased , the cost of treatment would become unsustainable unless the number of new HIV infections could be substantially reduced .
" Striking the right balance between treatment and prevention , with insufficient resources for the burden of the epidemic , is a major challenge for comprehensive care programmes such as PEPFAR , " said the authors , who recommended ongoing evaluation .
In July 2008 the US Senate extended PEPFAR for another five years , with an increased budget of $ 48 billion .
" The commitment of funds by the US government is commendable , " the authors noted , " but it is crucial to ascertain that PEPFAR is effective , and that the investment in this programme is cost - effective .

Apple and the maker of the " Baby Shaker " iPhone app issued an apology Thursday for creating an app that was " greatly lacking in taste . "
Apple and the maker of the " Baby Shaker " iPhone app issued an apology Thursday for creating an app that was " greatly lacking in taste . "
" This application was deeply offensive and should not have been approved for distribution on the App Store , " Apple said in a statement .
" When we learned of this mistake , the app was removed immediately .
We sincerely apologize for this mistake and thank our customers for bringing this to our attention . "
" Yes , the Baby Shaker iPhone app was a bad idea , " according to a note on the Web site for Sikalosoft , which created Baby Shaker .
" You should never shake a baby !
Even on an Apple iPhone Baby Shaking application . "
Sikalosoft stressed that Apple approved its app , but acknowledged that it was in poor taste .
The app allows people with iPhones to download an image of a baby , which they then shake to death .
It has since been pulled .
" There are currently over 30,000 iPhone applications out there .
So , there are many other iPhone applications you could be better spending your time and money on , " Sikalosoft continued .
The company then listed its top 10 list of alternative apps , including Stick Wars , Flight Control , and Pocket God .
The app's appearance in the App Store - which came on the heels of Apple 's one billionth app download - drew fire from The Sarah Jane Brain Foundation , which helps children suffering from pediatric acquired brain injuries .
" As the father of a 3 - year - old who was shaken by her baby nurse when she was only 5 days old , breaking 3 ribs , both collarbones and causing a severe brain injury , words cannot describe my reaction , " Patrick Donohue , founder of the foundation , said yesterday .
Donahue sent an e-mail to Apple chief executive Steve Jobs and other Apple vice presidents with the same sentiments .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
The numbers are staggering , especially because the tallies are being measured in human beings : Caterpillar ( 20,000 layoffs ) , Alcoa ( 15,000 ) , Boeing ( 10,000 ) , Pfizer ( 8,300 ) , and tens of thousands more .
The toll of jobs lost in the United States since the recession began is heading toward three million .
Unlike previous downturns , this one is not confined to the tech or manufacturing sectors .
It is the Equal Opportunity Recession , winding its way into every corner of the economy .
To put faces on the numbers , Fortune interviewed dozens of jobless people across the country .
They are old and young , rich and poor , from rural Maine and urban California .
They are your neighbor or your nephew .
Or they are you .
They may be from radically different backgrounds , but these job seekers have a few things in common : frustration , fear - and resilience .
They want to work .
They have treated unemployment as a full - time job in itself because they have learned that in the end , they have only themselves to rely on .
Here are their stories .
Where the people feel like spare parts
Annette Ison , 48 , Barbara Philpot , 50 , and Michele Scales , 52 , of Dayton
In her final weeks as an assembly - line worker , Barbara Philpot spent an entire summer just sitting and waiting for her time to run out .
" My last day was Aug. 31 , 2007 , " recalls Philpot , a 22 - year factory veteran , " but they had already closed down the facility .
All we did was sit in an auditorium and sleep or play cards .
It was depressing .
They gave us a lunch our last day for everybody who was still there , a fried - chicken lunch .
Who wants a piece of chicken when you know your demise is coming ?
I 'd rather have had the $ 5 it cost . "
Philpot and her former co-workers Michele Scales and Annette Ison had collectively spent almost six grimy but gratifying decades in the factories of Dayton , where they worked for auto - parts maker Delphi ( spun off from GM in 1999 ) .
Philpot ran a giant welding machine , Ison worked on the line , and Scales had just finished training to be a factory plumber .
They never thought they'd be the last of their families to work at the plants , but GM 's decline accelerated more quickly than anyone imagined .
In 2005 , Delphi filed for bankruptcy protection .
By the fall of 2007 the three women were spare parts .
" Dayton has always been an automotive city , " says Ison , " but it 's becoming a dried - up town . "
In Moraine , the suburb where the three women worked , the community is ebbing as well .
Thirty - year - old family restaurants are closing .
Foreclosure signs are spreading like cracks in a sidewalk .
The women still feel resentment from others who remember when Delphi was part of the GM ( GM , Fortune 500 ) gravy train .
" I get so tired of people thinking that because you worked at GM , life is so great , " says Philpot .
" Life is a day - to - day struggle now .
I used to love my job .
I wish every day I wake up that I could punch my clock and do my eight hours .
I never , ever dreamed it would end up like this . "
Former Delphi union employees do have some benefits .
With unemployment and supplemental pay , they 'll receive health care and about 70 % of their hourly wages until 2010 .
They also get money to go to school .
But there have been misunderstandings , particularly about the terms of the severance .
All three women mistakenly thought they were entitled to more money .
They did n't understand that they had to go to school to keep collecting unemployment , and did n't know there would be restrictions on what they could study .
Bad enough they 'd been laid off .
Now they had to take midterms ?
" The last time I was in school I had ovaries , " says Scales , who has undergone 21 surgeries in the past five years due to complications from a mastectomy and hysterectomy .
Scales had just finished her training in May 2007 when she was told she'd have to help pack up the company 's equipment .
" I shipped my job to Mexico , " she says .
Scales ' experience is in industrial , not residential , plumbing , and she says there are no industrial jobs out there .
Now she 's hoping to land a management position in plumbing by completing an associate 's degree .
Unable to get funding for that , Scales took out a student loan .
" I 'm in foreclosure .
I do n't know how long I can stay in my house .
That 's another thing that makes it hard to study .
I feel like my life is depending on this . " --

Next : A career counselor takes his own advice
A group of citizens showed up on Tuesday in Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard 's office .
They were wondering where the 2006 Pima County ballots , the subject of an election fraud investigation , are being kept .
One early report indicated the ballots were being stored by Maricopa County -- hardly a model of intact chain of custody itself .
The Pima County ballots had been secretly removed from a secure storage facility about a week earlier .
Jim March , a member of the board of directors for Black Box Voting ; John Brakey , of AuditAZ , and other Pima County citizens wanted to know where the ballots are now -- who has access , what are the security arrangements , how can their integrity be verified ?
THE STORY SO FAR :
The Pima County May 2006 RTA election stinks .
If it was n't rigged , somebody went to a lot of trouble to make it LOOK crooked .
Last week Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard caught at least part of a clue and decided to step in .
Wonderful .
NOT SO GREAT :
He came and grabbed the ballots from the SECURE private facility where they were locked up ( Iron Mountain Storage in Pima County ; Iron Mountain is a firm that specializes in secure document storage and escrow ) and hauled the ballots away to points unknown .
This took place , in secret , some time around Feb. 24 this year .
Arizona citizens decided to tell him .
MARICOPA'S SPOTTY CHAIN OF CUSTODY HISTORY
The most critical Maricopa County ballots , scheduled for a post-election hand count spot check during the 2008 general election were handed over to Sheriff Joe Arpaio for several days ; one controversy on these ballots involved Sheriff Joe Arpaio 's race .
More absurd :
In Maricopa County , chain of custody is supposedly secured with numbered seals .
Maricopa ordered 20 copies of each number ;
Ten were given to elections workers and the elections office kept 10 more .
Ordering even ONE duplicate numbered seal automatically breaks the chain of custody because it allows a person to replace a seal with another of the same number .
Sending 10 with the poll workers lets them break in and replace the seals over and over , and giving 10 more to the elections office adds opportunity for insiders to swap ballots before handing them over for hand count spot checks .
DOES MARICOPA HAVE THE PIMA COUNTY BALLOTS ?
Once they got to Maricopa County , the Pima County citizens started asking around .
Was Maricopa County elections keeping the Pima County ballots ?
No , said Assistant Director of Maricopa Elections office Rey Valenzuela .
Maricopa does n't have the ballots , but has been tasked with doing the hand recount for the Pima County RTA ballots .

A perennial problem in human - computer interaction is getting machines to understand emotional concepts like sarcasm , irony and understatement .
Now , however , researchers at the MIT Media Lab may have made a breakthrough .
They 've built a system that has scanned through 1.2 billion tweets with a natural emotional labelling system attached - emoji .
" Our basic idea with our DeepMoji project is that if the model is able to predict which emoji was included with a given sentence , then it has an understanding of the emotional content of that sentence , " explains the team 's project page .
" With this approach we beat the state of the art across benchmarks for sentiment , emotion , and sarcasm detection . "
Try it yourself
You can try the software yourself by heading over to deepmoji.mit.edu and typing in a short sentence .
The algorithm will predict which emoji should accompany it .
It 's pretty good at figuring out exactly what you mean .
" The classic use case is companies wanting to make sense of what their customers are saying about them , " wrote the team .
" But there are many other use cases as well now that natural language processing ( NLP ) is becoming an increasingly important part of consumer products . "
They continued : " For instance , all of the new chatbot services popping up might benefit from having a nuanced understanding of emotional content in text .
Lastly , it can hopefully be used for various interesting research purposes . "
To that end , the team plans to soon release the code so that it can be used by other researchers .
The Eclipse Foundation has announced the release of Eclipse Riena 1.0 , a platform for developing multi-tier rich client applications based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform ( RCP ) and Equinox .
Riena Core is an OSGi - based Remote Services Component for creating distributed client / server applications .
The 1.0 release of Riena delivers a set of components which include :
Remote Services allows for the communication and coordination between OSGi - based components on a client and server , enabling truly distributed component deployment .
Riena User Interface and Navigation Components provide developers with the frameworks and building blocks that accelerate the development of the client user experience for business - centric applications .
Object Transaction allows developers to isolate the object level changes on a client application before communicating those changes to a server .
This enables more efficient client / server communication and client rollback of changes .
Authentication and Authorization extend the Equinox Security model to allow for security in a distributed system .
Client Monitoring is a server component that tracks the status of each client in a distributed system .
For more information on Riena you can check out a previous InfoQ article , visit the “ Getting Started Guide ” or read the series of articles by Elias Volanakis .
Also the Riena wiki outlines the basic principles behind it .
Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœCash for trashÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , is a recycled plan to promote the theory that bankers know what they are doing and financial institutions are Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœsoundÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢.
Geithner is now promoting Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœtoxic debtÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , which was previously declared immeasurable on banksÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ books .
They are being marketed as being worth much more than anyone is currently willing to pay for them .
In fact , their Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœtrue valueÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ is so high that if they were properly priced , banks would not be in this mess .
So letÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s use taxpayerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s monies to drive up prices and give it to hedge funds .
The catch , there is always a catch , if asset values go up , investors profit , but if they go down , the investors can walk away from their debt .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¦Ã¢â‚¬Â¦Ã¢â‚ ¬Â¦a stroke of pure genius !
The US $ is stronger in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is higher against 12 of the 16 most actively traded currencies , in another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
Yesterday , Geithner introduced his Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœnotÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ well kept secret of off loading toxic assets ( should it not be toxic liabilities ) .
The initial reaction has been another Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnewÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ recycled plan with few surprises and whose success depends on active participation .
Madoff would be proud of this scheme .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the PPIP or Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœPublic - Private Investment ProgramÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ which will provide Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœ$ 500b in purchasing power to buy legacy assetsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ .
The program includes financing assistance from the Fed and FDIC .
Treasury will Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœprovide 50 % of the equity capitalÃ¢â‚¬â „¢ , while the private sector will manage the investment ( another way to promote Hedge funds ! ) .
The private sector manager will be overseen by the FDIC .
What a no - brainer , being insured for losses !
The structure of the plan is to encourage private participation .
Another scheme to delay defaultÃ¢â‚ ¬Â ¦..
Existing US home sales once again surprised to the upside yesterday ( +4.72 m vs. +4.45 m ) .
Record foreclosures are finally attracting bargain hunters back into the market .
Median house prices have slumped close to - 16 % y/y last month ( $ 165 k from $ 195 k , 2nd - biggest drop on record ) , and distressed properties accounted for +45 % of all sales .
The US$ currently is higher against the EUR - 0.32 % , CHF - 0.04 % and JPY - 1.26 % and lower against GBP + 0.42 % .
The commodity currencies are weaker this morning , CAD - 0.06 % and AUD - 0.17 %. 50 % of CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s total export revenue is commodity based .
So , it was no surprise yesterday to see the loonie gain ground on the back of the US TreasuryÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s program to help banks dispose of Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœdistressed assetsÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ which boosted global equity and commodity prices .
The currency has soared over the last couple of trading sessions as the USD $ has plummeted vs. its biggest trading partners .
Robust commodity prices have certainly given the currency a temporary leg up .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s all about the big dollar , for now look to sell USD rallies as long as commodities remain buoyant .
The AUD gained for a 11th consecutive day ( longest winning streak in nearly 3 - years ) on the back of the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœcash for trashÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ idea that has boosted speculation that the global recession may subside .
Global growth is the key to this commodity high yielding asset .
The FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s plan to keep interest rate yields low will only weaken the USD $ further and promote the higher yielding AUD$ ( 0.7042 ) .
In this current environment one should expect better buying on pull backs .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 53.38 down - 42 c ) .
The covert weak dollar policy is becoming a boom for crude prices .
Oil advanced yesterday to its highest level in nearly 4 - months as the greenback suffered once again vs. the EUR , thus boosting demand for most commodities as a hedge against inflation .
The depth and scope of the FedÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s announcement on quantitative easing has temporarily at least instilled optimism about the outlook for the US economy .
This has given crude the desired support and certainly helping OPEC with its own problems .
We are back to moving on the USD $ , crude prices rose 10 % last week and year to date has advanced 17 % .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not just OPECÃ ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s support that Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s pushing crude higher .
Demand destruction remains a concern , there is nothing to suggest that demand has increased or will increase in the short term .
Crude prices could remain vulnerable unless the greenback continues on this path of weakness .
Even last weeks weekly EIA report was bearish for crude prices .
Inventories climbed + 1.94 m barrels to +353.3 m vs. an expected increase of + 1.5 m .
Supplies of gas and distillate fuel ( heating oil and diesel ) also increased .
US demand dropped - 0.6 % last week to +18.8 m barrels a day , while total daily fuel demand over the past month was + 19.1 m , down - 3.2 % from a year ago .
Gold remains under pressure as the rally in global equities has eroded the appeal of the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœyellowÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ metal as an alternative asset ( $ 933 ) .
The Nikkei closed 8,488 up +272 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 4,218 up + 42 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 3,961 up +10 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year Treasury yields eased 1 bp yesterday ( 2.65 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Despite global equities aggressively advancing after GeithnerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœnewÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ proposed plan to deal with toxic assets on banks balance sheets , treasuries remain better bid on pull backs .
As per usual , traders continue to cheapen up the front of the yield curve ahead of another record $ 98b issue of new debt this week .
However , policy makers are now determined that yields will not rise given the current economic environment after last weeks FI buyback announcement .

UN ’s Anti-Blasphemy Resolution restricts free speech , promotes Islam
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ji-qdC5zYd4If an U.N. Anti-Blasphemy Resolution is passed , it will outlaw criticism of Islam in any form .
Even talking about the religion ’s influence on terrorism could be a crime .
“ A group of 57 Organization of Islamic Countries , ” a February 25 Lou Dobbs report says , “ the largest block at the United Nations , has been pushing it , out of concern , it says , for anti-Islamic behavior , saying , “ This resolution is a major step towards sensitizing the international community on the serious impact of defamation of religions … . ”
“ While appearing in name to promote tolerance , the implementation of this concept actually fosters intolerance and has served to justify restrictions on human rights and fundamental freedoms . ”
Backers of the Anti-Blasphemy Resolution say their goal is simply to curtail speech that offends religion , specifically Islam .
Religious groups and free speech advocates say the true goal is to extend the influence of Sharia law in the West .
The attached video is shocking .
So shocking that you ’ll immediately wonder why every major news organization has n’t carried it .
This measure is obviously in direct conflict with the U.S. Constitution and a clear violation of free speech .
Lou Dobbs is outraged .
Leftwing icon Christopher Hitchens is outraged .
We ’re outraged .
You ’ll undoubtedly be outraged , too .

Pasadena , CA — Using information from a suite of telescopes , astronomers have discovered a mysterious , giant object that existed at a time when the universe was only about 800 million years old .
Objects such as this one are dubbed extended Lyman - Alpha blobs ; they are huge bodies of gas that may be precursors to galaxies .
This blob was named Himiko for a legendary , mysterious Japanese queen .
It stretches for 55 thousand light years , a record for that early point in time .
That length is comparable to the radius of the Milky Way 's disk .
The researchers are puzzled by the object .
Even with superb data from the world 's best telescopes , they are not sure what it is .
Because it is one of the most distant objects ever found , its faintness does not allow the researchers to understand its physical origins .
It could be ionized gas powered by a super - massive black hole ; a primordial galaxy with large gas accretion ; a collision of two large young galaxies ; super wind from intensive star formation ; or a single giant galaxy with a large mass of about 40 billion Suns .
Because this mysterious and remarkable object was discovered early in the history of the universe in a Japanese Subaru field , the researchers named the object after the legendary mysterious queen in ancient Japan .
" The farther out we look into space , the farther we go back in time , " explained lead author Masami Ouchi , a fellow at the Observatories of the Carnegie Institution who led an international team of astronomers from the U.S. , Japan , and the United Kingdom .
" I am very surprised by this discovery .
I have never imagined that such a large object could exist at this early stage of the universe 's history .
According to the concordance model of Big Bang cosmology , small objects form first and then merge to produce larger systems .
This blob had a size of typical present - day galaxies when the age of the universe was about 800 million years old , only 6 % of the age of today 's universe ! "
Extended blobs discovered thus far have mostly been seen at a distance when the universe was 2 to 3 billion years old .
No extended blobs have previously been found when the universe was younger .
Himiko is located at a transition point in the evolution of the universe called the reionization epoch — it 's as far back as we can see to date .
And at 55 thousand light years , Himiko is a big blob for that time .
This reionizing chapter in the universe was at the cosmic dawn , the epoch between about 200 million and one billion years after the Big Bang .
During this period , neutral hydrogen began to form quasars , stars , and the first galaxies .
Astronomers probe this era by searching for characteristic hydrogen signatures from the scattering of photons created by ionized gas clouds .
This image of the Himiko object is a composite and in false color .
The thick horizontal bar at the lower right corner presents a size of 10 thousand light year .
( Photo Credit :
This image is created by M. Ouchi et al. , which is the reproduction of Figure 2 in the article of The Astrophysical Journal May 2009 - 10 v696 issue . )
The team initially identified Himiko among 207 distant galaxy candidates seen at optical wavelengths using the Subaru telescope from the Subaru / XMM - Newton Deep Survey Field located in the constellation of Cetus .
They then made spectroscopic observations to measure the distance with the Keck / DEIMOS and Carnegie 's Magellan / IMACS instrumentation .
Himiko was an extraordinarily bright and large candidate for a distant galaxy .
" We hesitated to spend our precious telescope time by taking spectra of this weird candidate .
We never believed that this bright and large source was a real distant object .
We thought it was a foreground interloper contaminating our galaxy sample , " continued Ouchi .
" But we tried anyway .
Then , the spectra exhibited a characteristic hydrogen signature clearly indicating a remarkably large distance — 12.9 billion light years ! "
" Using infrared data from NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope , radio data from the VLA , and X - ray imaging from the XMM - Newton satellite , we were able to estimate the star - formation rate and stellar mass of this galaxy and to investigate whether it contains an active nucleus powered by a super - massive black hole , " remarked James Dunlop a team member at Edinburgh .
" We found that the stellar mass of Himiko is an order of magnitude larger than other objects known at a similar epoch , but we cannot as yet tell if the center houses an active and growing black hole . "
" One of the puzzling things about Himiko is that it is so exceptional , " said Carnegie 's Alan Dressler , a member of the team .
" If this was the discovery of a class of objects that are ancestors of today 's galaxies , there should be many more smaller ones already found — a continuous distribution .
Because this object is , to this point , one - of - a- kind , it makes it very hard to fit it into the prevailing model of how normal galaxies were assembled .
On the other hand , that 's what makes it interesting ! "
Full Title : “ Watch Me Crank Dat Statham Boy , Then IronMan Dat Hoe ”
[ the hoe in question being either Amy Smart or Pepper Potts ]
Maybe Iron Man should call his friend , James “ BROdey ” Rhodes .
Guys , come in close .
Closer .
I want to level with you for a minute .
I want to bare my soul .
This comic was extremely difficult to make .
Not because the art was particularly challenging , and not because I tripped over the verbage .
It was the subject matter .
Making fun of “ Crank 2 ” is like making fun of a movie where a guy has his heart removed ( for some reason ) and replaced with a robot heart that runs on a laptop battery which must constantly be recharged through a series of escalating violent and sexual exploits .
Ridiculous , right ?
The premise already so comical that in order to make a joke about it I had to reach into a parallel universe and pluck out a character that might be able to relate to Jason Statham ( I think his name in teh film is Crank - O ) through the shared experience of having one ’s pulmonary system artificially and forcibly augmented by foreigners .
Sometimes my job is hard .
I was pleased to read , however , that “ Crank 2 ” does n’t take itself seriously enough to get caught up in the trappings of it ’s own absurd plot devices .
It seems , rather , that the movie has fun with it ’s own stupidity by constantly upping the anty in terms of over the top violence ( strippers shot in the chest leak breast implant goo… seriously ) , action and sex ( Statham is at one point urged to “ rub up against some one ” to create enough static electricity to “ charge his battery … the battery is his penis ) .
So I suppose if you want to replace your brain with an artificial brain that has to be fed a steady stream of tits , gore , car chases and explosions ( that REALLY does n’t sound all that bad actually ) , “ Crank 2 ” might be just the thing to keep your robo - brain from entering sleep mode .
WHO WANTS TO PLAY “ CRANK MAD LIBS ” ?
In “ Crank 3 , ” [ group/ethnicity / organization ] steal Jason Statham ’s [ body part / penis ] and replace with with a [ noun ] that has to be [ verb ]ed every hour or it [ someting bad ] ’s all over the place .

Scotland Yard last night suspended a second officer over brutality allegations after fresh video surfaced showing him striking a woman who was attending a vigil in honour of Ian Tomlinson , the man who died after being attacked by police at the G20 protests .
The officer , a sergeant , was the second person from the Territorial Support Group to be suspended in the last week .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission announced it would investigate the alleged attack by the TSG sergeant , the second time in a week the police watchdog has announced an investigation after media revelations .
The footage and series of photographs were taken at the Bank of England the day after Tomlinson 's death .
The latest footage appears to show the officer hitting a woman across the face with the back of his hand , and saying : " Go away . "
The woman , clutching a carton of orange juice and digital camera , remonstrates with the officer .
He is then seen drawing a baton from his pocket and striking the woman on her legs .
The officer 's badge number was concealed .
" People were there for the vigil out of respect to remember Ian Tomlinson , " said Tristan Woodwards , 25 , who caught the incident on film .
" Police officers have to be held accountable . "
David Winnick MP , a member of the home affairs select committee , said last night the footage showed " more totally unacceptable " behaviour by a police officer .
He added : " The home secretary should make a statement about events at the G20 protests .
That statement should include first and foremost Ian Tomlinson 's death and explain why police made a totally misleading statement about their contact with him . "
The first officer to be suspended came forward after the Guardian last week published footage of his clash with Tomlinson .
It is believed the officer suspended last night had not come forward , but Scotland Yard would not say how he had been identified .
The new claims of brutality came as the chair of the IPCC faced renewed criticism after he wrongly claimed there was " no CCTV footage " in the area where police allegedly assaulted the newspaper vendor before he died .
The IPCC said yesterday that Nick Hardwick had been mistaken when he said there were no security cameras around Royal Exchange Passage , a pedestrianised area near the Bank of England where an officer struck Tomlinson with a baton and pushed him to the ground .
Tomlinson , 47 , had his hands in his pockets and his back to police when the attack occurred around 7.20 pm on 1 April .
He collapsed and died moments later .
The IPCC is investigating whether the attack caught on footage obtained by the Guardian last week was an isolated incident or the culmination of a series of unprovoked assaults on Tomlinson .
The father of nine had been trying to walk home when he was confronted by police at the G20 protests .
A first postmortem concluded that Tomlinson had died of a heart attack .
The results of a second examination is expected within days .
Hardwick said on Thursday there was no CCTV evidence of alleged police assaults on Tomlinson .
" We do n't have CCTV footage of the incident , " he told Channel 4 news .
" There is no CCTV footage - there were no cameras in the locations where he was assaulted . "
Yesterday , after pictures were published showing cameras in the area , the IPCC said : " [ On Thursday ]
Mr Hardwick believed that he was correct in this assertion - we now know this may not be accurate .
There are cameras in the surrounding area . "
An IPCC spokesperson said while there may have been cameras in the area , that did not mean the watchdog had discovered footage of any alleged assaults .
The IPCC would not comment on why , a week after it said " investigators have looked at many hours of CCTV " .
City of London police manage and control the public CCTV cameras in the area , including at least one that overlooks Royal Exchange Passage .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the rights group Liberty , said she had " serious concerns " about the IPCC 's leadership , whose confusion over CCTV was " very worrying for the investigation " .
" You have to ask the question :
Where are they getting their information from ?
Are they taking [ City of London ] police at their word ?
" If the IPCC can't grip this investigation and win back the public confidence that was lost in the Jean Charles de Menezes case , then I think patience will run out . "
There were at least two cameras on or beside Royal Exchange Passage .
One , on the corner of Threadneedle Street , is a City of London police camera that can turn through 360 degrees .
An IDF reservist writes to a family in Gaza , " I was the soldier who slept in your home . "
The letter , published in Ma'ariv , was translated by IMRA .
Hello ,
While the world watches the ruins in Gaza , you return to your home which remains standing .
However , I am sure that it is clear to you that someone was in your home while you were away .
I am that someone .
I spent long hours imagining how you would react when you walked into your home .
How you would feel when you understood that IDF soldiers had slept on your mattresses and used your blankets to keep warm .
I knew that it would make you angry and sad and that you would feel this violation of the most intimate areas of your life by those defined as your enemies , with stinging humiliation .
I am convinced that you hate me with unbridled hatred , and you do not have even the tiniest desire to hear what I have to say .
At the same time , it is important for me to say the following in the hope that there is even the minutest chance that you will hear me .
I spent many days in your home .
You and your family 's presence was felt in every corner .
I saw your family portraits on the wall , and I thought of my family .
I saw your wife 's perfume bottles on the bureau , and I thought of my wife .
I saw your children 's toys and their English language schoolbooks .
I saw your personal computer and how you set up the modem and wireless phone next to the screen , just as I do .
I wanted you to know that despite the immense disorder you found in your house that was created during a search for explosives and tunnels ( which were indeed found in other homes ) , we did our best to treat your possessions with respect .
When I moved the computer table , I disconnected the cables and lay them down neatly on the floor , as I would do with my own computer .
I even covered the computer from dust with a piece of cloth .
I tried to put back the clothes that fell when we moved the closet although not the same as
you would have done , but at least in such a way that nothing would get lost .
I know that the devastation , the bullet holes in your walls and the destruction of those homes near you place my descriptions in a ridiculous light .
Still , I need you to understand me , us , and hope that you will channel your anger and criticism to the right places .
I decided to write you this letter specifically because I stayed in your home .
I can surmise that you are intelligent and educated and there are those in your household that are university students .
Your children learn English , and you are connected to the Internet .
You are not ignorant ; you know what is going on around you .
Therefore , I am sure you know that Kassam rockets were launched from your neighborhood into Israeli towns and cities .
How could you see these weekly launches and not think that one day we would say " enough " ?!
Did you ever consider that it is perhaps wrong to launch rockets at innocent civilians trying to lead a normal life , much like you ?
How long did you think we would sit back without reacting ?
I can hear you saying " it 's not me , it 's Hamas " .
My intuition tells me you are not their most avid supporter .
If you look closely at the sad reality in which your people live , and you do not try to deceive yourself or make excuses about " occupation " , you must certainly reach the conclusion that the Hamas is your real enemy .
The reality is so simple , even a seven - year - old can understand : Israel withdrew from the Gaza Strip , removing military bases and its citizens from Gush Katif .
Nonetheless , we continued to provide you with electricity , water , and goods ( and this I know very well as during my reserve duty I guarded the border crossings more than once , and witnessed hundreds of trucks full of goods entering a blockade - free Gaza every day ) .
Despite all this , for reasons that cannot be understood and with a lack of any rational logic , Hamas launched missiles on Israeli towns .
For three years we clenched our teeth and restrained ourselves .
In the end , we could not take it anymore and entered the Gaza Strip , into your neighborhood , in order to remove those who want to kill us .
A reality that is painful but very easy to explain .
As soon as you agree with me that Hamas is your enemy and because of them , your people are miserable , you will also understand that the change must come from within .
I am acutely aware of the fact that what I say is easier to write than to do , but I do not see any other way .
You , who are connected to the world and concerned about your children 's education , must lead , together with your friends , a civil uprising against Hamas .
I swear to you , that if the citizens of Gaza were busy paving roads , building schools , opening factories and cultural institutions instead of dwelling in self - pity , arms smuggling and nurturing a hatred to your Israeli neighbors , your homes would not be in ruins right now .
If your leaders were not corrupt and motivated by hatred , your home would not have been harmed .
If someone would have stood up and shouted that there is no point in launching missiles on innocent civilians , I would not have to stand in your kitchen as a soldier .
You do n't have money , you tell me ?
You have more than you can imagine .
Even before Hamas took control of Gaza , during the time of Yasser Arafat , millions if not billions of dollars donated by the world community to the Palestinians was used for purchasing arms or taken directly to your leaders ' bank accounts .
Gulf States , the Emirates - your brothers , your flesh and blood , are some of the richest nations in the world .
If there was even a small feeling of solidarity between Arab nations , if these nations had but the smallest interest in reconstructing the Palestinian people – your situation would be very different .
You must be familiar with Singapore .
The land mass there is not much larger than the Gaza Strip and it is considered to be the second most populated country in the world .
Yet , Singapore is a successful , prospering , and well - managed country .
Why not the same for you ?
My friend , I would like to call you by name , but I will not do so publicly .
I want you to know that I am 100 % at peace with what my country did , what my army did , and what I did .
However , I feel your pain .
I am sorry for the destruction you are finding in your neighborhood at this moment .
On a personal level , I did what I could to minimize the damage to your home as much as possible .
In my opinion , we have a lot more in common than you might imagine .
I am a civilian , not a soldier , and in my private life I have nothing to do with the military .
However , I have an obligation to leave my home , put on a uniform , and protect my family every time we are attacked .
I have no desire to be in your home wearing a uniform again and I would be more than happy to sit with you as a guest on your beautiful balcony , drinking sweet tea seasoned with the sage growing in your garden .
The only person who could make that dream a reality is you .
Take responsibility for yourself , your family , your people , and start to take control of your destiny .
How ?
I do not know .
Maybe there is something to be learned from the Jewish people who rose up from the most destructive human tragedy of the 20th century , and instead of sinking into self - pity , built a flourishing and prospering country .
It is possible , and it is in your hands .
I am ready to be there to provide a shoulder of support and help to you .
But only you can move the wheels of history .
Regards ,
Yishai , ( Reserve Soldier )
The above was a letter that was originally published in the Hebrew - language daily newspaper Ma'ariv , and translated into English by the Independent Media Review and Analysis ( IMRA ) .
April 1 , 2009 ( WASHINGTON ) –
The humanitarian situation resulting from the six years conflict in Darfur is an “ obscenity ” , the widow of the late Jordanian King Hussein said on Tuesday .
Jordan ’s Queen Noor ( Reuters )
“ Darfur is an obscenity .
The sources of that conflict are very complex but what has happened , is happening to people on the ground is absolutely unacceptable by any norms ” Queen Noor said in an interview with CNN .
Asked about support by Arab leaders at the annual summit in Qatar this week , Queen Noor said that “ is a reflection of Arab concern over double standards ” .
“ Were there not so many cases where western pressure brought to bear on Arabs but Israel for example , disproportionate killings of civilians in Gaza during the recent [ assault ] and also in Lebanon in 2006 during the crisis there ” she said .
“ If those cases had not taken place with relatively without little western outcry you would find a very different attitude I think towards what is taking place in Sudan ” Queen Noor added .
Arab leaders in Doha united firmly behind Sudan ’s leader against the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) last month for his alleged role in Darfur war crimes .
The Arab League resolution rejected the warrant and called on the court to annul it and urged its members not to cooperate with it .
The US - born Queen said “ it is perverse what is taking place [ support to Bashir ] ” but argued that it is a result of the perception of double standards in the region .
“ Arabs see the United States which is not a signatory to the International Criminal Court holding Bashir responsible but turning a blind eye to gross human right violations in the occupied territories [ Gaza and West Bank ” she added .
Many people in the Middle East decry what they perceive as double standards in international justice where alleged war crimes by Israel against Lebanese or Palestinians , or by the United States in Iraq , go unpunished .
Jordan is one of the three Arab states who have ratified the ICC ’s Rome Statute and its officials have said they will fulfill their obligations under the treaty despite endorsing the resolution this week .
During his speech at the Arab League summit , Jordan ’s King Abdullah said that it is necessary to deal with the ICC “ with the utmost sense of awareness and responsibility to ensure Sudan ’s security , unity , independence and sovereignty ” .

At least three agencies are investigating whether someone stole donors ’ credit card numbers from the campaign of former U.S. Sen.
Norm Coleman .
And the state attorney general has been asked to look into whether the campaign broke any laws .
The campaign clammed up Friday , citing the inquiries , as criticism continued .
A local law professor says he believes the campaign “ clearly ” broke two state laws , and a nationally recognized cyber - security guru called part of the campaign ’s explanation “ idiotic ” and straining belief .
Earlier this week , a campaign attorney said he believed the campaign broke no laws , and Coleman cast himself as a victim of data theft .
The data was exposed to anyone with an Internet search engine for part of Jan. 28 .
On Tuesday night , the self - described whistleblower Web site WikiLeaks.org blew the story open by e-mailing more than 50,000 people — whose names were contained on two databases , one of which included full credit card numbers and security codes of some 4,700 people — with the news that their information had been compromised .
The next day , as proof , WikiLeaks posted two spreadsheets showing only the last four digits of the credit card numbers and the security codes .
It has n’t been verified that the spreadsheets came from the Coleman Web site , but the campaign said it ’s operating under the assumption they were , and a number of people contacted by the Pioneer Press said they donated online and that the credit card numbers and codes are real .
The U.S. Secret Service , state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and St. Paul police said Friday they have opened investigations , and the state attorney general ’s office has received a written complaint against the campaign from a Minneapolis Web developer who posted the complaint on the Internet .
A spokesman for Attorney General Lori Swanson declined to comment on whether an investigation was open .
David Schultz , a professor at Hamline University School of Business , said he believes the campaign broke two state laws .
One prohibits anyone from keeping the three - or four - digit security codes that mark the front or back of credit cards .
“ That clearly , clearly , looks like they violated that law , ” he said .
The second is a law that requires immediate disclosure as soon as credit card data is compromised .
The campaign began notifying donors only after WikiLeaks ’ announcement .
“ The law does n’t seem to say that there actually has to be a theft but a possible compromise of the consumer database , ” Schultz said .
That ’s a direct contradiction to top Coleman campaign officials , who claim they said nothing after the Jan. 28 exposure of the data because law - enforcement officials told them no one had actually accessed the data .
Campaign attorney Fritz Knaak has said the Secret Service told the campaign “ they had a virtual certainty ” of that .
“ That ’s idiotic .
There ’s no other way to say it , ” said Bruce Schneier , founder of an information security company and a nationally recognized expert who lives in Minneapolis .
Investigators know good hackers can cover their tracks to make it impossible to detect a sneak , he said .
Moreover , he said , on Jan. 28 , no one needed to hack anything to get the data .
Schneier used the analogy of a house that was n’t broken into , but rather was left with the front door wide open .
“ How can you say nobody walked in ? ” he said .
“ I ca n’t believe the feds or any investigator was that stupid .
So either he ( Knaak ) misunderstood or is lying . ”
The Pioneer Press e-mailed the campaign with a series of questions about these issues .
Spokesman Tom Erickson responded , in part : “ Given the sensitive nature of this attack , we will have no further comment on … this matter while it is under active investigation . ”
The Coleman for Senate campaign filed a report Thursday with St. Paul police .
A person named Tyler Olson “ called to report a breach of an Internet server ” between Jan. 28 and Wednesday , a report said , noting “ no suspect information . ”
Meanwhile , the WikiLeaks site itself drew more curiosity Friday .
Its media office e-mailed at least some of those named on its spreadsheets and told them , “ Several national news organizations , such as the AP , and local organizations in MN have asked us for your feedback . ”
It went on to say that the media groups had a “ pool ” agreement in which WikiLeaks would act as a conduit for a request for a “ one - time comment ” of each supporter .
It promised them confidentiality .
Doug Glass , Minnesota news editor for the Associated Press , said the AP knew nothing of this .
WikiLeaks spokesman Jay Lim acknowledged the AP was not involved after the Pioneer Press , which also had no such agreement , questioned him .
Lim did not respond to a request about which news organizations had agreed to a pool .
Such a third - party pooling agreement would be highly unusual because the media already have access to the donors ’ contact information and because the Coleman campaign has questioned the involvement of WikiLeaks in what it has called “ theft . ”

Misdemeanors such as assaults , thefts and burglaries will no longer be prosecuted in Contra Costa County because of budget cuts , the county 's top prosecutor said Tuesday .
District Attorney Robert Kochly also said that beginning May 4 , his office will no longer prosecute felony drug cases involving smaller amounts of narcotics .
That means anyone caught with less than a gram of methamphetamine or cocaine , less than 0.5 grams of heroin and fewer than five pills of ecstasy , OxyContin or Vicodin wo n't be charged .
People who are suspected of misdemeanor drug crimes , break minor traffic laws , shoplift , trespass or commit misdemeanor vandalism will also be in the clear .
Those crimes wo n't be prosecuted , either .
" We had to make very , very difficult choices , and we had to try to prioritize things .
There are no good choices to be made here , " said Kochly , a 35 - year veteran prosecutor .
" It 's trying to choose the lesser of certain evils in deciding what we can and cannot do . "
Barry Grove , a deputy district attorney who is president of the Contra Costa County District Attorneys Association , said , " There 's no question that these kinds of crimes are going to drastically affect the quality of life for all the citizens of Contra Costa County . "
The decision not to go after any perpetrators of certain offenses , Grove said , amounts to " holding up a sign and advertising to the criminal element to come to Contra Costa County , because we 're no longer going to prosecute you . "
Do n't even bother submitting the cases , Kochly said Monday in a memo to the Contra Costa County Police Chiefs Association .
" If they are submitted , they will be screened out by category by support staff and returned to your department without review by a deputy district attorney , " he wrote .
Kochly wrote that he had long taken pride in saying that his office could do " more with less . "
" Unfortunately , we have now reached a point where we cannot maintain the status quo , " he said .
" We will definitely be doing ' less with less ' as a prosecution agency . "
The changes are needed to help eliminate a $ 1.9 million budget deficit in the district attorney 's office for this fiscal year .
By month 's end , six deputy district attorneys will be laid off , and 11 more will have to be let go by the end of the year , Kochly said .
The county Board of Supervisors originally proposed cutting the office 's budget by $ 4.1 million .
But after Kochly argued that such a reduction would hurt his ability to prosecute petty thefts , the board used sales - tax revenue to close the gap .
Supervisor John Gioia , who represents Richmond , said the list of crimes that Kochly says he wo n't prosecute is far longer now than what he told the board during its budget deliberations .
" I do n't think it 's a good idea for the chief prosecutor in the county to inform the public at large what cases they 're not going to prosecute , " Gioia said .
The district attorney 's decision was upsetting news to Janet Kelleghan , an employee at Donna 's Gifts in Concord , which has been victimized by thieves in the past .
" If they know they 're not going to be prosecuted , there 's going to be a lot more shoplifting , " Kelleghan said .
" I 'd ask them to reconsider , " she said of the district attorney 's office .
Kochly said prosecutors will still consider charging suspects with certain misdemeanors , including domestic violence , driving under the influence , firearms offenses , vehicular manslaughter , sex crimes and assault with a deadly weapon .
Almost 50 days into his administration President Obama made his way around to what strikes me as America ’s # 1 long - term issue , education .
The soundbite is pretty catchy : he wants to overhaul the system “ from the cradle up through a career . ”
A compelling sentiment , that is .
Our educational system could n’t be much more broken , and a righteous keelhauling overhauling is certainly in order .
But the rhetoric does n’t tell us a lot .
For instance :
“ We have let our grades slip , our schools crumble , our teacher quality fall short and other nations outpace us , ” Obama said in an address to the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce .
“ The time for finger - pointing is over .
The time for holding ourselves accountable is here . ”
“ The relative decline of American education is untenable for our economy , unsustainable for our democracy and unacceptable for our children , and we cannot afford to let it continue , ” he said .
Great speechwriting , but two people who disagree violently on every point from root causes to optimal solutions might find themselves standing and cheering wildly and slapping each other on the back at these words .
So , as best we can tell , what does Mr. President actually plan to do ?
Let ’s go line by line .
The president outlined a five - tier reform plan , starting with increased investments in early childhood initiatives .
Obama noted that the recently passed $ 787 billion stimulus plan includes an additional $ 5 billion for Head Start , a program to help low - income families .
He highlighted a proposal to offer 55,000 first - time parents “ regular visits from trained nurses to help make sure their children are healthy and prepare them for school and life . ”
He also pledged to boost federal support in the form of “ Early Learning Challenge ” grants to states that develop plans to strengthen early education programs .
Excellent .
As I noted earlier this week , we need to “ invest heavily in early childhood reading programs , because nothing better energizes subsequent , lifelong learning .
” I was taught to read when I was four and by the first day of first grade I was reading at the 4th grade level , or better .
I never looked back .
The only real problem is that since all the other kids had n’t had this advantage , I spent most of my school years bored out of my skull .
But the basic fact is that thanks to my early reading education , everything – everything – came easier to me .
The same is true across the board .
Invest in early reading and you ’re strengthening every link in the educational chain for each and every affected student .
It ’s a shame that early childhood health has to be addressed by a special program , and an even bigger shame that Republicans will oppose it as “ socialism , ” but yes , this seems like a good idea , too .
Second , Obama called for an end to “ what has become a race to the bottom in our schools ” through lower testing standards .
Echoing former President Bush ’s call to end “ the soft bigotry of low expectations , ” Obama said states needed to stop “ low - balling expectations ” for students .
Few good things ever begin with “ Echoing former President Bush . ”
But it ’s not clear whether Obama was echoing Dubya or whether the CNN reporter hung that albatross around his neck .
So let ’s proceed … carefully .
“ The solution to low test scores is not lower standards ; it ’s tougher , clearer standards , ” he argued .
Those two guys who hate each other are applauding and high - fiving again .
At the same time , however , he urged states to develop standards “ that do n’t simply measure whether students can fill in a bubble on a test but whether they possess 21st century skills like problem - solving and critical thinking , entrepreneurship and creativity . ”
Okay , now I ’m on my feet cheering and high - fiving .
Problem - solving ?
Critical thinking ?
Are there really more essential skills out there ?
Are there more neglected skills ?
To help promote this goal , Obama said he would push for funding in the No Child Left Behind law to be more effectively tied to results .
The Education Department , he said , would “ back up this commitment to higher standards with a fund to invest in innovation in our school districts . ”
Errr , wait a goddamned minute .
No Child Left Behind , the worst atrocity that ’s been visited on American education in my lifetime ?
No Child Left Untested , the hellspawn of the “ Texas Miracle ” ?
The single biggest reason why we abandoned critical thinking and problem solving in the first place ?
Because the cure for the plague is more plague ?
And what the hell does NCLB have to do with innovation , anyway ?
No , folks , this is not promising .
What next ?
Obama ’s third tier focused on teacher training and recruitment .
He noted that federal dollars had been set aside in the stimulus plan to help prevent teacher layoffs .
He also reiterated a promise to support merit pay , as well as extra pay for math and science teachers with the goal of ending a shortage in both of those subjects .
At the same time , however , the president warned that ineffective teachers should not be allowed to remain on the job .
“ If a teacher is given a chance but still does not improve , there is no excuse for that person to continue teaching , ” he said .
“ I reject a system that rewards failure and protects a person from its consequences . ”
Here Obama is paying cheap lip - service to the opponents of public education ( and in the process insulting the rest of us ) .
No , none of us are in favor of bad teachers .
No , none of us are getting excited about the prospect of a system that aggressively seeks to provide tenure for half - trained monkeys .
In short , this is , as worded , a non-issue .
The why is simple .
As I explained in December of 2007 , education is like most other professions : you get what you pay for .
The rhetorical double - dealing and intellectual dishonesty from the Right on this issue is knee - buckling .
On the one hand , we need vouchers and and privatization so that the king - hell majesty of the marketplace can solve the problem of government - induced mediocrity .
On the other , we do n’t believe that the basic laws of economics apply to the task of attracting good teachers .
So in the interest of helping Mr. President and the assembled crowd at Corruptapalooza to which he ’s pandering , let ’s revisit Econ 101 for a second : when you raise compensation , you attract better talent .
Pay teachers what they deserve – something that approaches fair compensation for the service they provide – and you ’ll find that the scourge of welfare queens from Detroit unqualified teachers begins to magically cure itself as highly qualified people who opted for jobs they could make a living at opt back into the thing they really want to do , forcing the less qualified types to seek employment elsewhere .
This is n’t to suggest that we do n’t have fantastic teachers today – we do , by the boatload .
But these are people who are willing to make some sacrifices that other talented people are n’t , and we ’ll never get our system where it needs to be – no matter what kind of system we implement – until we can get the words “ teacher ” and “ sacrifice ” a little better separated .
Fourth , Obama called for the promotion of educational “ innovation and excellence ” by renewing his campaign pledge to support charter schools .
He called on states to lift caps on the number of allowable charter schools .
[ sigh ]
Okay , I know that data vary from place to place , and I ’m the last guy to hang his hat on standardized testing results , at least as they ’re currently configured .
But nationally , charters lag behind by a significant margin .
So let ’s put it this way .
At best , there ’s hardly enough data to make charter schools a significant component of your plan .
So that ’s discouraging .
He also urged a longer school calendar .
“ I know longer school days and school years are not wildly popular ideas , ” Obama said .
“ But the challenges of a new century demand more time in the classroom . ”
This I like .
The nine - month calendar made more sense in an agrarian society , perhaps , but these days there ’s a lot to be said for making learning a year - round endeavor .
Obama ’s final reform initiative focused on higher education .
Among other things , the president promised to boost college access by raising the maximum Pell Grant award to $ 5,550 a year and indexing it above inflation .
He also promised to push for a $ 2,500 a year tuition tax credit for students from working families .
Half - measures .
It ’s like the house is on fire so let ’s toss a glass of water on it .
We need to get serious about assuring a comprehensive , appropriate education for all citizens .
This does n’t necessarily mean a four - year college , but it does mean making sure that our brightest and best are n’t saddled with six - figure debt that they ’ll never get paid off .
This , to me , looks like a plan for reducing six - figure debt to a high five - figure debt .
Which is to say , you ’re pointed in the right direction , now walk it like you mean it .
In promoting his program , the president called for an end to the “ partisanship and petty bickering ” that many observers believe has typically defined education policy debates in the past .
I suppose one way of minimizing partisan backlash is to give the other side what it wants right up front .
Okay , maybe I ’m being unduly bitchy in spots here .
While there are things not to like in what Obama appears to be proposing , it also must be said that it ’s far better than what we ’ve seen from any other president this century .
So fingers crossed .
Rest assured , Mr. President , we ’ll be watching , and we ’ll be doing so with some of those critical thinking skills you touted so highly in making your announcement .
There is no doubt that the new Israeli government , led by Benyamin Netanyahu , honestly reflects the collective mindset of the Israeli Jewish Zionist society .
True , there are Israelis who are averse to racism and fascism , but these are unfortunately very few in numbers and their influence is almost negligible .
Indeed , a fleeting glance at the composition of the new Israeli cabinet reveals an extremist coalition of war criminals , pathological liars , racist thugs ( both of the Hitlerian and Stalinist styles ) , and hateful religious maniacs who inhale and exhale hatred 24 hours per day .
For those who do n’t know him , Benyamin Netanyahu is a pathological liar par excellence .
His modus operandi is based on dishonesty , mendacity , prevarication , and deception .
Despite his public relations babbling about “ peace with our neighbors , ” the man is firmly anti-peace , against the creation of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and against equal rights for Jews and non-Jews .
He is actually an enthusiastic advocate for Judaizing East Jerusalem by checking Arab demographic growth , demolishing Arab homes and denying Jerusalemites their natural rights to build homes to meet natural growth .
This brazenly racist policy is known as “ narrowing Arab horizons ” and its ultimate goal is to force the Arab inhabitants of Al - Qods , or as many of them as possible , to leave the city and emigrate for good .
Netanyahu ’s venomous racism is not confined to the Palestinians of the “ occupied territories ” or the “ Shtachem ” as the West Bank and Gaza Strip are often referred to in Hebrew .
He was quoted on several occasions as demanding that “ measures ” be taken to prevent Israel ’s Palestinian citizens from reaching the 30 % threshold .
Furthermore , Netanyahu who often invokes the concepts of civility , democracy and western culture , especially when addressing naïve western audiences , actually believes that Israel should embark on a massive campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinians if and when the international community , particularly the US , would tolerate such a scenario .
In 1989 Netanyahu told students at Bar - Ilan University that “ Israel should have exploited the repression of the demonstrations in China , when world attention focused on that country , to carry out mass expulsions among the Arabs of the territories . ”
Well , for those who take the word “ transfer ” lightly , they should know that “ transfer ” is only a euphemism for genocide .
If such is the character of the premier , one can have a clear idea about his lieutenants and ministers from Avigdor Lieberman , to the gurus of Gush Emunim ( the settler movement ) , who are shamelessly demanding that non-Jews in Israel - Palestine be either exterminated , deported or enslaved as water carriers and wood hewers in the service of the master race !
And then there is the irredeemably opportunistic war criminal Ehud Barak who insists rather arrogantly that the army that exterminated hundreds of Gaza children with White Phosphorus just two months ago is the most moral army in the world .
Netanyahu is not stupid .
He realizes that his ideological convictions are too ugly and too fascist to be accepted by the international community , including the US , Israel ’s guardian - ally .
This is why he is going to mislead the world by blurring and hiding , as much as possible , his government ’s fascist nature .
He will heavily resort to employing “ diversionary tactics ” such as “ terror , ” “ Iran , ” “ anti-Semitism , ” and “ Hamas ” to distract attention away from the fascist and criminal platform of his government .
He will shout “ Auschwitz , Treblinka , Mauthauzen , Bergen Belsen ” whenever Israeli crimes are exposed and criticized .
He will claim that Israel will not allow itself to be pushed to the brink Auschwitz whenever Israel is demanded to end its Nazi - like occupation of the Palestinian homeland and allow the Palestinian people the right to independence and self determination .
In short , we are talking about a man who lies as often as he breathes a dishonest politician who thinks hasbara and smart public relations can be a more effective substitution for an honest peace process based on human rights and international law .
This is why , the capitals of the world must not allow themselves to be duped , deceived and cheated by this notorious , cardinal liar .
I am , of course , in no way suggesting that the previous Israeli government was less nefarious than the new one .
The previous government of the evil trio- Olmert , Livni , and Barak - had all the hallmarks of a Zionist Third Reich .
What else can be said of a government that ordered its army to exterminate and incinerate thousands of civilians with White Phosphorus , and then shamelessly claimed that it did n’t really mean to do it ?
However , that government was considered by many states around the world , such as the gullible Europeans , a “ government of peace , ” a “ liberal , ” even “ leftist government , ” which really gave a new meaning to the term “ verbal fornication . ”
For us Palestinians , and despite the legitimate and understandable anxiety stemming from the rise of fascism in Israel , it is still better to have in Israel a manifestly fascist government pursuing fascist policies than a deceptively “ liberal ” or “ leftist ” government pursuing the same criminal policies .
Let the world see Israel as it really is .
In the final analysis , an honest criminal is better than a lying saint .
At least the former is predictable and consistent .
The campaign is focusing on the calorie content of alcohol Many people are unaware of the calorie content of alcohol , a survey shows .
Four in 10 did not know a glass of wine has the same calories ( 120 ) as a slice of cake , or that a pint of lager and a small sausage roll have 170 each .
The poll of 2,000 adults in England was carried out as part of the government 's drive to curb people 's drinking habits .
The campaign also stresses that a heavy drinking session is often followed by an unhealthy breakfast , which again helps to pile on the pounds .
The Know Your Limits campaign has in the past focused on other consequences of drinking , such as disease risk .
But to coincide with the focus on weight , the Department of Health carried out research showing a regular beer drinker , who downed five pints a week or 250 over the course of a year , packed away the same number of calories as someone eating 221 doughnuts over the space of 12 months .
It also revealed the average wine drinker consumed 2,000 calories each month .
Over the course of a year , that is the equivalent of eating an extra 38 roast beef dinners .
Health minister Phil Hope said : " Regularly drinking more than our recommended daily limits can have a knock - on effect on our health , including an expanding waistline .
" It 's not only the calories in the drinks themselves that can help to pile on the pounds , we 're also more likely to eat fatty foods when we 've had one too many . "
Heather Caswell , of the British Nutrition Foundation , added : " Most people would baulk at consuming a full glass of single cream , but would n't think twice about a couple of pints .
" But the calorie content is similar and , over time , excess alcohol intake is likely to lead to weight gain . "
And a spokesman for the Drinkaware Trust added :
It 's imperative we are in the know when it comes to what we are drinking . "

Last week it was a rumor .
Today it 's a fact .
The Eee PC ( model 1004DN ) will be the first Eee with a Super - Multi optical disc drive .

The 10 - inch netbook is ordinary in every other way , loaded with the typical N280 Atom chipset ( that 's the newer one ) , 1GB RAM , 120GB hard drive , Wi-Fi , and Bluetooth .
And while it may look like a bit like a Mac , from what we can tell , the body is aluminum only around the keyboard , meaning that the underside is still plastic .

The 1004DN is 3.2 pounds ( when loaded with a 6 - hour , 6 - cell battery ) and 1.3 inches thick at its chunkiest point .
It should begin shipping overseas in April , but there 's no word on pricing at this time .

GRAND RAPIDS --
Police today reported an 11 - percent drop in serious crime , with significant decreases in homicides , burglary , auto theft and vandalism .
" I 'm really impressed -- I 'm stunned -- by the work you guys have done , " 2nd Ward Commissioner David LaGrand told police Chief Kevin Belk and commanders during the commission 's Public Safety Committee meeting .
Belk said he believed partnerships between police and community groups , including after - school and faith - based programs , neighborhood groups , crime analysis and strong police work contributed to the decline during 2008 .
CRIME STATS
Here are selected crimes reported in Grand Rapids in 2007 and 2008
Murder : 22 ( 2007 ) , 16 ( 2008 )
Rape : 79 , 97
Robbery : 778 , 760
Aggravated assault : 1,186 , 1,101
Burglary : 2,656 , 2,258
Larceny : 7,229 , 6,462
Vandalism : 2,358 , 1,565
Weapons : 116 , 142
Fraud : 655 , 613
Forgery / counterfeit : 123 , 286
Embezzlement : 7 , 78
He still had concerns about crimes such as robbery , which hit a decade high of 778 in 2007 , and declined only 2 percent last year .
But overall , he considered the report to be extremely good news for the city and its residents .
Weapons offenses increased 22 percent , but Lt. Patrick Merrill , who compiled the report , said it is a positive sign because the statistics show police were able to get those weapons off the streets .
Rapes , which are narrowly defined under federal guidelines , increased by 23 percent , but other sex offenses dropped by 11 percent .
Police believe that organizations that work with young victims of sexual assault provided information to children that probably resulted in increased reporting of such crimes .
About a third of the instances of sexual assault involved children 12 and under , often victimized in their homes .
Police increasingly have relied on crime analysis to develop crime trends , and assign officers to known " hot spots . "
Police also have worked to improve information sharing throughout the department , and get information to officers on the street as soon as possible .
Patrol officers , interviewing an increased number of burglary suspects in the field , probably led to a 15 - percent decline in burglaries , authorities said .
First Ward Commissioner James Jendrasiak said he was concerned about the amount of gang graffiti that has turned up recently .
" It 's getting disgusting , " he said .
Belk said it is a problem , but appears worse this time of year because those who work to cover it are limited during the winter months .
Incidents of vandalism , which includes graffiti , dropped 34 percent last year .
" I do agree it is a significant problem we have yet to get our hands around , " Belk said .
Belk said he remains concerned about those ages 16 to 24 , who are involved in a disproportion amount of crime .

IT IS the most detailed map of its kind ever created , showing 110,000 " nearby " galaxies , within 2 billion light years of our world .
Every dot is " another Milky Way , with billions of stars , " said Heath Jones , the leader of a team of Australian astronomers that spent 10 years undertaking the survey in an effort to unravel one of modern astronomy 's biggest mysteries .
The galaxy we live in is at the centre of the pattern , mapped by Dr Chris Fluke , Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing , Swinburne University of Technology .
It is not just the economies of the world that are collapsing .
Far out in space , countless galaxies are plunging towards each other at speeds that cannot be explained by the collective gravitational tug of their stars .
Scientists suspect the mysterious pulling power is dark matter - so called because , despite making up the majority of the stuff in the universe , it is invisible .
The blushes of US officials over the low - flying passage of a 747 jet above downtown Manhattan on Monday have turned a deeper shade of red after it was that the authorities informed New York in advance but ordered the details to be kept secret from the public .
The flyover of a member of the president 's Air Force
One fleet , accompanied by two fighter jets , prompted mass panic on the streets among hundreds of New Yorkers who feared a repeat of 9/11 .
Many downtown offices were vacated , and the emergency services flooded with distress calls .
The stunt , costing $ 328,835 of taxpayers ' money , was designed as a publicity photo shoot to get a picture of the presidential plane with the Statue of Liberty in the background .
But it backfired , forcing President Obama to apologise .
" It was a mistake , as was stated ... and it will not happen again , " Obama said .
He has let his anger over the incident be known , and has ordered a probe into what happened .
It now transpires that the Federal Aviation Administration , in charge of the project , did inform key agencies ahead of the flyover , in full awareness of the possibility that low - flying planes could provoke unease among New Yorkers in the wake of 9/11 .
The New York police , the FBI and the Secret Service that protects the president were all told , but were ordered to keep the event secret even to the extent of federal sanctions being imposed if the news leaked .
The mayor 's office was also informed , though in that case there were blushes for other reasons .
The manager who was informed by the aviation administration forgot to pass it up the line to Mayor Bloomberg , and was reprimanded .
" I think we 've all learned something from it and now it 's time to make sure our procedures are better and to get on with other things , " Bloomberg said .
" It does seem like it was a waste of money , but that 's up to the federal government . "
Tea prices are surging .
Is your mug next ?
By Kabir Chibber
Business reporter , BBC News
The tea leaves in this cup were probably bought and sold in Mombasa Your cup of tea may be about to get more expensive .
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) says that demand exceeded supply in 2008 , driving up the cost of tea .
Tea consumption reached 3.85 m tonnes last year , up 4.8 % from 2007 .
But production was only 3.78 m tonnes , according to the FAO 's preliminary estimates .
Tea was in surplus in 2007 , but it seems the recent shortfall can only get bigger .
" This explains the current price hike , which shows that traders are expecting the worst , " said Kaison Chang , an economist who works in the FAO 's tea division in Rome .
Tea prices have soared as drought has hit Kenya hard in the past year , as well as Sri Lanka and India , which is the world 's biggest producer of tea .
Traders ' fears
" There 've been reports of a 15 % drop in production in Sri Lanka alone in January and February due to the drought , " Mr Chang said .
If the shortfall turns out to be as deep as expected , then prices will go through the roof
Kaison Chang , FAO
All this has not gone unnoticed in Mombasa , a Kenyan coastal city of white sand and blue water that hosts tea auctions .
These weekly auctions , which sell most of the tea produced in Africa , pretty much set the benchmark for the price of the crop throughout the world .
The average price of tea last year was $ 2.33 / kg , almost a third higher than $ 1.76 /kg in 2007 , according to Kenya 's tea board .
Black tea had jumped to a record of $ 2.70 last August .
But Mr Chang said he had heard reports that the price of tea had now breached $ 3/kg in recent weeks , as the scale of the crop shortfall became clear .
The new oil ?
It may get even higher as tea traders worry the production gap will get larger .
Kenya , which is Africa 's largest grower of tea , will probably produce 328 million kg of the crop this year , the Tea Board of Kenya said this month .
That is well below the 345 million kg produced last year .
" If the shortfall turns out to be as deep as expected , then prices will go through the roof , " Mr Chang said .
But much in the same way that rising crude oil prices push up the cost of petrol at the pump , this too is likely to increase the price of High Street brand teas .
The UK is the second - biggest importer of tea in the world , behind Russia , so any costs of the raw materials will either have to be absorbed by the teamakers or passed on .
British tea companies are also suffering from the decline in the pound against the dollar for the past year .
Whittard of Chelsea said that the market was going through an " uncertain period " .
" Areas are certainly suffering drought and there is no reserve of tea , so shortages exist , " said Giles Hilton , Whittard 's product director .
" Some prices might need reviewing soon , " he said .
With global demand continuing to rise , there is little sign that production is going to be able to match .
More expensive cups of tea may have to become a fact of life .

Carey Price Waves Goodbye To Canadiens Fans
Total Pro Sports –
If you missed the game last night , the Montreal Canadiens were swept by the Boston Bruins in the first round of the 2009 NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs .
In the second period after the Bruins took a 4 - 1 , Canadiens goaltender Carey Price had a Patrick Roy moment and waved to his hometown fans as they cheered sarcastically that he made a save .
“ Oh , Patrick Roy moment for Carey Price !!!!!! ”
Said the announcer
Back in 1995 in his final game as a Hab , Patrick Roy allowed 9 goals in an 11 - 1 loss to the Detroit Red Wings and waved to the crowd as the fans cheered when he finally stopping a puck .
After he was pulled he walked over to Team President Ronald Corey who was sitting behind the bench and told him he was done as a Canadien .
Patrick Roy was then traded to the Colorado Avalanche and that same year went on to win the Stanley Cup .
So where does this leave Carey Price and and his future with the Canadiens ?
They have another good goalie in Jaroslav Halak who many think should have been in since game three in this series .
Is Carey Price done in Montreal ?
He showed he can act like Roy , but will he ever be able to play like him ?

Copenhagen wants to bring carbon - dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions down to zero and become the first carbon - neutral capital city by 2025 .
The target was announced by the seven mayors of the city while launching Copenhagen ’s new climate plan .
As a city that has so many green habits already this seems very achievable .
The plan involves the initial reduction of CO2 emissions by 20 % by 2015 , and 50 clear initiatives have been outlined to achieve that target .
The business community and the local inhabitants have been invited to work closely with the city ’s administration towards achieving these ambitious goals .
The development of a new geothermal power station is one of the initiatives to achieve a CO2 - neutral Copenhagen by 2025 and it would increase the production of geothermal heat by 600 % .
Such a project would cost the city about $ 183.33 million .
Professor Hendrik Lund of the Department of Development and Planning at Aalborg University ( Aalborg , Denmark ) , said that a new power station could be set up within six to seven years .
Lund ’s paper observes that Copenhagen could utilize geothermal energy to generate up to 50 % of the district heating requirements .
Klaus Bondam , Mayor of Technical and Environmental Administration , said that instead of choosing the easiest solutions to reduce greenhouse gases , Copenhagen would implement the green solution to create a healthy city .
The other initiatives of the city ’s climate plan include the use of hydrogen - powered and electric cars that could be parked for free in parking areas and recharged at street corners .
The plan also includes the refurbishment of educational institutions , increased use of wind turbines , development of a wind power project , and the use of biomass in power stations to ensure that the energy produced is carbon - neutral .
According to results of a recent survey , the ground a few kilometers beneath Copenhagen has enough hot water to fulfill all the heating requirements of the eastern Zealand district for thousands of years .
The survey reports that the geothermal reserves under the city contain about 70 times more energy than required by Denmark to fulfill its heating , electricity and transportation needs .
Jesper Magtengaard , an engineer of DONG Energy ( Copenhagen ) , has said that new calculations show that it is economically feasible to allow building heating systems to absorb heat from the water , send the used water back underground , allowing it to be reheated , and then reuse it for district heating .
Although using geothermal energy is not comparable with the existing power and heat plants in the short - term , it is a plan that could be developed for the long - term .
Denmark currently has two operating geothermal plants .
The plant in the town of Thisted in Jutland was set up in 1984 , while the second plant is located on the island of Amager , which is a part of Copenhagen .
Copenhagen already has three large - scale waste - combustion plants that produce surplus heat during summer .
According to the project manager for the heating plan for the capital , Thomas Hartmann , setting up a geothermal plant now would be less economical than continuing with the existing biomass - and waste - fueled heat and power plants .
Copenhagen will host three climate conferences in December 2009 .
The United Nations ’ Framework Convention on Climate Change summit will outline the new paths to be followed to fight climate change after 2012 , when the first stage of the Kyoto Protocol concludes .
The two other summits are the Children ’s Climate Change Forum and a mayors ’ summit , which is expected to generate practical methods that can be followed by municipal bodies to fight climate change .

Winston Churchill is an example to council workers , campaigners say Council leaders have compiled a banned list of the 200 worst uses of jargon , with " predictors of beaconicity " and " taxonomy " among the worst horrors .
The Local Government Association says such words and phrases must be avoided for staff to " communicate effectively " .
Cliches such as " level playing field " and inscrutable terms like " re-baselining " have been prohibited .
LGA chairman Margaret Eaton said : " The public sector must not hide behind impenetrable jargon and phrases . "
Local and central government are often criticised for their use of language .
' Coterminous , stakeholder engagement '
The LGA 's list includes suggested translations of some terms , such as " measuring " for the civil servant 's favourite " benchmarking " , " idea " for " seedbed " , " delay " for " slippage " and " buy " for " procure " .
For most , though , no explanation is forthcoming or , perhaps , possible .
Town hall workers are urged not to use the words " mainstreaming " , " holistic " , " contestability " and " synergies " .

The French word " tranche " , meaning " slice " in conventional English , is also banned .
Ms Eaton said : " Why do we have to have ' coterminous , stakeholder engagement ' when we could just ' talk to people ' instead ?
" During the recession , it is vital that we explain to people in plain English how to get access to the 800 different services that local government provides with taxpayers ' money .
" Councils have a duty , not only to provide value for money to local people , but also to tell people what they get for the tax they pay .
People would be furious if they have no idea of what services their cash is paying for and how they should get to use them . "
' Gobbledegook '
She added : " Unless information is given to people to explain what help they can get during a recession then it could well lead to more people ending up homeless or bankrupt .
" If a council fails to explain what it does in plain English then local people will fail to understand its relevance to them or why they should bother to turn out and vote .
" We do not pretend to be perfect , but as this list shows , we are striving to make sure that people get the chance to understand what services we provide . "
A Plain English Campaign spokeswoman said : " This gobbledegook has to go .
Jargon has its place within professions but it should not be allowed to leak out to the public , as it causes confusion .
" It could even be used to cover up something more sinister .
Churchill and Einstein were both plain speakers and they did OK .
Councils should follow their lead . "

Social websites harm children 's brains : Chilling warning to parents from top neuroscientist By David Derbyshire Last updated at 1:45 AM on 24th February 2009 Social networking websites are causing alarming changes in the brains of young users , an eminent scientist has warned .
Sites such as Facebook , Twitter and Bebo are said to shorten attention spans , encourage instant gratification and make young people more self - centred .
The claims from neuroscientist Susan Greenfield will make disturbing reading for the millions whose social lives depend on logging on to their favourite websites each day .
. . .
Baroness Greenfield , an Oxford University neuroscientist and director of the Royal Institution , believes repeated exposure could effectively ' rewire ' the brain .
Computer games and fast - paced TV shows were also a factor , she said .
' We know how small babies need constant reassurance that they exist , ' she told the Mail yesterday .
' My fear is that these technologies are infantilising the brain into the state of small children who are attracted by buzzing noises and bright lights , who have a small attention span and who live for the moment . '
(1) Celebrity Fluff
It was bound to happen .
Some neuroimaging lab will conduct an actual fMRI experiment to examine the so - called " Neural Correlates of Twitter " -- so why not write a preemptive blog post to report on the predicted results from such a study , before anyone can publish the actual findings ?
For those of you who do n't know , Twitter is a social media application that enables microblogging ( 140 characters or less ) and revolutionizes the way that people communicate breaking news raise funds for worthy causes , and organize meaningful protest movements .
Or else it 's the refuge of narcissists suffering existential crises of identity who must broadcast their every move in a pathetic attempt to find external validation and meaning in their crushingly boring lives .
We 've seen a plethora of posts on the Psychology of Twitter , most notably at Psychology Today ( part 1 part 2 ) and World of Psychology ( part 1 part 2 ) .
Now , the time for the Neurology of Twitter has arrived !
However , Professor Susan Greenfield has beaten me to the punch with her fake data , as quoted below in an alarmist article in the Daily Mail : Her " fear " is based on sheer speculation without a shred of evidence .
Furthermore , other fear mongering reports ( PDF ) have cherry - picked the existing data to support the hypothesis that Twitter is harmful to your health .
So why do n't we do an experiment to see exactly what happens to the brain while reading Twitter streams in real time ?
The purpose and the methods of the study are summarized below .
A low - level baseline condition ( viewing " + " ) and an active baseline condition ( reading the public timeline of random tweets from strangers ) will be compared to three active conditions :
(2) Social Media Marketing Drivel
(3) Friends on your Following List
An example of the public timeline on Twitter is illustrated below .
The hemodynamic response function to this active control condition will be compared to those from Conditions 1 - 3 above .
Contrasts between each of these conditions and the low - level baseline will also be performed .
Fig. 2A . (
) .
A region of ventral mPFC showed greater activation during judgments of the target to whom participants considered themselves to be more similar .
Reading the stream of Celebrity Fluff will activate the frontal eye fields to a much greater extent than the control condition , as the participants will be engaged in rolling their eyes in response to the inane banter .

Reading the stream of Social Media Marketing Drivel will tax the neural circuits involved in generating a feeling of disgust , including the anterior insula , ventrolateral prefrontal cortex - temporal pole , and putamen - globus pallidus ( Mataix - Cols et al. , 2008 )

The major predicted results are as follows :
In conclusion , we predict that the observed patterns of brain activity will be dependent on the nature of the Twitter material being read .
These distinct neural networks are expected to reflect the cognitive , emotional , and visceral processes underlying the rapidly changing content of digital media , which ultimately results in " rewiring " of the brain .
Next on The Neurocritic : Ashton Kucher ( @aplusk ) deconstructs the outrageous headline that Twitter can make you immoral
But that epic piece will have to wait untilhas lifted the embargo on the journal article ( Immordino - Yang et al. , in press ) that inspired the headline ( and others too ) : ( from Wired ) :
While the Nintendo Wii may be selling in huge numbers every month , players wanting more precision out of their controls have been waiting for the Wii MotionPlus , the add - on peripheral for the Wiimote that will give true 1:1 control of games .
Today Nintendo has announced the release date and price of the peripheral : on June 8 you can buy the add - on for $ 20 alone , or with Wii Sports Resort for $ 49.99 on July 26 .
The new price of a fully decked out controller with the Wiimote , Nunhuck , and MotionPlus ? $ 80 .
The peripheral will only work with games that are coded to support it , but offering the add - on with a good example of what the controls are capable of with the new Wii Sports title should whet gamers ' appetites .
We had a chance to try the peripheral at E3 last year , and the precision of movement is impressive .
The peripheral also changes how the controller feels in your hand ; it adds a significant amount of weight and length to the Wiimote , making the whole thing feel almost like the hilt of a sword .
It 's somewhat odd , seeing a virtual hand on the screen move exactly with yours as you hold a virtual frisbee , although the Motion Plus may make gamers excited about the possibility of the Nintendo Wii once again .
A sword - fighting game that will come in Wii Sports Resort will allow you an unlimited number of attacks , you simply wield the controller like you would a real sword , although not having the weight of the blade or much tactile feedback when you hit an object is somewhat disconcerting .
The MotionPlus also hurts the value proposition of the Wii somewhat , as we 've pointed out .
The controller is $ 40 alone .
Adding the Nunchuk is another $ 20 .
The MotionPlus is yet another $ 20 .
That means that for games that require the entire setup , you 'll need what amounts to an $ 80 controller .
Multiply that by four , and you have $ 320 worth of controllers for your system , if any games are released that require you to have every peripheral attached to play .
It 's also odd to have the standalone peripheral available weeks before the package with the killer app .
Will Nintendo have other games available for us with the MotionPlus before July 26 ?
It 's possible that company could release some tech demos or even games that take full advantage of the hardware on WiiWare , or there could even be a whole channel dedicated to Motion Plus titles .
This may sound unlikely , but it 's doubtful Nintendo would sell hardware with no included game .
Nintendo has proven that it knows how to sell hardware to consumers , as Wii Fit still sells incredibly well on the Nintendo Wii , as do rhythm games with included drums and guitars , but the MotionPlus will succeed or fail on the strength of the games that take advantage of the hardware .
Will there be titles that are worth the $ 20 upgrade price ?
We 'll find out in a few short months .
As President Obama continues to express confidence in the U.S. economy , many Americans say they have confidence in his ability to steer the nation ’s fortunes in the right direction .
A new Gallup poll found that 71 % of those interviewed said they placed “ a great deal or a fair amount ” of confidence in the president to bring about an economic recovery .
That puts Obama ahead of some of the country ’s leading economic experts : Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke had a 49 % rating in the poll and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner drew 47 % .
Fifty - one percent of respondents said they were confident in Democratic congressional leadership on the economy .
Advertisement
Thirty - eight percent felt that way about Republican leaders .
Obama -- who has won passage of a $ 787 - billion economic stimulus package and advanced multibillion - dollar plans to aid homeowners , the auto industry and other sectors of the economy -- has said tough times are ahead , but he is seeing signs of improvement in an economy that has been mired in recession for more than a year .
“ The economy is still under severe stress , ” Obama said last week after meeting with economic advisors and Bernanke at the White House .
“ We ’re still seeing a lot of job losses , a lot of hardship . . . so we ’ve still got a lot of work to do . ”
But , the president said , the nation was starting to see “ glimmers of hope . ”

Bernanke , who became Fed chairman in 2006 during the Bush administration , was instrumental in convincing Congress before Obama took office to provide a $ 700 - billion bailout of financial firms .
And Geithner pushed for federal assistance for the financial markets and homeowners while demanding concessions from automakers -- forcing the resignation of the chairman of General Motors as the company sought additional aid from the government .
“ It is unlikely that many Americans have a highly sophisticated understanding of the complex economic policies enacted in the last several months by either Bernanke or Geithner , ” said Frank Newport , editor in chief of the Gallup Poll .
“ Yet only 17 % and 14 % of Americans , respectively , are not able or willing to give an opinion on confidence in these two men ’s actions on the economy . ”
The survey of 1,027 adults conducted last week had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .

I ’m writing this in the erstwhile billiards room , mulling over my favorite tunnel find , the little cast - iron horse , frozen in flight beside me .
My discoveries have changed the way I think about where I live .
We buy a house believing it ’s ours , but in fact it ’s an ever - shifting palimpsest and we are merely the latest to write over it .
Nevertheless , for continuity ’s sake , my housemates and I have kept to the tradition of holding big parties .
It ’s practically a civic duty .
It would be selfish to keep all this house and yard to ourselves .
As befits a home built in an old farming district , we also have made a point of working the land , gradually putting the yard back into operation over the years .
We removed 12 tons of concrete there , covered the devastated soil with free city compost and planted an organic garden that produces so many vegetables we ’ve considered opening a farm stand .
We planted a fig tree and several berry bushes , and we bought a wine press to accommodate the fruits of the prolific grapevine .
( As a concession to our retrograde American attachments , we put down a lawn just big enough for bocce but a touch too small for a cow . )
The garden is a particularly busy place now that spring is here .
We ’ve set up a coop in preparation for the chickens we have on order .
We bought more than 50 varieties of seeds , many of them heirlooms that have n’t been in wide use since the house was built .
And we ’re stocking up on canning and pickling jars  the tunnel will make an excellent root cellar .
Among the stranger produce we ’ve harvested from the garden is a doll we call Pinkie , who , with the hole in her stomach and her grossly misshapen head , was probably scary even before she was buried decades ago .
Pinkie has become the house mascot .
She sits on the front - porch swing , which is somehow always rocking , and keeps a constant vigil , staring into the middle distance through her one good eye .
The estimate comes from data obtained by a space probe that is examining the so - called Cosmic Microwave Background ( CMB ) radiation - often called the echo of the Big Bang .
The echo contains information of what the cosmos was like when it was young and how it might develop .
The cosmos is 13.7bn years old but the stretching of space with its expansion after the Big Bang means that simple distance measurements do not apply .
Stretched space
This age estimate comes from two independent lines of investigation - the age of stars and the expansion of the Universe .
This means that radiation reaching us from the earliest Universe has been travelling for more than 13 billion years .
But the assumption that flows from this - that the radius of the Universe is 13.7 billion light - years and that it is 27.4 billion light - years wide does not follow .
Astronomers realise the Universe is more complex .
It has been expanding ever since the Big Bang when energy , space and time itself began .
According to Neil Cornish of Montana State University , US , and colleagues writing in the journal Physics Review Letters , the distance covered by the light in the early Universe gets increased by its overall expansion .
To get the picture try to imagine the Universe a million years after the Big Bang .
Light travels for a year , covering one light - year .
But at that time , the Universe was about a thousand times smaller than it is today meaning that one light - year has now become stretched to about a thousand light - years .
When this expansion is taken into account the Universe is bigger than it would appear to be .
Neither finite nor infinite
Because of this stretching , radiation from the early Universe cannot be said to have travelled 78 billion light - years .
What it means is that the starting point of a particle of light , a photon , reaching us today after travelling for 13.7 billion years is now 78 billion light - years away .
NASA'S WILKINSON PROBE Launched to obtain full - sky images of 13 billion + year - old temperature fluctuations in CMB Temperature differences correspond to " seeds " that grew to become stars and galaxies Data help answer questions about age and geometry of Universe
And that is the radius of the Universe .
Confused ?
The new estimate comes from analysing data obtained by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMap ) which has been studying the CMB which formed about 400,000 years after the Big Bang .
Subtle differences in the background radiation can tell astronomers the age of the Universe and other cosmological parameters .
One implication of the new analysis is to prove false the idea that one could , theoretically , look in one direction and eventually see the back of your head .
The researchers looked for evidence that multiple images of the same object could show up in different locations in space - time .
The predicted pattern in the CMB that would have shown the effect was not observed .
According to the researchers the latest work provides no evidence that the Universe is finite and no evidence that it is infinite either .

This is n't a world where you have your hand held , guided on a wire , or spoon fed all of your equipment and skill .
This is EVE , a universe of cold , hard working , and merciless players .
This is our world outside of the real , we are a mimic of the War Profiteers and Black Market monsters that effect everyone in real life today .
We profit off of your misery , we make advancements by stealing yours , and we take your merciful attitudes , chew it up , and spit it out .
But here is the best part : you will most likely mistake us for someone who cares .
We create the world , we make the history , we alter the course of the story .
The players of EVE are all responsible for evolving this game .
Think of its creative structure being completely driven by the players and implemented by the developers .
Story , new ideas , support , all of this is in our power , and we can all bring these into the world .
What do we get in return ?
A world created by us , and the finance to support our lives within this world we have created .
There is no limit .
This is NOT a simpletons game .
This is a complex , unforgiving , but vastly rewarding game if you have the patience to stick it through .
If you understand how tabletop miniatures games work like Warhammer 40 k , Battletech , and D&D , you will understand what I mean by complex .
There are attributes for EVERYTHING in this game , and EVERYTHING in this game has a use , whether it is to make money , build ships , build weapons , or ammunition for those weapons -- everything has a purpose .
If you are looking for a constant action , twitch / fast paced adventure game , this is NOT for you .
This is a mix of ( very old school ) and with the game pace of .
If you want to experience heart pumping adrenalin in this game , then its in the end game .
That being when you join a corp and start experiencing PVP and Corporation wars , then you experience an intensity unlike any other game .
Now I will tell you , this game can be slow paced , and many get the idea that the game requires 100 % attention .
This is a misconception .
I put in only an hour or two of ( gameplay ) time a day into this game if I 'm lucky and I am still able to excel in this game .
It all matters to what you prefer to do .
This is a game for the hardcore complex casual and hardcore complex core gamers .
My friend said it best , is hardcore for the hardcore .
If none of this interests you and you do n't think you can get into it , it 's OK , just stop reading now .
This is n't a game for everybody .
If you are interested in playing , and have patience , then by all means keep reading !
You can keep reading if you are just overall interested but not interested in playing .
What can I do in ?
The better question would be whatyou do ?
What you can be inis all dependent on how much of an effort you want to put into it .
Ultimately , is all about its player driven universe .
The storyline , the events , the structure of the game and its economy is all effected from the players of .
What they do on a daily basis , what Corporations they bring down , the ways they find to exploit other players -- all of it brings something to the table of CCP 's development for
The following is a list of the things that players do and what YOU can do in EVE .
I 'm not going to describe each path , for there is too much to explain .
[ Side Info ] YES these ALL matter in a BIG way with the EVE Universe and there are hundreds if not thousands of people doing each of these roles .

Where it all starts :
Now that we have gotten that out of the way , and you understand that there is a VAST world to be explored , I am here to really give you a basic start in ' breaking yourself in ' into the EVE universe .
I will take you through a simpletons path of breaking yourself in .
I will show you the path I took and what its brought me so far , and basically give you an idea of what you can accomplish .
Now there are MANY ways you can approach this game , this is just the way I did it and its helped me greatly .
Step One : Creation
So choose a race ( I recommend Caldari - this is the route I went ) and a bloodline .
These used to matter and have specific attributes added to them , but now its all on an even playing field for all races .
You start from the scratch with all races .
What it all depends on now is what type of career path you choose and how you want to fight , mine , trade , manage , etc .
Each race is located in different regions of the galaxy ( and this is one big ass galaxy ) so if you want to play with friends , its best to all go the same race so you all start in the same region of space .
Otherwise you could be taking a rough and deadly journey through the galaxy just to meet up with your friend .
Step Two : Tutorials
So , you created your character and you have a vague idea as to what you want to do with yourself in the universe of EVE .
You launch the game , you are in space and , well , here is where I 'm going to be very blunt .
DO THE TUTORIAL .
Many people want to just start this game and skip through everything and think they can learn it all on their own .
Well guess what : THIS IS NOT A SIMPLETON GAME .
You will fail miserably if you try to learn this game without reading through tutorials or guides .
You will first go through the main tutorial that comes up when you launch the game .
This tutorial will teach you the basic ways of combat and navigation and it will also teach some important aspects of the menu system .
Once you go through this tutorial it will dock you at your races station .
This station will contain three other tutorial agents that you can also find through the help menu that is located on the left side of the EVE Nav bar .
These tutorial agents were brought to my attention after the new Apocrypha patch .
I saw this one month after I started playing so you will have a much better head start than I did when I started this game .
These three agents will cover the aspect of hauling materials , contracts , combat , salvaging , materials reprocessing and mining .
After you learn these things from these agents you are ready to make your way through the first series of the Epic Arc missions that were introduced to EVE Online with the Apocrypha patch .
And with these skills you will be able to pull in AT LEAST 700,000 ISK ( game currency ) per mission .
On average I was making 1.2 million ISK per Epic Arc mission by doing the missions , salvaging on these missions , and selling the resources you collect .
Step 3 : Fitting your ship for the journey and understanding your environment .
Once you have finished the basic tutorial missions , you will go and venture out into space .
But first you must fit your ship properly for the adventure .
Depending on what you have been training your skills around , is what you will fit your ship with .
For instance , since I have been training missiles .
I am going to go with a Caldari Frigate , and for this I went with a Kestrel .
The Kestrel is a basic frigate missile boat for the Caldari and uses missile launchers for its weapon systems .
This ship was actually given to me as a reward for one of the tutorial missions , so it saved me some money right there .
[ Side Info ]
The reason why I went with a Kestrel is because I am going for the Cloaking Specialist Career path which is a Covert Ops type career .
With this in mind I looked up what type of Caldari Covert Ops ships there were and saw that the Covert Op Ship I wanted was a kestrel frigate .
Early preparation for what I will be using I guess you could say .
The skills I have been training under Missile Launcher Operations is :
Missile Bombardment : I have trained this to lvl 5 first
Missile Launcher Operation : lvl 5
Standard Missiles : lvl 4
Now you may not start off with some of these skills so you may have to buy the skill book .
If that 's the case , run some missions with your basic setup and then buy the skill books .
They should n't cost much at all .
You will also want to pay attention to the time it takes to train these skills .
For example , when I got my Missile Launcher Operation to Level 4 , I stopped it there and trained my Standard Missiles to level 4 since it would take less time , then went back to training Missile Launcher Operation to level 5 .
Apart from training these , you will want to focus your training around learning and engineering if you go through this route that I 'm talking about .
Now apart from selecting the proper ship , and understanding what to put on it , you must understand how to utilize materials that you purchase .
For instance , when you are looking for missile launchers and missiles for those launchers you want to understand what they do .
So -- IMPORTANT RULE --
Always view the product info and read up on its attributes and prerequisites .
This will let you know if you can use these products or train these certain skills just yet .
[ Side Info ]
Salvaging is another way to obtain materials to sell and build things .
Whenever you destroy a ship there is always a ship wreckage and sometimes that wreckage has some cargo in it for you to exploit .
That cargo can get you some cash , but if you really want to expand your profits , salvaging will help you greatly through missions .
What salvaging does is it takes the ship wreck itself and tries to salvage any ship components it can .
Now you wont always get something out of a wreck , but more times than not you will get enough to add another 400,000 - 600,000 isk to your mission .
You can also collect these ship components and use them to build ships yourself if you do n't want spend the money on buying them pre-built .
Ship Fitting for my adventure
Ship : Kestrel Caldari Frigate
Hardpoint Fitting ( Missile launcher hardpoints ) : 4 of the Standard Missile Launcher I
Secondary Fittings : Cap Regcharger I , Shield Booster I
Basic Fitting : Power Diagnostic System I , Ballistic Control System I
With these fittings I was able to plow through the Epic Arc missions with ease .
There were some missions where I had to spend some time fighting a foe .
At first I thought they were impossible until I learned that certain ships have a harder time hitting you the closer you orbit them .
Which brings in another aspect ; understand how the weapons work .
Each weapon system has a certain effective range .
With my setup , I can hit targets at 0 - 25 km , any further and my missiles die out and do n't do anything .
The closer I am with certain ships the more damage I will do .
Apart from distance , there is also importance in the types of rounds and types of launchers / turret weapons you use .
Some are geared for PVP and others are geared for PVE .
For instance , faction missiles are used mainly for PVP , and standard missiles are used for PVE .
Understanding how your weapons work will improve your chances of survival in this universe .
Step 4 : Moving deeper into the verse and running Missions
First things first , you must understand the space that you are in .
The systems you start off in no matter which race you are is rather safe security territory .
You can see the security of systems in the upper right of your screen where it shows the system you are in .
Security status goes from 1.0 to 0.0. 1.0 to 0.5 .
Space is generally safe territory , and is protected by AI Police known as Concord .
Concord will come to the aid to players in 1.0 to 0.5 security space , however they may not make it on time depending on where you are located and what the level of the security space is ( usually the lower the security space is , the fewer Concord that are around ) .
0.5 and below is unsecured space and you should only go in at your own risk .
Starting off you do NOT want to go into this territory , even when you first join a corp as a noob they advise that you stay away from anything below 0.5 until you can properly defend yourself or you have an escort .
Players that attack players in security space going all the way down to 0.1 will have a negative standing , but that does n't stop them .
In 0.0 Security space , this is lawless territory , free game , wasteland .
These are usually territories controlled by alliances , and some alliances will have open travel free territory while others will have shoot on sight territory .
You will learn more about this when you get into corporations .
MISSION TIME !
Now its time for you to do your missions !
So I will tell you one simple thing :
Go to the Arnon System , Go to the Sisters of EVE Bureau Station , and talk to the Agent that gives you the Epic Arc mission .
And from there the adventure for you begins .
System : Arnon
Station : Sisters of EVE Bureau
[ Side info ]
You can find these stations and systems through your People & Places Dock which is located on the EVE Nav bar , here is also how you find and add other players playing the game .
Your buddy list if you will .
This epic arc structure will take you through some high paying missions for starter pilots .
You will make A LOT of money with this path .
I went through this and did salvaging in all of the missions I was given and I finished with 20 million ISK at the end of it all .
Step 5 : Your Final Destination
Now it is time for you to get your hands dirty .
This is the end game , this is where it all comes to fruition , this is where it all matters .
You will join a Corporation , you can find Corporation recruiters in the channel 's list which is located on the EVE Nav panel on the left side of your screen .
You can use this to find Corporations to join , or if you have friends that play and are in Corporations you can join up with them if they will have you .
Many Corporations will accept noobies , this is the best way to get your feet wet .
With this new experience you will be on your main track of learning .
They will teach you the deeper complex structure of EVE and the complex and satisfying nature of PVP & corporate war .
[ side info ]
Corporations are like Guilds & Clans in other games / MMOs .
But unlike other MMOs , these boys play shit for the profit .
Their actions effect EVERYTHING in the game .
They can bring down entire alliances , they can control vast amounts of EVE territory .
With Corporate alliances players , will experience what its like to be a nation , they will live a virtual life of political and military unrest .
Here is where all of EVE is centered around , it is what all players work for .
You literally are living in a virtual capitalist society that is controlled by corporate war profiteers , black market mobs , and cold hearten pirates .
Conclusion
So there you have it .
It seems like a lot , huh ?
Well I warned you , this is not a simpletons game , this is a very complex , very intuitive game .
It is not for everybody , it is not a friendly world out there , this is as dirty as it gets .
The problems of today 's real life with corporate power and war profiteers is just what EVE online is .
If the corporations and war profiteers of the real world were to still be in power hundreds of years from now , EVE could very well be the real .
LOLOLONOES CONSPIRACY !
I know , but its an interesting outlook when you make the comparison .
To say this game is horrible and sucks is just pure subjective rage .
From a design aspect and community aspect this is a very innovative and brilliant structure .
Sure its not for everyone , its a very underground style of gameplay , but the way it has been approached with getting the community to be a core part of its development process is nothing short of spectacular .
Graphically the game is like no other , and from a design structure , nothing can compare to its complexity .
I mean , we are talking about a game that had Financial and Economic Advisers aid them in creating the games economic structure .
What I explained to you today was just but one sprinkle that is on top of the frosting which sits on top of this giant cake .
Besides combat there is a whole entire active world of manufacturers , traders , market exploiters , corporate managers , pirates , mercenaries , spies ( quite literally there is internal espionage within Corporations that cause massive amounts of damage that can destroy years worth of a player ( s ) work ) , bankers , miners , etc. etc .
And all of these aspects are taken seriously .
Management , asset control -- all of it .
If you are someone who is interested in business , finance , expanding a company , this game can seriously give you an insight as to what its like .
There is so much more that I cannot show you in just one blog , and this was long enough .
So if you feel up to it , take the step , be bold pilot .

Tomorrow is April 1st , and apart from funny pranks and silly hats — the Conficker worm will rear its ugly head .
As recently as yesterday , some early ( not that early I realize ) detection programs are available .
And they ’re free .
The first is simple to use , but slow as crap .
In the author ’s defense , it ’s just a proof of concept .
But it works . 🙂
It ’s written in Python , and has both the python script ( which requires some additional libraries in Linux ) and a windows version that is all built into a package .
This site has links to both versions , along with some instructions .
It seems to be able to keep up with the traffic it ’s getting , whereas some other sites are getting crumbled as admins scramble to sniff their networks .
The second method uses a brand spanking new version of NMAP to do the detecting .
The advantage is it ’s much quicker at scanning larger networks .
The disadvantage is it requires a bit of commandline fu .
Fear not , it ’s as easy as copy / paste .
First , get the version for your operating system .
NOTE : You MUST get nmap -4.85BETA5 because earlier versions wo n’t scan for Conficker .
Once you install nmap , you ’ll want to run the command :
nmap -PN -d - p445 –script=smb-check-vulns –script-args=safe=1 [ network_range ]
Where [ network_range ] is something like 10.10.5.1-255 or even 10.10.0.0/16 .
You ’ll need to look through the results for information like :
Host script results :
| smb-check - vulns :
| MS08-067 : FIXED
| Conficker : Likely INFECTED
|_ regsvc DoS : VULNERABLE
And then fix / patch those hosts .
I ’d suggest sending the results to a text file , and grepping for the word VULNERABLE or INFECTED — but those types of instructions are beyond the scope of this quick hack of a post . 🙂
The banking system is still in crisis , house prices are in freefall and unemployment is climbing rapidly ; those seeking out green shoots are likely to be disappointed , since the economy is hardly through the danger zone .
The only consolation comes from the stock market , which is more or less flat since Obama took over , and the fact that most other economies are in a worse state .
More worryingly , the new president has yet to convince us that he is more Franklin D Roosevelt than Herbert Hoover .
Those of us who hoped that the new president would infuse genuine urgency into the rescue plan , for either the economy or the financial system , have been sorely disappointed .
The language may be more sincere , the speeches more glamorous , but the response is still nowhere near bold enough .
All the criticisms of the initial Bush “ rescue ” – that it nationalised the financial system ’s losses while allowing the bankers to make off with the profits ; that it failed to draw a line under the institutions ’
previous failures – remain applicable to Obama ’s scheme .
Whenever I hear the media and the government denouncing loudly in unison , I look for the possibility that the target is a scapegoat , and that the scandal goes deeper , touches better - established personalities .
This article by Wayne Madsen ( scroll down to see it ) offers a plausible hypothesis why Madoff 's conviction is the end of the line , and prosecutors are n't lookig for co-conspirators .
According to Madsen , Madoff 's investors were not so dumb , and what Madoff was really collecting money for was a vast floating casino project in Manhattan , with new transit lines thrown in for extra $ $ $ .
The " Cornerstone Project " was to have absorbed Madoff 's cash and rewarded him richly , before last September 's crash put the project in jeopardy .
I wo n't try to summarize the intrigue that Madsen describes , aside from revealing the " cornerstone " of his charge : Judge Denny Chin , who has accepted Madoff 's guilty plea and will be in charge of sentencing him , is a major investor in the Cornerstone project .
Jaguar is the second most powerful computer ever built and the fastest dedicated to science ( Image : National Center for Computational Sciences , Oak Ridge National Laboratory )
In cult sci-fi tale Hitchhiker ’s Guide to the Galaxy , the most powerful computer in the universe was charged with finding the answer to life , the universe , and everything .
In the real world , a newly built supercomputer that is the most powerful ever dedicated to science will be tackling questions about energy use and generation , climate change , supernovas , and the structure of water .
The projects were chosen in a peer - reviewed process designed to get the computer producing useful science even during the period when its performance is still being fine - tuned by engineers .

Jaguar is located at the National Center for Computational Sciences ( NCCS ) , part of Oak Ridge National Laboratory , Tennessee , and has a peak operating performance of 1.64 petaflops , meaning it can perform more than a million billion mathematical operations every second .
Jaguar has 181,000 processing cores , compared to the one or two found in most desktop machines .
The world ’s only more powerful computer is the US Nuclear Security Administration ’s 1.7 - petaflop Roadrunner at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico .
Climate first
First unveiled last year and after several months of testing , directors at Oak Ridge recently started tasking Jaguar with its first research projects .
Environmental issues motivate many of the first wave of 21 projects .
Three involve climate models – including one that models the global atmosphere down to grids of 14 kilometres instead of the more usual 55 or 100 - km squares .
Other environmentally inspired projects will simulate flames inside diesel engines with the aim of cutting fuel consumption , and synthesis of biofuels from waste plant material .
‘ High demand ’
Other projects Jaguar will investigate include analysis of the 3D structure of the “ Britney Spears ” of supernovas , the most observed to date , to the exact arrangement of molecules in liquid water – still a mystery despite its importance to life .
“ It is in very high demand right now and we ’re very excited , ” says Douglas Kothe , director of science at the NCCS .
“ This is a very programmable platform with an enormous amount of memory – three times the amount of memory relative to the next closest system – and is turning out to be very stable and reliable . ”
After July , the NCCS says , the computer will be set to carry out more work on the climate – being made available to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change for a month or more .

( CNN ) -- U.S. nonprofits are straining under the weight of the recession , with many expecting to sustain permanent financial damage , a survey shows .
Most nonprofits anticipate the recession will have a long - term or permanent negative effect , according to a survey .
The survey by Nonprofit Finance Fund focused on 986 nonprofits , including " lifeline " organizations that many depend on for basics such as food and shelter .
Only 16 percent of the nonprofits expect to cover their operating expenses this year , while 52 percent anticipate the recession will have a long - term or permanent negative effect on their organizations .
" The survey reveals the precarious state of a sector that is continually asked to do more with less , " Clara Miller , president of NFF , said in a statement .
" Lifeline organizations , 91 percent of which focus on serving vulnerable populations , simply will not be around to provide critical services if we continue with current practices , " she said .
Almost all -- 93 percent -- expect an increase in demand for services this year .
The organizations said they are taking steps to adjust , including cutting programs , reducing salaries and delaying paying vendors .
" Like many other nonprofits , we have had to make cuts that directly and negatively affect the people we serve , " said survey respondent Felix Rouse , chief executive officer of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Newark .
" We have temporarily closed one of our five sites .
We have reduced our program offerings from 47 to 30 , and have had to lay off about 25 employees ( 28 percent of the workforce ) . "
The Nonprofit Finance Fund , which provides loans and access to grants to nonprofits , urged organizations to team up with those who fund them to find innovative ways to address the challenges and continue serving the needy .
" This recession is forcing the issue of how to better invest in what works for the benefit of society , " Miller said .

As if recent release of Kindle 2 was n’t enough …
Kindle for iPhone application was just released to iTunes marketplace and is available for download !
What it does is it brings most of the Amazon Kindle functionality to iPhone or iPod Touch .
The application is free to download and can be installed either via iTunes ( click here if you have iTunes already installed ) or directly through App Store …
Once the application is installed – you need to enter your Amazon.com username and password and within seconds you have all the books that you ’ve purchased before for your Kindle available in “ Archived Items ” …
Couple more taps on the touchscreen and you can start reading away .
Ok and now when the hype is gone lets be a bit more specific .
The new app can do :
Download and display all textual books that are available in the Kindle Store .
Synchronize bookmarks , annotations , reading positions etc via the WhisperSync .
Add new bookmarks .
Text is displayed very clearly and is readable even at the smallest font size ( it fact when smallest font size is contains almost as much text as my Kindle which I have set to second smallest font .
Once application is registered iPhone immediately becomes selectable in the combo-boxes on the Amazon.com so you can send purchased books to the device .
And now on what it ca n’t do :
It looks like periodicals a missing .
At least WSJ that I ’m subscribed to did n’t show up anywhere in the application .
There is no text - to - speech
Regrettably there is no special interface to buy more books .
It has to be done via PC or iPhone Safari browser which is doable but not the most comfortable experience you would have .
Unfortunately using Amazon Mobile application ( also free ) is not an option since it only allows adding Kindle books to wish - list .
Hopefully Amazon will update it soon enough .
There does n’t seem to be any dictionary functionality .
To sum it up :
Way cool , with a room for improvement .
While it would seem that releasing such an application would hurt Kindle sales , personally I thing that it would not and overall it would be benefical to Amazon.com .
And here is why :
While the text is clear and readable , reading from iPhone is not the best experience .
i Phone is much less autonomous than Kindle because it ’s not meant to run long on a single charge but more importantly because when you are reading an eBook a back - lit display is drawing a lot of power from the battery .
There is no way you can read 20,000 pages on a single charge and this was a major selling point to me and many other Kindle owners .
So in no way iPhone will be able to even come close to replacing Kindle .
On the other hand iPhone is a great opportunity because it is an undisputed leader by number of e-commerce transactions that are initiated and completed using it .
This is because it provides excellent mobile browsing experience .
You can actually navigate the web and shop with it comfortably .
There were 10 M + iPhones sold during 2008 alone .
Releasing this application gives Amazon better access to this audience .
And by defintion this audience likes to consume information and spend money on gadgets .
So I imagine quite a few would first buy a couple of books to their iPhone to do some quick lookup or to read something during some long commute and eventually would buy Amazon Kindle to have a better reading experience with these books .
Another reason I happy about this realease is that in the modern world of proprietary mutually incompatible and overly restrictive DRM systems that hurt honest users much more than pirates having a seemless easy way to access useful copyrighted and legally purchased content across several platforms from two different manufactureres is a step in the right direction .
Java Student Projects
Fake News During the US Presidential election , the pro-Trump forces made up new fake news stories every day .
They never offered any evidence .
The pro-Trump forces eagerly spread these stories , fervently believing them only because they reinforced their belief that Hillary was the daughter of Satan .
There was no downside to telling these stories .
If there were believed , they inflamed the Trump supporters and dispirited the Clinton supporters .
If there were not believed , the result was no different than had the lies never been released .
We need to restore the penalty for emitting fake news .
We need to track fake news back to its source .
Then thoroughly debunk it , and sue the liars for libel .
Then publicly shame the liars who spread the story and organise retaliation , blocking and shunning .

Introduction

I have discussed most of the projects many times at length over the last decades on BIX which retained all postings in archives .
Pretty well everything I have to say about each project is spelled out here .
I do n’t have extra material to give you , unless I explicitly mention it .
I do n’t have the time to lead you by the hand through a project .
If one project is too difficult to tackle at your current level of skill , pick a simpler one .
If you are unemployed , or just out of school , you might hone your skills by tackling some of these projects .
They are more like the real world problems you will be given in the workplace .
In the real world you have to write the specifications too .
They are not handed to you on a plate the way they are in school .
I give you many hints on how to solve the problems , far more than you would get in the workplace .
These problems are intermediate in degree of hand - holding between school and the workplace .
I would be happy to implement any of these projects for you , for a fee , though I do not do homework .
Which Project to Pick ?
Which project should I pick ?
Learning More
Students imagine I have complete detailed specs written on every class .
The key skill students must learn is writing the spec and doing the overall design of a decently large project .
Any boob can code given a detailed class specification .
In the real world you are never handed tidy perfectly - specified little problems than can be handled with two or three pages of code .
In the real world , you wo n’t even get project outlines anywhere near as detailed as I have given you here .
They will never contain any implementation hints as my outlines do .
You have to pull teeth to get even the vaguest information about what the program should do .
You have to write prototype systems .
Only then are your users smart enough to tell you what they really wanted , or are you smart enough to suggest to them possible options they might enjoy .
My advice for a student who thinks a project is too difficult , is to create a sub project that he thinks he might tackle successfully , or try a simpler different project entirely .
After that experience , he can add a bit more complexity .
Trying to solve the problem all at once just leads to overwhelm .
Do n’t feel embarrassed that the sub project would have no practical use .
It is just a stepping stone .
Though I have no additional materials to send you , I am willing to answer specific questions about the projects .
I will normally add that material into the project descriptions for others too .
For team projects underway you can join Asynchrony , Enhydra or SourceForge .
Practice !
Programming is a skill best acquired by practice and example rather than from books .

Man page for lns
NAME
lns – symbolic link creation utility
SYNOPSIS
lns [ flags ] srcfile destfile lns [ flags ] srcfile [ srcfile ... ] destdir
DESCRIPTION
lns creates symbolic links .
The standard command ln -s also does this , but it interprets its first argument as the literal text to be placed in the symlink .
If your current working directory is not the same as the target directory , this can get confusing .
For example , to create a symlink to a file hello.c in a subdirectory programs , you would have to write ln -s ../ hello.c programs , even though hello.c is actually in your current directory , not one level up .
In particular , this is unhelpful because it makes it difficult to use tab completion to set up the command line .
lns solves this problem , by creating symlinks using the obvious semantics you would expect from mv or cp .
All of its arguments are expected to be either absolute path names , or relative to the current working directory .
So , in the above example , you would write lns hello . c programs / hello.c or just lns hello . c programs , exactly as you would have done if the command had been cp ; and lns will figure out for itself that the literal text of the symlink needs to be ../hello.c .
lns also has a mode in which it will create a symlink mirror of an entire directory tree : that is , instead of creating a single symlink to the root of the tree , it will create directories in the same structure as the whole of the original tree , and fill them with individual symlinks to the files .
This is occasionally handy if you want to work with a slightly modified version of a large file hierarchy but you do n't want to waste the disk space needed to create an entirely separate copy : you can symlink - mirror the whole tree , and then just replace one or two of the symlinks with modified versions of the files they point to .
ARGUMENTS
If you provide precisely two arguments to lns , and the second one is not a directory ( or a symlink to a directory ) , then lns will interpret the second argument as a destination file name , and create its target link with precisely that name .
If the second argument is a directory , lns will assume you want a link created inside that directory , with the same filename as the source file .
If you supply more than two arguments , lns will expect the final argument to be a directory , and will do this for each of the other arguments .
( This behaviour is intended to mimic cp as closely as possible . )
The source file (s ) are not required to exist .
lns will create links to their locations whether they actually exist or not ; if you create them later , the links will point to them .
OPTIONS
-a Create symlinks with absolute path names ( beginning with a slash ) .
Normally , lns will create relative symlinks .
Relative symlinks are often more useful : if a parent directory of both the link and its target is moved to a new location , a relative symlink will still work while an absolute one will fail .
-f
Overwrite an existing symlink at the target location .
Normally , lns will warn and refuse to do anything if the target location is already occupied by a symlink to a file ; using -f will cause it to replace the existing link with its new one .
If the target location is occupied by something that is not a symlink , lns will refuse to overwrite it no matter what options you supply .
If you specify precisely two arguments , and the second is a symlink to a directory , lns will treat it as a destination directory rather than a destination file , even if -f is specified .
Use - F , described next , to override this .
-F
Like -f , but additionally forces lns to interpret its second argument as a destination file name rather than a destination directory .
This option is useful for overriding an existing link to one directory with a link to a different one .
-e
Tolerate an existing symlink at the target location , if it has the same link text that lns would have created .
( Think of it as ‘ ensure this link exists ’ , which lns will be equally happy to arrange by creating it or by doing nothing . )
-r Enables recursive link - tree construction .
If the source pathname exists and is a directory , then instead of creating a symlink to it at the target site , lns will create a fresh directory , and then recursively attempt to link every file inside the source directory to the inside of the new target directory .
If a directory already exists at the target site , lns will recurse into it ; so you can , for instance , use lns -r -f to refresh an existing link tree .
-v
Verbose mode : makes lns talk about what it is doing .
You can make it more verbose by adding a second instance of - v . -q
Quiet mode : prevents lns from printing an error message if the link target already exists .
EXAMPLES
In simple situations , lns can be used pretty much as you would use cp .
For example , suppose you start in directory dir and issue the following commands :
$ lns file1 subdir $ lns file2 .. $ lns subdir / file3 subdir2 / subsubdir $ lns subdir2 / file4 subdir2 / subsubdir
Assuming all the subdirectories mentioned actually exist , this will create the following symlinks :
subdir / file1 , with link text ‘ ../ file1 ’.
, with link text ‘ ’. ../ file2 , with link text ‘ dir / file2 ’.
, with link text ‘ ’.
subdir2/subsubdir/file3 , with link text ‘ ../../subdir/file3 ’.
, with link text ‘ ’.
subdir2/subsubdir/file4 , with link text ‘ ../ file4 ’.
Note that in each case lns has constructed the shortest relative link it could manage : it did not mindlessly create the fourth link with text ‘ ../../ subdir2/file4 ’.
You can specify a target file name instead of a target directory .
For example , the following command has the same effect as the first of the list above :
$ lns file1 subdir / file1
Now suppose there is another file called file1 in subdir2 , and you want to change the link in subdir to point to that .
Normally lns will give you an error :
$ lns subdir2 / file1 subdir lns : failed to link subdir2 / file1 to subdir / file1 : target exists
You can override this error by using -f :
$ lns -f subdir2 / file1 subdir
This will overwrite the existing link subdir / file1 with a new one whose text reads ‘ ../ subdir2/file1 ’.
Now let 's create some symlinks to directories .
Again , this is simple to begin with :
$ lns subdir2 subdir3
This creates a symlink called subdir3 with text ‘ subdir2 ’.
In order to overwrite this directory , the -F option is likely to be useful .
Suppose I now want the link subdir3 to point at subdir instead of subdir2 .
If I do this :
$ lns -f subdir subdir3
then lns will immediately notice that the second argument subdir3 is ( a symlink to ) a directory , and will therefore assume that it was intended to be the directory containing the new link .
So it will create a file subdir3 / subdir ( equivalent to subdir / subdir , of course , since subdir3 is currently a symlink to subdir ) with link text ../ subdir .
In order to overwrite the directory symlink correctly , you need the -F option :
$ lns -F subdir subdir3
- F tells lns that you really want the new symlink to be called subdir3 , not to be in the directory subdir3 ; and it also implies the -f option to force overwriting .
So now you get what you wanted : the previous symlink subdir3 is replaced with one whose link text reads ‘ subdir ’.
Next , a couple of examples with -r .
Suppose you have your subdirectory subdir .
Then running
$ lns -r subdir subdir - mirror
will create a new subdirectory called subdir - mirror , containing symlinks to everything in subdir .
If the directory subdir - mirror already existed , however , lns 's command - line processing will notice that it's a directory , and will assume things are supposed to be copied into it , so that your mirror of subdir will end up at subdir - mirror / subdir .
To fix this , you can again use - F , to tell lns to literally create its output at the precise location you specify rather than inside it :
$ lns -rF subdir subdir- mirror
LIMITATIONS
Because lns attempts to guess what you probably wanted the exact text of your symlinks to be , it will not let you control that text with complete precision .
For example , it might be important to you that your symlink contains a path that indirects through another symlink , so that it behaves correctly when the latter symlink changes .
Or you might specifically need a symlink of the form ../../ foo / bar instead of ../ bar , so that when the link gets moved from the foo directory into another one , the link will continue to point to some particular file .
In situations where the precise link text is important to you , lns is probably not the tool for the job , and you should revert to using ln -s .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Computer hackers have embedded software in the United States ' electricity grid and other infrastructure that could potentially disrupt service or damage equipment , two former federal officials told CNN .
The ex-officials say code also has been found in computer systems of oil and gas distributors .
The code in the power grid was discovered in 2006 or 2007 , according to one of the officials , who called it " the 21st century version of Cold War spying . "
Department of Homeland Security Director Janet Napolitano would not confirm such a breach , but said Wednesday that there has been no known damage caused by one .
" There have been , to my knowledge , no disruptions of power on any grid caused by a deliberate cyberattack on our infrastructure -- on the grid , " Napolitano said .
" Nonetheless , we remain in constant protection , prevention , education , resiliency mode and we work with the utility sector particularly on that . "
Watch security officials explain threat »
The U.S. power grid is n't the only system at risk .
The former officials said malicious code has been found in the computer systems of oil and gas distributors , telecommunications companies and financial services industries .
Napolitano said the vulnerability of the nation 's power grid to cyberattacks " has been something that the Department of Homeland Security and the energy sector have known about for years , " and that the department has programs in place to fight such attacks .
Security experts say such computer hacking could be the work of a foreign government -- possibly Russia or China -- seeking to compromise U.S. security in the event of a future military conflict .
Former CIA operative Robert Baer said he is not aware of a specific breach like the one the former officials describe .
But he said people in the intelligence community assume that such attacks from countries like China go on all the time .
" Their foreign intelligence service has been probing our computers , our defense computers , our defense contractors , our power grids , our telephone system .
... I just came from a speech at the national defense university and they were hit by the Chinese trying to get into their systems , " Baer said .
" They are testing and have gotten in portals .
It 's a serious threat . "
Baer said if the software was embedded by a foreign government , he doubts it would be used to launch a surprise attack .
Instead , he said , that government likely would keep the bugs in place in case of a future conflict with the United States .
" It 's deterrence in the event of war , " he said .
" They will have another weapon at their disposal , which will be to turn off our power . "
When the coding is found , it can be destroyed .
But experts said that 's easier said than done .
" If you have somebody who knows what they 're doing writing that code and embedding it in a clever way , you can look right at it and not recognize it , " said Scott Borg , director and chief economist at the U.S. Cyber Consequences Unit , an independent research institute .
And even when it 's found , Borg said , confirming the source of a cyberattack can be next to impossible .
" Anonymity is a fact of life in the cyberworld , " he said .
" It 's very easy to run an attack through somebody else 's computer .
It 's very easy to embed code in Russian or Chinese when you 're not Russian or Chinese .
" So it 's very difficult to be confident on where anything like this comes from . "
Critics of the utilities industry have accused it of not doing enough in the past to defend against cyberassaults .
But Ed Legge , spokesman for the Edison Electric Institute , which represents shareholder - owned electric companies , said the industry takes the threat seriously and has made progress in closing some of the loopholes that would allow such attacks .
President Obama has started a 60 - day review of all the nation 's efforts at cybersecurity that is expected to be completed by April 17 , Napolitano said .
While utility grids are owned by industries , not the government , Napolitano said her department will continue working with power companies and other industries to help prevent an attack that could cripple power or other vital services .
" Can we continue to work to enhance efforts within critical infrastructure like the utility grid ?
Yes , " she said .
" Are we continuously looking for ways to enhance and educate for the prevention and protection of the cyberworld ?
Absolutely .
" Is this a priority of the president 's and of all of us that are involved with safety and security ?
You bet . "

Comment Tell A Friend Print Format Save Article China 's first two satellites dedicated to environment and disaster monitoring were delivered to their users yesterday .
Both Huanjing - 1A and Huanjing - 1B have two charge coupled device cameras , with a 30 - m resolution and a 720 - km width , each on board , the State Administration of Science , Technology and Industry for National Defense said in a statement .
The Ministry of Civil Affairs , in charge of disaster relief and reduction , and the Ministry of Environmental Protection are the users of the two satellites .
They can jointly form the image of China 's entire territory in two days , " which not many other satellites with 30 - m resolution cameras in the world can achieve " , it said .
This enables the two satellites to monitor a designated area repeatedly , fast and inform government agencies of the latest disaster development , it said .
In February , on the Australian government 's request to help fight a rare forest fire , the satellites , then under - testing , provided images , Chen Qiufa , the administration chief , said .
Luo Pingfei , vice - minister of civil affairs , said the two satellites would provide a stable , long - term data source to help China fight against disasters .
The two satellites will provide data through the soon - to - open Beijing office of the United Nations Platform for Space - based Information for Disaster Management and Emergency Response for global disaster reduction , Chen said .
The satellites were launched atop the Long March - 2C launch vehicle on Sept 6 , 2008 , from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in Shanxi province .
They passed in - orbit testing in February .
Next year China will launch a small radar satellite to work with these two optical satellites , the statement said .
Eventually , a total of eight small satellites will be launched to form a constellation for all - weather , 24 - hour monitoring and environment and natural disasters forecast , forming a complete image on China once every 12 hours .

Aides said Mr. Obama struggled for four weeks about whether to release the memos in response to a lawsuit filed under the Freedom of Information Act , consulting with advisers , experts and intelligence professionals .
It was on his mind so much , they said , that he talked about it with aides late at night in his hotel room during stops on his recent European trip .
Image President Obama , in a visit to C.I.A. headquarters on Monday , said employees of the agency would not be prosecuted for taking part in harsh interrogations .
Credit ... Jim Wilson / The New York Times
In meetings , they said , he served as “ the interrogator , ” as one put it , challenging people to defend their views .
Advisers diverged , with some like Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. favoring the release of more information and others like Leon E. Panetta , the new C.I.A. director , urging that more be withheld .
Aides said Mr. Obama worried about damaging morale at the C.I.A. and his own relationship with the agency .
In the end , aides said , Mr. Obama opted to disclose the memos because his lawyers worried that they had a weak case for withholding them and because much of the information had already been made public in The New York Review of Books , in a memoir by George J. Tenet , the former C.I.A. director , and even in a 2006 speech by President George W. Bush .
The decision to promise no prosecution of those who followed the legal advice of the Bush administration lawyers was easier , aides said , because it would be hard to charge someone for doing something the administration had determined was legal .
The lawyers , however , are another story .
On Sunday , Rahm Emanuel , the White House chief of staff , said on the ABC News program “ This Week ” that “ those who devised policy ” also “ should not be prosecuted . ”
But administration officials said Monday that Mr. Emanuel had meant the officials who ordered the policies carried out , not the lawyers who provided the legal rationale .
Three Bush administration lawyers who signed memos , John C. Yoo , Jay S. Bybee and Steven G. Bradbury , are the subjects of a coming report by the Justice Department ’s ethics office that officials say is sharply critical of their work .
The ethics office has the power to recommend disbarment or other professional penalties or , less likely , to refer cases for criminal prosecution .
The administration has also not ruled out prosecuting anyone who exceeded the legal guidelines , and officials have discussed appointing a special prosecutor .
One option might be giving the job to John H. Durham , a federal prosecutor who has spent 15 months investigating the C.I.A. ’s destruction of videotapes of harsh interrogations .

The Wall Street Journal is running a front - page story about John Thain today in which he accuses Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis of lying about events surrounding the Bank of America – Merrill transaction and the ouster of Thain as a top Bank of America executive .
Thain spent most of his career at Goldman Sachs , but left to head the New York Stock Exchange when he was passed over at Goldman in 2003 .
The key issue as far as John Thain is concerned has to do with the bonuses paid out to Merrill Lynch executives .
Ken Lewis says he was apoplectic that these bonuses were paid when Merrill lost $ 15 billion .
But Mr. Thain says that he and Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis agreed in writing that the bonuses could be paid before Bank of America ’s acquisition of Merrill closed , which led to the early payments .
“ The suggestion Bank of America was not heavily involved in this process , and that I alone made these decisions , is simply not true , ” he says .
Bank of America has painted a different picture than Mr. Thain ’s of critical decisions that were made last fall .
It has cast him as the person responsible for distributing billions of dollars of bonus money despite Merrill ’s huge losses .
Before Mr. Thain ’s recent discussions with the Journal , he had refrained from commenting in depth .
Edward here .
Honestly , Ken Lewis does not have a lot of credibility here after details of a February deposition were revealed last week .
In that deposition , Lewis admitted to consummating the merger with Merrill Lynch despite his own misgivings about the deal , apparently because his job was on the line .
So we have to take Lewis ’ statements with this in mind .
The Wall Street Journal article continues later with this :
According to the merger documents , many other compensation decisions at Merrill were to be made “ in consultation ” with Bank of America officials .
Bank of America approved paying a portion of the bonuses in Bank of America stock and was involved in setting compensation for a number of Merrill executives , people involved in the matter say .
Within days of the takeover announcement , Bank of America ’s transition team arrived at Merrill to begin figuring out how to combine the two companies .
About 200 employees set up on one floor of Merrill ’s headquarters , and Bank of America Chief Accounting Officer Neil Cotty moved into an office on the 32nd floor .
The group became involved in nearly every aspect of Merrill ’s operations , with dozens of Bank of America employees tracking Merrill ’s financial condition on a daily basis , according to people who work at the firm .
In October , Bank of America announced that Mr. Thain had agreed to become president of the combined company ’s global banking , securities and wealth - management business once the acquisition was completed .
A bank spokesman said there had been “ no commitment about succession in Mr. Thain ’s decision to stay . ”
Mr. Thain says that in late September , over a dinner in Charlotte , Mr. Lewis told him he was the only real candidate in line to succeed him .
By the end of November , Merrill ’s losses were ballooning because of deteriorating market conditions and write - downs on various mortgage - related investments .
Still , the daily emails sent to executives at both companies summarizing the deal ’s status said “ status green , ” according to Mr. Thain , signaling that the takeover was on track .
In early December , the compensation committee of Merrill ’s board agreed to a bonus pool of $ 3.62 billion .
On Dec. 11 , Bank of America asked Merrill to increase the amount of cash to 70 % , according to a letter reviewed by the Journal .
The two companies agreed that the stock portion of Merrill ’s bonuses would be paid in early January .
Mr. Thain says the documents prove that Bank of America was actively involved in compensation decisions .
Some Bank of America executives have said that Mr. Lewis lost confidence in Mr. Thain when Mr. Lewis learned of the losses from the transition team .
Mr. Lewis flew to Washington on Dec. 17 to tell federal regulators that he was considering abandoning the takeover .
Two days later , Mr. Thain left for vacation in Vail , Colo. , unaware that the regulatory showdown had happened .
Messrs .
Thain and Lewis both have said that Mr. Thain did n’t find out until Jan.
5 .
What transpired is not entirely clear , but the following is a potential course of events :
John
Thain sees Merrill Lynch on the verge of failure on the weekend of Lehman ’s demise and rings Ken Lewis , a man he hardly knows – after all Bank of America is not really a creature of Wall Street .
John Thain and Merrill Lynch are .
Thain wants to strike a deal – one that the Feds ( read Paulson , Bernanke and Geithner ) – facilitate ( See Fed Chair Hoenig ’s off - the - cuff remarks about this , which I first mentioned in March ) .
Later , the banking industry gets hammered .
Anyone with a large prop desk ( Goldman , Merrill , Deutsche , Morgan Stanley ) suffers huge losses .
Merrill is one of the worst hit .
Now , remember Bank of America is NOT a Wall Street firm .
They are based in Charlotte .
They are a regional commercial bank ( BofA is really Nations Bank / NCNB ) with a very different culture to the likes of Merrill .
So they probably were shocked by the losses here – which I imagine they were kept abreast of on an ongoing basis .
In March , The FT has said BofA knew how Merrill ’s books were being marked .
The next part is tricky .
Did Lewis , a deal hound if there ever was one , want to back out at this point ?
My gut says no .
Were they going to pay big bonuses to retain personnel at Merrill ?
Yes !
Remember , they had just paid a monster $ 44 billion for Merrills .
They were not about to let the deal founder on a one - off bonus round .
Things changed somehow by December as the losses mounted .
And I suspect there was a real culture clash as well .
Thain and Lewis started to get to know one another and it was not working .
From my perspective , it is irrelevant what really happened in December between Thain and Lewis .
What is relevant is that Lewis and the board of directors of Bank of America allowed the Merrill Lynch transaction to take place knowing that huge bonuses had been paid out and huge losses had been sustained – making the Merrill franchise considerably weaker than it was in September .
The MAC clause is completely valid as a reason to pull out or change the terms of the deal .
This is what I argued in a post yesterday about Lewis .
Because BofA did not change the deal terms and was subsequently bailed out , we can only believe that there was a nod - and - wink deal made with Bernanke and Paulson that more funds would be coming to bolster BofA ’s worsening balance sheet as the stock price cratered .
At the end of the day , none of this is beneficial to Bank of America shareholders , who have seen their shares fall from over $ 50 per share to as low as $ 3 before rebounding to over $ 10 .
They now trade for $ 9.10 .
Just think back , before the Countrywide and Merrill acquisitions , Ken Lewis could have claimed to be a rival for king of the hill to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon , who now touts his firm ’s ‘ fortress ’ balance sheet .
But , after two disastrous mergers , Bank of America is a shambles .
The real losers in this he - said she - said saga of corporate executives managers and regulations are the owners of the business , the shareholders .
And yet , John
Thain is the only one to have lost his job .

Thain Fires Back at Bank of America – WSJ
We all know " behind " the banks are the vampire elites , e.g. , The Bilderberg Group and a few thousand billionaire / trillionaire filth , but at least now we know the " face " of The Beast .
As a relevant aside , we should never forget that Bill and Hillary Clinton have been licking the jack boots of the Bilderberg Group , the Monsanto corporation ( described as the most toxic corporation on the planet , which is steadily poisoning the entire food supply of the Earth ) , but probably most of all , the Israel Lobby ( please read the objective and documented book with this title about how this astronomically rich lobby is literally destroying human civilization and that the psychotically righteous Israeli right wing does not now and never has wanted a " two state solution " -- rather they openly want to steal the entire State of Palestine . )
Remember The Beast ( mentally ill religious fanatics , the lunatic right wing of every country on the Earth , and parasitical , vampire elites ) , functions best is it 's " Heart of Darkness " , and here the " vampire " image fits perfectly , since their ultimate fear is the " daylight " of truth .
We also know The Beast has been ravaging civilization ( in various historical forms ) for probably thousands of years ; however , for the last few hundred years the ultimate weapon of The Beast has been banks , banks , and more banks .
Ironically , the billionaire bailout of banks ( which Obama has done nothing to stop ! ) , followed by the financial rape of frequently doubling bank credit card rates , has drawn the world 's attention to " the banks " .
Suddenly , we see them for what the are : the face and weapon of The Beast .
The Beast image has been very useful , particularly with its spiritual innuendos , but you can only go so far with metaphors and images , and eventually you need something more concrete and specific for the target of America 's rage .
And now we have it !
BANKS are where we can focus our rage .
BANKS basically totally explain the death of our economy – and our Constitutional Republic .
BANKS are warehouses of treason , limitless dishonesty , limitless greed , and the ultimate origin of the rape of America .
Again , " behind " the banks are a few thousand billionaires and trillionaires , but Daddy Rockefeller can no longer be seen as an aging American , because now we KNOW this monster is responsible not only for the bankruptcy of millions of Americans ( and vulnerable people all around the globe ) ; he is also responsible either directly or indirectly for the deaths of literally millions of human beings .
The evidence continues to mount that groups like " The Illuminati " are systematically committing planet - wide genocide as we speak .

Two of the defendants argued their innocence on Sunday in a webcast Half of the charges levelled at the founders of the Pirate Bay file - sharing site have been dropped .
Swedish prosecutors dropped charges relating to " assisting copyright infringement " leaving the lesser charges of " assisting making available copyright material " on trial day two .
Pirate Bay co-founder Frederik Neij said it showed prosecutors had misunderstood the technology .
The music industry played down the changes as " simplifying the charges " .
Peter Danowsky , legal counsel for the music companies in the case , said : " It 's a largely technical issue that changes nothing in terms of our compensation claims and has no bearing whatsoever on the main case against The Pirate Bay .
" In fact it simplifies the prosecutor 's case by allowing him to focus on the main issue , which is the making available of copyrighted works . "
The Pirate Bay was launched in 2003 and quickly established itself as the world 's most high profile file - sharing website .
In February 2009 , it reported 22 million simultaneous users .
At the start of the trial in Stockholm , Frederik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde Kolmsioppi and Carl Lundstrom were facing a large fine and up to two years in prison , if convicted .
" This is a sensation .
It is very rare to win half the target in just one and a half days and it is clear that the prosecutor took strong note of what we said yesterday , " defence lawyer Per E Samuelson told the TorrentFreak website , which reports on developments in the BitTorrent file - sharing community .
BitTorrent is a legal application used by many file - sharers to swap content because of the fast and efficient way it distributes files .
No copyright content is hosted on The Pirate Bay 's web servers ; instead the site hosts " torrent " links to TV , film and music files held on its users computers .
Your reactions :
At the turn of the century lobbyists proclaimed that travelling in a steam - driven train at the mindboggling speed of 20 mph would suffocate and kill you .
This nonsense came from rigid old fashioned entrepreneurs who could n't cope with the tide of time , and the change in technology that comes with it .
Nor can the media barons of large companies and if they can't they will subsequently disappear and others will take over .
The trial is at best entertainment but of no significance what so ever !
Fredrik , Malmo , Sweden I agree that sharing copyrighted materials is a violation of law , but at the same time the companies themselves legally enforce their own laws in the software they release in the name " Terms of use " or " EULA " which you have to click on it to install the program .
It contains usually a very sophisticated term that serves to protect the company in the first place .
Shamoel , Sweden I sincerely hope that the media firms fail miserably in this endeavour .
They need to recognize that websites like the Pirate Bay and people like Mr. Sunde and his colleagues will be around for quite a while mostly in response to their dreadful business tactics .
These firms do n't even have a valid accusation : " It 's a trial that regards four individuals that have conducted a big commercial business making money out of others ' file - sharing works , copyright - protected movies ... " .
What business ?
None of these bit - torrent trackers are a business !
Most of their money goes right back into the site itself !
Any money they make has got to be a fraction of the ridiculous amount these lawyers are asking for !
And none of the " infringing material " is found on their servers anyway !
It 'll set a welcome legal precedent when the firms lose and TPB gets to continue freely , and the media bullies can leave with their tails between their legs .
Good luck TPB crew !

If you can get something for nothing , why buy it ?
This is theft , pure and simple , and it deprives the creators of the profits they have earned and that they need to produce more content .
Daniel Guida , La Mesa , California , USA I 'm with Pirate Bay on this one as the entertainment industry has been ripping off consumers for decades and now with the digital age it's time to stuff a few of these companies
If they ain't prepared to keep apace with technology and offer their product at a reasonable price then they 're finished .
And as far as the law goes , these two lads are in the right - they are not responsible themselves for distributing the il( legal ) content .
So , stuff the industry .

US combat troops may stay in northern Iraq after a deadline for them to pull back by the end of June has passed , the top US commander in the area has said .
Col Gary Volesky said his soldiers would stay in Mosul and other nearby cities where al - Qaeda remained a threat if the Iraqi government asked them to .
US and Iraqi officials describe Mosul as al - Qaeda in Iraq 's last major urban stronghold in the country .
Barack Obama has said he wants all US troops out of Iraq by the end of 2011 .
" If the Iraqi government wants us to stay we will stay , " said Col Volesky in a teleconference with journalists .
He said the US military was conducting an assessment of the situation in Mosul after five US soldiers were killed in a suicide lorry bombing there on Friday .
In January , Ryan Crocker , the outgoing US ambassador to Iraq , warned that a hasty withdrawal of US troops from the country would create " severe risks " .
He said al - Qaeda remained a threat and that an overly rapid departure would have a " chilling effect " on Iraqis .
The US currently has more than 140,000 troops in Iraq , and combat troops are due to pull out of Iraq 's cities by the end of June .
Under a recent agreement , they are expected to remain elsewhere in the country until the end of August 2010 .
In Germany , wholesale prices dropped 8 percent in March from a year ago , the steepest fall since 1987 .
In Japan , wholesale prices fell 2.2 percent on an annual basis .
In the United States , the Consumer Price Index fell 0.4 percent in March , year over year , though prices rose 0.2 percent excluding food and energy .
“ It does n’t mean it will spread here to the U.S. , but we need to look closely at Spain and other places to understand the dynamic , ” says Simon Johnson , a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund .
“ It ’s like the front line of a new virus outbreak . ”

The trends have unnerved even well - established businesses .
“ There is such a huge lack of confidence in the politicians , in the European Union and in the banks , ” said Arturo Virosque , 79 , president of Valencia ’s chamber of commerce and the owner of a local logistics company .
Ticking off crises going back to the Spanish Civil War in his youth , he said , “ this is different .
It ’s like an illness . ”
After price cuts by competitors , Mr. Virosque ’s company reduced charges for storage and transportation , and slashed its work force to about 170 , from 250 .
“ The worst thing is that we have to cut the young people , ” he said , because higher severance makes it too expensive to fire older workers .
While unemployment traditionally is higher in Spain than in much of Europe , the sharp increase has many here nervous .
The jobless rate for those under 25 is at a Depression - like level of 31.8 percent , the highest among the 27 nations of the European Union .
Before cutting prices in early 2009 , Mr. Maestre ordered several rounds of job cuts at his company , Fermax , as sales of the intercoms collapsed with Spain ’s housing bubble .

GOP Wields More Influence Over the Stimulus Bill - The Wall Street Journal Maine Sen. Collins Leads Group of Moderates Seeking to Trim Package to $ 700 Billion or Less ; Obama Calls for Quick Action
February 5 , 2009
WASHINGTON - Republicans are exercising increasing influence over President Barack Obama 's economic - stimulus plan in the Senate , with Maine Sen.
Susan Collins emerging as a leader of efforts to trim the initiative and sharpen its focus on job creation .
Sen .
Collins , a centrist with allies in both parties , was called to the White House Wednesday to meet with Mr. Obama .
She envisions holding the cost of the stimulus package to $ 700 billion or less , well below the $ 819 billion package of tax cuts and spending the House approved last week .
The target grew out of discussions among a group of moderate Republicans , led by Sen .
Collins , aimed at reining in costs and better targeting federal funds toward job creation .
The effort amounts to " rebuilding " the Obama package , according to an individual familiar with the talks .
The package would include tax cuts and investments intended to create jobs , such as infrastructure projects , but it would step back from spending projects that do n't immediately lift the sagging U.S. economy .
After meeting with Mr. Obama , Sen .
Collins expressed concern about a number of spending provisions , including $ 780 million for pandemic - flu preparedness .
" I have no doubt that the president is willing to negotiate in good faith , that he wants to have a bipartisan bill , " Sen .
Collins said .
The move to scale back the package came as Mr. Obama made a pitch for quick action .
" No plan is perfect , and we should work to make it stronger , " said Mr. Obama , who separately met Wednesday with two other centrist senators .
" But let 's not make the perfect the enemy of the essential . "
It is unclear how far Sen .
Collins 's plan will advance , or how much appetite the Senate will ultimately have for sizable cuts in the package .
But the effort dramatizes the fluid nature of debate this week .
Other Republicans have successfully pulled the legislation in the opposite direction : Amendments they pushed would add billions of dollars to the budget of the National Institutes of Health , while creating tax breaks to encourage auto purchases .
The stimulus package being proposed in the Senate has approached $ 900 billion .
But as it nears a vote , GOP leaders say the plan ignores Republican proposals .
Video courtesy of Fox News .
The push for more generous incentives paid off again Wednesday , as the Senate , by voice vote , approved an $ 18.9 billion proposal by Sen. Johnny Isakson ( R. , Ga. ) to create a tax credit to encourage housing purchases .
The tax credit would be equal to $ 15,000 , or 10 % of the purchase price , whichever is lower , on the purchase of a primary residence .
The provision would apply to purchases made in the 12 months after the date of enactment of the package .
A little later Wednesday , the Senate , also by voice vote , approved $ 2 billion for state agencies to help finance affordable - housing projects that have dried up as a result of the credit crunch .
" Thanks so much , " said Sen. Christopher " Kit " Bond ( R. , Mo. ) .
Additional housing measures are expected , possibly a proposal to commit billions of dollars for foreclosure relief .
The changes Wednesday pushed the cost of the Senate package to more than $ 920 billion .
" At some point , we 're going to have to learn to say no , " said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R. , Ky . ) .
Moreover , the Senate moved to damp growing international criticism of a " Buy American " provision that would require all projects funded through the legislation be built with U.S. products .
After negotiations with the White House , the Senate maintained the original mandate , but approved an amendment , by voice vote , requiring the limit to be " applied in a manner " consistent with U.S. trade agreements .
President Obama said Tuesday he feared the provision could " trigger a trade war . "
U.S. business groups vowed to keep pushing for the provision to be removed altogether .
[ GOP Wields More Influence Over the Stimulus Bill ]
As a measure of the " Buy America " provision 's popularity , the Senate voted 65 - 31 to defeat an amendment by Sen. John McCain ( R. , Ariz . ) that would have stripped the provision from the package entirely .
Democrats entered this week 's debate knowing they would need Republican support .
That is because 60 votes are necessary to ensure passage in the Senate , and Democrats currently only control the chamber with a 58 - 41 majority .
Democratic leaders have provided for open debate .
And in a further overture , Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D. , Nev. ) has signaled that Republicans will have a voice in final negotiations , once efforts begin to meld the competing House and Senate stimulus bills .
Another complicating factor : Not all Democrats are certain to vote with the White House .
Sen. Ben Nelson ( D. , Neb . ) is working with a dozen or more moderate Democrats to find ways to scale back the package .
The senators have identified more than $ 50 billion in projects they contend do n't meet the test of near - term job creation , including $ 122.5 million for new and renovated polar ice breakers .
Sen . Nelson also met with Mr. Obama Wednesday .
He said the president knows the bill needs " scrubbing , " and is committed to working with moderates .
Sen .
Nelson 's effort is being coordinated with Sen.
Collins , who has been conferring with a half - dozen moderate Republicans , and the two senators might move forward on a bipartisan alternative .
Their actions are being closely monitored by Senate Democratic leaders , who want to keep the president 's initiative on track .
" We 're open to changes , " said Senate Democratic Whip Richard Durbin ( D. , Ill . ) .
But he defended the thrust of the package , saying that " the fundamentals of the bill are sound , " a message echoed by White House budget chief Peter Orszag .
In an interview , Mr. Orszag said the administration 's " portfolio " approach to stimulus , which combines relief for cash - strapped states , tax cuts for businesses and individuals , and a raft of government spending , is designed to spread the impact of government action throughout the economy .
" The package , in my view , is basically the right size , and it has basically the right balance , " he said .

Over the last several years , developers have moved from table - based website structures to div-based structures .
Hey , that ’s great .
But wait !
Do developers know the reasons for moving to div-based structures , and do they know how to ?
Often it seems that people are moving away from table hell only to wind up in div hell .
This article covers common problems with layout structure in web design .
The first part goes through what table and div hells are , including lots of examples .
The next section shows how to write cleaner and more readable code .
The final part looks at what features await in future .
Please join us on this journey from hell to heaven .

Table Hell
You ’re in table hell when your website uses tables for design purposes .
Tables generally increase the complexity of documents and make them more difficult to maintain .
Also , they reduce a website ’s flexibility in accommodating different media and design elements , and they limit a website ’s functionality .
MAMA ( Metadata Analysis and Mining Application ) is a structural Web page search engine from Opera Software that crawls Web pages and returns results detailing page structures .
If we look into MAMA ’s key findings , we see that the average website has a table structure nested three levels deep .
On the list of 10 most popular tags , table , td and tr are all there .
The table element is found on over 80 % of the pages whose URLs were crawled by MAMA .
Semantically speaking , the table tag is meant for listing tabular data .
It is not optimized to build structure .
Ease of use
Using tables to build structure is quite intuitive .
We see tabular data every day , and the concept is well known .
And the existence of table attributes makes for a rather flat learning curve because the developer does n’t have to use a separate style sheet .
With divs , the developer must use the style attribute or an external style sheet , because the div tag does n’t have any attributes attached to it .
Also , tables do n’t break when the content is too wide .
Columns are not squeezed under other columns as they are in a div-based structure .
This adds to the feeling that using tables is safe .
Maintainability
Table contains different tags : the table tag being the wrapper , tr for each row and td for each cell .
The thead and tbody tags are not used for structural purposes because they add semantic meaning to the content .
For readability , each tag is normally given its own line of code , with indention .
With all of these tags for the table , several extra lines of code are added to content .
The colspan and rowspan attributes make the code even more complex , and any developer maintaining that page in future has to go through a lot of code to understand its structure .
< table cellpadding = " 0 " cellspacing = " 0 " border= " 0 " > < tr > < td colspan= " 3 " height = " 120 px " >....</td> </tr> < tr> < td class = " menu " valign = " top " >...</td> < td class=" content " valign = " top " >...</td> < td class = " aSide " valign = " top " >...</td> </tr> < tr> < td colspan= " 3 " >...</td> </tr> </table >
< div id =" header " >...</ div > < div id =" menu " >...</ div> < div id =" content " >...</ div > < div id =" aSide " >...</ div > < div id =" footer " >...</div>
As we see from the example , the table - based layout contains more code than the div- based version .
Imagine now if this difference in size stays consistent as the code base grows ( by a ratio as much as 2:1 ) .
In a div - based structure , it is also possible to skip the menu div and use an unordered list ( ul ) as a container instead .
Nested tables are code smell that a website is stuck in table hell .
The number of lines of code is endless , and the complexity is overwhelming .
Tables are far from clean code and do n’t bring anything semantic to the content unless you ’re dealing with actual tabular data .
And if you ’ve happened to inherit the maintenance of a website that has poor readability , it ’s a nightmare .
Nested tables are a poor substitution for semantically meaningful , block - level elements .
Another drawback to tables is that they make it harder to separate content from design .
The border , width , cellpadding and cellspacing tags are used in about 90 % of all websites that use tables , according to MAMA .
This adds code to the HTML that should instead go in the style sheet .
Excess code slows down development and raises maintenance costs .
There ’s a limit to how many lines of code a programmer can produce per hour , and excess code is more complicated for others to understand .
Developers may not even understand their own code after a while .
More lines of code mean larger file sizes , which mean longer download times .
Developers should keep in mind new media , such as mobile devices , which usually have low bandwidth .
Websites will have to support media other than traditional monitors in future , and bad code limits the possibilities .
A large code base has more bugs than a small one .
Developers tend to produce a certain number of bugs per line of code .
Because tables increase the code base , such structures likely contain more bugs than layouts with less code lines .
Websites with tags that properly describe content are easily identifiable .
Disabling the style sheet on craigslist shows us a table - based layout .
Headlines are marked only with the bold tag , and all links could easily be put in individual lists .
Flexibility with media
In an ideal world , the same markup would be used for printers , mobile devices , screens and other media .
Using tables for structure provides less flexibility in moving columns around and hiding entire columns .
Your user may want to put the side column at the bottom or view a printer - friendly version .
With tables , this would require a separate page for each media , which means extra costs during development and higher maintenance costs compared to a div-based website that separates content and design .

A classic .
Websites currently in table hell :
Div Hell
Websites in div hell have more div tags than are necessary .
This is also known as “ divitis . ”
The div tag is a block - level element that defines a section within a document .
Divs are thus suitable for building the structure of Web pages .
The div tag is also used to describe content that cannot be properly described by other more semantic tags .
When developers do not understand the semantic meaning of other block - level elements , they often add more div tags than are needed .
Some programmers mistakenly believe that using a lot of divs is just fine .
Maybe this photo by my_ladyhawk makes a good point .
Is overuse of divs the best of the worst ?
Ease of use
Div -based structures have a much steeper learning curve than table - based structures .
The developer must know CSS and understand the difference between block - level elements and inline elements , when to use floats and when to use absolute positioning and how to solve browser bugs .
The div element is n’t visual like the table element .
Everyone knows what a table looks like , but divs are not as obvious .
The good thing about a div , though , is that it ’s only one element .
It ’s not wrapped in a parent element the way td tags are in tables .
The container , then , is more flexible and does n’t have the limitations of its parent tag .
Using a div for structure can make a page more fragile when content is pushing the div to its limit .
It can also force columns to fall under each other .
But this is usually only true for older browsers ( particularly IE6 ) ; newer browsers make content flow to the next column .
Dealing with browser bugs can be a little tricky at first , but with experience developers can identify and fix them .
Browser support for W3C standards is getting better and better .
With the growing popularity of Firefox and Safari and the introduction of Google Chrome , we are seeing a big fight over market share , which inevitably makes for better browsers .
Maintainability
The biggest problem with div tags is that they are used too often .
Divs should only be used to build structure and as placeholders for design elements when no other block - level elements can describe the content .
The div tag is for logical groupings of elements .
Nesting div tags deeply is a sure path to maintenance hell , and the code will make developers think twice before touching it , simply because it ’s so unreadable .
True , using descriptive class and structure names makes the code more understandable , but using them for nested div tags is not always easy .
Too many div tags is code smell that content is n’t being described as it should .
It means divs are being used when semantic block - level tags would better describe the content ; for instance , headings should be wrapped in h1 to h5 tags .
Writing semantic code usually reduces the code base ; and less divs with floats helps keep browser bugs away .
Disabling the style sheet for Twitter shows us some nice semantic code .
Twitter uses lists , headings , hr and fieldset and shows good understanding of how to mark up content .
Of course , ids and classes can carry semantic values that no other tags have .
The problem is that these values are not standardized .
For example , div id =“ banner ” could have a semantic value for software containing advanced algorithms , telling it that this is a banner .
Classes and ids that have semantic values added to them will never be a substitute for tags that have semantic values built in .
Giving semantic values to classes and ids will dramatically increase the readability of code and help avoid bad class names like bigRedText .
Also , search engines such as Google use complex algorithms that use the semantic information in classes and ids .
One interesting technology is microformats , which are built on the idea of semantic classes .
With the help of special standardized formats , content can be automatically processed by microformat - aware software .
< div class= " vcard " > < span class = " tel " > < span class = " type " > home </ span > : < span class= " value " >+1.415.555.1212</span > </ span > </div>
An example of an hCard microformat .
The hCard is a format for representing people , companies , organizations and places .
The presence of the style attribute is code smell that a website is languishing in div hell , because it does n’t have any particular rendering behavior .
53.54 % of all websites indexed by MAMA contain a style attribute , and 35.40 % of all websites have divs that use a style attribute .
Classes and ids would help separate design and content and clean up this widespread use of the style attribute .
Classes and ids would also facilitate access to elements in the document object model ( DOM ) through scripts .
Semantic code helps machines understand content .
While humans are capable of finding the Norwegian word for “ monkey ” using the Web , computers cannot do this without human direction .
That ’s why it ’s very important to use tags that describe content properly .
Here are a couple more reasons why machines need to be able to understand website content :
Spiders crawl websites , indexing pages for search engines .
Adding semantic meaning to content probably makes websites rank higher .
Screen readers are used by people with visual impairments .
They read content out loud to the user or send it to a braille display that the user reads with his or her fingers .
Also , visually impaired people use the keyboard to navigate and use a wide range of keyboard commands .
They can also get lists of all headings and links on a page , and each of those lists has meta information on how many elements it contains .
Setting the language attribute is also important so that screen readers read content in the correct language .
The importance of semantic markup is illustrated by comparing the strong and b tags .
The strong tag adds semantic meaning to the content ; and b tag adds only visual meaning .
As a result , people using screen readers wo n’t get the same information from that content as people seeing it visually .
Many countries have laws that prescribe accessibility support for government websites .
Others will follow .
A braille display .

Every extra div the developer adds makes the code harder to read .
More lines of code lead to longer download times , and so on .
This all rings of the code smell we get from table - based layouts .
Overusing div tags is as bad as having a table - based layout , except that it is more flexible with media .
To illustrate the circles of div hell , let ’s look at examples :
Menu
< div id =" menu " > < div class= " selected " > < div class= " graphicLeft " > < div class= " graphicRight " > < a href= " # " >
Home </ a> </div> </div> </div > < div > < div class= " graphicLeft " > < div class= " graphicRight " > < a href= " # " > About </a> </div> </div > </div > ... </div>
Here is a typical example of a menu with too many div tags .
Using a list and setting the anchor tag to display : block in the style sheet would have made all of these divs unnecessary .
Headings
< div class= " headingOne " >
My heading </div > < div class= " headingTwo " >
My heading </div > < div class=" heading Three " >
My heading </div >
Headings created like this add only visual effect to the content .
Their semantic value is lost , and screen readers and web spiders can’t tell they ’re headings .
( This is the same as what we see when b is used instead of strong . )
News list
< div class = " news " > < img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </div> < div class = " news " > < img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </div>
Developers who do n’t see the potential of list elements often use divs instead .
Lists save some class definitions and help screen readers know how many items there are .
Different widths for containers
Page 1
< div id=" contentNormal " ></div > < div id=" aSideNormal " ></div >
Page 2
< div id=" contentWide " ></div > < div id=" aSideSmall " ></div >
When every column on a website is given its own container , many unnecessary div ids are created .
This can easily be rectified by adding a class to the body tag .
Let each container simply inherit the class of the body tag and then give each page its own layout in the style sheet .
This makes it easy to read the content and page .
The improved readability of both the HTML and style sheet simplifies maintenance .
Flexibility with media
Even a website in div hell can be flexible with different media as long as the design is separated from the content and put in the style sheet .
Read the excellent article “ Going to Print ” on A List Apart for guidelines on building a printer - friendly version of your website .
This is beyond the scope of this article , but it ’s important to point out that a div- based structure is more flexible in supporting different media than a table - based structure .
Not having to maintain separate pages for each media saves maintenance and development costs .
A div-based structure allows you to move columns around and even hide columns using display : none in the style sheet .
When a website is in div hell and has a lot of floats , finding out which floats to disable to avoid printing bugs on Gecko - based browsers like Netscape 6.x and Mozilla ’s is very hard .
These browsers do not print long floating elements well .
If a floating element runs past the bottom of a printed page , the rest of the float effectively disappears and is not printed on the next page .

Using divs correctly
Before creating a div , the developer should consider , “ Do I really need this , or can I do this with a block - level element ? ”
Liberal use of h1 to h5 for headings and ul and dl for lists helps a lot , and do n’t forget the paragraph tag .
Another element that does n’t need div wrapping is form .
For more flexibility with forms , try combining the fieldset element with a list : that way , the content has semantic value , and the developer has block - level elements to design with .
Because a div element marks up only one block at a time , the code base is much smaller than that of a table - based structure .
Less code is code that is more readable , easier to maintain , faster to develop , less buggy , smaller in size , you get the point .
You want as little code as possible to do the job right .
When a structure is tagged correctly , more divs are needed only for graphics .
When we ca n’t put background - color , border , background - image , etc. on a block - level element , introducing a div is okay .
Clean code should n’t stand in the way of a good graphic design .
See how many block - level elements Yahoo has on its home page .
This screenshot , with tables and block - level elements outlined , was taken with the Web Developer plug - in for Firefox .
Could Yahoo have used fewer containers ?
Tips and tricks
Let ’s go through some basic examples .
The examples below should inspire developers to dig deeper into the subject of clean code and ways to avoid divitis .
Notice how the semantics in the code help keep the code readable .
Menu
< ul id =" menu " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Products </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
About </a></li> </ul >
A menu as a list is easier to use than as a div and saves many lines of codes .
The li tag is a block - level element that can have background properties attached to it , as it is the anchor tag if its display attribute is set to block in the style sheet .
Two block - level elements exist to contain the beginning and end of each menu item ’s layout .
Using a list also makes the page more accessible for people with disabilities and allows you to nest lists for sub-menus .
Headings
<h1 > Main heading </h1 > < h2 > Normal heading </h2 >
Use headings where possible .
They add semantic value to content and boost website rankings in search engines .
They also help people who use screen readers access and understand content .
News list
< ul class= " newsList " > < li > <img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </li > < li > <img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </li > </ul >
Group similar pieces of content together and put them in lists .
It ’s amazing how much of the web is in lists .
Lists are perfect containers .
They save many lines of code and make code much more understandable than it would be with tables or a mess of divs .
And lists let people with screen readers know how many elements they contain .
So many main pages of websites already contain lists of news .
Different widths for containers
HTML
< body class= " newsShow " > < div id =" content " ></div > < div id =" aSide " ></div > </ body >
CSS
/* Containers */ # content { float : left ; } # aSide { float : right ; } /*
Page structures */ .newsShow # content { width : 80 % ; } .newsShow # aSide { width : 20 % ; } .home # content { width : 70 % ; } .home # aSide { width : 30 % ; } .oneColumn # content { width : 100 % ; }
With a class for body , there is no need for contentSmall , contentNormal , contentWider and so on .
Simply refer to the container through the body parent class and then control the width in the style sheet .
The style sheet will be more readable , and the developer wo n’t need to refer to so many bad classes .
The page type ( body class ) will tell you which one to refer to .
List post data
< dl > < dt > Your name is :</ dt > < dd> Susan Hanson</ dd > < dt > Your address is :</ dt > < dd> Street name 1</dd > < dt > You live in :</ dt > < dd> Oslo</dd > </dl >
Use the dl tag when listing key value pairs .
Many people would probably use a table for this purpose .
But using the dl tag saves code and makes it possible to float the dt and dd tags and set their widths for a nice layout .
The dl tag semantically links the dd to the dt tag .
Both dt and dd are block - level elements .
Simple form
< form > < ul > < li > < fieldset > < legend > Person info</ legend > < ul > < li > < label for =" name " >
Name :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " name " id =" name " /> </ li > < li > < label for = " age " >
Age :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " age " id = " age " /> </li > ... </ul > </ fieldset > </ li > < li > < fieldset > < legend > Address info</ legend > < ul > < li > < label for = " address " >
Address :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " address " id =" address " /> </ li > < li > < label for = " zip " >
Zip :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " zip " id =" zip " /> </li > ... </ul > </ fieldset > </li > ... </ul > </ form >
This example is of a form that is semantic and has containers for the layout .
Getting a nice layout with forms can often be quite messy .
Nested tables are often used for this purpose .
But using lists instead tells screen readers how many elements a form contains .
The fieldset is a block - level element that groups related data and can be nicely designed using CSS .
Using divs to manage structure ( header , menu , footer and so on ) and using other block elements , like p , ul , dl and form , where appropriate would make the world a much easier place to live .
Lists are already widely used and perfect as containers .
And do n’t forget to include a class with your body tag .
When developers start coding cleanly and semantically , they never look back .

Tips on Moving From a Table - to Div-Based Structure

Put layout - specific code in the style sheet , and let the markup tell the browser what kind of content it is .
Every time someone works on a page , she or he should check if the code can improved a bit , whether by making it more semantic , more readable or cleaner .
It would probably cost more to replace the whole system than fix it bit by bit , especially if it ’s a large website .
Do n’t continue writing bad code if the website already contains bad code .
Write good semantic code and remind yourself that the bad code will eventually be replaced .
Writing good code saves time in the end .
Make a difference now , right away by writing only clean , semantic code .
The Future
Two upcoming technologies look very interesting in how they deal with structure .
HTML 5 will come with tags that have structural semantic meaning and a table - based layout for CSS .
CSS 3 will come with a nice feature called multi-column layout .
HTML 5
With HTML 5 , we ’ll actually see semantic markup for the structure of Web pages , which mean the structure will have meaning .
This will add many possibilities for the way machines read websites :
Search engines will have more ways to rank content , based on the structure .
Screen readers will have more semantic markup with which to help visually impaired people .
Markup for small - screen devices will become standardized .
Along with new structural elements , HTML 5 also introduces many new tags .
Some of the most interesting elements :
The video and audio tag will bring new , semantically meaningful markup to content and allow video and audio to be streamed directly in the browser .
and tag will bring new , semantically meaningful markup to content and allow video and audio to be streamed directly in the browser .
Forms will get new and improved semantics for text input and form validation .
The new canvas tag will have a 2 - D drawing API .
HTML 5 also contains many new APIs , such as :
Immediate - mode 2D drawing
Timed media playback
Offline storage

To illustrate the circles of div hell , let ’s look at examples :
Menu
< div id =" menu " > < div class= " selected " > < div class= " graphicLeft " > < div class= " graphicRight " > < a href= " # " >
Home </ a> </div> </div> </div > < div > < div class= " graphicLeft " > < div class= " graphicRight " > < a href= " # " > About </a> </div> </div > </div > ... </div>
Here is a typical example of a menu with too many div tags .
Using a list and setting the anchor tag to display : block in the style sheet would have made all of these divs unnecessary .
Headings
< div class= " headingOne " >
My heading </div > < div class= " headingTwo " >
My heading </div > < div class=" heading Three " >
My heading </div >
Headings created like this add only visual effect to the content .
Their semantic value is lost , and screen readers and web spiders can’t tell they ’re headings .
( This is the same as what we see when b is used instead of strong . )
News list
< div class = " news " > < img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </div> < div class = " news " > < img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </div>
Developers who do n’t see the potential of list elements often use divs instead .
Lists save some class definitions and help screen readers know how many items there are .
Different widths for containers
Page 1
< div id=" contentNormal " ></div > < div id=" aSideNormal " ></div >
Page 2
< div id=" contentWide " ></div > < div id=" aSideSmall " ></div >
When every column on a website is given its own container , many unnecessary div ids are created .
This can easily be rectified by adding a class to the body tag .
Let each container simply inherit the class of the body tag and then give each page its own layout in the style sheet .
This makes it easy to read the content and page .
The improved readability of both the HTML and style sheet simplifies maintenance .
Flexibility with media
Even a website in div hell can be flexible with different media as long as the design is separated from the content and put in the style sheet .
Read the excellent article “ Going to Print ” on A List Apart for guidelines on building a printer - friendly version of your website .
This is beyond the scope of this article , but it ’s important to point out that a div- based structure is more flexible in supporting different media than a table - based structure .
Not having to maintain separate pages for each media saves maintenance and development costs .
A div-based structure allows you to move columns around and even hide columns using display : none in the style sheet .
When a website is in div hell and has a lot of floats , finding out which floats to disable to avoid printing bugs on Gecko - based browsers like Netscape 6.x and Mozilla ’s is very hard .
These browsers do not print long floating elements well .
If a floating element runs past the bottom of a printed page , the rest of the float effectively disappears and is not printed on the next page .

Using divs correctly
Before creating a div , the developer should consider , “ Do I really need this , or can I do this with a block - level element ? ”
Liberal use of h1 to h5 for headings and ul and dl for lists helps a lot , and do n’t forget the paragraph tag .
Another element that does n’t need div wrapping is form .
For more flexibility with forms , try combining the fieldset element with a list : that way , the content has semantic value , and the developer has block - level elements to design with .
Because a div element marks up only one block at a time , the code base is much smaller than that of a table - based structure .
Less code is code that is more readable , easier to maintain , faster to develop , less buggy , smaller in size , you get the point .
You want as little code as possible to do the job right .
When a structure is tagged correctly , more divs are needed only for graphics .
When we ca n’t put background - color , border , background - image , etc. on a block - level element , introducing a div is okay .
Clean code should n’t stand in the way of a good graphic design .
See how many block - level elements Yahoo has on its home page .
This screenshot , with tables and block - level elements outlined , was taken with the Web Developer plug - in for Firefox .
Could Yahoo have used fewer containers ?
Tips and tricks
Let ’s go through some basic examples .
The examples below should inspire developers to dig deeper into the subject of clean code and ways to avoid divitis .
Notice how the semantics in the code help keep the code readable .
Menu
< ul id =" menu " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Products </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
About </a></li> </ul >
A menu as a list is easier to use than as a div and saves many lines of codes .
The li tag is a block - level element that can have background properties attached to it , as it is the anchor tag if its display attribute is set to block in the style sheet .
Two block - level elements exist to contain the beginning and end of each menu item ’s layout .
Using a list also makes the page more accessible for people with disabilities and allows you to nest lists for sub-menus .
Headings
<h1 > Main heading </h1 > < h2 > Normal heading </h2 >
Use headings where possible .
They add semantic value to content and boost website rankings in search engines .
They also help people who use screen readers access and understand content .
News list
< ul class= " newsList " > < li > <img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </li > < li > <img /> < h2 /> < p /> <a /> </li > </ul >
Group similar pieces of content together and put them in lists .
It ’s amazing how much of the web is in lists .
Lists are perfect containers .
They save many lines of code and make code much more understandable than it would be with tables or a mess of divs .
And lists let people with screen readers know how many elements they contain .
So many main pages of websites already contain lists of news .
Different widths for containers
HTML
< body class= " newsShow " > < div id =" content " ></div > < div id =" aSide " ></div > </ body >
CSS
/* Containers */ # content { float : left ; } # aSide { float : right ; } /*
Page structures */ .newsShow # content { width : 80 % ; } .newsShow # aSide { width : 20 % ; } .home # content { width : 70 % ; } .home # aSide { width : 30 % ; } .oneColumn # content { width : 100 % ; }
With a class for body , there is no need for contentSmall , contentNormal , contentWider and so on .
Simply refer to the container through the body parent class and then control the width in the style sheet .
The style sheet will be more readable , and the developer wo n’t need to refer to so many bad classes .
The page type ( body class ) will tell you which one to refer to .
List post data
< dl > < dt > Your name is :</ dt > < dd> Susan Hanson</ dd > < dt > Your address is :</ dt > < dd> Street name 1</dd > < dt > You live in :</ dt > < dd> Oslo</dd > </dl >
Use the dl tag when listing key value pairs .
Many people would probably use a table for this purpose .
But using the dl tag saves code and makes it possible to float the dt and dd tags and set their widths for a nice layout .
The dl tag semantically links the dd to the dt tag .
Both dt and dd are block - level elements .
Simple form
< form > < ul > < li > < fieldset > < legend > Person info</ legend > < ul > < li > < label for =" name " >
Name :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " name " id =" name " /> </ li > < li > < label for = " age " >
Age :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " age " id = " age " /> </li > ... </ul > </ fieldset > </ li > < li > < fieldset > < legend > Address info</ legend > < ul > < li > < label for = " address " >
Address :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " address " id =" address " /> </ li > < li > < label for = " zip " >
Zip :</ label > < input type =" text " name = " zip " id =" zip " /> </li > ... </ul > </ fieldset > </li > ... </ul > </ form >
This example is of a form that is semantic and has containers for the layout .
Getting a nice layout with forms can often be quite messy .
Nested tables are often used for this purpose .
But using lists instead tells screen readers how many elements a form contains .
The fieldset is a block - level element that groups related data and can be nicely designed using CSS .
Using divs to manage structure ( header , menu , footer and so on ) and using other block elements , like p , ul , dl and form , where appropriate would make the world a much easier place to live .
Lists are already widely used and perfect as containers .
And do n’t forget to include a class with your body tag .
When developers start coding cleanly and semantically , they never look back .

Timed media playback

MIME and protocol handler registration
Work on HTML 5 started in late 2003 and has the following timeline :
First W3C Working Draft in October 2007
Last Call Working Draft in October 2009
Call for contributions for the test suite in 2011
Candidate Recommendation in 2012
First draft of test suite in 2012
Second draft of test suite in 2015
Final version of test suite in 2019
Reissued Last Call Working Draft in 2020
Proposed Recommendation in 2022
This may look ridiculous ( 2003 to 2022 is 19 years ! ) , but consider the case of HTML 4 , DOM2 HTML and XHTML1 , the three specifications that HTML 5 is supposed to replace .
The HTML 5 team wants to have a test suite with which at least two browsers completely pass before calling it a day .
This does n’t mean that developers can’t start using HTML 5 before 2022 , only that the specification may change during this period .
HTML 5 will probably be usable by 2012 , depending on how fast browser makers implement the features and distribute their browsers to users .
Some APIs and tags have even been implemented in today ’s browsers .
The semantic structure of HTML 5 will save developers from having to add many divs , but marking up the rest of the content correctly will still be important for having a semantic website .
Last but not least , understanding the difference between block - level elements and inline elements and what every tag is for will still be very important .
Table - based layout with CSS
Another new feature will display block - level elements as tables with the help of CSS .
The display attribute for the wrapper would be set to table , and the display attribute for block - level elements that are columns would be set to table - cell .
Table - based layout with CSS will be more robust than the float model , in which the layout often breaks when the font size is extreme .
Another positive effect is that columns will automatically be equal in height .
With the release of IE8 , all three major browsers now support the styling of block - level elements as tables .
It will probably be a while , though , before the majority of users actually use a browser that renders the feature as intended .
HTML
< body > < ul id =" menu " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Products </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
About </a></li> </ul > < div id =" content " > < p >
Fusce quis velit ... </ p> </div> < div id =" aSide " > < p > Praesent iaculis commodo elit ... </ p> </div> </ body >
CSS
body { display : table ; table - layout : fixed ; } #menu , #content , # aSide { display : table - cell ; } #menu { width : 20 % ; border : 2 px solid red;} # content { width : 50 % ; border : 2 px solid blue ; } # aSide { width : 29 % ; border : 2 px solid green;}
The wrapper ( in this example , body ) is set to display as a table , and the relevant columns are set to table - cell .
This even works for list elements , as the example shows ( and it saves a div ) .
This is a trimmed example ; a normal structure would contain a header and footer .
This would have required an extra div to contain the row with menu , content and aSide .
The container that holds each row would need its display set to table - row .
The container for each row is needed to get a break line after the columns .
This example shows the above code running in Firefox .
Multi-column layout with CSS
Some CSS 3 magic will help developers arrange text in columns within an element .
This will be possible in two ways : by defining either a column width or a column count .
Multi-column layout is currently supported in Mozilla and Webkit - based browsers , which prefix these properties with - moz - and - webkit- , respectively .
Column width
The number of columns displayed depends on how wide the column is set ( spacing between columns is controlled by the column - gap property ) and how wide the container is .
- webkit - column - width : 8em ; - webkit-column-gap : 1em ; - moz-column - width : 8em ; - moz-column-gap : 1em ;
This example was created with column - width on the paragraph tag and a body width set to 495 px .
The code is rendered in Google Chrome .
Column count
The column - count property defines how many columns text is divided into .
The width of the columns depends on how wide the container , column gaps and column borders are .
- webkit- column - count : 2 ; - webkit-column-gap : 1em ; - webkit-column-rule : 1 px solid black ; - moz-column - count : 2 ; -moz-column-gap : 1em ; - moz - column - rule : 1 px solid black ;
This example was created with column - count on the paragraph tag and a body width set to 490 px .
The code is rendered in Google Chrome .
( It looks the same in Firefox , aside from the column divider not showing . )

W3C offers a new way to arrange text , “ newspaper - wise , ” in columns .
Knowing the difference between block - level and inline elements
A block - level element is an HTML tag ( such as p , table , h1 or div ) that generates a break line .
A block - level element has five spacing properties : height , width , margin , border and padding .
An inline element , such as a span or anchor , does n’t generate a break line and is n’t as flexible a container as a block - level element .
A block - level element is not allowed inside an inline element .

Karzai says he hopes the president shows better judgment in his plans for Afghanistan .
Karzai takes swipe at Obama
Afghan President Hamid Karzai took a shot at President Barack Obama on Sunday , saying he hopes the president shows better judgment in his plans for Afghanistan once his administration has " put itself together . "
In his first major interview since Obama assumed the presidency , Karzai was asked by CNN host Fareed Zakaria on his show " GPS " to respond to charges made by Obama that the Afghan president has demonstrated a " bunker mentality . "
Advertisement
" I was surprised to see that statement , " Karzai said .
" Perhaps it 's because the administration has not yet put itself together .
Perhaps they have not been given the information yet .
And I hope as they settle down , and as they learn more , we will see better judgment . "
Asked if he thought Obama understands the struggles facing Afghanistan , Karzai backtracked a bit , saying Obama " surely " understands the country .
" Surely he 's a very intelligent person as well .
And given the right reporting by his administration , given the right figures by this administration , he 'll figure out very quickly as to how things are in Afghanistan , " the Afghan president said .
Despite the rift , Karzai said he expects to be able to work with Obama .
" I can certainly engage with him very , very , very positively , " he said .
" It 's part of what has been said by him during his election campaign .
It 's part of the things that 's been said recently . "
Karzai added , though , that Obama has a tough act to follow , calling former President George W. Bush " a great person . "
" I have a lot of respect for him , " Karzai added .
But while Karzai praised Bush , he also accused the United States of repeatedly trying to exert international political pressure on him by leaking information to The New York Times and others that he his brother has profited from the Afghan drug trade .
“ There were charges in The New York Times in 2004 , just about a month and a half before the presidential elections in Afghanistan , that my brother was involved in drugs — or rumored to be involved in drugs , ” he said .
“ Now , incidentally , Mr. Zakaria , this happened after I had a serious dispute with the U.S. and British ambassadors on a spraying from air on a poppy field in the Nangarhar Province of Afghanistan . ”
Asked to confirm that he was accusing elements within the United States government of trying to manipulate press coverage to place pressure on him , Karzai responded : “ My conclusion is that , yes , this was part of a political pressure tactic , unfortunately . ”
When Tony Blair called recently in this magazine for all leaders to “ do God ” , we anticipated a response ; the volume and vigour of the letters , emails and commentary his article provoked , however , were beyond anything we expected .
Whatever one thinks of the former prime minister , he had touched on an issue that mattered deeply to many , and which sharply polarised opinion .
So what place should God have in our society ?
Over the next 18 pages Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins lead the charge for the atheists , A N Wilson reveals how he has found his Christian faith again , and various distinguished writers and thinkers , including the Chief Rabbi , Tony Benn and Polly Toynbee , join the debate .

It was previously reported that Sony Pictures would film the next two installment of “ Spider - Man ” back to back , but director Sam Raimi has ended those rumors in a recent interview conducted by Ain’t It Cool News .
He said :
“ No one ’s talked to me about making part 5 at this moment .
Right now I ’m hoping to make part 4 , ”
As for when Spider - Man 4 might begin , Raimi added :
“ It is a never - ending process .
Basically we are talking about the story right now , shortly artists will come on and I ’ll start giving them shots to draw .
We are supposed to start talking to a production designer soon , so it will just keep getting larger and larger .
Whenever the picture comes out we want to make sure we were shooting above the bar as it currently stands as far as visual effects go and we may or may not make that , but that will be my team ’s goal when we start . ”
Sony and Marvel recently announced a May 6 , 2011 release date for “ Spider - Man 4 , ” which means production would have to commence sometime next year .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A pair of Republican congressmen ripped Congressional Black Caucus members for ignoring Cuba 's " myriad gross human rights abuses " Thursday , saying this week 's caucus trip to the island nation ignored the plight of political prisoners under the Castro regime .
Rep. Chris Smith , R - New Jersey , blasts members of the Black Caucus on Thursday for their trip to Cuba .
They also urged the Obama administration to refrain from easing trade embargo or travel restrictions until the Cuban government releases all " prisoners of conscience , " shows greater respect for freedom of religion and speech , and holds " free and fair " elections .
The call from Reps. Chris Smith , R - New Jersey , and Frank Wolf , R - Virginia , came three days after the administration signaled that new rules on family travel and remittances to Cuba may be announced before President Obama goes to the Summit of the Americas on April 17 .
It also followed statements from several Black Caucus members Tuesday arguing for consideration of an end to the trade embargo and other diplomatic restrictions placed on Cuba for five decades .
Watch CNN's Ed Hornick discuss the story »
" Yes , we have history -- we have good history and not - so - good history , " said Rep. Laura Richardson , D - California .
" But the point is it 's history , and we need to move forward . "
Three members of the caucus were visiting the Latin American School of Medicine , where students from nations including the United States study , when they received an invitation to Fidel Castro 's home for a meeting .
" Former President Fidel Castro is very engaging , very energetic , " said CBC Chairwoman Barbara Lee , also a from California Democrat .
" Our conclusion is , given the new direction in our foreign policy , that it 's time to look at a new direction in our policy toward Cuba .
Watch Lee discuss her visit to Cuba »
" The 50 - year embargo just has n't worked , " she said .
The caucus members , who also visited current Cuban President Raul Castro , " did nothing to publicly show any concern for the myriad gross human rights abuses perpetrated by the Cuban government or the tragic fate of hundreds of Cuban democracy and human rights activists , " Smith said .
" Yet they held press conferences at which they heaped and lavished praise and affection for a government the United States Department of State only six weeks ago called ' totalitarian . ' "
A 2008 State Department human rights report cited , among other things , numerous accounts of beatings of Cuban political prisoners , harsh and life - threatening conditions for dissidents , and severe restrictions on freedom of movement and religion , Smith said .
" Over the past 50 years , the Castros and their secret police have been directly responsible for killing thousands of nonviolent , courageous pro-democracy activists and for jailing and torturing tens of thousands of others .
And they continue to this day to perpetrate their brutal crimes , " he said .
" Before the Obama administration even thinks about permitting further travel to Cuba , or altering the trade embargo on Cuba , both the White House and Congress have a moral obligation , a duty , to ensure that the Cuban dictatorship releases all prisoners of conscience , makes substantial progress in respecting freedom of religion , speech and , press and assembly , and holds free and fair elections . "
Lee responded Thursday that it made no sense to continue what she characterized as a failed policy .
" Everyone is entitled to their own opinion , but by any objective standard our current policy toward Cuba just has n't worked .
Simply put , it 's time to open dialogue and discussion with Cuba , " she said in a statement .
" I am convinced , based on the meetings which were held , that the Cubans do want dialogue , they do want talks , and they do want normal relations with the United States of America .
And I believe that it's in the United States ' best interest to do that . "
On Monday , the White House adviser for the Summit of the Americas , Jeffrey Davidow , refused to be pinned down about when the administration might announce its easing of the restrictions on travel and remittances to Cuba .
" I really could not say .
But I would not be surprised if it came before the summit , " he said .
" They 're going to happen .
I ca n't tell you exactly when . "
Before he was elected president , Obama promised to ease restrictions on Cuban - Americans traveling to visit family in Cuba and sending them money .

I just reread Jason Foutz ’s post Higher order multivariate automatic differentiation in Haskell , as I ’m thinking about this topic again .
I like his trick of using an IntMap to hold the partial derivatives and ( recursively ) the partials of those partials , etc .
Some thoughts :
I bet one can eliminate the constant ( C ) case in Jason ’s representation , and hence 3 / 4 of the cases to handle , without much loss in performance .
He already has a fairly efficient representation of constants , which is a D with an empty IntMap .
I imagine there ’s also a nice generalization of the code for combining two finite maps used in his third multiply case .
The code ’s meaning and correctness follows from a model for those maps as total functions with missing elements denoting a default value ( zero in this case ) .
Jason ’s data type reminds me of a sparse matrix representation , but cooler in how it ’s infinitely nested .
Perhaps depth n ( starting with zero ) is a sparse n-dimensional matrix .
Finally , I suspect there ’s a close connection between Jason ’s IntMap - based implementation and my LinearMap - based implementation described in Higher - dimensional , higher - order derivatives , functionally and in Simpler , more efficient , functional linear maps .
For the case of Rn , my formulation uses a trie with entries for n basis elements , while Jason ’s uses an IntMap ( which is also a trie ) with n entries ( counting any implicit zeros ) .
I suspect Jason ’s formulation is more efficient ( since it optimizes the constant case ) , while mine is more statically typed and more flexible ( since it handles more than Rn ) .
For optimizing constants , I think I ’d prefer having a single constructor with a Maybe for the derivatives , to eliminate code duplication .
I am still trying to understand the paper Lazy Multivariate Higher - Order Forward - Mode AD , with its management of various epsilons .
A final remark : I prefer the term “ higher - dimensional ” over the traditional “ multivariate ” .
I hear classic syntax / semantics confusion in the latter .
I just reread Jason Foutz ’s post Higher order multivariate automatic differentiation in Haskell , as I ’m thinking about this topic again .
I like his trick of using an IntMap to hold ...

It is being reported that NBC producers were told by higher ups not to incorporate discussion or highlight ’s of CNBC ’s Mad Money host Jim Cramer ’s appearance on Jon Stewart ’s The Daily Show .
This along with Cramer ’s no show of Morning Joe is evidence that the Peacock Family is doing damage control .
According to TVNewser , the order came down from higher ups not to highlight Cramer / Stewart .
This is a radical departure from earlier in the week when Cramer was everywhere .
Including on what is arguably the family of networks spotlight show Today .
Cramer made all of his regular CNBC daytime appearances , but there was no mention of Stewart .
Let me be clear , this was obviously not Cramer ’s decision .
This is GE doing damage control , while trying to protect a valuable member of the NBC family .
NBC is in the dumps ratings wise , and MSNBC except for their primetime line up still runs third behind CNN and FNC , but CNBC is the dominant business news network .
In addition , CNBC has been marketed not only as a source of business news , but a place for advice and expertise .

It is tough to overestimate the damage that The Daily Show interview did to the network ’s brand , because Jim Cramer has been marketed as the face of CNBC expertise .
Cramer has been THE face of the network .
There was only one small part of the interview that was damaging to CNBC .
It was the video that was shown that was not intended for television in which Cramer described tactics and said things that he admitted that he would never say on TV .
A couple of little video clips destroyed the idea that CNBC was shooting straight with its viewers .
I freely admit that I watch CNBC everyday because it is great entertainment .
It is the most bi-polar network on television .
If the market is up it is euphoric , but should it fall on bad news , the network is glum and depressed .
Often these mood swings happen in the same day .
One of things I have learned from years of watching CNBC is that every bit of valuable news the viewer gets is often wrapped in tons of speculation and opinion .
I think this episode provides a case study in how the media tries to shape the audience ’s perception of the news .
NBC decided that Cramer ’s appearance on The Daily Show was bad for them , so they made a decision that was n’t based on news value .
Their decision was rooting in saving one of their top performers ( CNBC ) and stars ( Jim Cramer ) embarrassment and a loss of credibility .
NBC is n’t the first network , and it wo n’t be the last , to make this kind of decision , but it is the most recent example of the mainstream media ’s news filter in action .
Reporter makes crap up , says “ one in fifty children homeless ”
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9eBNRjD7bAThe scene is this week ’s Presidential press conference .
Pre-chosen , pre-approved , pre-truthful reporter Kevin Chappell of Ebony asked the President this question :
“ Thank you , Mr. President .
A recent report found that , as a result of the economic downturn , one in 50 children are now homeless in America .
With shelters at full capacity , tent cities are sprouting up across the country .
In passing your stimulus package , you said that help was on the way .
But what would you say to these families , especially children , who are sleeping under bridges and in tents across the country ? ”
Damn tough questioning , Kevin .
Except for one thing .
It ’s a bogus statistic , as Mickey Kaus explains at Slate.com :
“ Chappell ’s question is based on this study by an anti-homelessness advocacy group with every incentive to maximize the estimate of the problem .
1 ) The report apparently counts all people who are “ homeless ” even one night over the course of a year .
That ’s very different from saying that one - in - 50 are homeless at the same time–e.g. , “ now . ” 2 ) More significantly , the report counts as “ homeless ” families who ’ve “ doubled up ” –e.g. , moved in with relatives–apparently on the grounds that while these children in these families do have a home , they do n’t have “ a home of their own . ”
That ’s not what most people mean by homeless , and not the image Chappell conjures ( tent cities , sleeping under bridges ) … .
The study also counts families living in motels and trailer parks–again , lousy living arrangements , maybe , but not what we usually mean by “ homeless . ”
“ P.S. : “ Doubling up ” counts for fully 56 % of the “ 1 in 50 ” estimate .
( See page 9 ) .
“ Hotels / motels ” counts for 7 % .
In other words , right off the bat almost two - thirds of the study ’s once - a - year “ homelessness ” is n’t actually homelessness . ”
Sure , they fudged the numbers .
But they did it for the children .
And that makes it ok .

Rachel opened her show tonight with a blockbuster exclusive interview , saying :
" The decision to release Office of Legal Counsel Memos re. torture has had one other ramification so far and it is this : Govt. officials who knew about torture but who were sworn to secrecy are now free to talk about it . "
She said that new major news to report : Condoleezza Rices 's counselor at the State Dept , Philip Zelikow , wrote a memo to the Bush Administration in which he argued that the legal opinions on torture were wrong .
He gave competing advice to the Bush Administration , which responded by trying to destroy his memo .
The Zelikow Memo
The underlying absurdity of the administration 's position can be summarized this way .
Once you get to a substantive compliance analysis for " cruel , inhuman , and degrading " you get the position that the substantive standard is the same as it is in analogous U.S. constitutional law .
So the OLC must argue , in effect , that the methods and the conditions of confinement in the CIA program could constitutionally be inflicted on American citizens in a county jail .
In other words , Americans in any town of this country could constitutionally be hung from the ceiling naked , sleep deprived , water - boarded , and all the rest -- if the alleged national security justification was compelling .
I did not believe our federal courts could reasonably be expected to agree with such a reading of the Constitution .
In My Opinion , this is a blockbuster revelation and may signal to others , with continuing declassification of documents by the Obama Administration , that it is time to come out with their dissent .
Clearly , the Bush Administration thought that there was something to hide if they tried to destroy his memo .
I am rushing to put this up so the community can follow this .
Perhaps someone with better capabilities than me can embed the interview from RM 's show tonight .
Let the Games Begin ................................
UPDATE :
The interview is just fantastic .
To me , it raises so many more questions .
Someone PLEASE embed it in this diary and I will copy the url up here .
I am working on dial - up so can't do it myself .

Single - celled organisms that can convert electricity into methane could help solve one of the biggest problems with renewable energy – its unreliability compared to the steady output of polluting fossil - fuel power stations .
Wind power is capricious , while solar cell output drops off at night or on cloudy days .
That fluctuating output poses big problems for electricity grids that rely on steady levels throughout the day .
Proposals to deal with the ups and downs of green power supply have included better batteries or redesigning the electricity grid .
An intriguing new idea involves “ feeding ” surplus power to the microorganisms instead , which combine it with carbon dioxide to create methane .
That could then be stored and burned when needed .
The method is sustainable too , as the carbon is taken from the atmosphere , not released from long - term storage in oil or coal .
Energy food
The new method relies on a microorganism studied by Bruce Logan ‘s team at Pennsylvania State University in University Park .
When living on the cathode of an electrolytic cell , the organism can take in electrons and use their energy to convert carbon dioxide into methane .
Advertisement
Logan ’s team discovered this behaviour in a mixed culture of microorganisms , dominated by Methanobacterium palustre – the first to be observed directly manufacturing methane in this way .
The behaviour had been previously suspected but not confirmed .
Tom Curtis at the Institute for Research on Environment and Sustainability at Newcastle University , UK , says that the use of microorganisms , rather than conventional catalysts , is a plus .
“ There are no noble metals involved , so it should be very cheap , ” he says .
Of the energy put into the system as electricity , 80 % was eventually recovered when the methane was burned – a fairly high efficiency .
“ You do n’t get all the energy back , but that ’s a problem with any form of energy storage , ” says Curtis .
‘ Simple and scalable ’
If the CO 2 used to make the methane was captured from the flue pipes of power stations or even – using more complex methods – from the open air , the methane would become a carbon - neutral fuel .
Logan is optimistic about the method ’s potential : “ Commercial applications could be just a few years down the road , ” he says .
Curtis is also impressed .
“ If you have a windmill , say , you need a relatively simple way to store the energy .
What I like about this method is it ’s simple , it ’s replicable and it ’s scalable . ”
Several similar techniques use microorganisms to produce > hydrogen fuel rather than methane .
But the hydrogen economy is not here yet , Logan points out .
“ These methods are great , but hydrogen does n’t fit into our existing infrastructure .
Methane does . ”

Even as the Republican argues to include ballots of voters who forged signatures and ballots they previously rejected
Plus :
A bit more to bring you up to date with the latest ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/11/2009 , 2:23 pm PT
While Norm Coleman may believe that " God wants [ him ] to serve , " the voters of MN , and a ruling yesterday from the 3 - judge panel presiding over his U.S. Senate election contest , still seem to indicate otherwise .
Yes , at it turns out , something actually happened during Coleman 's ongoing trial yesterday , and it resulted in still more votes for Al Franken .
That , and other late developments follow ...
Franken Gets 24 More
A ruling from the court [ PDF ] , found that some 24 Franken voters who'd filed to have their rejected absentee ballots counted , could , in fact , now have them counted .
Eric Kleefeld of TPM does the heavy lifting for us on this one ...
The Minnesota election court has now taken some kind of meaningful action , handing down a ruling [ PDF ] on a summary judgment motion that will now allow the counting of some --- but not all --- of a group of Franken - voters who filed a motion to have their rejected ballots counted .
The ruling gives us some hints as to where things will go from here --- and it's not good news for Norm Coleman .
Out of over 60 voters who filed this motion , the court is ordering just 24 ballots to be counted at this time .
The opinion lays out a pretty stringent standard for letting previously - rejected ballots in :
It has to be demonstrated that the voter either fully complied with the relevant laws and procedures , and thus the rejection was wholly a clerical error , or that any actual non-compliance was credibly the fault of the election official .
An example of this second category would be if a voter pro-actively asked whether they were registered to vote , were told yes and provided an absentee ballot for a registered voter , but it turned out they really needed to re-register .
This is a tough standard to meet , and will mean that the number of people who qualify for it will be a fairly limited number .
...
So how does this relate to Norm Coleman 's chances ?
He 's currently fishing in a pool of nearly 4,800 rejected ballots , trying to get a bunch of them in .
But this ruling seems to indicate he's not going to get very many of them in --- indeed , these 60 were some of Franken 's best cases , and he 's only scored on just over a third of them .
Norm is casting a much wider net , so the success rate will probably be far lower .
The additional 24 votes ( actually , just 23 for the moment , since a question still remains about one of them ) , will not be added to the official total immediately , as the Franken camp has declined to do so until after the trial has run its full course .
So the official tally still remains Franken +225 over Coleman , for the moment .
Coleman mouthpiece / front-man Ben Ginsberg ( he of FL 2000 Bush v. Gore " do n't count any votes ! " fame ) , tried to put a happy spin on the court 's ruling .
According to the Star - Tribune , " Ginsberg said the ruling also aided their efforts to have many more ballots counted and shows that the three - judge panel ' will allow in many more ballots as long as there is adequate proof of the voter 's intent .
...
We feel very good about what happened today . ' "
Thinning the Ballot Herd
In what appears to be a move to cull down the number of rejected absentee ballots currently in contention , the judges have asked both sides to present arguments on Thursday , for or against the inclusion of such ballots , based on 19 different categories of rejected ballots .
From the Strib ...
Should a ballot be barred if it went to the wrong precinct ?
Should a ballot be excluded if cast by a non-registered voter ?
And what about an unsigned ballot where the instructions for signing were obstructed by a pre-printed address sticker ?
Those are among 19 questions that District Judges Elizabeth Hayden , Kurt Marben and Denise Reilly want lawyers for Coleman and Franken to answer this week in a major development in a dispute over thousands of ballots that one side or the other wants counted .
Attorneys from both sides tried to spin the new development as a positive one for their respective client .
At the end of last week , the the " Ballot Universe " of rejected absentees which the judges are allowing to be examined for possible inclusion in the count , now stands at some 4,800 from Coleman , and about 800 from Franken .
Having it Both Ways
Franken 's team was otherwise busy in court today , making the case that Coleman now wants hundreds of ballots counted that he had previously ( and successfully ) fought to keep from being counted during the post- election hand - count ... back when Coleman thought he was winning .
Many of those voters , Franken attorneys made clear , whose ballots were rejected by Coleman before --- due to a dubious MN Supreme Court decision allowing veto power to the campaigns over whether some ballots got counted or not during the hand - count --- are now listed ( disingenuously ) on Coleman 's website as being among those whom " the Franken campaign is seeking to disenfranchise . "
TPMDC has more on that .
Also related , Coleman 's team continued again on Monday to try and convince the court that voters who forged signatures , should have their ballots counted anyway .
Imagine what Fox and Sean and Rush , et al , would be saying right now , if a Democrat was trying to do something like that !
You can watch all of the proceedings , live as they happen , as streamed on the web by TheUptake.org .
They also post key moments from the trial and attorney pressers , later in the day , for standalone archived viewing .

' It 's a pirate 's life for me '
A 25 - year - old Somali pirate has told the BBC's Mohamed Olad Hassan by telephone from the notorious den of Harardhere in central Somalia why he became a sea bandit .
Dahir Mohamed Hayeysi says he and his big - spending accomplices are seen by many as heroes .
I used to be a fisherman with a poor family that depended only on fishing .
The first day joining the pirates came into my mind was in 2006 .
A group of our villagers , mainly fishermen I knew , were arming themselves .
See map of how piracy is affecting the region and countries around the world
One of them told me that they wanted to hijack ships , which he said were looting our sea resources .
' National service '
He told me it was a national service with a lot of money in the end .
Then I took my gun and joined them .
Now I have two lorries , a luxury car and have started my own business in town
Dahir Mohamed Hayeysi
Years ago we used to fish a lot , enough for us to eat and sell in the markets .
Then illegal fishing and dumping of toxic wastes by foreign fishing vessels affected our livelihood , depleting the fish stocks .
I had no other choice but to join my colleagues .
The first hijack I attended was in February 2007 when we seized a World Food Programme - chartered ship with 12 crew .
I think it had the name of MV Rozen and we released it after two months , with a ransom .
One last job I am not going to tell you how much it was , or three other hijackings I have been involved in since .
Pirates have stepped up attacks on shipping in recent weeks
My ambition is to get a lot of money so that I can lead a better life .
Now I have two lorries , a luxury car and have started my own business in my town .
I only want one more chance in piracy to increase my cash assets , then I will get married and give up .
Piracy is not just easy money - it has many risks and difficulties .
Sometimes you spend months in the sea to hunt a ship and miss .
Sometimes when we are going to hijack a ship we face rough winds , and some of us get sick and some die .
Sometimes you fail in capturing and sometimes you come under threat by foreign navies , but all we do is venture .
Heroes
Let me give you a good example .
Thousands of young desperate Somali [ migrants ] continue to risk their lives in the sea in search of a better life abroad .
Dahir Mohamed Hayeysi says foreign navies will not stop piracy
So it is no surprise to see us in the same water , pirating in search of money - there is no difference .
We have local support ; most of the people here depend on pirates directly or indirectly .
Because if there is a lot of money in the town they can get some through friendship , relatives or business .
Also our work is seen by many in the coastal villages as legal and we are viewed as heroes .
The only way the piracy can stop is if [ Somalia ] gets an effective government that can defend our fish .
And then we will disarm , give our boats to that government and will be ready to work .
Foreign navies can do nothing to stop piracy .
When first loaded , the map 's focus falls on Somalia where most of the pirates are based .

The Manbottle Library : Humor : 12 Rules for Life 12 Rules for Life Sometimes we just need to remember what the 12 Rules of Life really are :
1 . Never give yourself a haircut after three margaritas .
2 . You need only two tools : WD - 40 and duct tape .
If it does n't move and it should , use WD - 40 .
If it moves and should n't , use the tape .
3 . The five most essential words for a healthy , vital relationship are " I apologize " and " you are right . "
4. Everyone seems normal until you get to know them .
5 . Never pass up an opportunity to pee .
6 . If he / she says that you are too good for him / her - believe them .
7. Learn to pick your battles ; ask yourself , " Will this matter one year from now ?
How about one month ?
One week ?
One day ? "
8 . When you make a mistake , make amends immediately .
It 's easier to eat crow while it 's still warm .
9 . If you woke up breathing , congratulations !
You have another chance !
10 . Living well really is the best revenge .
Being miserable because of a bad or former relationship just might mean that the other person was right about you .
11 . Work is good , but it 's not that important .
Money is nice , but you can't take it with you .
Statistics show most people do n't live to spend all they saved ; some die even before they retire .
Anything we have is n't really ours ;
It 's on loan to us while we 're here ... even our kids .
12 . And finally ... Be really good to your family and / or friends .
You never know when you are going to need them to empty your bedpan .
I , like many people , have been subscribing to Internet connection services since the days of 300 baud modems .
Then I upgraded to 14.4 k , 36.6 k , 56 k , DSL , and now cable .
Unfortunately , due to where I am living today , I 'm stuck on 3 Mbit Verizon DSL service , which is often running at less than 1 Mbit .
Thankfully , my service does n't have a download cap on it -- at least not yet anyway .
Much like everyone reading this article , I 'm a genuine supporter of advancement in hardware and technology services .
Suffice to say , I was happy with the progression of Internet connection services over the years .
Recently , however , I would have to say that Internet connection advancement in the U.S. and Canada has been purely an interest of the corporations that provide them and not about serving the consumer -- you -- and the advancement of technology in America in general .
In late March , I wrote an article on Tom's Hardware explaining why HDCP ( high definition content protection ) is the bane of movie watchers everywhere .
Not only is HDCP an invasive technology that kills the enjoyment of movies for enthusiasts , it does nothing to stop pirates .
We all know this to be true .
Do n't think for a moment though , that big media does n't know this -- they absolutely do .
Now , they have a new plan .
Since big media can't directly go after pirates , they 've decided to go after to after the group of people who they think can't do a thing about it : anyone using an Internet connection .
You .
Several years ago while at DailyTech , I wrote a series on net neutrality .
If you have n't heard , the big issue on net neutrality is about ISPs creating tiers of net connections for both businesses and consumers .
Tiers allow companies to effectively charge you more for your downloading habits rather than the speed you 're after .
Net connection services have always been mainly about speed for the consumer .
Want to subscribe to a faster service ?
Pay more .
It was simple and effective .
Without net neutrality , ISPs not only charges for speed packages but also for how much you download .
At the time , Verizon and others were very vocal about net neutrality , especially when the U.S. government and FCC were looking into the matter .
Verizon and others made it clear that net neutrality was much ado about nothing .
They lied .
Time Warner Cable , which provides Internet connectivity for millions is a big opposition to net neutrality .
Alright , let 's cut the bull : Time Warner Cable , which provides Internet connectivity for millions , wants to screw you .
But TWC is n't the only company out there with an interest in charging customers more for less .
Most major ISPs are on the same bandwagon .
The big reason for this ?
Online video and music .
Cable companies have a vested interest in protecting their business , which is providing TV and movie services to their millions of subscribers .
The more online movie and music services that pop online , the more threat there is to their bread and butter .
The only way cable providers can slow this process down or stop it , is to limit how much you 're able to download .
This week , TWC released a new set of tiered connection plans ranging from a ridiculous 1 GB per month plan to something TWC calls the 100 GB " super tier " plan .
Super ?
" We need a viable model to be able to support the infrastructure of the broadband business , " said Time Warner Cable CEO Glenn Britt .
Despite what Britt claimed , 2008 was actually a great year for TWC : 10 - percent more subscribers , but operating costs did n't go up .
So what kind of math did Mr. Britt learn in school ?
Not the kind of math I learned ; but that does n't matter since Britt had an annual comp of $ 16.2 million .
Here 's some more logical math for your consumption : consider TWC's 40 GB tier .
It costs a whopping $ 54.90 per month .
If you only watch 7.25 hours a video per week , via Netflix , your Xbox 360 , or any other service , you will be slapped with a bill of $ 200 at the end of the month .
Worried ?
" Do n't worry , " says TWC's COO Landel Hobbs .
" Overage charges will be capped at $ 75 per month .
That means that for $ 150 per month customers could have virtually unlimited usage at Turbo speeds , " says Hobbs .
That 's an incredible deal if I ever saw one .
Right ? ( sarcasm ) .
YouTube , Hulu , Netflix , and many other online video services are becoming more and more popular .
Arguably , Netflix is putting Blockbuster out of business .
Hulu , iTunes , and others like it are a major threat as well .
Tiered plans however , ensure that you only get to watch a limited number of videos per month as well keep your downloading of videos to a minimum .
Why have a really fast net connection to enjoy online media services and downloading when in reality , you can't ?
The answer is : so you , your friends , your family , and anyone else you know that has an Internet connection can keep dumping money into traditional cable programming .
TWC , AT&T , Comcast , Cox , Verizon , and others are not for the consumer in any way , shape , or form .
Because of their traditional business practice , which is quickly becoming obsolete , cable providers want to make sure you , the consumer , will pay more to keep them afloat .
Download capping is the new DRM .
It ensures several things :
- You will be more hesitant to download movies and music legitimately -- even though you 've paid to watch / listen .
- You will watch more cable TV ( so you can see all those great ads ) .
- You will accidentally pay more for less .
- Pirates get a whacking .
Big media and ISPs can't effectively eliminate piracy by going after pirates directly or stop online video and music streaming services .
So they have a better plan now : go after everyone .
What about gamers ?
Do n't watch streaming video and just a serious gamer ?
This will affect you too .
If you like downloading demos , or have to update your favorite games with big updates and patches , prepare to have those eat a big chunk of your monthly download allowance .
This is something every gamer has essentially been doing for free , but not for much longer .
Any gamer here using Steam ?
Oh boy ...
If you purchase say , Call of Duty : World at War off of Steam , it 's over 6 GB .
If you 're paying $ 29.95 for TWC 's 5 GB connection , expect to pay an overage fee for hitting your cap and for the extra gigabyte .
You can do something about TWC and others .
A for - consumer organization called FreePress has an online petition , which is 500,000 strong at the moment , aims to convince Congress to put a stop to net capping schemes ( scams ? ) .
Sign up here and make a stand .
Glenn Britt , Landel Hobbs , or anyone at TWC who still cares about the consumer , I invite you to e-mail me at tuannguyen at bestofmedia.com .
I 'll be delighted to talk about how to bring your business into the 21st century .
Mike Green and Donald Brashear will be suspended for Game 7 at the Verizon Center , according to reports from the Washington Post , as reported moments ago on ESPN ’s SportsCenter .
However I can’t find any information related to this on the Post ’s website .
I assume they are still working on the report .
Brashear was involved in a huge hit of Blair Betts at center ice in Sunday afternoon ’s contest .
There were also allegations that Shaone Morrisonn bit Rangers center Brandon Dubinsky .
Maybe it was really Green ?
I guess we ’ll soon find out .
This article will be updated once more details are available .
However as of writing this , I cannot find any confirmation from NHL.com or TSN.
ca concerning a Donald Brashear or Mike Green suspension being handed down .
So considering the lone source of ESPN at the moment , take this with a grain of salt .
More , including ESPN ’s retraction , and then a retraction of the retraction , after the jump .
TSN does report :
Washington Capitals forward Donald Brashear has a 1 pm et hearing with the National Hockey League to discuss his actions in Game 6 against the New York Rangers .
Brashear will face supplemental discipline for both his exchange with New York ’s Colton Orr in the warm - up prior to the game and his late hit on Rangers forward Blair Betts in the first period .
** UPDATE : ESPN just retracted on SportsCenter , stating that Mike Green and Donald Brashear have not been suspended , yet .
However they both now have a hearing at 1 pm today .
This is according to ESPN ’s Pierre LeBrun .
They also quoted George Mcphee , whose phone must have rung off the hook after to the previous report .
The biting incident with Shaone Morrissonn is alleged to have happened after Dubinsky boarded Green , so Green would have been on the ice , and involved in that scrum .
Is it possible that he bit an opposing player ?
I am fairly certain this is n’t the worst bit of misreporting that the World Wide Leader has ever had , but its pretty big .
Green is a Norris candidate , and one of the best young players in the league .
To report that he will be suspended for a Game 7 in the playoffs , and then to later retract is a pretty big error .
At the moment it is n’t even clear that they have the right player .
There is some speculation that they really meant Shaone Morrissonn , unless having a bad haircut is a suspendable offense .
We ’ll keep on this story , and report again this afternoon on the results of the hearings .
In other news , the Capitals are dominating the series , and the Rangers are doing more whining than winning .
**UPDATE # 2 : ESPN has now retracted their retraction , stating that Mike Green is NOT under consideration for suspension , nor is Shaone Morrissonn .
The only player to have a hearing today at 1 PM will be Donald Brashear .
ESPN states that Brashear ’s hit on Betts is the reason for possible suspension , while Capitals Insider reports that it is actually the pregame incident that is under review .
Seriously ESPN , why do you even try to report on the NHL ?
Daniel Kish lost his sight in infancy , but taught himself to echolocate with bat - like clicks ( Image : djeyewater , stock.xchng )
I am 6 years old and it ’s my first day at school .
The bell rings for recess and all my classmates run gleefully away .
But unlike them I can not see .
At least , not with my eyes .
Instead , I click my tongue , listening for echoes from the wall to my left .
I walk with my hands slightly outstretched to keep me from running into chairs that may have been left askew .
I hear kids laughing and shouting through the open door , and by clicking I also hear the presence of the sides of the doorway in front of me .
I go through it to the playground for the first time .
After a few steps , I stop to listen .
I stand on a crack in the pavement that runs parallel to the building behind me .
I click my tongue loudly and turn my head from side to side .
The way is open , shot through with scurrying voices , balls bouncing and shoes scampering to and fro .
What is around me ?
How do I get there ?
How do I get back ?
Clicking my tongue quickly and scanning with my head , I move cautiously forward , catching fleeting images of bodies darting hither and thither .
I follow spaces that are clear , avoiding clusters of bodies , keeping my distance from bouncing balls .
I am not afraid – to me , this is a puzzle .
I turn my head and click over my shoulder .
I can still hear the wall of the building .
As long as I can hear that , I …
Last month , Cambodia began a trial for crimes against humanity that took place three decades earlier .
The U.N. - backed tribunal has indicted and is now trying five former Khmer Rouge officials for crimes against humanity and war crimes during the years of 1975 - 79 .
In that short span , while the Khmer Rouge was in power , an estimated 1.4 million Cambodians died ( possibly up to 2 million ) due to Khmer policies , which included forced labor , outright executions , starvation , and torture - for an idea of the magnitude , click here for a visualization .
All these acts were part of the Khmer Rouge 's disastrous effort to dismantle their society and build a communist utopia .
Now , 30 years later , Cambodia is still recovering - a young country , with over 50 % of the population younger than 25 , millions of leftover land mines , extreme poverty and a still - rebuilding agricultural system .
Collected here are some recent photos from Cambodia , its people , the tribunal and more .

Rosanna Pulido is the Republican nominee for the 5th Congressional District of Illinois .
This is her website : http://www.rosannapulido2009.com
Rosanna Pulido is also an active poster on the conservative message board FreeRepublic.com under the name “ chicagolady ” .
A link to her posting history is available to the right .
Proof that Rosanna Pulido is also chicagolady is provided in this interview with the Chicago NBC affliate .
Her candidacy – and affiliation with Free Republic – is also noted here , and here .
Rosanna Pulido is the founder and director of the Illinois Minutemen , a branch of the Minutemen Project – a border vigilante group which has attracted the attention of the Southern Poverty Law Center , the ACLU , the Anti-Defamation League , and former President George W. Bush .
You can read about their various incidents which include racial slurs , violence , and faking murders on video at their Wikipedia entry here .
Rosanna has brought up her association with the Minutemen in her Free Republic posts , and reposts blog entries by other Minutemen on the site as well .
** Update # 2 – April 2 **
John Curry , the 32nd Ward Republican Committeeman has posted the following bulletin regarding Ms. Pulido this evening on his website .
Mr. Curry had previously sent Ms. Pulido private correspondence regarding her inflammatory comments about Cardinal George , which she chose to repost on Free Republic .
This bulletin clarifies that Mr. Curry , acting in his capacity as a representative of the Republican Party , does not endorse Ms. Pulido and encourages a write - in vote instead .
I DO NOT ENDORSE ROSANNA PULIDO ” I wish to report to Republicans in the 32nd Ward and in the 5th Congressional District that I do not endorse Rosanna Pulido .
Since the primary election and more particularly over the last two weeks , I have become aware of extremely disturbing information relating to Ms. Pulido .
That information can be summarized as follows : Pulido has an established relationship with another political party , America ’s Independent Party .
Pulido has not dispelled concerns that she is running as a “ Trojan Horse ” candidate , one who exploits the name of the Republican Party to her personal advantage only to promote a non-Republican or anti-Republican , fringe agenda .
Pulido is on record as making groundless and reprehensible remarks , unworthy of a good citizen , disparaging the Cardinal of the Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago , gays , Mexicans , African Americans , and others .
Little , if anything , is known about Pulido ’s personal and professional background .
Pulido has refused to respond to reasonable requests from the Republican Party to account for her actions and the actions of her campaign or to cooperate with the Republican Party in any professional or reasonable way .
Based on the above , I do not endorse Rosanna Pulido or recommend that any Republican vote for her for Congress in the upcoming Special Election .
Instead , I encourage all Republican voters who wish to show their support for the true principles of the Republican Party and protest the absence of a worthy candidate on this ballot to cast a write in vote for “ Abraham Lincoln ” as their candidate .
You may ask for assistance from the election judges on how to write in “ Abraham Lincoln ” , and they are required to provide you with that assistance .
I take this action in order to uphold the integrity of the name of the Republican Party .

** Update – April 2 **
At least three individuals have retracted their endorsements of Ms. Pulido due to her comments on Free Republic .
The first is York Township Trustee Moon Kahn , who released this letter to various outlets :
Dear Ms. Rosanna Pulido ,
In the tradition of Islamic forgiveness , while I still believe in pardoning you for pronouncing some hateful remarks against Muslims , assuming it might have happened in a moment of rage and ignorance , the continuous revelations of plethora of your provocative statements , which were completely unknown to me until a few days ago , delineate a disturbing mindset .
Several community organizations that include Illinois Coalition of Immigrant and Refugee Rights , Council of American - Islamic Relations , Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago , Jewish Council of Urban Affairs , Priests for Justice for Immigrants , and other civic organizations and friends of mine , whose judgments I highly respect , have been referring to clippings of your quotes , published on blogs under the pseudonym of Chicagolady , demonstrate that while advocating your viewpoints you frequently transgressed the boundary of robust discussion and veered off to demonize and dehumanize the groups you wanted to oppose .
Considering this transgression , which is antithetical to one of the core values and attributes of a leader , I experience deep anguish in continuing my endorsement , which I extended to you earlier without the knowledge of the newly revealed testimonials of yours .
As such , I withdraw my endorsement for you for the Illinois ’ 5th Congressional District seat and request you to remove the endorsement text and my picture off your website .
Take care ,
Moon Khan
York Township Trustee
Asian American Liaison of DuPage County Republican Party
The second retraction of support came from the Chicago News Bench , a conservative blog which was also one of the first to cover the issue of Ms. Pulido ’s comments .
Rosanna ,
In spite of knowing that I very publicly pulled my support for your campaign , you maintain a link to my blog on your website at http://www.rosannapulido2009.com/ in your “ Illinois Blogs ” list .
Please remove it immediately .
For your reference , you have it listed ( incorrectly ) as “ Rogers Park Bench . ”
I asked you on several occassions , prior to my un-endorsement of your campaign , to correct the name of my blog , which is NOT “ Rogers Park Bench , ” but is “ Chicago News Bench . ”
You were not considerate enough to show me that courtesy , and now you compound that discourtesy by keeping a link to my blog on your site .
That gives the false impression that I still support you , which I do not .
( You can not say that you do n’t know that I un-endorsed you , as you and I have discussed it several times by phone and email .
Remove all links and references to me and to my blog from all of your campaign websites , including any Facebook or MySpace pages maintained by you or by your campaign .
( You did that for Mr. Moon Khan , York Township Trustee , Asian American Liaison of DuPage County Republican Party . )
I note as well that you still have Right Not Wrong listed on your blogroll , in spite of the fact that blogger Chris Barkulis also pulled his support for you .
Sincerely , Tom Mannis
Chicago News Bench
http://rogersparkbench.blogspot.com
The third is another conservative blog , RightNotWrong.com .
While RightNotWrong and Chicago News
Bench both retracted their support last week , to keep things somewhat organized all three retractions are listed in this single update .
Some of you may have recently heard about the NBC 5 news report about Rosanna Pulido and her anonymous comments under the name Chicagolady on the Free Republic conservative message site .
In light of the recent development of what those comments actually were , I cannot in good conscience back Ms. Pulido or her campaign .
As much as I would like to see a Republican elected from the 5th during this special election , I do n’t believe it should be someone marred by questionable activities in online forums .
This is not a disagreement with what stance on the core conservative issues she has , but more of how she portrayed some of them .
Candidates that have made comments bordering on racism do nothing good for the advancement of the Republican Party .
On the contrary they set us back by giving fodder to the Democrats .
For years the Democrats have tried to fool people into thinking that all Republicans are backward thinking racists and any little bit they can chomp on they exploit to prove this fallacy .
Truth be told there are Republicans that are racist , but there are also Democrats that are racist .
No party can insulate themselves from it because unfortunately racism is something that exists in America .
Do I like it ?
No .
That does n’t mean I need to excuse it or stand with it just so my party may have a chance at winning any type of political office .
This is not an endorsement of Democrat Machine candidate Mike Quiqley .
What this district and the State of Illinois needs is a Republican representative that can stand above the Democratic Political Machine and be free of controversy .
I look forward to the 2010 midterms where hopefully the Illinois Republican Party can put forth and fully support a strong , viable candidate for the 5th Congressional District .
** Update – March 31 **
Various civil rights advocacy groups have held a press conference highlighting Ms. Pulido ’s comments :
CHICAGO CONDEMNS HATE SPEECH BY IL GOP CANDIDATE
( CHICAGO , IL , 3/31/09 ) – A number of religious and civil rights groups today held a news conference to condemn intolerant and hateful remarks made by Rosanna Pulido , the GOP candidate for the 5th congressional district seat .
“ Ms. Pulido ’s statements under the blog moniker “ Chicagolady ” contain vicious remarks maligning groups such as Catholics , Mexicans , Muslims , immigrants , and gays , ” said Ahmed Rehab , Executive Director of Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) Chicago .
“ All Americans including Pulido are entitled to a free opinion ; by the same logic , we are entitled to oppose bigotry , particularly from those seeking leadership positions within our country . ”
Speakers at the news conference included Juan Salgado , Board President of the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights ; Reema Ahmad , Government Affairs Coordinator of the Council on American - Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) Chicago ; Junaid Afeef , Executive Director of the Council of Islamic Organizations of Greater Chicago ( CIOGC ) ; Jane Ramsey , Executive Director of Jewish Council of Urban Affairs ; Father Larry Dowling from Priests for Justice for Immigrants ; Shayla King , NAACP student chapter president , Loyola University of Chicago .
CONTACT : Catherine Salgado , Communications Director , ICIRR , E - Mail : csalgado@icirr.org , 312.332.7360 x 235 ; Reem Rahman , Communications Coordinator , CAIR - Chicago , 217.493.0912 ; E- Mail : communications@cairchicago.org
Additional information is available at the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights .
They have requested a meeting with Illinois Republican Chairman Andrew McKenna to discuss Ms. Pulido ’s comments and how they reflect on the Republican Party that supports her candidacy .
** Update – March 25 **
Thanks to Jill Garvey at Imagine 2050 for doing additional investigation work into Ms. Pulido ’s comments .
Ms. Garvey has learned that one of her endorsers , a Mr. Moon Khan ( who happens to be the first Muslim elected to a public office in Illinois ) has emailed Ms. Pulido and extracted an apology from her – you can read the apology , and more information on the fallout from Ms. Pulido ’s comments , at Imagine 2050 .
** Minor Update – March 25 **
A Free Republic poster has found a Chicago - area blog highlighting Ms. Pulido ’s posting history ( they also link to this blog ) and has posted a thread about it at freerepublic.com .
While Ms. Pulido has not yet posted in the thread , given the fact that she ’s already gone to Free Republic for campaign advice and assistance illustrates how influential the message board is in her decision - making process – influence that one could assume would continue through her term as an elected official .
A typical comment from the thread :
“ How many Americans have illegal gangbangers killed here in the US ?
Typical Lib maggot who refuses to see the truth … in his rush for Communism ( you know , taking our money to fund the “ entitled ” ) they forget the BILLIONS of cost of illegal immigration . ”
** Update – March 24 **
Ms. Pulido may find it interesting that , as the founder of the Illinois Minutemen , she has been touted as a “ voice of reason ” at the white supremacist site Stormfront.org .
A screencap of the original post is here ; if you ’re not at work and do n’t mind Stormfront showing up in your browser history , the original post is ( NWS ) here .
( NWS ) Stormfront.org also reposts an email from the Constitution Party where they mention working with Rosanna Pulido ; screencap here , original link ( NWS ) here ( NWS ) .
Finally , and most recently , in a thread titled “ Mexicans are a bigger problem than we think ” , a Stormfront.org poster promotes Rosanna Pulido ’s candidacy by calling her the “ anti- invasion candidate ” and encourages other Stormfront posters to look up her web site .
Screencap here , original link ( NWS ) here ( NWS ) .
This connection fits the Anti-Defamation League ’s findings that the Minutemen and various white supremacy and neo -Nazi groups have campaigned and worked alongside each other , even if no direct association exists .
** Update – March 23 **
Ms. Pulido has posted on freerepublic.com asking if reproduction of Free Republic comments are “ ok ” – referencing this blog .
If any visitors to this blog have the opportunity to ask Ms. Pulido about her comments on Free Republic , it may be worth asking a followup question about who ( or where ) she tends to go to for advice .
Here ’s a quick reference to various posts made by Rosanna Pulido on FreeRepublic.com over the years .
If you ’ve never been to Free Republic , the fact that these posts inspired encouragement from other Freepers , rather than derision or outrage , should provide enough background .
Rosanna Pulido thinks Obama will sell black people into slavery .
Rosanna Pulido prefers illegal medication , and distrusts the FDA .

What does AmEx want ?
That ’s a question American Express cardholders are asking more and more these days as the company turns the screws on long - standing customers and seems determined to show as many as possible the door .
Similar moves by leading card issuers drew a scornful response from President Obama , who told industry leaders last week that “ the days of any - time , any - reason rate hikes and late - fee traps have to end . ”
But AmEx , which pocketed $ 3.4 billion in bailout cash from taxpayers , seems to have been especially successful at making customers feel unwelcome .
Advertisement
I wrote Sunday about a Los Angeles man who had his AmEx credit limit slashed twice by the company and then had his card canceled , all because of a “ serious delinquency ” in his credit file that apparently no one but AmEx could see .
I ’ve since heard from numerous others who related similar experiences , including some who said AmEx even demanded that they send in copies of their tax returns if they wanted to keep their accounts -- a notion so outlandish that I was sure it had to be a scam .
And demonstrating that AmEx is n’t just pushing around middle - class cardholders , I spoke the other day with Beverly Hills resident James B. Davis , who runs a publishing company with about $ 16 million in annual sales .
He said he holds three AmEx Platinum cards , one for personal use and two for business .
Davis , 61 , recently received a letter from AmEx saying it was canceling a benefit allowing him to carry an extended balance on certain travel expenses .
It said this was due to an unspecified problem with his credit file .
Advertisement
“ I have no debt -- zero , ” Davis told me .
“ So I called up my credit file and went through all 40 pages of it .
I kept seeing ‘ Account in good standing , ’ ‘ Account in good standing . ’
Every account was in good shape . ”
He said he finally found a single instance when he was late with a MasterCard payment -- about three years ago .
“ I ca n’t believe they were going after me for this , ” Davis said .
“ I ’m the sort of customer who buys cars on his American Express card . ”
Worse , he said that when he contacted the company to find out what was going on , all he got was a lot of unhelpful mumbo - jumbo from service reps .
This is a customer , mind you , whose credit limit runs in the hundreds of thousands of dollars .
Advertisement
Davis ’ theory , and I think he’s on to something , is that AmEx has unleashed some sort of computer program that ’s combing cardholders ’ credit files for any problem , no matter how small or outdated .
The company is then acting on any such issues to thin the ranks of customers and reduce its exposure to risk at a time when credit card defaults have risen to record levels .
I put this theory to Desiree Fish , an AmEx spokeswoman .
All she would say was that the company “ is trying to manage its risk prudently . ”
She said she could n’t comment on Davis ’ account but insisted that “ if we tell people that there ’s an action because of a delinquency in their credit file , it ’s because we ’ve found a delinquency . ”
Advertisement
I asked about the reports I ’d heard of AmEx customers being asked by the company to fax in their income tax returns .
This could n’t be a legitimate request , right ?
Wrong .
“ In isolated cases , we will request that a card member provide us with additional information , including tax returns , in order to verify the spending capabilities of that card member , ” Fish said .
If a cardholder declines to share such info -- and who would n’t ? -- she said that person ’s card might be canceled or its use could be suspended until the balance was paid down .
Advertisement
“ American Express is a brand you can trust , ” Fish said .
“ It ’s not like you ’re being asked to fax documents to an unknown number .
“ In no way is this intended to offend anyone , ” she added .
And do n’t let the door hit you on the way out .
Food donations
Advertisement
I wrote last month about California caterers , hotels and restaurants throwing out roughly 1.5 million tons of food annually at a time when food banks and shelters are facing unprecedented demand for assistance from recession - hit people .
I noted that state Sen. Jenny Oropeza ( D - Long Beach ) was crafting legislation intended to address this sad statistic , but appeared to be scaling back her efforts amid fierce resistance from the California Restaurant Assn .
Well , I ’m glad to report that Oropeza has beefed up her bill -- a bit .
The legislation , SB 35 , still focuses primarily on creating a database that would provide food businesses and their clients with resources for donating leftovers to charity .
But now it also includes language requiring caterers and others to inform clients about the existence of the database .
That ’s a pretty measly improvement , but it is a step in the right direction .
Advertisement
Mandatory discussion of the database might at least get some people thinking about what to do with leftovers instead of allowing them to end up in a dumpster .
Oropeza ’s bill was approved by the Senate Governmental Organization Committee on Tuesday .
It now heads to the Appropriations Committee .
“ It ’s heartwarming to see that our leading policymakers understand this is an issue that can mean the difference between having a wholesome meal or going hungry , ” Oropeza said .
“ There simply is too much perfectly good food being wasted in California . ”
The trick to making this work is for food businesses to be receptive to contacting nonprofit groups that will handle pickup and delivery of leftover food .
They ’re out there -- Angel Harvest in Los Angeles , for example -- but they typically need plenty of advance word to arrange logistics .
Advertisement
It ’s shameful that so much food goes to waste during a time of such extreme need .
All we need is to work together to ensure that leftovers from banquets and hotel functions are put to good use .
And think of all the good karma that can be earned in the process .

Grammar rules exist so that we do n’t sound like complete idiots when we write .
Most of them have a good reason for being around ; after all , clarity in communication is a good thing .
A virtue , even .
However , that ’s not to say that all grammar rules are written in stone .
In fact , some of them seem to be the work of rabid grammarians , who gleefully enforce confusing syntax and awkward construction in the name of “ proper English . ”
To heck with that , I say .
Here are three grammar rules that were made to be broken .
1. Ending a sentence with a preposition
I have no idea where this rule came from .
What I do know is that many people , in an effort to keep from ticking off the Grammar Police , start twisting their sentences around so as not to end them with prepositions .
Unfortunately , more often than not , the new syntax is terribly awkward and painful to read .
Take the first sentence of this section , for example .
“ From where this rule came ” sounds like something Yoda would say , not me .
A big part of blogging is showing your personality through words .
How can you do that when you ’re twisting your phrases to suit some archaic rule ?
In the interest of clarity and readability , it ’s quite all right to end a sentence with a preposition .
2. Beginning a sentence with “ and ” or “ but ”
Somebody , somewhere , once decided that you should n’t begin sentences with conjunctions .
Maybe it was an overzealous teacher who thought her students were doing it too much .
My guess is that it was frustrated mothers who got sick and tired of hearing their children start every single sentence with “ But Mo-om ! ”
The rule even got screen time in the movie Finding Forrester , when Sean Connery and Rob Brown have an entire conversation about it ( and deliberately start their sentences with the offending words in order to make their points ) .
Regardless of how it began , you do n’t have to stick with it .
It ’s perfectly all right to start your sentences with “ and ” or “ but . ”
It ’s a great way to grab attention and emphasize a point .
But , as in all things , take it in moderation .
3. Splitting infinitives
How often have you heard that you ’re not allowed to let another word come between “ to ” and its verb ?
Some people hold that construction with the same reverence as is typically given to marriage : that which the writer hath wrought together , let no man tear asunder .
Except that it ’s really not that big of a deal .
Come on : “ to go boldly where no man has gone before ” just does n’t have the same ring to it as “ to boldly go . ”
If it sounds better to split the infinitive , then take an axe to it !
Do n’t cling to the ancient rules just because your high school English teacher told you to .
Be a rebel and break free of these nonsensical shackles !
His parents were migrant farmworkers who worked the harvests of California and Washington state before wintering in their small hometown in rural Mexico .
Bismarck Lepe , now 29 , remembers how at age 5 he helped out in the strawberry fields .
“ I was good at planting , ” he recalled .
“ I was very close to the ground . ”
“ He brags about that all the time , ” muttered his 21 - year - old brother Belsasar , known as Bel .
Today , Bismarck and Bel Lepe work marathon hours in the bright , clean quarters of their own Silicon Valley startup , with its own little fleet of electric - powered Razor scooters for zipping around Mountain View .
Educated at Stanford University , seasoned at Google , these overachieving sons of the Latino laboring class are among the valley ’s more demographically improbable entrepreneurs .
They are two of the three founders of Ooyala , a fast - growing company that in less than two years has built an impressive list of customers — Warner Bros. , TV Guide , Armani — with its infrastructure technology for the booming trend in online video .
Ooyala means “ cradle ” in the South Indian language of Telugu .
The name reflects the founders ’ ambition for the company to cradle innovation in delivering and syndicating video content while leveraging the interactive nature of the Web to enhance advertising revenue .
Silicon Valley prides itself as a meritocracy — a place where people are judged less by ancestry than by ability .
It boasts companies founded by people from all over the world .
But tech entrepreneurs of humble Mexican roots are a distinct rarity .
Bismarck , Ooyala ’s chief executive , largely shrugs off the occasional ethnic stereotyping .
At Google , a secretary once assumed he must be the “ phone guy ” she had summoned , not a manager involved in AdSense and YouTube .
The Lepe brothers and 28 - year - old co-founder Sean Knapp all attribute their own drive to the industrious example of their parents .
Knapp said he got a sense of the Lepe family work ethic when his partners ’ parents , Casimiro and Aida , helped them move into Ooyala ’s first office and later expand into its second .
They knocked down walls , painted , installed the kitchen , assembled furniture .
Knapp recalled with awe the sight of Casimiro , a man in his late 50s , hustling up stairs carrying a desk on his back : “ He was like a mountain goat . ”
” I love to work , ” Casimiro said .
“ That ’s what I teach my sons :
The only way you can live better is to work hard . ”
The Lepe family ’s journey , as Bismarck puts it , “ truly is the American dream . ”
Growing up in the village of Juchitlan , about 80 miles from Guadalajara , Casimiro Lepe was only 15 and had a sixth - grade education when his father died , thrusting him in the role of provider .
At age 23 , he began wooing a hometown girl from a prosperous family who was pursuing a college degree .
Aida ’s father did n’t approve of Casimiro , but the young man persisted , courting Aida for six years before prevailing with a poetic ultimatum : “ Nos casamos o nos dejamos . ”
Either we marry or we part ways .
Born in Oxnard , Bismarck was a birthright American citizen , but lived much of his childhood in Juchitlan .
His unusual first name , he explains , derives from some German ancestry on his mother ’s side .
He has happy memories of traveling with the Lepe clan from harvest to harvest as they picked lemons , peaches , nectarines , walnuts , strawberries and apples .
Kindly farm owners and managers , he said , looked after him as his parents worked .
At age 4 , Bismarck had his first job : making peanut butter and honey sandwiches and delivering them to the crew .
When Bismarck was starting school , the Lepes decided to settle in Oxnard .
Aida found office work and Casimiro toiled on local farms and delivered newspapers while attending community college to learn skills that have made him a maintenance man for an apartment company .
The Lepe brothers say their parents ’ hard work provided them with privileges not common to working class kids , including piano and karate lessons .
Bismarck ’s entrepreneurial streak — inspired , he says , by episodes of “ Dallas ” and “ Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous ” — became evident in elementary school .
He turned dimes into dollars , he said , by selling classmates pens and other items he purchased on visits to the downtown Los Angeles wholesale district .
At Oxnard High School , Bismarck excelled in academics and athletics , as a distance runner .
It is a school , he said , that serves a community with a wide socioeconomic divide .
About half of his freshman class failed to graduate .
In his application to Stanford , Bismarck took care to include a childhood photo of himself clinging to his mother ’s leg while she worked in an apple orchard .
He started as a pre-med student ; his parents hoped he would emulate Aida ’s brother , a physician and hospital owner in Mexico .
Bel looked up to the brother who , he said , “ was like the cool , live - in uncle ” because of their age difference .
Bel , too , excelled in academics and distance running .
Bismarck ’s horizons widened at Stanford , where Knapp , a distance - running star on Stanford ’s track team , became a friend .
Bismarck ’s interest in medicine waned as he took jobs at tech startups and pursued his own entrepreneurial ideas .
Encounters with students who had attended exclusive prep schools such as Andover and Exeter gave him an idea : Perhaps Bel could attend such schools on scholarship .
So it was that Bel , at age 14 , left Oxnard for the famed Phillips Academy in Andover , Mass. , commonly known as Andover , later transferring to the Thacher School in Ojai .
Bel said he believes the Andover experience — literally attending class with the sons of presidents and kings — helped prepare him for the social adjustment of both Stanford and Google .
A computer wiz , Bel was only 18 when he started working at Google while carrying a full load at Stanford .
Bismarck and Knapp were already working there .
As Bismarck tells it , the Ooyala story began one night in January 2007 , when he was struck by an idea for enhancing the commercial potential of online video .
Soon , he was pitching his idea to his brother and friend .
The decision to leave Google was toughest for Knapp : Unlike Bismarck , he was not yet vested in his stock options , and an early departure meant walking away from a hefty paycheck .
Google executives , they say , urged them to pursue their project within the company and without the financial risk .
But Ooyala ’s founders said they wanted the risk and challenge of building their own company .
To stay at Google , Knapp said , would be like living in your parents ’ mansion :
It might be nice , “ but it ’s still their mansion . ”
While Bismarck focused on developing the business , Knapp and Bel concentrated on technology .
By all signs , the risk is paying off .
Approaching its second anniversary , Ooyala has expanded from the three founders to 42 full - time and three part - time employees , with more jobs to be filled .
Ooyala ’s founders say they still tend to work 14 - hour days — and enjoy what they ’re doing .
The Silicon Valley wing of the Lepe clan still maintains its ties to Mexico .
One of Ooyala ’s customers is Televisa , a Mexican broadcasting giant .
And not long ago , Bismarck Lepe bought a large piece of farmland in Mexico .
The farmworkers ’ son is growing papaya .

NASHUA , New Hampshire ( CNN ) --
The economy in southern New Hampshire is not by any means among the worst in the nation .
Still , according to city records , there are 29 foreclosed homes on the books in Nashua -- many of which are in deplorable condition .
Walls had been ripped open in this foreclosed home in Atlanta , Georgia .
" This house is not livable right now , " Nelson Ortega , the city 's chief building code inspector , told CNN as he stood in front of a boarded - up single - family home on a residential street in Nashua .
The foundation of the house was fractured , Ortega said , and there were cracks and fissures in many of the supporting beams .
At the side entrance to the house were broken windows , garbage and peeling paint .
In 2006 , Ortega said , the property sold for $ 200,000 .
It 's anyone 's guess , he said , what price the home might bring now , if it ever sold .
That this foreclosed home might not ever sell was not news to a researcher who lives nearby .
" About a third of all of the foreclosed properties nationwide have been so damaged , either by the previous owners or by criminal gangs coming in after the foreclosure , that they no longer qualify for standard mortgage financing , " Thomas Popik told CNN .
" So there is going to be all kinds of government programs to help , but if they do n't qualify for standard mortgage financing , there 's no one to buy these properties . "
Popik says responses from thousands of real estate agents nationwide to the questionnaires he sends out quarterly indicate that badly damaged foreclosed homes -- so - called " distressed " properties in real estate jargon -- are a much bigger element of the national housing picture than officials in Washington have acknowledged .
Popik 's work is under the auspices of Campbell Communications , a Washington - based group that supplies data to private mortgage industry analysts .
" In many cases , it costs so much to rehabilitate these houses , it 's just not cost - effective , " he told CNN .
" And the properties are eventually going to be bulldozed . "
In some cities hit harder by the national economic downturn , a quick glance at foreclosed homes paints an even harsher picture .
" A lot of these homes have been vandalized , " Dana Ash , an Atlanta , Georgia , real estate broker , told CNN .
She was speaking in front of several foreclosed , boarded - up houses not far from the city 's center .
" They are a little scary going into them , " she said .
" The power is out , a lot of them are boarded up . "
A CNN camera crew was allowed into several of the houses .
Trash was everywhere ; plaster walls had been ripped open to expose wiring ; and in one case a toilet was dumped on an empty living room floor .
The banks that own the properties , Ash told CNN , probably will not simply walk away from the homes .
" Usually abandoning homes means it has n't sold , " she explained .
" They will eventually sell .
It will be pennies at best on the dollar , but they will eventually sell . "
From his office in New Hampshire , Popik said he is not at all certain of that .
" There are some cases where the properties have been so damaged that it's not profitable for the mortgage investor , which is a bank , to take title to the property , " he said .
The Mortgage Bankers Association told CNN it found no hard evidence of such a trend .
Some of the information , a spokesman said , was " anecdotal , " but there was no data one way or the other yet collected .
A spokesman for the Department of Housing and Urban Development in Washington told CNN that unsalable homes are still a relatively small part of the national inventory of foreclosed properties .
But , the spokesman added , the worse the economy is in a particular region , the more damaged and vandalized foreclosed homes are likely to be .

Sure , you may think rewarding people for crashing capitalism is a bad deal .
But it 's not .
Just listen to Columbia professor , Charles Calomiris on NPR .
First off , you 're just making a knee jerk reaction , and should stop sticking your nose into things you know nothing about .
I can't , sitting here today , and neither can you , judge from a distance and without knowing the details , judge what 's warranted and what 's not .
...
None of us know exactly who these bonuses are going to and for what reasons .
...
The point is , it 's very hard to micromanage from a distance here to determine if a payment is helpful to an institution .
This is all completely normal .
In fact , they 're doing it for you .
The reason why we compensate people in the financial industry not just with a smaller salary than they would otherwise get but with more of their compensation in bonuses , is because we want to incentivize them not to lose money .
We want to incentivize them to make money .
...
It does n't really make sense to get rid of bonuses , especially for people we 're hoping will make wise decisions so they do n't lose us even more money .
Can you imagine the damage people would do in those spots if they were n't the really Top People fueled by multimillion dollar bonuses ?
We really have no choice .
People need to get over this thing , and the biggest failure of the Obama administration ?
Not pushing people to accept this as the cost of doing business .
We need to do this .
We need to do it aggressively .
We need to do it for you .
It 's a hard sell , it does n't sound right , but in fact it is .
...
We as a country need to come together , stop being angry , and start thinking .
After all , it 's not like we 're funding a bunch of anonymous fiscal miscreants who undermined decades ( hey , centuries ) of the American economic system and left us all on the hook .
Not at all .
So what should we do ?
Wait for it , you 're going to love this .
The people at AIG are now working for us !
We own 80 % , and really more than that .
We own the whole " bad side " of the obligations .
What we need is , we need to compensate them so they stop losing money for us .
In other words , we 're not paying bonuses , we 're paying AIG to stop doing what they 've been doing .
If it makes it easier , do n't think of it as a bonus , think of it as a bribe .
Calomiris makes the point that , as a college professor , he does n't make bonuses .
Which is good , because if he was being paid on the basis of the intellectual quality of what he was passing on to his students , he'd have to take out a loan ( or maybe get AIG to provide a credit default swap ) .
Fortunately for the poor professor , he has another source of income .
He 's the Codirector the Financial Deregulation Project for the American Enterprise Institute .
While we 're worrying about the staffing at various federal agencies , can we take a moment to undo some of the damage at NPR ?
Anyone still looking to the AEI for wise counsel is beyond the bounds of reason .

Designers and developers have many choices to make when it comes to getting work done , from what frameworks , languages , and image editing software to use , to what platform to run .
The latter is an oft debated and controversial topic and the mere mention of it risks setting off flame wars of epic proportions , so in the interest of sanity , we ’ll try to avoid any direct comparisons to other operating systems .
Designers and developers have many choices to make when it comes to getting work done , from what frameworks , languages , and image editing software to use , to what platform to run .
The latter is an oft debated and controversial topic and the mere mention of it risks setting off flame wars of epic proportions , so in the interest of sanity , we ’ll try to avoid any direct comparisons to other operating systems .
It ’s no secret that there has been a growing trend in recent years toward developers , especially of the web variety , choosing a Mac as their main dev machine .
In this two - part series , we will examine some of the reasons behind this trend , look at some of the pitfalls of switching to the Mac , and go over the must - have software and configurations every switcher should be aware of .
You might be interested in the following related posts :
First Reason for Switching : Mac OS X
You may have noticed the rise in the number of colleagues and fellow developers who are choosing a Mac as their next computer .
If you have n’t , you ’re probably either working for Microsoft or you have an MBA .
So why is it so compelling ?
If you were to ask a die - hard Windows user why he or she thinks people like Macs , they would almost invariably say the reasons are purely about aesthetics .
If you were to ask most web developers why they have switched to a mac , however , the refrain would be loud and unanimous : OSX .
To be fair to Windows , in terms of raw capability the two offerings differ very little ; with enough elbow grease , both systems can be configured in pretty much any way its users wish .
When pressured to explain why they prefer OSX , Mac users often rest on qualifiable and subjective arguments such as “ it feels intuitive ” or “ I enjoy using it more ” or even “ I ca n’t explain why I like it better , I just do . ”
The Windows user , when presented with these arguments , usually rolls his or her eyes and continues on their way .
It is n’t until someone truly makes up their own mind to give OSX an honest chance that they can understand what all the fuss is about .
A Few Quantifiable Benefits of OS X include :
1. Open Source Friendly
As a web developer , if there ’s one skill you invariably have to develop , it ’s the use of a * NIX terminal .
Luckily , because OSX is built on top of UNIX , the terminal is ready and waiting .
Every Apple ships with a wide variety of open source programming tools and frameworks built in such as PHP , Apache , and Ruby on Rails .
Linux users who have grown tired of dealing with hardware issues , especially on laptops , often choose a Mac as their portable solution because it is UNIX based .
It means that the entire world of open source software out there is pretty much guaranteed to run without much hassle .
In a world where open source software is a way of life , web developers need a friendly environment to operate in .
2. Quartz Extreme
Quartz is the OpenGL powered windowing system used by OSX .
Quartz extreme utilizes the graphics card exclusively , which means no processor cycles are taxed .
This allows for a variety of useful features such as Exposé , which dynamically resizes every window on the screen giving you a bird ’s eye view of your entire workspace .
Spaces , a feature introduced in OSX 10.5 ( Leopard ) takes the bird ’s eye view a step further by providing a view of multiple desktops .
To further illustrate the point , you can activate Exposé inside Spaces and drag these windows from desktop to desktop – any videos that are playing will continue to play and the windows will dynamically resize to accommodate the extra window .
Once you get used to this sort of thing , you wonder how you ever lived without it .
3. Core Animation
Core animation provides a way for developers to produce animated user interfaces via an implicit animation model as well as an ‘ explicit ’ model .
In other words , it means some very flashy and useful features are going to start showing up in OS X applications much like the animated menu help system shown in the graphic above .
Prodiving developers with a toolset to implement these types of animated effects means software will become more intuitive .
There are so many useful tools that are built in to the Mac that come in handy for designers and developers that it ’s easy to see OSX was built with developers and creative professionals in mind .
Take the built - in screen capturing utility “ Grab ” for OSX , which has a wide variety of options , from selecting down to the pixel the area you want to screenshot , to providing window captures complete with the window frame , to outputting directly to the desktop as a .PNG file .
In fact , some tools were created specifically for designers because Apple has long catered to the creative professional market ( indeed , it sustained Apple during their darkest times ) .
More built in tools include :
The Digital Color Meter - a tool that allows you to grab the color value of any pixel on your screen .
Console - Useful for viewing very large log files
Terminal - Mentioned above , complete with many OSS tools like VIM
XCode Tools - The Apple development IDE
Zoom - easy - as - pie down - to - the - pixel zooming
Safari Debug Mode - Similar to Firebug for Firefox
Time Machine - dead simple automated backups
5. Unified User Interface
As any student of design knows , consistency is one of the most important principles to adhere to , and it is clear the OSX UI was designed with this in mind .
Because of the strict user interface guidelines provided by the Apple software development tools , applications and utilities on a Mac feel like they are all part of the same system .
The menu bar , which for some switchers can be a difficult feature to get used to , adheres to this unification by standardizing the location and layout of the menu options .
Drag - and - drop functionality is ubiquitous .
Being able to do things like drag an image off your web browser directly into your Photoshop project are a boon to productivity .
If it feels as though you should be able to drag - and - drop something , you probably can .
6. Security
Now before you crack your knuckles and start composing your diatribe about why Macs are n’t any more secure than PCs , let me point out a trite but undebatable fact : there ’s simply less malware out there for Macs than PCs – a LOT less ( partly because Unix is inherently more secure than Windows and partly because Windows is just more wide - spread and Mac users are n’t targeted that often – read more in the article Is The Mac Really More Secure Than Windows ? ) .
If you are on a Mac , at least for the next few more years , you can pretty much rest assured your days of worrying about virus and spyware scans are a thing of the past .
7. Textmate , Growl , Quicksilver , and more
There is no shortage of text editors available to developers , but one that seems to keep coming up in recommendation after recommendation is Textmate , the lightweight GUI text editor for OSX .
The project management drawer makes it easy to keep track of folders , which for monolithic MVC frameworks like Ruby on Rails and CakePHP is a godsend .
Nested scopes allow users to create their own syntax highlighting which is important in the ever changing world of web development .
To speed up the development process , one can utilize “ snippets ” or pieces of reusable code that can be inserted with a few key strokes .
While there are n’t any features that are revolutionary , they are combined in a way that makes for a very unobtrusive coding experience that seems very in tune with the overall feel of a Mac .
In addition to Textmate , there is a whole host of other beloved applications that seem to have been created by people who truly understand and want to emulate the Mac experience , like the quick - launch solution Quicksilver , the system notifications app Growl , and the chat client Adium .
These are pieces of software of a caliber that is sometimes difficult to find on Windows .
It seems that quality , not quantity , is the best way to describe the Mac software library .
8. Quick Look
OS X not only has icons that display an actual miniature version of the file they are representing , but it ’s possible to view the contents of the file in their full glory without having to launch the program they are associated with simply by hitting the space bar .
Furthermore , if a group of icons are highlighted , they can be expanded into a gallery view .
9. Virtualization
OSX is the only OS you can get that can virtualize all three major operating systems out of the box .
This is a must have for checking browser compatibility .
To make life even easier , you can do it right from within OSX using programs like Parallels , Virtualbox , and VMWare Fusion .
And if you think web browsers render websites exactly the same regardless of the operating system they ’re running on you are sorely mistaken .
Second Reason for Switching : Intel Inside
When Apple made the switch to Intel chips , it upset a lot of Mac fans out there who liked the fact that Apple was n’t the same as any other X86 box on the market .
With the rise in mobile computing , however , Apple was forced to face the fact that the PowerPC was n’t offering as good a solution as Intel .
They also knew that by offering a system that could run Windows in addition to OS X they would put to rest any compatibility arguments .
It turned out to be a good strategical move , and droves of would - be switchers were finally able to take the plunge without being forced to give up their entire libraries of Windows - based software .

And if you think web browsers render websites exactly the same regardless of the operating system they ’re running on you are sorely mistaken .
Third Reason for Switching : Less Hassle
Opinionated Software
Some people like hassle .
In fact , developers typically love getting their hands dirty customizing , maintaining , and tweaking their operating systems .
If you fall under this category , Linux is probably your best fit , followed by Windows .
OS X is more opinionated than other platforms .
It ’s more difficult to customize its look and feel , there ’s no easy way to get it to run on anything but Apple hardware , and OS X can be very particular about the way certain things are done .
Opionated software , however , can have its benefits .
While it may be more difficult to customize and hack every last aspect of your OS , sometimes it can be nice to have a system where a good many of these choices have already been made for you .
Because Apple provides a complete solution , from the operating system to the hardware to a lot of the software that ’s bundled in , they have an easier go of making sure the experience is seemless and well tested .
Opinionated software can be a very polarizing concept , however .
Take Ruby on Rails for instance , a web development framework where many decisions are made for the developer based on the core contributors ’ opinions about best practices .
Rails has a preferred javascript framework , database ORM , templating system , and more .
You can choose other configurations if you want to , but it shines brightest when you do things the “ Rails Way . ”
You spend less time customizing and more time actually developing .
This hands - off approach can be a major turn off for some developers , but for others it removes a lot of the hassle and reinventing of the wheel .
The high rate of Mac ownership among Rails developers could be directly attributed to the analogous nature of Apple and Rails .
The analogy is made more apt by any number of PHP vs Ruby on Rails flame wars you can find out there .
Support
Because Apple provides the whole solution , they are obligated to provide support for the whole solution as well .
Most developers are perfectly willing to trouble shoot their own computers , but when deadlines need to be met it can be nice knowing that you can offload some of that hassle to people who already know the system inside and out .
Apple has impressive customer service specifically because they support the entire system , rather than just one aspect of the system .
It ’s also handy to be able to take your machine into an actual brick - and - mortar store rather than deal with outsourced phone support .
Let ’s face it , when it comes to a non-technical spouse or family member , we can expect to do a lot of troubleshooting .
Just like its nice not to have to worry about troubleshooting your own computer , it ’s even nicer not to have to worry as much about other people ’s computers .
It is reasonable to assume that because Macs typically have less security issues ( at least for now ) , there ’s less time spent trying to explain how to avoid malware and actually removing it .
Fourth Reason for Switching : Microsoft
If you like it or not : a big reason why developers have been flocking to Apple is in part due to the fact that it is n’t the big M .
When personal computing was still in its infancy , the reverse was true .
Microsoft understood that it was the developers ( developers developers ) that would make their OS successful while Apple ’s closed model ended up being a huge mistake .
Once Microsoft started dominating the marketplace , however , the pungent stench of monopoly sparked the open source movement , and more and more developers were starting to wonder if there were better options out there .
Linux is of course the golden child of the open source movement , but despite the efforts of Ubuntu it is still a ways off in terms of being a turnkey solution for most people .
Enter Apple : a Unix based system that despite being every bit as closed as Microsoft , is in large part the antithesis of Microsoft .
Microsoft software has the unfortunate feeling of having been designed by committee .
Features are packed in with little regard to their usefulness , and aesthetics are seemingly an afterthought .
When Vista first launched , the Aero user interface was so flashy it required higher end machines to even run it , somewhat defeating the argument Microsoft was making about the affordability of PCs .
OSX was designed to run as well on the most expensive Mac Pro as it would an eight year old Powerbook because they control the solution from hardware to software .
Unfortunately , Windows does n’t come bundled with PHP , Rails , or any other open - source web development frameworks or languages any time soon .
More and more of what we do is in the cloud these days anyways and it is almost starting to feel quaint when you come across new software that runs solely as a desktop client .
Microsoft has painted themselves into a corner – they rely on closed formats and standards in a world where open source software , open formats , and open standards are king .
Fifth Reason For Switching : Design and Minimalism
Good design gets out of the way .
It does n’t demand to be seen or appreciated .
Most of all , good design is something you do n’t even notice at first .
Bang & Olufsen understands this , and Apple understands this .
As of this writing , there are only two styles of Apple notebook : silver and white , and white is only available in the cheapest configuration .
Apple notebooks are free of stickers , screws , vents , buttons , switches , and graphics .
What this leaves is a system with little to look at other than the screen in front of you , which is as it should be .
The benefit of the entire product development cycle being done under one house is that Apple creates a system that truly feels as though it was created by one person .
At the heart of Apple ’s design philosophy is the concept of minimalism .
It is a concept that has worked well for companies such as Google .
We all remember the gratuitous placement of links and ads on most search engines before Google came around with its simple search bar .
After all , it was the search that was the important part , not the content the provider was hoping we would want .
Apple figures if not including a feature angers 1 % of their consumer base but makes things easier for the other 99 % it ’s probably worth doing .
Take , for instance , the lack of a second mouse buttom .
It may seem like a glaring omission on Apple ’s part , but it has had some unintended consequences : because developers can’t simple throw commands into a bloated right - click menu they are forced to think more about the one - click usability of their applications .
Minimalist design has its downsides too , however .
Macs lack card readers , often have 2 - 3 less USB ports than even low end machines , and are typically difficult to customize .
For those of you who value a product that gives you many choices , Apple is going to fall short .
It is often pointed out that upgrading a Mac is easy : “ Just throw it away and buy a new one . ”
Humor aside , this is n’t too far from the truth but the good news is that Macs hold their value better than any computer on the market .
Instead of throwing it away , sell it on Ebay for healthy head - start on a new machine .
Mac ’s Pitfalls
It ’s not all sunshine and rainbows for everyone who switches to a Mac .
There are the inevitable bumps in the road that everyone experiences when making a major platform change , and for some people these bumps are outright road blocks .
Here ’s what to be aware of :
1. Control is now Command
Breaking the habit of using control as the main modifier key on your system can take a bit of time and some people never quite get the hang of it .
Old habits die hard and muscle memory dies harder .
This is a problem that can be solved by re-mapping command to the control key , but when you are using a system that assumes a certain configuration you may run into confusion later on .
2. No Second Mouse Button
Unless you use an external mouse with your Apple laptop you will have to get used to the lack of a second mouse button .
The truth is there is no optimal number of mouse buttons .
Luckily , you can enable right - clicking in a number of ways on a mac , such as tapping the track pad with two fingers simultaneously or holding ctrl when clicking .
3. No Maximizing of Windows
This is actually starting to become less true as time goes on as ex-Windows users who develop software for the Mac include the feature ( for instance , maximize on firefox for the Mac works as expected ) .
But the typical maximize you are used to in Windows cannot be found on the Mac , and for some this can be extremely frustrating .
In fact , the whole “ stop - light ” window controls can at times feel stale and unintuitive .
4. Lack of an “ affordable ” Mac
Perhaps the most popular sticking point of non-Mac users , price is always at the heart of the debate .
Under $ 1200 or so , there is no question that byte for byte , ghz for ghz , you can get a better raw value by avoiding Apple .
Apple has chosen not to enter the sub $ 1000 PC not because it does n’t want to grow sales , but because it wants to avoid the dogfight that Sony , HP , and other brands are in for the lower end market .
Profit margins are razor thin in that range , after all .
Apple is certainly catering to the botique style consumer .
If you are pinching pennies these days the price issue may just be the one pitfall you ca n’t bring yourself to overcome .
5. Much Smaller Software Library
While this is somewhat mediated by the fact that you can virtualize Windows on a Mac , it is a far cry from being able to run your favorite programs natively on your system .
If you are using software on a regular basis that only runs in the Windows environment , you may want to think hard about whether moving to a Mac is worth the trouble .
6. You Ca n’t Build a Mac ( Easily )
Part of the success of Windows was the fact that they licensed it to run on any PC , anywhere .
Apple has been closed since the word go , save a brief period where they allowed Mac clones to exist in what turned out to be a devastatingly bad idea .
If you ’re the type who loves building your own PC from scratch , a Mac is not going to offer much for you .
In general , even the most jaded Windows user is inevitably going to miss at least a few features or aspects of Windows during their switch to a Mac .
The best policy to follow is to keep an open mind during the learning process .
Try doing things “ the Mac way ” for a week and keep your skepticism to a minimum .
Above all , ask questions before you make assumptions .
There ’s a fervent Apple community out there ( in case you have n’t noticed ) that have solutions for every issue you find , thanks in part to the fact that most of them are switchers themselves .
Remember , if you ’re having the issue , chances are good some other switcher experienced it before you and created or found a solution .
Conclusion
While not the right solution for everyone , it ’s clear that many people are switching to a Mac these days for a good many reasons .
Nevertheless ,
Macs are expensive and require user ’s patience and willingness to adapt his or her behavior to a compltely different interface .
Mac is certainly not an option for every user , but it is definitely an option worth considering – particularly for designers or developers .

Fibre optic networks are offering faster broadband speeds Virgin Media will offer 100 to 150 M bps broadband speeds up to two years before BT completes its rival fibre network .
" We have an opportunity with our network to provide significantly higher speeds , " Virgin Media 's chief executive Neil Berkett told BBC News .
BT has said its fibre network will hit the first crop of UK cities by early 2010 and will be complete by 2012 .
Virgin currently offers a top speed of 50 M bps while BT is pledging 40 to 60 Mb .
Mr Berkett said its fibre to the cabinet ( FTTC ) network was capable of supporting up to 200 M bps but roll out of higher speeds was a " function of timing " .
He said : " When we look at the market I do n't see us getting the returns right now for 100 or 150 Mbps .
See what applications work at different speeds " As we work with application providers , and content providers ... there will be a natural point where we upgrade from 10 , 20 and 50 M bps to something more .
" If BT were to meet the time frame they have suggested - of finishing by 2012 - I would see us as having much , much faster upstream speed , running at a minimum of 100 M bps downstream and possibly more .
You can see a real opportunity there . "
Faster speeds
Mr Berkett said he would be surprised if Virgin Media did not start the roll out of faster speeds next year .
BT has said it will deploy FTTC technology at 29 exchanges across the UK in the coming 9 to 12 months .
The network will offer speeds of up to 40 M bps - and potentially 60 M bps - to 500,000 homes and businesses .
Areas of Belfast , Cardiff , Edinburgh , Glasgow , London and Greater Manchester will be able to access the fibre network , which will be opened up on a wholesale basis to Internet Service Providers ( ISPs ) who can then offer various broadband packages to customers .
Virgin Media says its network reaches half of all homes in the UK .
The technology has a theoretical limit of 200 M bps downsteam speeds .
Mr Berkett said the firm had not ruled out the possibility of opening its own network to other ISPs .
He said : " We had this conversation with a bunch of investors recently .
Our position is ' Let 's prove the market ' .
" Wholesaling is not off our agenda but right now it is not a priority for us . "
He added : " Who knows , by the time BT have rolled out their next generation network we may be in position to explore wholesale . "

In May 2008 , Bruce Wilson , co-founder of the blog Talk2Action , made a short video featuring a recording of Pastor John Hagee preaching about how God had sent Hitler to hunt the Jews and force them to Israel .
The video went viral and McCain was forced to disassociate himself and repudiate Hagee ’s endorsement .
Hagee slunk off the national stage .
Flash forward to September of last year .
McCain ( now the GOP ’s presidential candidate ) chooses a relatively obscure political figure , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , as his running mate .
When a CNN reporter asked a GOP campaign spokesperson about Palin ’s religious beliefs , she would only say that “ the Republican vice presidential candidate has ‘ deep religious convictions . ’ ”
Wilson began looking into Palin ’s religious background .
What he found was far more interesting than the fairly run -of - the - mill Christian Zionism of someone like Hagee .
Bruce , can you explain what you found when you started looking into Sarah Palin ’s religious background and affiliations ?
Bruce Wilson : Sarah Palin is , broadly speaking , in the emerging postdenominational movement , which by 2000 encompassed 385 million Christians and is vastly different from the faith as it has been practiced in recent centuries .
We identified Palin as in a majority tendency of postdenominationalism known as the neocharismatic movement , or the “ Third Wave . ”
Evangelical missionary reference work World Christian Trends calls the Third Wave “ a new and disturbingly different ” kind of Christianity whose members “ can accurately be called radical Christians with some pentecostal / charismatic parallels ” and which has , as one of the distinctive characteristics of Third Wave Christian ministry , a heavy emphasis on healing miracles including raising the dead — an emphasis promoted from the pulpit in sermons at Palin ’s most central church , the Wasilla Assembly of God .
We also found extensive evidence that Palin is in a religious movement founded in 2001 that has coalesced out of Third Wave Christianity ; the New Apostolic Reformation ( NAR ) .
The NAR is bent on radically reinventing Christianity , and is fast becoming the vanguard of the global Christian Right .
Its leaders have openly declared that their aim of achieving worldwide biblical government and a utopian age in which evil — as an ontological category — has been banished by purging demon spirits and unbelievers from the earth .
Palin is directly , personally linked to not one but two major NAR leaders , Windwalkers Ministry International founder Mary Glazier and Thomas Muthee — who have both publicly described battling alleged witches with prayer - warfare .
Through Glazier , Palin appears to be under the authority of the man who founded the NAR and has announced the advent of a second Reformation , C. Peter Wagner .
Charismatic manifestations as extreme as raising the dead are n’t what is problematic about Palin ’s religious tendencies ;
Third Wave and NAR theology is militantly anti-pluralistic and anti-democratic , the quintessence of Christian religious supremacy .
While our work recognized the need for a basic reassessment of the impact the charismatic movement has had on Christianity and , increasingly , on American religion and politics , it also highlighted the mainstream media ’s failure to inform American voters about Palin , who might now have been just a heartbeat away from the presidency .
Why do you think your revelations about Palin did n’t catch on with the mainstream media ?
I ’ve been pondering that question for several months , and I ’ve come up with two related levels of explanation .
The first is simply that what our stories described sounded outlandish — millions of Christians worldwide are trying to bring about an earthly utopia by driving out demons alleged to infest cities and towns , inanimate objects ( cars , alarm clocks , rosary beads , big rocks , toothbrushes whatever ) , as well as entire ethnic groups .
It sounds , until one gets used to the proposition that demons are omnipresent in day - to - day life , absurd .
The obvious question in many of our readers ’ minds was I ’m sure :
Why have n’t I heard of this before ?
The implication seemed to be that much of the journalism on religion and politics to come out over the last decade has missed massive , global changes in Christianity that carry profound political implications .
Historian Philip Jenkins wrote about the enormity of those changes , which he likened to a second Reformation , in a 2002 article in the Atlantic Monthly entitled “ The Next Christianity . ”
There ’s actually quite a significant body of scholarship on the rise of Third Wave Christianity and even on the New Apostolic Reformation .
But to find it one has to be aware those movements exist .
The few mainstream journalists who interviewed us , leading up to November 4 , were far less skeptical after we sent them some reference material to let them know we were n’t writing creative fiction .
Three points of reference we used were Alix Spiegel ’s 1997 This American Life radio story , “ Pray ” ( about the strange goings on at Ted Haggard ’s New Life Church ) ; Jane Lampman ’s two September 1999 Christian Science Monitor stories on The World Prayer Center and the ‘ spiritual mapping ’ movement ; and René Holvast ’s 2005 dissertation for the University of Utrecht , “ Spiritual Mapping : The Turbulent Career of a Contested American Paradigm , ” which has been reworked into a book published last November .
So , our stories connected Palin to a religious movement that relatively few Americans know even exists , which looks acts and holds theological beliefs — even a basic outlook on life — that is very different from what secular and liberal America might think or envision as coming from the ‘ religious right . ’
And the religious ideas powering the movement are very strange , novel that is , compared to Christian theology of the past several hundred years .
The challenge : How do authors , amidst the tumult of a presidential election , establish an audience for explaining a new school of thought that cuts radically against the grain of orthodox thought ?
Had we been able to plausibly link her to any of a number of cults or minor religions that people had at least heard of before , our work might actually have stuck in people ’s minds .
So there were n’t any cognitive reference points .
Memory is relational — new information that fits preexisting patterns of knowledge tends to stick .
Information that does n’t tends not to .
I suspect much of our writing got momentarily noticed , as being in the “ oh , that ’s really weird ! ” perceptual category , then was rapidly forgotten .
The headlines of our stories were provocative enough : “ Palin ’s Movement Urges Godly to Plunder Wealth of Godless ” ; “ Palin Linked to Second Witch Hunter ” ; “ Palin ’s Spiritual Warfare Network Partners With Homeland Security ” ; “ Palin put Religious War Advocate on Alaska Suicide Prevention Council . ”
Our work did get out through some smaller progressive media platforms : Radio talk - show host Thom Hartmann ( and a few other hosts ) interviewed me .
On the Internet , Mark Karlin of Buzzflash strongly promoted our work , accurately dubbing Palin a ‘ Manchurian candidate . ’
New York Times religion reporter Laurie Goodstein interviewed us at considerable length and quoted me in her NYT story on Palin .
She was one of the few journalists assigned to the beat ( Garance Burke , writing for the Associated Press , also stood out ) who got it .
Her story , without actually naming the New Apostolic Reformation , covered much of what was important for her readers to know about the distinctive nature of Palin ’s faith and religious associations .
Despite gaining broad distribution on the Internet , I think that our work did n’t spread deeply into the mainstream media because we did n’t have access to big enough distribution channels .
While we were posting on some alternative news services , such as Alternet and Buzzflash , The Daily Kos and The Huffington Post , many of the biggest liberal political blogs did n’t pick up our stories .
I would add two other factors : when some mainstream media outlets did stories which , to be honest , seemed to be quite heavily derivative of our work , they did n’t credit us ; and our stories may have been too dense for the 24/7 news cycle and too full of unrecognized names of individuals , organizations , and concepts .
We were very careful with our facts and as we ’ve both continued our research , we ’ve learned that our stories were more on target than we knew at the time .
Some religious
Web sites responded favorably to your work .
Yes , perhaps the most enthusiastic response we got was from classic fundamentalists —
Pre-millennial Apocalyptic Dispensationalists , to be specific .
Those folks were reposting our stories , in their entirety , on their Web sites , and they praised our work for accurately describing the NAR and its theology .
They ’ve been aware of the movement for years , and most of the good oppositional research on it , up until now , has been done by fundamentalists — religious traditionalists in essence , who consider the New Apostolic Reformation to be a dangerous and possibly satanic heresy .
The rift seemed to go straight to the heart of the hard right : one of our stories about Palin and the NAR was reposted in its entirety on the Free Republic Web site , then a fight broke out between pro and anti-NAR site members .
It was astounding !
You produced over twenty stories and several videos on Palin .
What are your plans for the future ?
The short answer is : books , longer and more ambitious articles , and even a full length video documentary or two .
The New Apostolic movement relies heavily on visual media and pop music ( much of it now carried over the Internet ) for organizing and projecting its ideas , and for creating the movement ’s sensual , experiential allure .
So , there ’s a vast amount of rich media to draw on , much of it — in terms of advertising and PR — cutting edge .
In terms of writing , I feel drawn toward unpacking how the existing lines of ideological conflict we see in our time came to be .
That ’s crucial , I feel , and it ’s part of a craft I ’ve just found a term for : ‘ parapolitics ’ — the shaping of cultural precepts which form ideologies that in turn drive politics .
The right has long been waging parapolitics but , especially in the religious sphere , the left seems to have largely forgotten it exists .

Low - Income Working Families : Rising Inequality Despite Economic Recovery
A new report shows that despite strong job growth since the end of the Great Recession , many working families are worse off that they were in 2007 , before the Great Recession began .
The latest U.S. Census data shows that three out of every 10 working families were low - income in 2016 .
In addition , income and wealth gaps between working families at the top and bottom of the economic ladder remain at all - time highs .
The report , produced jointly PRB and The Working Poor Families Project , also found disturbing growing inequality among racial and ethnic groups .
Six in 10 low - income working families are minorities .
And minority working families are twice as likely to be low - income than non-minority families .
As Tax Day approaches , the report calls on policymakers and employers to expand programs and strengthen benefits that help low - income working parents and their children .

Low - Income Working Families : The Racial / Ethnic Divide
There is a large and growing economic divide among America ’s working families , with whites and Asians at the top and other racial / ethnic groups falling behind .
While low - income working families comprise close to one - third of all working families in America , the significant differences among racial / ethnic groups present a critical challenge to ensuring economic growth and bringing opportunities to all workers , families , and communities across the United States .
In this brief , the Working Poor Families Project highlights Census Bureau data on low - income working families and differences across racial / ethnic groups .
Recognizing that public policy can play a critical role in our future prosperity by reversing these conditions , we recommend state government policies and actions that would improve conditions for millions of lower - income parents and their children , reduce inequality and promote economic growth by ensuring a well - qualified workforce and a sufficient number of jobs with wages and benefits that support a family .

States Continue to Increase Access to Workplace Retirement Savings Programs
A substantial number of working families are not saving enough to meet their needs in retirement .
Even before the coronavirus hit the U.S. , decimating the economy and throwing millions out of work , data showed that between 40 % and 75 % of working families were at risk of not having enough in retirement savings to maintain their pre-retirement standard of living .
A new policy brief by the Working Poor Families Project explores legislation and policies that states have put in place to help more workers save for retirement .
The brief is an update to a 2016 WPFP brief about increasing access to workplace retirement savings programs .
As the country struggles through the pandemic , Americans continue to need to accumulate more savings to weather the current and future economic downturns and prepare for retirement .

Claim : Photographs show Katie Kirkpatrick , a 21 - year - old cancer victim who passed away five days after her wedding .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , March 2009 ]
Beautiful Lesson !!!!!!!!
Beautiful Lesson !!!!!!!!
The girl in the picture is Katie Kirkpatrick , she is 21 .
Next to her , her fiancé , Nick , 23 .
The picture was taken shortly before their wedding ceremony , held on January 11 , 2005 in the US .
Katie has terminal cancer and spend hours a day receiving medication .
In the picture , Nick is waiting for her on one of the many sessions of Chemo to end .
In spite of all the pain , organ failures , and morphine shots , Katie is going along with her wedding and took care of every detail .
The dress had to be adjusted a few times due to her constant weight loss .
An unusual accessory at the wedding was the oxygen tube that Katie used throughout the ceremony and reception as well .
The other couple in the picture are Nick ’s parents .
Excited to see there son marrying his high school sweetheart .
Katie , in her wheelchair with the oxygen tube , listening a song from her husband and friends
At the reception , Katie had to take a few rest breaks .
The pain would n’t allow her to stand up for long periods .
Katie died five days after her wedding day .
Watching a women so ill and weak getting married and with a smile on her face makes us think …..
Happiness is reachable , no matter how long it last .
We should stop making our lives complicated .
Origins : On Valentine ’s Day 2002 , Katie Kirkpatrick , then a freshman at Rochester College ( a small Christian college in Rochester Hills , Michigan ) was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor .
Undaunted , Katie strove to keep up with her studies , but she suffered another setback in 2003 when she was diagnosed with “ an inoperable lung tumor wrapped around her pulmonary artery . ”
Nonetheless , in 2004 the resilient Katie took part in champion cyclist Lance Armstrong ’s “ Ride for the Roses ” cancer fundraiser :
Dr. Craig Bowman of the Bible faculty spearheaded a campus and area - wide effort that raised $ 28,000 which made one of Katie ’s dreams come true : riding with six - time Tour de France winner and fellow cancer survivor Lance Armstrong in his Ride for the Roses cancer fundraiser .
Dr. Craig Bowman of the Bible faculty spearheaded a campus and area - wide effort that raised $ 28,000 which made one of Katie ’s dreams come true : riding with six - time Tour de France winner and fellow cancer survivor Lance Armstrong in his Ride for the Roses cancer fundraiser .
Says Katie of Armstrong , “ I like his attitude and his perseverance .
I admire him for the way he dealt with his cancer , and his attitude : ‘ You know what , this is n’t going to beat me ! ' ”
On 15 January 2005 , 21 - year - old Katie — the girl “ with a contagious smile and unrelenting optimism ” who had been battling cancer for three years — married Lapeer County sheriff ’s deputy Nick Godwin , her high school sweetheart and the love of her life , at Church of Christ in Hazel Park , Michigan .
Katie Kirkpatrick Godwin passed away at the McLaren Regional Medical Center in Flint , Michigan , on 20 January 2005 , just five days after her wedding .
Her husband , Nick , said of the wedding and Katie ’s passing : “ It was wonderful .
It was a dream come true .
She was the most beautiful angel ever — just caring and selfless , and such an inspiration to everyone .
She was always smiling no matter what happened , no matter what news she got .
She was as close to perfect as they come . ”
She did not let sickness stop her from living , take away the hope or faith that made her believe she had a future .
She had a lovely wedding and she had love and she gave love and love does n’t die .
And that is how Katie beat cancer .
Additional photographs of Katie and her wedding can be viewed on the National Press Photographers Association ( NPPA ) web site .
Katie ’s Spa in Lapeer , Michigan ( a business which specializes in services to cancer patients ) , is named in Katie ’s memory , as is Katie ’s Wings , a non-profit organization established to help bring assistance to people affected by cancer .
Sadly , the event that likely prompted circulation of this item in March 2009 was the death of Katie ’s father , David B. Kirkpatrick , who passed away that month after his own battle with cancer .

Advertisement Demonstrators in Moldova have attacked the country 's parliament in protest at the victory of the governing Communist Party in Sunday 's general election .
Witnesses say crowds poured into the building , smashing windows and setting light to furniture .
Police said a woman died from carbon monoxide poisoning after inhaling fumes in a blaze , state television reported .
President Vladimir Voronin urged an end to " destabilisation " , but opposition leaders have backed the protests .
They say the election result was fraudulent .
EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana has urged all sides in the former Soviet state to refrain from violence , and Russia also voiced its concern .
' Bloodshed ' claim Communist Party leader Mr Voronin , who will step down as president this month after two terms in office , told ministers there was " no evidence of any irregularities during the election " .
" Appealing against the election 's outcome is merely a pretext , " he said during a televised cabinet meeting .
President Voronin said there was no evidence of electoral irregularities Mr Voronin said the authorities would " shed light on these events " and find out the identities of the organisers .
" But now we must think how we should act and what we should do because their key goal can be clearly seen , " he said .
" It is very obvious .
They need bloodshed from the authorities . "
The president and Prime Minister Zinaida Greceanii held talks with the leaders of the three main opposition parties - the Liberal Party , the Liberal Democratic Party and Our Moldova Alliance .
The three parties later denied accusations from Mr Voronin 's supporters that were attempting a coup d'etat and reiterated that they believed the election result was fraudulent .
" We support the youths in their absolutely normal aspiration to counteract this rude election fraud , " said Vlad Filat , leader of the Liberal Democrats .
" We were those who urged them not to use violence . "
The Mayor of Chisinau , Dorin Chirtoaca , who is deputy head of the opposition Liberal Party , said the protests were justified " because people did not vote for the Communists in such large numbers " .
Vote ' was fair ' Earlier on Tuesday , tear gas and jets of water were blasted at protesters by security forces defending the parliament building in the capital , Chisinau .
The presidential office was also attacked .
In pictures : Moldova protests Medical officials said more than 30 people - including both protesters and police - were injured .
Later , Moldovan state TV said one woman had " choked to death from carbon monoxide poisoning in the parliament " .
Although election observers concluded last weekend 's vote was fair , opposition parties and many students are not convinced .
The Communist Party won 50 % of votes in the election .
They were followed by the Liberal Party with almost 13 % of the votes , the Liberal Democratic Party with 12 % , and Our Moldova Alliance on almost 10 % .
It is still not clear whether the Communists will win the 61 seats in the 101 - seat parliament that they need to elect Mr Voronin 's successor unopposed .
Opposition reject coalition Mr Solana said he was " very concerned " over the situation .
" I call on all sides to refrain from violence and provocation .
Violence against government buildings is unacceptable , " he said in a statement .
" Equally important is the respect for the inalienable right of assembly of peaceful demonstrators . "
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said he was concerned about the protests , which he described as " provoked " .
President Voronin is barred by the constitution from running for a third term , although he has indicated he wants to remain involved in affairs of state .
If no president is chosen before 8 June , another parliamentary election must be held .
The pro-Western centre - right opposition parties have said they will not join a coalition with the Communists , who favour strong links with both Russia and the European Union .
Mr Voronin 's successor will lead the poorest country in Europe , where the average wage is just under $ 250 ( £ 168 ) a month , and will inherit an unresolved conflict over the breakaway region of Trans - Dniester .
Correspondents say the dispute is reminiscent of the situation in South Ossetia before last summer 's conflict between Georgia and Russia .
The region has run its own affairs , with Moscow 's support , since the end of hostilities in a brief war in 1992 .
Mr Voronin resumed direct talks with Trans - Dniester last year .

Subway heroes , as they are inevitably tagged before the grease from the tracks is rubbed off , come along every now and then — indeed , as the story of Chad Lindsey suggests , perhaps more often than we know .
Minutes after rescuing a man who had fallen onto the subway tracks in Pennsylvania Station on Monday , Mr. Lindsey , 33 , managed to melt back into the anonymity of the city , escaping the notice of the police , paramedics and subway workers .
“ I ’m of many minds of being in the spotlight , ” he said after a call from this reporter , whose short blog post on Monday prompted one of Mr. Lindsey ’s friends to identify him on Tuesday .
“ But what the hey , ” he said .
Mr. Lindsey , 33 , is from Harbor Springs , Mich .
He moved to New York City three years ago and settled in Woodside , Queens .
He can take it from there :
“ I was waiting for the C to go downtown to a reading , ” he said from his office on West 30th Street , where he works as a proofreader .
“ I ’m an actor — shocker . ”
He said that almost everyone seems to be an aspiring actor nowadays , but in this case , it is a critical point to the story : Mr. Lindsey currently appears in an Off Broadway show called “ Kasper Hauser , ” in a role that requires him to repeatedly lift a character who cannot walk .
On Monday , he was thinking ahead to his reading .
“ I ’m kind of zoned out , and I saw this guy come too quickly to the edge , ” he said .
“ He stopped and kind of reeled around .
I felt bad , because I could n’t get close enough to grab his coat .
He fell , and immediately hit his head on the rail and passed out . ”
Mr. Lindsey said he sensed that a train was approaching simply because the platform was crowded .
“ I dropped my bag and jumped down there , ” he said .
“ I tried to wake him up .
He probably had a massive concussion at that point .
I jumped down there and he just would n’t wake up , and he was bleeding all over the place . ”
He looked back up at the people on the platform .
“ There were lots of people , and none of them looked like they ’d be particularly good at jumping down there , ” he said .
` “ I yelled , ‘ Contact the station agent and call the police ! ’ which I think is hilarious because I do n’t think I ever said ‘ station agent ’ before in my life .
What am I , on ‘ 24 ’ ? ”
The man would not wake up , Mr. Lindsey said : “ He was hunched over on his front .
I grabbed him from behind , like under the armpits , and kind of got him over to the platform .
It was n’t very elegant .
I just hoisted him up so his belly was on the platform .
It ’s kind of higher than you think it is . ”
He stole a glance toward the dark subway tunnel that was becoming ominously less dark , with the glow on the tracks , familiar to all New Yorkers , signaling an approaching train .
“ I could n’t see the train coming , but I could see the light on the tracks , and I was like , ‘ I ’ve got to get out of this hole . ’ ”
He remembered the subway hero of 2007 , Wesley Autrey , who famously jumped on top of a man having a seizure on the tracks and held him down in the shallow trench between the tracks as the subway passed harmlessly over them .
“ I thought about the guy who laid on the guy on the tracks ?
I was like , ‘ I am not doing that .
We ’ve got to get out of here . ’ ”
Others on the platform responded .
“ Someone pulled him out , and I just jumped up out of there , ” Mr. Lindsey said .
With time to spare : “ The train did n’t come for another 10 or 15 seconds or something . ”
It appears that the motorman did not see the incident , as service was not interrupted .
The man lay bleeding on the platform , and the police arrived .
Mr. Lindsey said he gave a brief account to the police before another train arrived .
“ My adrenaline was pumping , ” he said .
“ I could n’t tell you why , but I just got on the next train .
He was in the hands of the cops . ”
After the rescue , a large group from the platform entered the subway car with Mr. Lindsey , smiling and clapping him on the back and saying thank you .
“ Then I sort of freaked out , and I was nervous and shaky .
These five women opened their purses and gave me Handi Wipes .
I was covered in blood and dirt from the subway tracks .
One woman was a nurse , and said , ‘ Do n’t have caffeine or cigarettes for an hour and a half , ’ because of the adrenaline in my heart . ”
An editor from The New York Times was in the same car , and he gave Mr. Lindsey a business card and asked him to call .
He did not call , but he recalled meeting the Times editor and , to confirm it was he , he produced the card on Tuesday and read the number and other identifying information scrawled on the back .
He thought of the fallen man and wondered briefly if he had done the right thing .
“ I thought maybe I should n’t have moved him , but you ’re going to get creamed by a train , ” he said .
He credited his show at the Flea Theater in TriBeCa with keeping him in shape .
“ I have to lift a kid up all the time , and I ’m always complaining about it , but I guess it ’s worth it , ” he said .
The fallen man was taken to St. Vincent ’s Hospital Manhattan and was later released .
The police identified him late Tuesday afternoon as Theodore Larson , 60 , of the Bronx .
Mr. Lindsey , of course , never learned the man ’s name .
His story told , he said goodbye , adding , “ It was quite a New York day . ”

We knew it was coming , and now it 's here ... the return of California 's foreclosure crisis .
Okay , it was n't exactly gone , but maybe just on hiatus thanks to a new state law that went into effect last fall .
That law requires lenders to take additional steps to keep troubled borrowers in their homes .
Then of course there were various bank and Fannie / Freddie moratoria on foreclosures .
Today DataQuick reports " lenders filed a record number of mortgage default notices against California during the first three months of this year , the result of the recession and of lenders playing catch - up after a temporary lull in foreclosure activity . "
Default notices surged 80 percnet from 75,230 for the prior quarter to 135,431 notices in Q1 2009 .
That 's also up 19 percent from the first quarter of 2008 .
This is a new all - time high for any quarter in DataQuick 's statistics , which go back to 1992 .
Now you may say , well , these are default notices , not foreclosures , and we 've got that great Making Homes Affordable adminstration plan all ready to help all these folks .
I 'm wondering just how they 're going to handle these folks , let alone help them .
According to DataQuick , the bulk of the loans were originated in late 2006 , at the very height and most desperate frenzy of the housing boom , when lenders were trying to get everyone and their brother into a new loan .
I wonder how many of those loans are now so far underwater , given the huge home price declines in California , that no modification is going to help .

Men look at the haze - shrouded skyline in Singapore October 16 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Nicky Loh
SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - A couple treated open air diners to a 15 - minute naked parade in Singapore , triggering both embarrassment and applause for a scene almost unheard of in the conservative city - state .
Pub manager Terence Chia told the Straits Times newspaper he saw the couple taking off their clothes Saturday night at a staircase in a block of flats in Holland Village , known for its popular nightspots .
“ Then , clothes in hand , they coolly walked in their flip - flops toward the market , ” he said , adding when the couple did a U - turn a sea of spectators was ready and poised with cameras .
“ There were more than 200 people and everyone was taking pictures , ” the newspaper Wednesday quoted Chia as saying .
“ Even women were busy clicking and people were cheering , whistling and applauding like crazy . ”
Police said the couple , a Caucasian man and an ethnic Chinese woman in their 20s , had been arrested and released on bail .
If convicted under Singapore law , they could face a fine of maximum fine of S$ 2000 ( $ 1,330 ) , up to 3 months in jail , or both .
Protests are rare in Singapore and only made legal last year in a designated area called “ Speakers ’ Corner , ” modeled on London ’s Hyde Park .
“ They looked really comfortable walking down the street , which led to many curious stares , ” wrote blogger Leonard Tan .
“ Singapore is getting more and more exciting . ”
Suskind , of course , is referring to the Senate report issued yesterday as well as his own research which traced the timeline of the policy making in the White House to the actual spread of torture techniques passing through both State and the Pentagon .
The timeline shows that one of the key -- if not the key - - impetus for the instigation of torture was to help the Administration " save face " in light of the increasingly obvious evidence that its claims of WMD's as a basis for the Iraq invasion were utterly bogus .
An analysis of the report and the issues raised in it appears here :
http://www.mcclatchydc.com/...
The report itself is here :
http://armed-services.senate.gov/...
The import of Suskind 's conclusions is that political considerations -- not national security concerns -- were driving the torture policy .
That is the key point that should allow the Democrats to pursue this without being overly concerned about blowback .
Suskind even notes that this distinction is " important in framing " the issue .
The public still holds the decision to invade Iraq in disrepute , despite its acknowledgement of recent " success " in achieving a lessening of the violence via the Surge and the tactics employed in the Sunni Awakening .
An argument that torture was instigated as a means to justify the underlying lie -- a lie that most Americans recognize -- is an attractive frame for the Democrats as this issue continues to percolate .
Because every time a Republican protests that torture was justified to prevent another 9/11 , the inquiry automatically circles back to the invasion of Iraq , which most Americans now agree was a grotesque mistake .
The Senate Report and the McClatchy article are based in part on statements and interviews of Senior intelligence officials and a former Army psychiatrist .
There were two reasons why these interrogations were so persistent , and why extreme methods were used , " the former senior intelligence official said on condition of anonymity because of the issue 's sensitivity .
" The main one is that everyone was worried about some kind of follow - up attack ( after 9/11 ) .
But for most of 2002 and into 2003 , Cheney and Rumsfeld , especially , were also demanding proof of the links between al Qaida and Iraq that ( former Iraqi exile leader Ahmed ) Chalabi and others had told them were there . "
For the Democrats , the way to frame this going forward is to show that it was in fact the other way around .
Update : Now that I'm in the nosebleed section , please allow me to add Paul Krugman 's take :
Let ’s say this slowly : the Bush administration wanted to use 9/11 as a pretext to invade Iraq , even though Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11 .
So it tortured people to make them confess to the nonexistent link .
There ’s a word for this : it ’s evil .

One of the fallacies we 've seen since the recession started is that there would be some significant , rejuvenated interest in dialup Internet service -- because it 's a few bucks a month cheaper than DSL , and because it 's good enough for some people .
Well , that 's not what EarthLink , one of the top U.S. dialup ISPs , saw last quarter .
EarthLink announced today that it lost a net 160,000 consumer dialup subscribers during Q1 -- more than 9 % of its subscriber base -- finishing the quarter with 1.59 million subs .
( To put that in perspective , 1.6 million people activated new , $ 100 / month iPhones with AT&T last quarter . )
To be sure , EarthLink did experience a slower rate of subscriber decline than a year ago .
During Q1 ' 08 , EarthLink lost 256,000 net dialup subs , or a 9.8 % drop .
And gross customer growth -- 116,000 new sign - ups during Q1 '09 -- was flat with Q4 ' 08 , despite lower marketing spend .
But either way , there 's nothing here that supports the idea that there is any sort of broad movement to last decade 's technology .
Meanwhile , EarthLink is still making a profit while its business shrinks .
The company made $ 32.5 million on $ 199 million of revenue during Q1 .
OLYMPIA — Rep. Mary Helen Roberts wants to get the state tuned in and turned on about the need for new dope laws .
Possessing a little marijuana should be decriminalized for sure and maybe even legalized , contends the Lynnwood Democrat .
“ What harm would it do anybody if I grew a plant in a pot on my back deck , ” Roberts said this week .
Today , the woman some lawmakers teasingly call the Pot Queen will share her views in a podcast — or is that a potcast ? — hoping to ignite a dialogue on changing how the state deals with marijuana users .
“ We are not even having the conversation , ” she said .
“ It is going on but not everyone is engaged .
This budget crisis is engaging more of us . ”
She calculates millions of dollars can be saved and communities made safer if cops spend less time cracking down on marijuana smokers and more on capturing violent offenders .
And cash - depleted coffers of the state and counties might get a little boost from “ Mary Jane ” with properly crafted policies .
Legislation introduced in the House and the Senate in January sought to do that .
The bills made possession by adults of up to 40 grams — less than 1.5 ounces — of marijuana an infraction rather than a misdemeanor .
Those cited would face a $ 100 fine with the money going into health care funds .
The House bill never got a hearing , while the Senate version did n’t get a vote .
Sen .
Joe McDermott , D - Seattle , a sponsor of the Senate measure , said the state could save up to $ 7 million a year by not investigating and prosecuting thousands of possession cases .
“ We need to be smart about how we spend those resources and recognize what pot is and what it is n’t , ” he said , applauding Roberts for her planned podcast .
Roberts , 61 , said she inhaled while working in Olympia with a state commission dealing with women ’s issues in the 1970s .
So , too , did many of the staffers from the legislative and executive branches of government she hung out with .
“ It was a weekend , casual drug .
None of us moved on to harder things and none of us wound up in jail , ” she said , noting she stopped smoking long before becoming a mother .
She picked up the Pot Queen nickname in January when an e-mail she wrote to the author of the House bill became public .
Today , some colleagues pass by her desk mimicking the enjoyment of a joint .
“ Why are n’t we making possession of a small amount legal , ” she wrote to Rep. Dave Upthegrove , D - Des Moines .
“ I think the public is ready for this .
I know I am . ”
Rick Steves of Edmonds is past ready .
For a decade , the travel writer , whose work appears in The Herald , has talked of the need for marijuana law reforms .
Thursday he sent a letter to lawmakers iterating support for the ideas behind the legislation .
Part of his message was that backing decriminalization does not make one pro-drugs .
“ It ’s not an issue of being soft on drugs or hard on drugs .
It ’s a smart on drugs on policy , ” he said in an interview .
“ Eighty million Americans have tried it , including a president who enjoyed it , ” he said .

The big news here is that there are many Democrats who do n’t want to move in a conventional liberal direction and there some Republicans willing to work with them to create a functioning center .
These moderates  who are not a party , but a gang  seemed willing to seize control of legislation from the party leaders .
They separated themselves from both the left and right .
What we ’re seeing may be the formation of a regular gang system .
In the past , moderate gangs  like the judicial Gang of 14  have appeared or disappeared depending on the issue .
But exploding federal deficits are a galvanizing issue for those in the center .
Concern over these deficits will influence every piece of domestic legislation .
In the coming weeks and months , there will be housing legislation , another round of TARP bailouts , the budget debate , the health care and entitlement debates .
In each case , the Moderate Gangs will occupy the crucial ground , even if the Democrats do wind up with 60 Senate votes .
Barack Obama is not initiating events ( he ’s had surprisingly little influence on the stimulus bills ’ evolution ) .
But circumstances now present him with a precedent - setting moment of decision .
Does he embrace the Gang System and try to use it to create a new style of politics ?
Or does he remain an orthodox Democrat , deferring to the Old Bulls on legislation , enforcing party discipline and trying to pick off a Republican or two here and there to pass laws ?
The liberals already are mobilizing against the Moderate Gangs .
On Thursday , the liberal interest groups were intensively lobbying against the stimulus cuts .
But there ’s no way that Obama , who spent two years campaigning on postpartisan politics , can reject the single biggest manifestation of postpartisanship in the country today .
If he does that , his credibility will be shot .
Obama did n’t plan them .
He did n’t create them .
He is n’t yet leading them .
But the gangs could be the big new fact in domestic politics .
If nurtured and used creatively , they can be the lever by which Obama transforms the landscape of government and creates a broad postpartisan coalition .
We ’ll see if he seizes this opportunity , or whether it ’s just business as usual .
( CNN ) --
The Marine Corps has sacked four top officers of a California - based fighter squadron over the December crash of a fighter jet that slammed into a San Diego neighborhood , the service announced Tuesday .
Grace Yoon , 15 months , was killed after a military jet crashed into her home .
Deferred maintenance and faulty decisions by the pilot and squadron members with whom he was communicating on the ground contributed to the crash , a Marine Corps investigation concluded .
The commander of the squadron involved , its top maintenance officer and two others have been relieved of duty as a result of the investigation , and nine other Marines have received other disciplinary action , Maj. Gen. Randolph Alles said .
The jet crashed in the University City neighborhood of San Diego , about three miles short of the Miramar airfield .
Two adults and two small children from a Korean immigrant family were killed when the jet slammed into their house .
Watch what pilot said as plane had trouble »
The F / A - 18 Hornet crashed after " a succession of emergencies " that began with oil - pressure problems in its right engine during a flight off the Southern California coast , said Marine Col.
John Rupp .
That left the jet relying on its other engine , which previously had been giving mechanics electronic indications of a problem with its fuel - flow system , Rupp said .
Learn more about the jet »
Maintenance rules do n't require immediate repairs for the problem , he said , but the squadron flew the jet 146 times before it eventually crashed because its left engine was starved for fuel .
" The end result was that the squadron elected to fly an aircraft that had a degraded fuel system on the left side of the aircraft , " Rupp said .
" This is a critical point , and this was collectively questionable judgment on the part of the squadron 's maintenance department . "
The investigation criticized the pilot , who was being trained on the F / A - 18 , for not consulting a pocket checklist that outlined emergency procedures .
While controllers aboard the aircraft carrier that launched the jet urged the pilot to land at a nearby Navy airfield at North Island , squadron officers relied on " incorrect assumptions and inaccurate data " to guide him back to the plane 's base at the Miramar Marine Corps Air Station .
" No one in the ready room stated or understood the severity of the low fuel emergency at this time , " Rupp said .
" This is a critical moment , and this is collectively bad decision - making by the duty officer , by the operations officer and by the squadron 's commanding officer . "
The pilot waited " until the last possible moment " to eject from the plane , bailing out at an altitude of just 400 feet , and attempted to steer away from homes on the ground before the crash , Rupp said .
The pilot , whose name has not been released , is grounded pending further review , which Marine officers said was routine .
Alles said the officer was an " above - average " pilot who " just made a poor decision . "
Dong Yun
Yoon lost his wife , children and mother - in - law in the crash and another unoccupied house also was destroyed .
Yoon said the victims were his daughter Rachel , who was born less than two months before the accident ; his 15 - month - old daughter Grace ; his wife , Young Mi Yoon , 36 ; and her 60 - year - old mother , Suk Im Kim , who he said had come to the United States from Korea recently to help take care of the children .
In an emotional press conference in December , Yoon said he did not blame the pilot and urged the public to pray for him .
" I do n't blame him .
I do n't have any hard feelings .
I know he did everything he could , " Yoon said at the time .
" Please pray for him not to suffer from this accident , " Yoon said as he fought for composure .
" He is one of our treasures for the country . "

( Reuters ) - A new strain of flu has killed up to 68 people in Mexico and infected eight in the United States .
Although health officials have stopped short of declaring a pandemic , they expect to find more cases as the flu was spreading between people .
The severity and mortality rate of this new strain has not yet been scientifically established .
However , health experts have long warned that the next flu pandemic was overdue and urged countries around the world to prepare for the dramatic economic impact of such a catastrophe .
Below are estimates of economic costs of such a disaster :
* The World Bank estimated in 2008 that a flu pandemic could cost $ 3 trillion and result in a nearly 5 percent drop in world gross domestic product .
The World Bank has estimated that more than 70 million people could die worldwide in a severe pandemic .
* Australian independent think - tank Lowy Institute for International Policy estimated in 2006 that in the worst - case scenario , a flu pandemic could wipe $ 4.4 trillion off global economic output .
* Two reports in the United States in 2005 estimated that a flu pandemic could cause a serious recession of the U.S. economy , with immediate costs of between $ 500 billion and $ 675 billion .
One report , from the Congressional Budget Office , said hospitals would have difficulty controlling infection and might become sources for spreading the illness .
A second report by New Jersey - based WBB Securities LLC predicted a one - year economic loss of $ 488 billion and a permanent economic loss of $ 1.4 trillion to the U.S. economy .
* SARS in 2003 disrupted travel , trade and the workplace and cost the Asia Pacific region $ 40 billion .
It lasted for six months , killing 775 of the 8,000 people it infected in 25 countries .

The 50 - year - old mother who has spent £ 10,000 on surgery to look like her daughter
With their flowing blonde hair , hourglass figures and slender , toned legs , they could easily pass for twins .
Both look fabulous in their matching polka dot dresses and , as Janet and Jane Cunliffe happily recount , potential boyfriends often struggle to tell them apart .
Hardly surprising , as both weigh in at 8st and , save for a couple of inches in height ( at 5ft 6in , Jane is two inches taller ) and different eye colours ( Jane 's are brown , Janet 's are blue ) they are virtually identical .
But Janet and Jane are not twins .
They are n't even sisters .
They are mother and daughter .
And , in what many will see as a depressing indictment of today 's youth - obsessed society , Janet confesses to having spent more than £ 10,000 on plastic surgery in a desperate effort to bridge the 22 - year age gap between herself and her daughter .
Spot the difference : Janet , left , has spent £ 10,00 on plastic surgery to look like her daughter , Jane , right
In this image - conscious age , it is a bittersweet moment for many mothers to confront the fact that their daughter 's beauty eclipses her own .
It is a rite of passage that most women , while far from thrilled , are pragmatic enough to accept as a part of life .
But not 50 - year - old Janet .
She views the small matter of being in her sixth decade as a mere technicality .
She is amused and proud that friends jokingly refer to her and her daughter as Paris and Chantelle after the platinum blonde socialite and the equally platinum former Celebrity Big Brother contestant .
Some might see this as empowering for a woman who is well into middle age .
Others might take the view that it is contrary to the laws of Mother Nature - not that Janet has much truck with her anyway .
' Who would n't want to look like my daughter ? '
As she told the Mail this week : ' It might sound barmy that I had cosmetic surgery to look like my daughter , but she 's gorgeous .
Who would n't want to look like her ?
' The way I see it is that she got her looks from me in the first place - mine have just faded with age .
' Seeing how attractive Jane is made me want to get my looks back .
Now instead of mum and daughter we look more like twins .
I had good genes and good skin , but I needed a helping hand to make me feel better about myself . '
Certainly Janet was n't always such a head - turner .
Just a few years ago , she was a size 14 redhead and felt , she says , dowdy and unattractive .
Not , she insists , that she was ever vain .
' I did n't have time for vanity in my 20s as I was too busy bringing up Jane and her brother , Pete , ' she says .
' I did n't pay much attention to myself . '
That changed as she entered her 30s and became increasingly disconsolate with her changing figure .
' Like any woman who 's had children , gravity had started to take its toll on my breasts , ' she says .
Transformation : Janet was a size 14 redhead before undergoing surgery
They 'd been small to start with , but they had become saggy and it made me depressed .
So I booked in for a boob job .
At £ 4,000 my husband was n't best pleased , but I thought it was worth it , ' she says .
Alas , the new breasts were n't enough to save her marriage .
By the age of 40 , Janet , by then divorced , had moved to Spain .
Her new partner ( who she does n't want to name ) ran a swimming pool business and she took on secretarial work .
It was a fresh start , but one which was overshadowed when , in 2003 , an implant ruptured .
Restorative surgery was needed and Jane took the opportunity to go from a 34C to a DD .
' I thought if I was going to pay £ 2,500 I might as well go bigger , ' she says .
' I had n't been that pleased with them the first time round and when Jane came to visit I noticed my bust looked flat in comparison .
I wanted to give myself a boost . '
Despite the new breasts , Janet still felt she looked old before her time , and her relationship with her new partner was floundering .
' We 'd been living together for eight years , but it was n't working any more .
We argued non-stop and finally , in May last year , I decided to move back home to be with my daughter . '
Happily , Jane was more than willing to provide a berth for her mother while she found her feet .
Double take : Janet says she and daughter Jane , right , attract a lot of attention in bars and are regularly mistaken as sisters
' It was a tough time and I was a bit of a lost cause , ' says Janet .
' I did n't know who I was or where I belonged .
I had n't lived in Britain for so long that I did n't have any friends here .
It was a terrible time .
I knew I had to sort out my life . '
For Jane , a fun night out was an obvious way to cheer up her mum .
But well - meaning as it was , for Janet it only reinforced her feelings of inadequacy .
' I could n't find anything decent to wear - having lived in Spain , all I had were shorts , T - shirts and scruffy jeans .
I had nothing fashionable and could n't borrow anything from Jane because it was all too small .
' I remember looking at Jane and saying : " I wish I had your figure . "
I 'd had a body just like hers when I was younger but now I was just a blob .
' I began to see that in Spain I 'd been living the life of a pensioner and had forgotten how to make the most of myself .
I may have been pushing 50 , but I still wanted to live life to the full , and why should n't I ?'
' I envied Jane 's crinkle - free eyes and full lips '
Nonetheless , spending time with her daughter 's young friends made Jane examine her face and body more closely .
' Jane and her friends are so glamourous and gorgeous that I stood out like a sore thumb .
I felt like an old bag , ' she says .
' Jane told me not to be so self - critical , but I knew it was true . '
For Janet , socialising with friends her own age , starting a hobby or meeting new people were not going to help .
What was holding her back , she felt , was the face staring back in the mirror .
' I remembered only too well when I used to be a lovely looking girl , ' she says .
' I 'd seen all these older celebrities who somehow managed to turn back the clock and I wondered if I could do the same .
At the very least I wanted to give it a try . '
And so Operation Overhaul began .
' I ditched junk food and started to follow the same healthy diet as Jane .
' Out went potatoes and pasta and I started eating grilled chicken salad and green veg , ' says Janet .
' Jane did n't drink in the week , so I cut out white wine in the evening and stopped snacking between meals . '
Lookalike : Jane , right , said she does n't mind that her mother has copied her image
The effects were startling : in four months , Janet lost 2st and could slip into her daughter 's size 8 trousers .
For many fifty - something women , a healthy , slender figure would have been enough , but Janet was n't happy - dropping three dress sizes was all very well , but she still had the face of an older woman .
' I envied Jane 's crinkle - free eyes , full lips and luscious , long blonde hair , ' says Janet .
' I was desperate to look more like my daughter , but knew no wrinkle creams could ever wind back the clock that far . '
And so , perhaps inevitably , Janet started to consider the more drastic route of cosmetic surgery , initially conducting her research on the internet .
She stumbled across the website of Linda Briggs , a surgery aficionado who has her own business offering guidance and advice to others thinking of going under the knife .
' I decided to give her a ring and ended up speaking to Linda 's husband , Mike , ' says Janet .
' He said he'd just had his eyes done in Croatia and was thrilled with the results .
That was enough for me .
I booked pretty much straightaway .
' I had some savings and knew if I wanted to look more like Jane then I 'd have to get my eyes done first , and my nose . '
' Men kept doing a double take and asked if we were sisters '
None of this comes cheap , even if prices are competitive abroad .
By the time she had totted up her procedures , the bill came to £ 5,000 , including flights and board .
Then there was the little matter of telling her daughter .
' She was furious and begged me not to do it , ' says Jane .
' It was n't that she was cross with me for wanting to look like her , it was because she was worried about me having an operation . '
For some , this might have given serious pause for thought .
This was , after all , non-essential surgery , and did not come without risk .
But Janet was determined .
' I 'd made up my mind , ' she says .
' As far as I was concerned , I knew what I was doing .
I wanted to look younger and felt it would do wonders for my self - esteem . '
And so last September , she flew out to Croatia on her own to undergo the two - hour operation on her nose and eyes , which took place under local anaesthetic .
Like daughter , like mother : Janet , left , and Jane say they enjoy looking like one another
' I was a bit frightened , but not enough to put me off , ' she says .
' I just decided to put my trust in their hands .
It was n't pleasant , but I got through it .'
She returned a week later , bruised and bandaged , but euphoric after being told by the surgeon that the result would be good , a claim that seemed to be upheld when the bandages were removed , revealing a younger Janet who looked eerily like her daughter .
' I was delighted , ' she says .
' It was everything I 'd hoped for . '
There were , however , a number of other final touches if Operation Overhaul - or should that be Project Jane ?
- was to prove fully successful .
' I decided that my lips were too thin , so I had a series of injections to plump them up .
They cost around £ 300 but they make all the difference , ' she says .
Then there were the blonde hair extensions , at a cost of several hundred pounds , at a local salon .
And finally a new wardrobe of size 6 to 8 clothes .
The effect , it must be said , is certainly startling .
' The first time we went to a local wine bar , we were the centre of attention , ' says Janet proudly .
' Men kept doing a double take and all night people asked if we were sisters .
We both loved the attention . '
' I love us looking the same '
Just what must Jane really make of it ?
A family resemblance is one thing , but a mirror image when you look at the woman who gave birth to you is quite another .
And Jane has sometimes had to cope with the fact that some people think she is the ' older ' sister .
' It 's not because I look older than my years , but just that Mum looks unbelievably young for her age .
She looks better than Madonna at 50 , which is saying something .
' People ask if I mind that she 's transformed herself into me , but I could n't be more proud .
I 'm the one who helps her with her hair and clothes , so it 's down to me , too .
I can hardly accuse Mum of copying my looks when she gave them to me , can I ?
' Actually , I love us looking the same , we 're closer than ever and she 's the sister I always wanted and never had . '
Both ' girls ' insist there 's no jealousy .
' We 're both confident about our looks , ' says Jane .
' Men give me just as many compliments as Mum gets , so why would I feel jealous ?
' I do n't worry about introducing boyfriends to her .
I know they'd never get anywhere , even if they did make a move on her . '
In fact , while there have been no shortage of offers from toy boys , Janet is happy being single .
' It 's not a competition .
This has always been about my own confidence and self - esteem .
I have n't done this to get a man , I 'm happy spending time with my daughter and reliving my youth , thanks to my new look . '
The question , of course , is where will it all end ?
For now , Janet says : ' I think I 've had enough surgery .
I 've put myself through enough . . . unless I suddenly start to look really old overnight .'
BOGOTA — Miguel Caballero slides open a box of 9 mm bullets .
“ Choose one , ” he says to his employee Lizeth Castaneda .
He points his revolver at Castaneda 's abdomen and fires .
Seconds later , his victim giggles with relief .
This fear - inducing demonstration is actually a marketing tactic .
Caballero has shot at more than 100 people — many of them employees — in order to instill faith in his product : bullet - proof fashion .
Caballero , 41 , dresses presidents , government officials and their bodyguards , as well as businesspeople and celebrities , in discrete and stylish blazers , leather jackets and tuxedo shirts that can stop bullets shot from pistols and Mini Uzis .
Press reports refer to U.S. President Barack Obama , Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and Spain 's Prince Felipe as Caballero clients .
But do n't look for confirmation .
“ The clients can get hysterical , ” Caballero explains .
Photos of clients he is allowed to talk about line his office walls .
There 's Colombian President Alvaro Uribe and Defense Minister Juan Manuel Santos .
And , for the celebrity - inclined , there 's actor Steven Seagal , sporting one of three leather jackets designed for him by Caballero , along with two bullet - proof kimonos .
As his BlackBerry buzzes with orders from around the world , Caballero is uniquely positioned to understand the shifting security concerns of the rich and powerful .
His opened his business 16 years ago , hoping to fill what he perceived as a local need in a country that has been plagued by violence for half a century .
“ If the product functions in Colombia , it ’ll function in any part of the world , ” he says matter - of - factly .
As he speaks , Caballero pulls the bullet out of the heavy cotton jacket his employee wore during the bullet demonstration — it only passed through the first few protective sheets sewn in .
Caballero 's handiwork does n't come cheap : A bullet - proof polo shirt can go for $ 900 to $ 7,500 depending on the level of protection , and a leather jacket costs $ 2,900 .
Today , most of Caballero 's products will be shipped out of the country .
As security in Colombia has improved , domestic sales have plummeted while demand from abroad has skyrocketed : Exports now make up 92 percent of Caballero ' s sales .
His company now has 18 distributors , or “ VIP Offices , ” around the world , including ones in Beirut , Milan and Houston .
Russians flock to his London boutique in the posh Harrod 's department store , and politicians at risk of assassination put in custom orders in Johannesburg , according to Caballero .
While the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks prompted Europeans to join his client portfolio , nowhere has demand soared so much as in Mexico , where drug cartel wars have brought terrifying levels of violence .
“ Today , Mexico is a very important market for us , ” says Caballero , adding that it accounts for 30 percent of his company ’s exports .
In response to demand , Caballero even opened a boutique in an upscale neighborhood in Mexico City .
But a store 's success does n't always reflect levels of local violence .
“ In Hong Kong as such , there ’s no danger , ” he says , referring to the location of one of his new offices , which caters to wealthy businessmen .
“ But where they travel , yes , ” he says , citing the unpredictable security situation in nearby Malaysia and Indonesia .
According to Yuen Kee Wong , who is in charge of Caballero ’s distribution for most of Asia , Hong Kong is also the perfect market for Caballero because of the number of wealthy “ gadget - collectors , ” who are attracted to the novelty and design of Caballero 's offerings .
“ This is not just a protection item , but a luxury fashion item that is very attractive , ” Wong says from her Hong Kong office .
Caballero believes that what distinguishes his products is his simultaneous ability to cater to an individual ’s fashion sense , security needs and lifestyle .
There is no item too unorthodox for Caballero :
He has tailored anti-ballistic underwear for a Colombian prison guard and a bullet - resistant blanket .
At one point in his conversation , Caballero is momentarily distracted by a new patron .
“ Look ! ” he exclaims , showing an incoming email on his Blackberry screen .
It ’s an order for a princess of an Asian country who wants Caballero to make her a robe .
“ We ’ll make it beautiful ! ” he tells his staff .
And Caballero recently returned from India , where he is offering lightweight kurta pyjamas , traditional Indian cotton pants and tops .
He ’s also fielding orders from politicians for his version of the high - collared Nehru jacket , in anticipation of a desire for heightened security in the run-up to national elections starting in April .
The clothes work like this : Workers at sewing machines weave a nylon - polyester blend into flexible sheets to absorb the impact of a bullet .
The more sheets layered into a garment , the more protection the garment offers .
But while Caballero 's bullet - proof fashion may be the most attention - grabbing side of his company , bullet - proof vests make up much of his business .
Staff at several assembly lines complete orders for 36,000 bullet - resistant vests for the armed forces of two Latin American countries .
Vests for military and security forces make up 60 percent of Caballero 's sales .
In this field , Caballero says his products are superior because they are the only water - and fire - proof vests in the world .
These days , Caballero ’s company — which grossed $ 15 million last year — is growing so rapidly that he needs to expand .
A new facility under construction in Bogota 's northwest will eventually house 312 workers .
“ This , ” he says , casting his arm towards the empty factory — which will also include a showroom and ballistic testing range — “ is going to be a work of art . ”
Caballero plans to hang modern art installations throughout the plant .
How did he come up with the idea ?
He offers the same explanation as for all his other work : “ I have ideas that no one else has . ”

The BBC is receiving complaints about kids ' show host Cerrie Burnell , who was born with one hand .
BBC spokeswoman Katya Mira said the corporation has received at least 25 " official " complaints recently about Cerrie Burnell , new host of two shows on the BBC - run CBeebies television network , which is aimed at children younger than 6 .
The official complaints do not count the dozens of negative comments lodged in Internet chat rooms , Mira said .
In one chat room , a father lamented that Burnell being on the show forced him to have conversations with his child about disabilities .
However , there have also been messages of support for Burnell .
What do you think about the complaints ?
" We have also received 99 appreciations of her , " Mira said .
Burnell started as a presenter of the shows in late January after acting with theater companies in Manchester , England , and Brazil .
A BBC news release in January introducing Burnell made no mention of her disability , but a publicity photo showed the right sleeve of her sweater pulled up , showing her arm stops just below her elbow .
The issue has spurred a debate in England among newspapers , columnists and bloggers .
Burnell said she has heard the criticism and will not let it bother her .
' It can only be a good thing that parents are using me as a chance to talk disability with their children .
It just goes to show how important it is to have positive , disabled role models on CBeebies and television in general , " Burnell said .
Michael Carrington , BBC controller of CBeebies , said the company is standing by Burnell .
" Cerrie is warm and natural and we think that , in time , all moms and dads and children will love her as much as we do , " Carrington said .

In a not totally surprising -- yet still kind of striking -- turn of events , Microsoft is reporting that its sales have fallen for the first time in 23 years .
You read that right , 23 years .
According to numbers that the company has just released , sales fell 6 percent year - over - year , while overall net income dropped a staggering 32 percent .
Those numbers are significant , but what 's more telling is where those losses are coming from .
Namely ?
Netbooks .
Apparently , in the midst of a global downturn consumers really are buying cheaper , especially when it comes to tech , which puts a fairly significant crunch on Redmond 's bottom line .
A CNN reports suggests that the presence of Linux on those devices has contributed to the hurt here , but it 's more likely that the combo of a market still unwelcoming to Vista and the wide popularity of XP on the low - power systems has more to do with these dipping profit margins .
Oh , and that general , awful market depression .
Still , it should serve as some kind of wake up call to Microsoft that just being the biggest does n't guarantee that the money will keep rolling in the way it has in years past -- clearly the big picture is n't as sharp as it's always been .
Hey Windows 7 -- no pressure , right ?
We've tweaked some language in the post that made the situation sound more dire than intended .
Do n't worry everyone , we know Microsoft is n't going anywhere .

When Malayalam cinema lost its original flavour ,
directors like me also lost relevance - observed Venu Nagavally , the veteran actor and the director of the latest release ‘ Bharya Swantham Suhurthu ’ .
He was talking to the press as part of the promotion of his latest movie .
[ Malayalam cinema has lost its flavour – Venu Nagavally ]
A successful film maker goes with the times and tells stories which people want to hear .
A great film maker tells the story he wants to tell and gets people to come and watch .
Just because your movie flopped does not mean that “ original flavor ” is lost .
Also the new thing is “ original choice ” .
Venu Nagavally ’s new movie , though it has a story relevant to the times , has flopped .
According to one reviewer :
But it ’s the dull , predictable storyline and its unimaginative execution that makes the film an ordinary film .
Quite a few scenes into this documentary on morality , we can guess pretty easily , where the story is heading to .
And the script never surprises the viewer with some imagination or twists .
The preachy tone of the film and its disdain of anything modern could have been an okay one some two decades back , but it fails to make much sense now .
The visuals are quite ordinary and the music is jarring to the core , to say the least .
Having a great story is no longer sufficient .
You need to let go of the past , move from documentary style , and stop assuming the audience have not grown since Nagavalli ’s best days .
He added ” When I started my career in Malayalam as an actor , directors were much more powerful than those of these days .
And now the industry and actors have become too big which is leaving out small storytellers
like me ” .
While this is true to a certain extent with success of designer films from Shafi , it is no constructive if someone just whines about it .
We would think that a person like Venu Nagavalli would find a way out instead of running out to the mini-screen like Sreekumaran Thampi .
Just look Sreenivasan .
He has been in the industry for a long time and even now a movie written by him – Katha Parayumbol – runs to packed houses .
It is not that all Sreenivasan movies have run to packed houses ; people who saw Bhargava Charithram can vouch for it .
But still , like the story of Bruce and the spider , he keeps trying , adapting to the times .
There was another movie called Classmates which had a bunch of non-superstars and the movie ran , just on the strength of the story .
Venu Nagavally also said that it is no longer possible to make political films in Malayalam as no consistent political views are conveyed by the Parties .
‘ Every ideology has been affected with cancer and people no longer believe that any of Political outfits are ideally suited to rule ’ – adds Venu who had directed hit political films earlier like ‘ Lalsalaam ’ and ‘ Rekthasaakshykal Sindaabad ’ .
This is again part of what - I - did - was - great - mentality .
We are not sure if Mr. Nagavalli saw a movie called Arabikatha .
It was one of the best political movies to come in recent times – well made , well writen , and appropriate for the times .
People like Nagavalli need to stop crying and start being the change they want to see .
The 80s are gone ; now it is 2009 .
The US government , as part of its stimulus plan to revive the depression in the US economy , recently decided on including an amendment that imposes a ban on firms receiving government bailouts , from hiring workers from other countries .
Microsoft has recently been asked to remove foreign workers that are employed under the H - 1B Visa program , resulting in the software giant announcing that 5,000 jobs will be cut in the next six months ; including 1,400 immediately .
H - 1B visas are offered by the US government to enable international students and highly skilled international workers , from all over the world , or who are already living in the USA , the opportunity to live and work in America legally .
From the beginning , there has been criticism from various quarters , over the role of the H - 1B program in replacing US workers .
There were several instances of US staff being replaced with H - 1B workers .
The ploy employers used is to hire these H - 1B replacements from contract job shops .
This way the companies could claim that they had not applied for H - 1B visas , making it possible for them to legally replace their US staff .
Another complaint was that US Employers hired H - 1B workers because they pay significantly less than they would have to for US workers .
This cheap labor causes depression in the overall wage structure .
Currently , 65,000 H - 1B visas are granted by the US annually to Hi-technology workers from countries like China , India and Philippines .
The US government states that they are not against the H - 1B program , but it has to be used in the actual spirit of why it was started in the first place – to have alternatives for specialized workers when there is no availability in the US .
It was also clarified that since the 900 billion dollars for the stimulus plan is being paid by the American taxpayer , it is only fair that American workers are hired .
This decision for foreign countries could mean hundreds of thousands of foreign students studying in the US universities will not get employment and millions will be made jobless .
The US government is also planning on controlling outsourcing .
American firms that move their jobs to other countries will not be eligible for any tax breaks .
Obama , in his address said , “ We will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our tax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas . ”
This will affect more than 1,000 American firms that have over the years moved their jobs outside the country .
The government is doing away with a particular provision of the tax code where US companies pay lower taxes for profits earned from foreign countries .
There has been opposition for this tax code for a long time , as it was seen as an encouragement for companies to send their jobs abroad , when they rightfully belong to the American workers .
The government ’s aim through this move is to make outsourcing unattractive to companies in the US .
However , many believe that tax breaks when compared to savings through outsourcing do not stand a chance .
While the idea of tax breaks would certainly appeal to the US businesses , it would require a huge tax break to change the established trend of global outsourcing .
It would be highly unlikely for companies involved in significant outsourcing to take their businesses , and the related infrastructure and human - resource costs back onshore .
So , the impact of this move may be very little .
People who oppose this move say that this move will only hurt the US as outsourcing makes a lot of sense ; both economic and logical .
It is left to be seen what actually happens .
However , with Obama focusing on the revival of the US economy , this is the kind of positive reaction that Americans expect from their new President .

Dr Craig said restricting criticism undermined learning
The growing expectation placed on schools and parents to boost pupils ' self - esteem is breeding a generation of narcissists , an expert has warned .
Dr Carol Craig said children were being over - praised and were developing an " all about me " mentality .
She said teachers increasingly faced complaints from parents if their child failed a spelling test or did not get a good part in the school pantomime .
Schools needed to reclaim their role as educators , not psychologists , she said .
Dr Craig , who is chief executive of the centre for confidence and well - being in Scotland , was speaking at the Association of School and College Leaders conference in Birmingham .
Negative characteristic
She told head teachers the self - esteem agenda , imported from the United States , was a " a big fashionable idea " that had gone too far .
She said an obsession with boosting children 's self - esteem was encouraging a narcissistic generation who focused on themselves and felt " entitled " .
[ Schools ] are not surrogate psychologists or mental health professionals
Dr Carol Craig " Narcissists make terrible relationship partners , parents and employees .
It 's not a positive characteristic .
We are in danger of encouraging this , " she said .
" And we are kidding ourselves if we think that we are n't going to undermine learning if we restrict criticism .
" Parents no longer want to hear if their children have done anything wrong .
This is the downside of the self - esteem agenda .
" I 'm not saying it 's of no value but you get unintentional consequences . "
Parental responsibility Since 2007 , there has been a statutory responsibility on schools in England to improve pupils ' well - being and primary and secondary schools are increasingly teaching social and emotional skills .

Indeed it is possible that Ofsted inspectors will soon appraise schools ' performance in this area ; and well - being could be one of the measures used in the school report card system that the government wants to introduce .
But Dr Craig told head teachers that this was not the role of schools .
" Schools have to hold out that they are educational establishments , " she said .
" They are not surrogate psychologists or mental health professionals . "
Learning about feelings from a professional in a classroom did not send out a positive message , she added .
And she warned there was a danger the more schools taught emotional well - being , the less parents would take responsibility .
" We run the risk of undermining the family as the principal agent of sociability , " she said .

Sheesh !
Kids and their speed racers these days .
Actually , Oregon State Police say the drivers of six exotic sports cars stopped for racing along Oregon 18 near Grand Ronde this morning were all grown men , some in their late 40's , from Washington and Canada on an annual road trip .
And apparently one ticket was n't enough for one of the drivers .
Two hours after getting dinged near Grand Ronde , one of the same cars - a yellow Lamborghini -- was stopped again for racing into the Columbia River Gorge near Multnomah Falls .
" These were all $ 100,000 - or - more cars , " said State Police Sgt. Brad Hessel .
" One guy told us his Ferrari cost more than $ 400,000 .
It was pretty much a street - legal racing car . "
The first incident was like something out of a Vin Diesel flick .
About 11:15 a.m. , a driver on Oregon 18 called the State Police Northern Command Center to report about ten expensive , high - octane sports cars zooming past each other in no-pass zones that cut through the farmlands near Grand Ronde .
East of town , Senior Trooper David Peterson spotted five of the cars .
As he chased after them , a sixth exotic racer sped past his patrol car .
Peterson was eventually able to stop all six vehicles and cite their drivers for speed racing ( a $ 679 ticket ! ) .
Last year , a pack of drivers in exotic racers were caught racing near Bend , which holds an annual exotic car show in September , but Hessel said he did n't know if it was the same group .
Thursday morning , the drivers were cooperative and told Peterson that they were part of a pack of 20 similar race cars traveling together on an annual road trip .
" They said they had been down in California and they were on their homeward part of the trip , " Hessel said .
" They knew they were pushing the envelope .
I guess they 're pretty high - paid fellas .
They just accepted their citations and went on about their trip . "
But apparently one of them had no problem blowing about $ 1,000 on traffic tickets in a single day .
Two hours after getting pulled over outside Grand Ronde , the driver of a 2004 Lamborghini was caught going 90 in a 65 mph zone on Interstate 84 near Multnomah Falls , some 100 miles away .
Police say they have no doubt it was the same driver .
Same name .
Same shiny hood ornament with the Lamborghini raging - bull logo .
Same Alberta license plate : " BADBUL . "

It 's spring cleaning time , and while most of us are thinking of packing a way our winter linens and airing out our summer clothes , a historian at the Vatican has decided to drag out another mouldering old bit of cloth to dangle before us .
In a well - timed news story that could easily be confused with the plot of a Dan Brown novel , the Vatican newspaper has reported that a historian working in the Secret Archives has uncovered proof that the Shroud of Turin was guarded and venerated by the Knights Templar .
The earliest confirmed mention of the shroud , which is believed by some to be the burial cloth of Jesus , was in 1353 , when it was put on display in France .
It later passed into the hands of the Savoy family , and has been in the Royal Chapel of the Turin Cathedral since 1694 .
The cloth was largely thought to be unremarkable , until photographs in 1898 showed what appeared to be the full body of a crucified man .
Efforts to trace the history of the shroud back in time have proven difficult .
Before the cloth 's appearance in Turin in 1353 there are only sketchy references to other objects that may or may not be the same thing .
A cloth with an image of a man on in is mentioned in Constantinople in 1204 , and there are vague earlier references to something similar .
Luckily for us , samples of the cloth were permitted for radiocarbon analysis , and the results of three independent labs showed that the cloth was produced in the first part of the 14th century , which fits in quite well with the historical evidence .
So we all went home in our acid wash jeans to tease our hair and listen to Duran Duran and worry about what the Soviets were up to .
' Cause all this happened in the late ' 80s you see .
When it comes to the Shroud of Turin , we 've been there , done that .
But high tops and big hair are back in style , and so too is the Shroud of Turin .
The story of the latest archival research in the Vatican has been picked up by dozens of news agencies around the world , many of them reporting the document from 1287 which describes “ a long linen cloth on which was impressed the figure of a man ” .
Many of the reports take the angle that this document might provide an explanation for where the shroud supposedly had been hiding , since it was last seen in 1204 , but very few of them mention the radiocarbon dates that make it very unlikely that the shroud is an older than AD 1300 .
But radiocarbon dating does n't really work , does it ?
Yes it does .
No , it really does work , and I would put far greater faith in the workings of radiocarbon dating than I would in the likelihood of relics of biblical or historical characters happening to turn up on our doorsteps .
There is a lot of carbon in the world .
And it comes in three different flavours .
Most of it is plain old boring carbon - 12 .
About 1 % of it is carbon - 13 , which is so boring that we do n't even need to mention it .
An even tinier amount ( 0.0000000001 % ) is carbon - 14 , which is radioactive , and decays at a known rate .
Carbon - 14 is constantly being produced in the upper atmosphere by those crazy cosmic rays .
As long as you 're alive , you 're constantly exchanging carbon with the atmosphere ( aka " breathing " ) which means that you have the normal amount of carbon - 14 in your body .
When something dies , it stops exchanging carbon with the atmosphere , so the amount of carbon - 14 in its tissues decreases at a known rate .
The older something is , the less C14 it has , and by measuring the proportion of C14 left , we can tell how long ago it died .
The dating in 1988 was completed using the then relatively new technique of AMS ( Accelerator Mass Spectrometry ) dating , which was able to count the number of carbon - 14 atoms directly .
AMS dating made it possible to take extremely small samples sizes , only a few square centimetres of cloth , compared to the then standard technique which indirectly measured the radiation produced by decaying carbon - 14 atoms , and which would have required upwards of 500 cubic centimetres of cloth .
The results were calibrated by comparing them with the standard graph of tree - ring dates , which takes into account variations in the atmosphere over time , and produced an age that was 95 % likely to fall between 1290 and 1360 .
The farther a proposed date is away from that timeline , the less likely it is to be correct .
For each sample that is prepared for dating , they also prepare a specimen of known age , such as animal bones that have come from a historically dated shipwreck .
If there was contamination or something wrong with our understanding of radiocarbon dating , the date for the known date sample would come back wrong .
Archaeologists did not just test radiocarbon dating once and walk away from it .
Every single date is also performed alongside known age samples , so that the method is continually being checked and re-evaluated .
Every single published dated is double - checked this way , and if the known date sample was off , the entire run would be discarded , regardless of what the dates might have proved .
There are some people who continue to insist that the radiocarbon dating of the shroud must be wrong , by invoking explanations ranging from the fact that the wrong area was sampled ( despite being selected by textile specialists ) , and that something in the way the shroud was handled or treated could have resulted in contamination .
In the original 1989 report , the three different labs that had subsamples of the shroud tried a variety of pretreatment and cleaning methods .
No matter what pretreatment method was used , the dates all turned out to be the same .
The 1988 analyses were also performed alongside similar pieces of cloth and linen which had previously been dated using other methods .
All the dates came out correct .
The people who are asking us to accept that the radiocarbon dates are wrong are either asking us to reject radiocarbon dating altogether , or to believe that there is something special about the cloth of the Shroud of Turin that makes it unlike any other material ever dated .
The implied assumption is that there is just something inherently funky about Shroud Carbon .
After turning water into wine , and curing lepers , does n't sticking a few extra carbon - 14 atoms on a piece of cloth seem pretty easy ?
What 's the harm in all this ?
From one point of view , nothing , I suppose .
This is how science works , by constantly testing and retesting hypotheses .
It is extremely unlikely that that the Shroud of Turin does not date to the middle ages , because it is extremely unlikely that our understanding of how radioactive carbon - 14 atoms become incorporated into living tissues is wrong .
If it was wrong , it would mean we would have to seriously re-evaluate almost every single radiocarbon date ever performed .
The lab that I am familiar with has performed over 10,000 analyses in the last twenty years .
The amount of proof that would be required to overturn such an accepted record would have to be extraordinary .
The fact that radiocarbon dating can withstand such scrutiny today is proof of its validity , and of the success of the scientific method .
So we can say as scientists , go ahead , hit radiocarbon dating with your best shot .
And it will withstand the blow , almost certainly .
Because if it does n't , 50,000 years of human history would have to be rewritten , or at least re-examined .
Every now and then , there are problems with how radiocarbon dates have been performed .
Filtering samples ensures that only well - preserved organic molecules or analyzed , but the filters ended up contaminating the samples with modern carbon .
These problems were detected by comparison with known - age samples , and the method was fixed .
Early on , archaeologists and scientists discovered that the production of C14 has n't been constant over the earth 's history , introducing the added complication of having
to calibrate all reported dates against a sequence of known - age tree ring dates .
So in many ways , I agree with the head of the Oxford lab , who has allowed further tests to be conducted , to determine if sources of contamination were possible .
As far as I know , the tests to date have only supported the original date .
If people have several hundred dollars to throw around on some spare radiocarbon dates , it 's not up to me to suggest that they might have a
better use for their money .
What I do object to is that every time the Shroud of Turin is dragged out of its dusty box and trotted before us , the media fail to take a critical , scientific view .
It is not up to us to decide whether we " believe in " the Shroud .
It should not be the conversation starter between believers and non-believers that it has been .
As Charles Greenia said : " if someone has based their faith in Jesus on the presumed legitimacy of the shroud , then there is something profoundly flawed about their understanding of their faith . "
The first thought that I had upon reading the Vatican report of the knight 's account of seeing an object like the Shroud was that it might attest to the fact that such relics were relatively common during the later middle ages .
It is not possible that the idea of of a shroud with a picture of a person on it had already been an " urban legend " of sorts by the time that the forgers created the Shroud of Turin in the early 1300s ?
This possibility has not been considered by any other source .
It 's time for the Shroud of Turin to go back in the box .
There are plenty of other scientific and historical mysteries that deserve our attention , and plenty of other dirty laundry waiting to be aired .

I 'm getting lots of emails that Hulu is now carrying the entire Cosmos series ( though , as far as I know , Hulu is still only available in the US ) .
That 's very cool ; Cosmos was groundbreaking and still stands today as perhaps the greatest science / astronomy TV documentary ever made .
If you watch the standard astronomy documentary these days , it 's all fast cuts and tons of information thrown at you , and in my opinion the average viewer walks away with nothing .
Cosmos is slower paced , but fascinating , and Sagan took care to make everything fit in such a way that by the end all this stuff makes sense .
You have a more complete idea of how science works , and how all the puzzle pieces fit together .
I would strongly urge everyone to watch the series , especially if you have curious kids .
Sagan influenced a whole generation of today 's astronomers -- including me -- and he can still inspire a new one , too .
March ' middle ground ' hearing will probe for Bush admin abuses David Edwards and Rachel Oswald
Published : Wednesday February 25 , 2009
Print This Email This Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy announced today he will hold a hearing next week to examine options for forming a nonpartisan commission to look into past national security polices and abuses of the Bush administration .
In remarks on the Senate floor late this morning Leahy ( D - Vt ) announced his hearing " Getting to the Truth Through a Nonpartisan Commission of Inquiry , " which will be held at 10 a.m. , Weds , March 4 and webcast live online .
" When historians look back at the last eight years , they will evaluate one of the most secretive administrations in the history of the United States , " Leahy said in remarks provided by his office .
" We also know that the past can be prologue unless we set things right .
The last administration justified torture , presided over the abuses at Abu Ghraib , destroyed tapes of harsh interrogations , and conducted ' extraordinary renditions ' that sent people to countries that permit torture during interrogations . "
" Nothing has done more to damage America 's standing and moral authority than the revelations that , during the last eight years , we abandoned our historic commitment to human rights by repeatedly stretching the law and the bounds of executive power to authorize torture and cruel treatment , " Leahy said .
Leahy has suggested an independent panel to focus on national security and executive power as related to counterterrorism efforts .
The senator said he has begun to speak with other members in Congress , outside groups and experts , and officials in the White House about the proposal .
He called his commission a " middle ground " for both sides of the aisle to meet in .
" Such a commission 's objective would be to find the truth .
People would be invited to come forward and share their knowledge and experiences , not for the purpose of constructing criminal indictments , but to assemble the facts , to know what happened and to make sure mistakes are not repeated , " Leahy said .
" While many are focused on whether crimes were committed , it is just as important to learn if significant mistakes were made , regardless of whether they can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous jury to be criminal conduct .
We compound the serious mistakes already made if we limit our inquiry to criminal investigations and trials . "
The New York Times reported earlier this week that support is growing for some sort of investigation into Bush administration abuses .
Though Leahy stressed that his commission would not be about just prosecuting criminal cases , Glenn Greenwald speculated that the presence of Sen.
Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island on any fact - finding war - crimes commission might result in prosecutions anyway .
Whitehouse is on both the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committee .
" Critically , he is also a former federal and state prosecutor and thus instinctively considers lawbreaking to be wrong no matter who is doing the lawbreaking , " writes Greenwald .
" His genuine passion to investigate these crimes is reflected in several speeches he has given demanding that these crimes not be " papered over . "
The senator from Vermont first discussed a non-partisan commission of inquiry in a speech at Georgetown University on Feb .
9 .
" There has been discussion , and in some cases disagreement , on how best to do this , " said Leahy of any investigation into past Bush administration abuses .
" There are some who resist any effort to investigate the misdeeds of the recent past .
Indeed , some Republican Senators tried to extract a devil 's bargain from Attorney General Holder - a commitment that he would not prosecute for anything that happened on President Bush 's watch .
That is a pledge no prosecutor should give , and Eric Holder did not .
Congress has already passed laws granting immunity to those who facilitated warrantless wiretaps and conducted cruel interrogations . "

Premature ejaculation can be distressing for couples A spray can help men with premature ejaculation problems prolong the length of time they have sex by six times .
Men who used the treatment five minutes before having intercourse extended their love - making from half a minute to almost four minutes , trials showed .
The spray , developed at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast , contains local anaesthetics that numb the penis .
A British Journal of Urology International study says it could be available in the next couple of years .
Up to 40 % of men experience premature ejaculation at some time in their lives , experts estimate .
It improved both sexual performance and sexual satisfaction
Lead researcher Professor Wallace Dinsmore
It is difficult to have an exact idea of the rate because there is still embarrassment about discussing sex lives and the definition of what constitutes a premature climax does vary .
For some 10 minutes in the sack may be enough , but for others intercourse lasting less than 20 minutes may be unsatisfactory .
In the study , the researchers looked at 300 men who regularly had difficulty lasting for more than a minute during love - making .
Most of the men had tried other treatments before , the most common being oral antidepressants .
Every time they had intercourse during the three - month study period , each couple measured the time to ejaculation with a stopwatch .
Sex delay
The men who tested the spray , called PSD502 , were able to last 6.3 times longer on average .
In comparison , men who tested a " dummy " spray containing no drug lasted only 1.7 times longer .
There are treatments and training techniques that can help
Peter Baker of the Men's Health Forum PSD502 helped 90 % of the men enjoy sex for up to four minutes , where they had previously only lasted for seconds .
And there was minimal transfer of the spray to the partners , meaning the men did not have to use a condom for this reason alone .
Lead researcher Professor Wallace Dinsmore said : " Premature ejaculation can be a very distressing condition for men and can cause distress , frustration and make them avoid sexual intimacy .
" Our study shows that when the PSD502 spray was applied to the man 's penis five minutes before intercourse it improved both sexual performance and sexual satisfaction , which are key factors in treating premature ejaculation . "
Peter Baker of the Men's Health Forum said the findings were welcomed .
" Premature ejaculation is a very significant problem for lots of men that is hardly talked about and that needs to change .
" There are treatments and training techniques that can help .
It is important that new treatments are looked at and that men are encouraged to seek help . "
Paula Hall , a counsellor for Relate , said : " This might particularly help men who have problems with premature ejaculation related to anxiety .
" It could help build their confidence , although the root cause of the anxiety would still need addressing . "

Matthew Kafagolis and Ethan Kirkwood , the alleged perpetrators in the anti-gay crime that took place on or near University of Cincinnati ’s campus , are now being charged with two counts of misdemeanor assault each , according to the Hamilton County Clerk of Courts ’
Web site .
The charges were refiled as misdemeanors against the alleged perpetrators on March 19 , and March 20 , respectively .
The original charges these individuals faced were felonious assault .
A misdemeanor charge carries a maximum penalty of less than a year in jail .

A team led by an Indiana University astronomer has found a sample of massive galaxies with properties that suggest that they may have formed relatively recently .
This would run counter to the widely - held belief that massive , luminous galaxies ( like our own Milky Way Galaxy ) began their formation and evolution shortly after the Big Bang , some 13 billion years ago .
Further research into the nature of these objects could open new windows into the study of the origin and early evolution of galaxies .
John Salzer , principal investigator for the study published today in Astrophysical Journal Letters , said that the 15 galaxies in the sample exhibit luminosities ( a measure of their total light output ) that indicate that they are massive systems like the Milky Way and other so - called " giant " galaxies .
However , these particular galaxies are unusual because they have chemical abundances that suggest that very little stellar evolution has taken place within them .
Their relatively low abundances of " heavy " elements ( elements heavier than helium , called " metals " by astronomers ) imply that the galaxies are cosmologically young and may have formed recently .
The chemical abundances of the galaxies , combined with some simple assumptions about how stellar evolution and chemical enrichment progress in galaxies in general , suggest that they may only be 3 or 4 billion years old , and therefore formed 9 to 10 billion years after the Big Bang .
Most theories of galaxy formation predict that massive , luminous systems like these should have formed much earlier .
If this overall interpretation proves correct , the galaxies may allow astronomers to investigate phases of the galaxy formation and evolution process that have been difficult to study because they normally occur at such early times in the Universe , and therefore at very large distances from us .
" These objects may represent a unique window on the process of galaxy formation , allowing us to study relatively nearby systems that are undergoing a phase in their evolution that is analogous to the types of events that , for most galaxies , typically occurred much earlier in the history of the Universe , " Salzer said .
The discoveries are the result of a multi-year survey of more than 2,400 star - forming galaxies called the Kitt Peak National Observatory International Spectroscopic Survey ( KISS ) .
The survey was designed to collect basic observational data for a large number of extragalactic emission - line sources .
Additional rounds of follow - up spectroscopy for the sources discovered in the initial survey led to the discovery of the 15 luminous , low - abundance systems .
" The reason we found these types of galaxies has to do with the unique properties of the KISS survey method , " Salzer said .
" Galaxies were selected via their strong emission lines , which is the only way to detect these specific galaxies . "
Previous surveys done by others have largely missed findings these unusual galaxies .
While the hypothesis that these galaxies are cosmologically young is provocative , it is not the only possible explanation for these enigmatic systems .
An alternative explanation proposes that the galaxies are the result of a recent merger between two smaller galaxies .
Such a model might explain these objects , since the two - fold result of such a merger might be the reduction of metal abundances due to dilution from unprocessed gas and a brief but large increase in luminosity caused by rampant star formation .
As a way to distinguish between these two scenarios , Salzer and his team intend to request observing time on NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope to use high - resolution imaging to determine whether or not the systems might be products of merging .

Eugene Robinson - April 21 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
It 's hard to argue with the results thus far from President Obama 's " no drama " approach to campaigning and governing , but I think he should learn to chew a little scenery when the occasion demands .
Theatricality is one of the weapons in any leader 's arsenal , and a well - timed glower or growl can have more impact than a sheaf of position papers .
Obama 's critics are upset that at the recent Summit of the Americas , held in Trinidad and Tobago , he treated his fellow leaders from around the hemisphere as peers .
Obama 's collegial attitude was , indeed , a break from tradition -- and was long overdue .
Nothing would have been gained by barking orders at our neighbors and reinforcing the old image of insufferable yanqui arrogance .
There were a couple of moments at the summit , however , when Obama would have been right to throw off a little heat .
One was his encounter with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez , whose public persona is the polar opposite of Obama's .
Chavez is all theater , all the time .
He made the most of his introduction to the new American leader , enfolding him in an all - smiles handshake and presenting him with a book that harshly indicts the long , painful history of U.S. intervention in Latin America .
Any idea that Chavez is some sort of threat to the United States is absurd .
It 's hard to see his fiery anti-American rhetoric as anything more than performance art , given that he has been scrupulously careful to avoid even the slightest disruption of the U.S. - Venezuela economic relationship .
Venezuela owns Citgo , among other concerns , and is a reliable supplier of oil to the thirsty U.S. market .
It should also be noted that Chavez has acquired his extraordinary executive powers -- he obviously wants to be president - for - life -- through the ballot box .
Americans may not like him , but Venezuelans do -- a majority of them , at least .
However , it 's impossible to overlook his anti-democratic methods of silencing his critics and neutralizing any potential opposition .
Even though he uses Venezuela 's oil to bolster the Castro regime in Cuba , Chavez is hardly a by - the - book socialist .
He 's more of an old - style Latin American strongman , a caudillo , and that 's no model for the 21st century .
Chavez can be charming .
But when Obama shook the man 's hand , he should have telegraphed clearly , through posture , expression and language , that he was not amused .
Chavez 's gift of the book was meant to affront , not to enlighten , and I would have advised Obama to reciprocate in kind .
The other moment for presidential theatrics was Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega 's 50 - minute speech excoriating , yes , the long and sordid history of U.S. meddling in Latin America .
Asked later about Ortega 's peroration , Obama replied curtly that " it was 50 minutes long . "
Obama was correct not to walk out on the speech .
But as was the case with Chavez 's tendentious present , Ortega 's speech was intended as a slap .
When Obama spoke later , he should have prefaced his promising call for an " equal partnership " with other countries in the hemisphere with some strong pushback against those who would rather relive the insults of the past than move forward .
Granted , the history of U.S. involvement in Latin America is pretty sordid .
And granted , Obama made clear that he intends no abdication of American leadership , but rather a new atmosphere of mutual respect .
Most of the assembled heads of government -- including Presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil and Felipe Calderon of Mexico , leaders of Latin America 's two biggest economies -- responded to Obama 's initiative graciously and with an eye toward the future .
Chavez , Ortega and a few others , however , made a show of being rude .
A flash of presidential anger from Obama would have been in order .
My argument is n't that Obama should try to be someone he 's not .
It 's that he 's declining to use one of the tools at his disposal .
As public anger over the U.S. bank bailouts was rising , a well - timed burst of presidential outrage might have allowed him to get out in front of it .
Obama was right to show respect for the leaders of neighboring countries big and small at the Summit of the Americas .
Those who were not gracious enough to show respect for him deserved to be given -- metaphorically , of course , and in the spirit of hemispheric cooperation -- the back of the presidential hand .

Last week , I spent a few pleasurably - languid hours reading Neil Gaiman ’s “ The Graveyard Book . ”
Gaiman ’s wonderful tale of a young boy – Nobody Owens – who is nurtured and protected by the ghostly denizens of a graveyard , transported me into another world , and made me contemplate about life , death and the afterlife .
I had experienced the same feelings once before .
That was while reading Emily Dickinson ’s “ Because I could not stop for Death . ”
We paused before a house that seemed A swelling of the ground ;
The roof was scarcely visible , The cornice but a mound .
Since then ’tis centuries ; but each Feels shorter than the day I first surmised the horses ’ heads
Were toward eternity .
( Lines 13 - 20 )
Graveyards are oases of tranquility in this chaotic world .
They are places where some people finally find – in Earth ’s welcoming bosom – the peace and solitude they craved for their entire lives .
Is there really an afterlife ?
No one really can tell for sure .
But it sure would be great if there were one .
Here are a few images inspired by the evocative imagery that Gaiman conjures up in his book .

Revolution # 70 , November 26 , 2006
Pat Tillman Family Attacked for Pursuing the Truth ... and Not Being Christians
Pat Tillman was a former NFL football player who joined the U.S. Army Rangers in 2002 .
When he was killed in Afghanistan in 2004 , the Pentagon and the Bush regime seized on his death to build patriotic support for the war , and military and political officials appeared with the Tillman family at the funeral .
But the official story released to the press and told to the Tillman family — that Pat had been killed by “ enemy fire ” — was a lie .
In fact he had been killed by “ friendly fire ” from Rangers in his own unit .
( See Revolution , November 5 , 2006 , “ Kevin Tillman and the Killing Lies of the U.S. Army . ” )
After the Tillman family continued to press for the truth the Army finally released thousands of pages of heavily censored documents on their investigations , which have allowed the family and reporters to piece together some of what occurred .
In July of 2006 , ESPN.com ran a 3 - part series about the death of Pat Tillman which revealed how military officials have attacked the Tillman family — not only for pursuing the truth about what happened , but because they are not Christians .
Lt. Col. Ralph Kauzlarich , the Army Ranger officer who commanded Pat Tillman ’s regiment in Afghanistan , conducted the second Army investigation into his death .
He told ESPN , referring to the Tillman family , “ I do n’t know , these people have a hard time letting it ( their son ’s death ) go .
It may be because of their religious beliefs . ”
Kauzlarich said during his investigation into Tillman ’s death he learned that Kevin Tillman , Pat ’s brother and fellow Army Ranger who was a part of the battle the night Pat Tillman died , objected to the presence of a chaplain and the saying of prayers during a repatriation ceremony in Germany before his brother ’s body was returned to the United States .
Referring to this , Kauzlarich said , “ When you die , I mean , there is supposedly a better life , right ?
Well , if you are an atheist and you do n’t believe in anything , if you die , what is there to go to ?
Nothing .
You are worm dirt .
So for their son to die for nothing , and now he is no more — that is pretty hard to get your head around that .
So I do n’t know how an atheist thinks .
I can only imagine that that would be pretty tough . ”
Then when asked about what he thought might placate the family , Kauzlarich said , ‘ You know what ?
I do n’t think anything will make them happy , quite honestly .
I do n’t know .
Maybe they want to see somebody ’s head on a platter .
But will that really make them happy ?
No , because they ca n’t bring their son back . ’ ”
ESPN quotes Mary Tillman , Pat ’s mother , responding to Kauzlarich ’s comments , saying : “ Well , this guy makes disparaging remarks about the fact that we ’re not Christians , and the reason that we ca n’t put Pat to rest is because we ’re not Christians …
Oh , it has nothing to do with the fact that this whole thing is shady .
But it is because we are not Christians …
Pat may not have been what you call a Christian .
He was about the best person I ever knew .
I mean , he was just a good guy .
He did n’t lie .
He was very honest .
He was very generous .
He was very humble .
I mean , he had an ego , but it was a healthy ego .
It is like , everything those [ people ] are , he was n’t . ”
As executive officer for the Ranger regiment in Afghanistan , Kauzlarich was ultimately responsible for command decisions in the area at the time of Pat ’s death .
He is also the officer who conducted the second Army investigation into the killing .
According to Army documents obtained by ESPN , the Army officer who conducted the first investigation believed that some of the shooters who killed Tillman “ could be charged for criminal intent ” and several had demonstrated “ gross negligence .
In Kauzlarich ’s investigation , Rangers were allowed to change their stories and only minor punishments were handed out .
Kauzlarich , who was supposed to be investigating and finding out what happened and the circumstances around the death , told ESPN.com that he thought the Army had found out who actually had killed Tillman but that he had never found out !
And he said , “ You know what ?
I do n’t think it really matters …
I had no issue on not finding a specific person responsible for doing it . ”
ESPN said Kauzlarich told them he was confident that the investigation would not result in criminal charges — and that investigators would not still be examining the incident at all if it were not for Tillman ’s NFL celebrity .
This is a particularly twisted comment , given how the Bush administration and the U.S. Army exploited Pat Tillman ’s celebrity to portray him as a war hero and to build support for the U.S. occupation of Afghanistan and Iraq .
Pat ’s younger brother Richard Tillman told ESPN about hearing politicians and military men talking at the memorial in front of nationwide TV cameras about Pat ’s death , “ I remember not believing the story of him running up a mountain , screaming his head off .
.. But at the same time , nothing made sense because you just are told that your brother is dead .
At the time , you are not going to piece anything together .
And I think that is what the military actually plans on because they have seen the way people are when they lose a loved one , and they can basically tell them anything and they are not going to pick up on it . ”
And after listening to officials talk about Pat being with God , Richard spoke at the memorial and said , “ Pat is n’t with God .
He ’s fucking dead .
He was n’t religious .
So thank you for your thoughts , but he ’s fucking dead . ”
These kind of virulent attacks on the Tillman family are not surprising given the presence of Christian fascist forces in the U.S. military , including among high ranking officers .
People may remember how in 2003 U.S. Lt. General Jerry Boykin went around the country delivering a talk where he showed slides of Osama bin Laden , Saddam Hussein and North Korea ’s Kim Jung
Il and then said : “ Why do they hate us ? ”
The answer to that is because we ’re a Christian nation .
We are hated because we are a nation of believers . ”
Boykin then went on to say that “ the enemy ” was not any one of these individuals but that “ The enemy is a guy named Satan .
Satan wants to destroy this nation .
He wants to destroy us as a nation and he wants to destroy us as a Christian army .
I ’m here on a recruiting trip .
I ’m asking you to join this army . ”
Boykin also said that George Bush was “ in the White House because God put him there for such a time as this . ”
And it was after this that Donald Rumsfeld promoted Boykin to deputy undersecretary of defense .
In an article posted on truthdig.com titled “ Playing the Atheism Card Against Pat Tillman ’s Family , ” Stan Goff says that Mary Tillman , Pat ’s mother , showed him a page from Pat ’s journal when he was 16 years old .
Goff says : “ It was Pat ’s reflection on why he had decided , once and for all , that he did n’t need organized religion .
The entry was motivated by Pat ’s grief at the death of an old family cat .
Pat was n’t comfortable with the idea that one could love another creature that was being excluded from the bargain in the afterlife .
He and his brothers grew up between a river and the mountains , where they roamed countless miles and delighted in the ceaseless interplay of geography , climate , flora and fauna .
In his journal entry , Pat speculated about this singular universality , and made up his mind that one did n’t need some anti-material monarchy buzzing with angels to accommodate himself to mortality . ”

The UK must distance itself from American foreign policy if Pakistani youths are to be prevented from growing up hating Britain , according to the government 's social cohesion minister .
The comments by Sadiq Khan , who has just returned from a fact - finding trip to Pakistan , follow the arrests of 12 men - 10 of whom were Pakistani nationals - in the north - west of England last week on suspicion of planning a terror attack .
They are likely to be given short shrift from Number 10 , which has been keen to ally itself to the Obama administration .
Earlier this month Gordon Brown stressed the two allies were united in their fight against terrorism in Pakistan .
But Khan , London 's first Muslim MP , said the UK must differentiate itself from the US after attending meetings at universities in Pakistan .
" I listened to the anger and pain over the challenges that young people growing up in Pakistan face , including the anger and frustration over US drone attacks , " he said .
The attacks by unmanned US drones have provoked fury in Pakistan , where scores of militants have been killed in the country 's remote border regions , along with innocent civilians .
" The anger and frustration at the drone attacks was huge , " Khan said .
" The view they [ the students ] had was that the UK was somehow responsible for this .
They have n't understood this was purely a US matter .
They lumped us together with the US , which to me is a poison .
It demonstrates to me we have a big problem . "
Khan , whose parents are from Pakistan , suggested the UK should look to reach out to disaffected Muslim youths by emphasising the close links between the two countries .
" Much of the Pakistani population does n't realise the good we are doing , " Khan said : the UK is to double aid to Pakistan to £ 180 m by 2011 .
Crucial to winning hearts and minds , Khan said , was dismantling the perception that the US and the UK were one and the same over foreign policy .
Acknowledging the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq had mobilised Muslim opinion against the UK , Khan said : " Because of things that happened in 2003 , there is an uphill battle .
We need better to explain that there has been a distinct change in UK foreign policy .
" For example , this month the last troops will come home from Iraq : that 's very different from the US .
The drone attacks are US , not UK ; our development policy does n't have the strings that come with US aid . "
Khan 's comments come as ministers seek to increase the numbers of security officials in Pakistan to help in vetting those applying for visas to Britain .
At present there are fewer than 10 security service officers assessing the backgrounds of more than 20,000 applications a year .
" At present , we are reliant on a small number of officials who do the ground work ; that is reliant on the Pakistani government giving us what it knows .
That should improve in the near future , and can be done with the co-operation of Pakistan , " a Home Office source said .
Government figures show that 42,292 student visas were issued to Pakistanis between April 2004 and April 2008 .
The LGM 2009 has been the fourth annual worldwide meeting of teams developing open source graphics applications .
Designers , graphic artists and many other people involved in print production and / or web development had a good time meeting the developers one to one .
It has been a tremendous success and we now look forward to the fifth edition of LGM which will take place in May 2010 in Brussels .
Further details will be announced on this website in a few weeks , so stay tuned !
This years edition has been preceded by LGM 2006 in Lyon , France , LGM 2007 in Montreal , Canada and LGM 2008 in Wroclaw , Poland .

From the ' networking news ' files :
Check Point ( Nasdaq : CHKP ) has completed its acquisition of Nokia 's security appliance business , nearly four months after the deal was first announced in December of 2008 .
Nokia and Check Point had been partners in the security appliance business for the past 12 years .
With the deal complete it means that Check Point now has a bigger appliance story to tell and can sell Nokia appliances running Check Point 's firewall and security software .
Check Point has also indicated that it plans to expand the Nokia business and its own with a new line of all inclusive IP security appliances .
" Check Point now leads the security appliance market with an unprecedented variety of security solutions , " said Through the acquisition , we 'll be able to better meet customers ' needs and preferences with the latest security software on the leading hardware platforms , " Gil Shwed , chairman and chief executive officer at Check Point said in a statement .
" Our unique Software Blade architecture allows customers to select the exact security protections they need for a given environment , and our comprehensive line of appliances lets customers deploy their custom gateway on the hardware of their choice . "
Check Point has claimed that Nokia had some 220,000 security appliance installations that will now become part of Check Point 's customer base .
In my view , this is a good thing for Check Point and may well be the catalyst that helps to propel their share and market stature forward .
Check Point has long been though off as mostly a software vendor in the enterprise space with its security application able to run on hardware from various vendors .
I do n't see that changing with the Nokia deal , but the mix could change with more deployments on Check Point branded hardware as time progresses .
Here 's an example of their latest tactic as a GOP minion confronts Blue Dog Rep. Chris Carney on the street .
It 's just about as stupid and pointless as you 'd expect from the Republican brain trust :
The National Republican Congressional Committee is sending out video " trackers " to ask provocative questions of Democratic members of Congress .
The trackers , who are congressional committee staffers , were earlier reported by Congress Daily , a specialty publication distributed largely on Capitol Hill .
NRCC spokesman Paul Lindsay told McClatchy that Democratic complaints were " whining , " adding that " The modern - day world of campaign politics demands that we track our opponents ' steps and missteps .
We have nothing to hide when it comes to asking tough questions , but it appears that Democrats do when it comes to answering them . "
The NRCC does n't require its questioners to identify themselves as partisans on grounds that anyone has a right to approach a member of Congress and ask a question .
It would n't say how many lawmakers have been questioned : A GOP statement said that , " Videos are posted on a case - by - case basis . "
Republicans say they 're simply trying to hold Democratic lawmakers accountable .
Since the Internet became an important part of campaigns , it 's not been unusual for candidates of any party to be tracked by their opponents .
" We 've had trackers following us around before , but they were there to observe , " said Andrew Stoddard , communications director for Rep. Dina Titus , D - Nev. , who recently was ambushed by a GOP interviewer .
" What they 're doing now , " Stoddard said , " takes things to a whole new level . "
In case of making a tatoo one Russian proverb comes very handy .
The proverb we are talking about is ” you must measure seven times before you start cutting ” , in English there are also plenty of alike , ” score twice before you cut once ” , for example , though in Russian language they warn to think seven times before acting .
That ’s especially important in regard of tatoo , to consider the good artist with big experience and rich portfolio .
Well , still some find it easier not to think seven times .
Now their tatoos cause lot of laughs when are seen by someone for the first time .

LONDON , April 30 ( Reuters ) - Britain wants to get involved in protecting oil supplies from Iraq after its combat role there comes to an end , Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Thursday .
Brown was speaking after talks in London with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki coinciding with the formal end of combat operations for British troops in southern Iraq .
“ We hope to sign an agreement with the Iraqi government about the future role that we can play in training and in protecting the oil supplies of Iraq and that will be an agreement between our two governments rather than any new United Nations resolution , ” Brown told a news conference .
He said he believed the proposed agreement would go to the Iraqi parliament in the next few weeks .
Iraq produces nearly 2 million barrels of oil a day and sits on the world ’s third - largest proven reserves .
Maliki was in London with senior Iraqi officials and international business leaders to attend a conference exploring possible investment deals as his country slowly emerges from six years of conflict .
Representatives from around 250 companies , from Shell to Rolls Royce and Barclays Capital , are meeting leaders including Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani for a day of talks .
British investors have already proposed projects in Iraq worth 10 billion dollars , Business Secretary Peter Mandelson told the Invest in Iraq conference later .
“ Despite the tough global conditions , British exports of goods to Iraq increased by 17 percent last year to 156 million pounds .
And I want many more British firms to follow those already working there . ”
A series of deadly attacks in Iraq in the past two weeks has stirred fears of a return to broader sectarian bloodshed .
“ There are people in Iraq who want to fail the government but our army and armed forces are ready to face these challenges , ” Maliki told the news conference .
Brown said Iraq was open for business and urged British companies to look for opportunities there .
Maliki said Iraq needed investment .
British troops are withdrawing from Iraq six years after joining the U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein .
By the end of July there will be only around 400 troops left and they will continue to provide specialist training to Iraqi forces .
In a ceremony in Basra , southern Iraq , Britain conducted a formal transfer of authority to the U.S. commander in Iraq , beginning their final withdrawal .
In the six years since the invasion , 179 British servicemen and women have died .

Feeding Mercilessly Upon Ourselves
This a kind of a sequel or sister episode to NOW IS NOT GOOD , generally hailed as our creative pinnacle , the radiant summit from which we can now only tumble helplessly towards flaccid irrelevance .
With that in mind , we hope readers will enjoy this reference to a simpler and perhaps happier time .
We join events a few hours after Paul 's perplexing and abruptly - ended phone conversation with Dale .
This time we follow me , as I behave in a similarly avoidant manner to Dale , plunging unnecessarily to frightening depths , although at least I made it to the party .
Meanwhile , Paul is enjoying himself immensely .
The master of every social occasion , Paul wears Santa Claus 's hat with panache ; the old man stuck it on his head in a gleeful fit .
Forty - five minutes later in the bathroom , while pulling up his pants Santa remembered his hat , or at least noticed its absence , though he could not recall what he had done with it , and as he steadied himself against the sink , one eyelid behaving erratically , he developed suspicion towards a young woman who had found comedic use for him among her friends .
He had been maneuvering his girth through a dense spot in the room , catching glimpses when possible of the brunette by the fireplace , holding his white Russian as high as possible to prevent further spillage after a bit splashed his white cuff , although this method was ill - conceived and only made his task harder .
But that girl -- he had heard her laugh -- was n't she speaking with a young man , smartly dressed and well - built , and did she not cast a look his way as her smile spread , showing too much of her gums ?
She was vulgar , Santa thought , but transfixing .
His thoughts strayed once more , now to the miniature hot dogs which had somehow been part of that shifting careening world out there , the party ...
His vision seemed unusually sharp , but there was a delay , the room rotating a moment after his head turned .
The towel over the bidet was a hue of peach which he did not like .
With this issue we also make our first overt reference to actual real events occurring outside of our immaculate comic reality .
I predicted the arrival of Christmas months ago , but the tsunami caught everyone off - guard .
Please do n't call it a commentary ; it 's only a reflection , the way a shard of glass has no choice but to display whatever person or tsunami passes before it .
Unwillingly , like debris tossed by a furious current , we align with the pattern of the day .

Energy drinks such as Red Bull , Rockstar , and Monster — laced with high doses of caffeine ( up to seven times the amount in a cup of strong coffee , or 14 cans of cola ) and other stimulants — have been shown to increase blood pressure , cause heart racing , and increase anxiety , in a study published last fall by Johns Hopkins Medicine .
Another study by Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit , published this March , found similar concerns :
The researchers found that healthy adults who drank two cans a day of a popular energy drink experienced a 10 - point increase in their blood pressure and a five - to seven - beat increase in heart rate .
The study is published in March in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy .
These are “ healthy adults ” being affected this way .
But our children are also downing energy drinks in record numbers , looking for a quick after - school pick - me - up , or as a sports booster , without understanding the real risks .
With their smaller bodies , the 50 to 500 mg of caffeine typically found in one can will have much greater effects on children .
There is also a concern that children are becoming addicted to caffeine because of energy drinks .
In the study , Griffiths highlights the cases of nine patients treated by a US poisons unit after having an energy drink called Redline , which contains 250 mg caffeine .
Eight of the nine were boys , with the youngest aged 13 .
Their symptoms ranged from nausea and vomiting to tremors , chest pain and a racing pulse .
( guardian.co.uk )
The PEI Medical Society and the Maine Legislature want sales of energy drinks to children banned , after more and more children are showing up in emergency rooms and school nurse rooms with symptoms of caffeine intoxication , from elevated heart rates and blood pressure to headaches , sweating , anxiety , palpitations , nausea and sleep disturbances .
The symptoms of over exposure to caffeine had become serious enough for the Florida Poison Control Center at the University of Miami / Jackson to begin tracking it last year .
The caffeine over exposure tracking discovered children as young as two were being brought in to Florida emergency rooms for symptoms resulting from drinking an energy drink containing excessive amounts of caffeine .
Opponents to this measure believe that it would be unenforceable , and that it should be a parent ’s responsibility to educate and monitor their own children .
Ideally this would be true , however , it seems that education of adults is necessary first , since frequently parents are the ones providing these drinks for their children in the first place .
Energy drink industry representatives maintain that their products are not marketed to children , and in fact “ not suitable for children ” is plainly printed on the label of most drinks .
However , advertising campaigns centered on extreme sports , implying that the drinks are performance enhancers , are very appealing to young people , and we seem to have not noticed the warning labels .
These studies , while new , are only confirming fears that have been around for years .
But new energy drink products have continued to come on the market and sales have continued to skyrocket despite these concerns .
Johns
Hopkins experts are saying the warning labels need to be more prominent and include information on caffeine overdose , just as over - the - counter caffeine pills already do .
If you ’re looking for a quick energy boost , try these natural alternatives .
They wo n’t leave you dehydrated , coming down from sugar highs , or in the emergency room .

Via ThinkProgress , here ’s Ron Paul picking up the secession firestorm Rick Perry lit when he put the possibility of Texas leaving the Union on the table :
Partial transcript :
[ Perry ] really stirred some of the liberal media , where they started screaming about : ‘ What is going on here , this is un-American . ’
I heard one individual say ‘ this is treasonous to even talk about it . ’
Well , they do n’t know their history very well , because if they think about it ... it is very American to talk about secession .
That ’s how we came in being .
Thirteen colonies seceded from the British and established a new country .
So secession is a very much American principle .

Gov. Richardson asking for public input on whether to sign death penalty abolition bill
As noted in this post , late Friday the New Mexico state legislature finally passed a bill to repeal the death penalty in that state .
Now , as detailed in this local story , Gov. Bill Richardson is actively seeking public input concerning whether he should sign the bill :
Gov. Bill Richardson , whose signature could abolish the death penalty in New Mexico , spoke publicly Saturday about his dilemma over signing the bill .
The governor said in the days after the attacks of 9 - 11 , he supported the death penalty .
But in the last couple of years , he says his thinking has started to change .
" You see prosecutorial abuse , you see inmates that have been wrongly incarcerated , you see DNA evidence that 's faulty , " Richardson said .
Those doubts could play a role in Richardson 's decision to either sign or reject a bill passed by the New Mexico Senate Friday that would abolish the death penalty for life without parole .
The governor has until Wednesday to decide .
" I 've struggled with this .
It 's something probably that you get as governor once in a lifetime , so I want to make the right choice , " he said ....
The governor said he is looking for the public 's input before he decides .
" I want to hear compelling argument , factual arguments .
I want to hear from the clergy - conscious arguments , " he said ....
The governor 's office has been flooded with thousands of calls and e-mails on the issues , with opinion split evenly .
Now , the governor says he wants to go face - to - face with voters .
" We 're going to be available all weekend to hear from constituents , " he said .
" I 'm going to meet with constituents on Monday - - anyone that wants to talk to me about this issue , " he said .
You can call the governor at 505-476-2225 .
You can also e-mail him through his website under the " contact the governor " link .

I 'm sorry to see that Bill Richardson has now forgotten all about the victims of 9/11 .
Just kidding , of course .

My guess : Richardson would like to do away with death , but he 's more concerned with doing away any chance of becoming president in the process .

The death penalty should be abolished .
Our Justice system is imperfect .
In fact it has been imperfect over 225 times in murder cases .
DNA evidence proved these people not guilty , yet many were sentenced to DEATH and some life in prison without possibility of parole .
Putting an innocent to death is MURDER .
There are too many cases where evidence is supressed and DA 's / Investigators are more interested in promotion than justice .
Juries are not given all the facts .
Not something I want on my conscience .
Life in Prison without possibility of parole is terrible enough and it allows time for exoneration if a mistake is made .
MANY ARE .

Once convicted of the first murder , all others are immune , thanks to the criminal lover lawyer .

Who Else Is Sick Of The Octuplets Mom ?
When I first read the news of octuplets being born I was definitely interested in the news .
It is not every day octuplets are born .
However , it has been almost a month since the babies were born , and every where I turn I am reading or hearing about their mother .
I will spare all the details of everything said or written about here because I am sure most of you have heard it a thousand times .
The main issue I have is , she definitely does n’t have the money to raise all 14 of her children .
So now she is going on shows like Good Morning America to have everyone feel sorry for her position .
The bigger issue should be how could someone on welfare and already had six children be allowed to have in - vitro done .
If you ca n’t properly take care of your children you already have , how can someone legally get a procedure done to have more children .
I understand this procedure is very helpful for women who have many challenges getting pregnant .
The problem here is Nadya Suleman did not have these problems .
At the end of the day its the tax payers who are paying for people like Suleman to have these procedures done , get money from the government and then get a bunch of publicity ( and maybe money from the publicity ) done .
Although I definitely have a problem with how Suleman has worked the system , I also understand there is n’t much to do to fix the situation .
After all she has managed to market her problems into national news and even has gotten my interest enough to write a blog about her .
So though I strongly disagree with how she was legally allowed to get in - vitro , she should look into a marketing career and get herself off welfare .
Stumble it !
An Ontario Superior Court judge has ordered a pair of website owners to turn over identifying information about eight people being accused of defamation after posting anonymous comments .
" In my view , the defendants are under an obligation to disclose all documents in their power and control , " Justice Stanley Kershman said in a ruling delivered Monday to defendants Connie Wilkins - Fournier and Mark Fournier of Kingston , Ont. , who run the website Free Dominion .
Kershman also ordered the couple to pay $ 5,000 in costs to the plaintiff in the case , Ottawa human rights lawyer Richard Warman , described by Kershman as an " anti-hate speech advocate . "
Warman had requested , for use in a court action , access to documents that would assist in identifying the anonymous posters and their locations , such as :
Email addresses and all personal information .
The IP addresses of their computers .
Documents concerning the establishment and operation of the website , such as hosting agreements , billing information , and website registrant names .
The Fourniers had argued that people using the message boards do so with the expectation of anonymity and may make statements or provide information that they would n't normally with family , friends or co-workers .
However , Kershman cited a 2004 case that said privacy cannot be used to protect a person from the application of civil or criminal liability , and that privacy rights must be balanced against the rights of other interests and the public interest .
He also cited a 2008 child pornography case , in which a judge ruled that a person 's name , address and the name of their spouse are not information that one would expect to keep private from the state under such circumstances .
Fournier , posting on the Free Dominion website late Monday , said the ruling has a number of implications .
" Most importantly it means that anyone can gain access to a Canadian forum owner 's confidential records on its members simply by filing a lawsuit ( that could later be dropped ) against the forum operator . "
However , he said the couple did not have the funds to appeal and will likely have to comply with the ruling .
University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist , posting on his blog Tuesday , expressed concern that the decision " feels like a judge anxious to order disclosure , despite the weight of authority that provides some measure of privacy protection for anonymous posters . "
Geist said the court must ensure that a proper balance is struck between the rights of a plaintiff and the privacy and free speech rights of an anonymous poster .
In order to do that , it must set a high bar for plaintiffs to meet in order to justify overriding the poster 's rights .
The website in question is described in the ruling as " so controversial that it is blocked to employees of the Ontario Public Service " — something that Geist said is " not much of a threshold . "
Warman is in the process of suing the Fourniers , alleging they " falsely and maliciously published and circulated " information on the site that claimed Warman had posted hateful , racist words .
The allegations have not been proven in court .
HTPC fans were devastated when it was revealed that only OEM PC builders would have the privilege of building Vista Media Center PCs with CableCARD support , but hope is here : it looks like a few members of The Green Button forum have figured out how to build their own CableCARD ready HTPC .
There 's two barriers to overcome , which unfortunately still make it more difficult than just picking up an internal or external ATI Digital Cable Tuner , but they 're not terrible : would - be system builders just need to score an OCUR tuner product ID number and use a BIOS contains the correct OSFR table .
No one 's figured out how to tweak just any BIOS yet , but apparently most ASUS P5Q motherboards work fine -- so really you just need to score some used CableCARD tuners off eBay and ask the seller for the PID from their computer .
Or you could throw caution to the wind and plug in the generic PID of 263DJ - 2Y9YT - 6X9G6 - W28DB - 697TF , which may or may not work .
Anyone feeling brave enough to grab a new mobo and CableCARD tuner and give this a shot ?
" The fact that there are blank spots between each of these lines is a sign of how little we really know about the world 's oceans . "
Stewart to Limbaugh : ' Get the f**k out ' of NYC David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Thursday April 2 , 2009
Print This Email This Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh , who has been treated like a GOP leader since Obama 's election , did n't mince words when it came to pontificating on a new New York tax plan which aims at the state 's highest earners .
Limbaugh entitled his rant ' El Rushbo to New York : Drop Dead , ' and said on his radio show Monday , " I 'm going to get out of there totally , ' cause this is just absurd , and it 's ridiculous . "
But Limbaugh is n't the only one who does n't mince words .
" Finally ! " Jon Stewart shouted in relief on Wednesday 's edition of Comedy Central 's Daily Show before " revealing " the long - running conspiracy aimed at getting the conservative to leave the city .
" For years , for years , for years , New Yorkers have done everything in our power to get this guy to leave town , " Stewarts joked .
" We passed laws making it tougher for hot dog vendors to sell along the streets .
We hold gay pride parades and there are barely any gay people in the city so we shipped them in . "
Stewart added , " We knew he was into drugs so we cleaned up Times Square . "
Finally , the comic host offered Limbaugh directions along with his EZ pass then shouted out , " Get the f*ck out of here ! "

The Obama administration ’s choice to head the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) recently withdrew in the face of a concerted right - wing attack .
Veteran diplomat Chas Freeman would not have had to face Senate confirmation .
Instead , he had to face attacks in the right - wing press and blogosphere .
His withdrawal was a victory for Bush - era neoconservatives and their allies regarding intelligence and broader Middle East policy .
The NIC chairmanship is structured to offer a skeptical view on U.S. intelligence .
With his broad knowledge and experience in East Asia , the Middle East , Africa , Europe , and Latin America , Freeman would appear to be an ideal appointee .
Fluent in both major dialects of Chinese , he accompanied President Richard Nixon on his historic 1972 trip to China .
Later , he served as principal deputy assistant secretary of state for African affairs , assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs , and as ambassador to Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War .
After retiring from the State Department , Freeman succeeded former senator and 1972 Democratic presidential nominee George McGovern as head of the Middle East Policy Council , a centrist Washington think - tank .
Those closest to Freeman have confirmed that his decision was indeed his own .
Neither the president nor Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , who had offered Freeman the position , asked him to withdraw his acceptance of the NIC post .
At the same time , the White House ’s refusal to come to Freeman ’s defense in the face of misleading and defamatory attacks is reminiscent of the Clinton White House ’s abandonment of assistant attorney general nominee Lani Guinier in similar circumstances back in 1993 .
The Sin of Being Right on Iraq
Freeman announced his withdrawal just hours after Blair praised Freeman before the Senate Intelligence Committee for his “ wealth of knowledge and expertise in defense , diplomacy , and intelligence . ”
The seven Republican members of the committee did n’t , however , welcome these attributes when they spoke out strongly against his appointment .
Particularly upsetting to Freeman ’s right - wing opponents were his statements acknowledging the disastrous consequences of the U.S. invasion of Iraq , a decision backed not only by Republicans but by such key Senate Democrats as Intelligence Committee chair Dianne Feinstein , Vice President Joe Biden , and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn. ) , an outspoken supporter of the invasion , kept pressing Blair on the Freeman appointment during the hearing , to which Blair replied that such criticism was based on a misunderstanding of the position .
“ I can do a better job if I ’m getting strong analytical viewpoints to sort out and pass on to you and the president than if I ’m getting precooked pablum judgments that do n’t really challenge , ” Blair said .
Lieberman , clearly unsatisfied with Blair ’s response , promised he would continue to press the issue .
Freeman had raised the ire of war supporters in his articles and speeches exposing the errors of Bush policy in the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq .
“ Al - Qaeda has played us with the finesse of a matador exhausting a great bull by guiding it into unproductive lunges at the void behind his cape , ” Freeman said , noting how invading Iraq appeared to the world ’s Muslims as “ a wider war against Islam . ”
Freeman further observed : “ We destroyed the Iraqi state and catalyzed anarchy , sectarian violence , terrorism , and civil war in that country . ”
Not surprisingly , the bipartisan group attacking the appointment was led by such staunch supporters of the invasion of Iraq as Representatives Mark Kirk ( R - Ill . ) , Steve Israel ( D - N.Y. ) , John Boehner ( R - Ohio ) , Shelley Berkley ( D - Nev. ) , and Eric Cantor ( R - Va . ) .
Sen. Charles Schumer ( D - N.Y. ) , another outspoken supporter of the invasion of Iraq , insisted that “ Freeman was the wrong guy for this position . ”
Schumer even tried to take credit for Freeman ’s withdrawal , claiming , “ I repeatedly urged the White House to reject him , and I am glad they did the right thing . ”
By contrast , those supporting intelligence assessments based on the facts rather than ideology had praised the appointment as an example of a shift away from the Bush administration policy .
Freeman has “ spent a goodly part of the last 10 years raising questions that otherwise might never get answered  or even asked  because they ’re too embarrassing , awkward , or difficult , ” Dan Froomkin of NiemanWatchdog observed .
“ For him to be put in charge of [ the NIC ] is about the most emphatic statement the Obama administration could possibly make that it wo n’t succumb to the kind of submissive intelligence - community groupthink that preceded the war in Iraq . ”
James Fallows of The Atlantic noted how “ anyone who has worked in an organization knows how hard it is , but how vital , to find intelligent people who genuinely are willing to say inconvenient things even when everyone around them is getting impatient or annoyed .
The truth is , you do n’t like them when they do that .
You may not like them much at all .
But without them , you ’re cooked . ”
Smear Campaign
In the days following Blair ’s appointment of Freeman , the attacks grew more and more bizarre .
For example , since the Middle East Policy Council had received some grants from some Saudi - based foundations , Freeman was accused of thereby being “ on the Saudi payroll ” and even being a “ Saudi puppet . ”
In The New Republic , Martin Peretz insisted that Freeman was “ a bought man . ”
But it ’s certainly not unprecedented for presidential appointees to have worked with nonprofit organizations that have received support from foreign governments .
Indeed , Dennis Ross , appointed last month as special adviser for the Gulf and Southwest Asia , is still listed as the board chair of the Jewish People Policy Planning Institute , which is supported by the Israeli government .
To set the record straight , Blair told the Senate Intelligence Committee that Freeman had “ never lobbied for any government or business ( domestic or foreign ) ” and that he had “ never received any income directly from Saudi Arabia or any Saudi - controlled entity . ”
In another irony , the person identified as the principal orchestrator of the attacks against Freeman  including the charge that he was a Saudi agent  was Steven Rosen , former director of the right - wing American - Israel Political Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
Rosen currently faces espionage charges for transferring classified materials to the Israeli government .
M.J. Rosenberg , a former colleague of Rosen who now serves as policy director of the Israel Policy Forum , said “ you could n’t have picked anyone less credible to lead the charge ” against Freeman .
But Rosen ’s smear campaign was apparently credible enough to force Freeman to turn down the position .
Another line of attack was that Freeman , in the words of the Wall Street Journal , was a “ China apologist . ”
Critics cited quotes allegedly made by Freeman , many taken out of context , that appeared to justify repression by the Beijing regime , including the 1989 crackdown against pro-democracy activists .
According to Blair , however , Freeman  who has spoken of the Tiananmen Square massacre as a “ tragedy ”  was n’t describing his own views but was simply observing what he considered to be “ the dominant view in China . ”
Similarly , a number of leading China experts came to Freeman ’s defense as well , with Jerome Cohen noting that claims of Freeman endorsing the 1989 repression were “ ludicrous ” and Sidney Rittenberg observing that as a U.S. diplomat in Beijing , Freeman was “ a stalwart supporter of human rights who helped many individuals in need . ”
Yet Peretz falsely claimed that Freeman had “ made himself a client of China ” and was a man with “ no humane or humanitarian scruples ” who wanted the United States to “ kowtow to authoritarians and tyrants . ”
Nor did it stop National Review from claiming that Freeman ’s appointment proved “ you can go directly from effectively working for the Saudis and Chinese to being the country ’s top intelligence analyst . ”
None of those attacking Blair ’s appointments on the grounds of supposedly supporting authoritarian regimes has ever raised concerns about Adm .
Blair himself .
Blair served as the head of the U.S. Pacific Command from February 1999 to May 2002 , as East Timor was finally freeing itself from a quarter - century of brutal Indonesian occupation .
As the highest - ranking U.S. military official in the region , he worked to undermine the Clinton administration ’s belated efforts to end the repression , promote human rights , and support the territory ’s right to self - determination .
He also fought against congressional efforts to condition support for the Indonesian military on improving their poor human rights record .
When human rights activists raised concerns about having a defender of death squads as the director of national intelligence , the Obama White House rushed to Blair ’s defense , something they were clearly not willing to do for Chas Freeman .
Criticizing Israeli Policies
Freeman ’s rightist critics also claimed that Freeman was “ anti-Israel . ”
For instance , Freeman rejected the Bush administration ’s policy of defending Israeli violence against Palestinians while insisting that the Palestinians had to unilaterally end their violence against Israelis .
A number of Freeman ’s critics cited in horror Freeman ’s observation [ .pdf ] that until “ Israeli violence against Palestinians ” is halted , “ it is utterly unrealistic to expect that Palestinians will stand down from violent resistance . ”
Freeman has been concerned for some time that U.S. policy is radicalizing the Palestinian population to the point of jeopardizing Israel ’s security interests .
The United States had “ abandoned the role of Middle East peacemaker to back Israel ’s efforts to pacify its captive and increasingly ghettoized Arab populations , ” he observed .
“ We wring our hands while sitting on them as the Jewish state continues to seize ever more Arab land for its colonists .
This has convinced most Palestinians that Israel cannot be appeased and is persuading increasing numbers of them that a two - state solution is infeasible . ”
Ironically , a number of prominent Israeli academics , journalists , security analysts , military officers , and political leaders have made similar observations .
Freeman ’s critics , however , believe that expressing such concerns makes Freeman  in the words of the Wall Street Journal  an “ Israel basher . ”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , a strident supporter of Israeli government policies , claimed that Freeman ’s views were “ indefensible ” and urged President Barack Obama to withdraw his appointment .
In his withdrawal statement , Freeman reiterated his concern that “ the inability of the American public to discuss , or the government to consider , any option for U.S. policies in the Middle East opposed by the ruling faction in Israeli politics has allowed that faction to adopt and sustain policies that ultimately threaten the existence of the state of Israel . ”
He went on to observe that this “ is not just a tragedy for Israelis and their neighbors in the Middle East ; it is doing widening damage to the national security of the United States . ”
Obama ’s Silence
A number of diplomats and other State Department professionals who had known Freeman as a colleague spoke up in favor of his nomination and challenged the defamatory and libelous attacks against him .
For example , a letter signed by former UN ambassador Thomas Pickering , former ambassador to Israel Samuel Lewis , former ambassador to Afghanistan Samuel Neumann , and more than a dozen other current and former ambassadors noted : “ We know Chas [ Freeman ] to be a man of integrity and high intelligence who would never let his personal views shade or distort intelligence assessments . ”
Similarly , a group of prominent former intelligence officials called the attacks against Freeman “ unprecedented in their vehemence , scope , and target , ” noting how they were perpetrated by “ pundits and public figures aghast at the appointment of a senior intelligence official able to take a more balanced view of the Arab - Israel issue . ”
Yet despite so many mainstream officials coming to his defense , the Obama White House chose to remain silent .
Most pundits , as well as Freeman himself , have blamed the so - called Israel Lobby for forcing him out .
While AIPAC itself was apparently not involved in the smear campaign , many of Freeman ’s harshest critics were among the strongest supporters of the Israeli Right .
However , the battle over Freeman ’s appointment was about a lot more than simply his views on Israel  or Saudi Arabia or China ; it was about the integrity of our nation ’s intelligence system .
Those who most exploited the false claims about nonexistent “ weapons of mass destruction ” in order to frighten the American public into supporting the U.S. invasion of Iraq were the most eager to deny Freeman the chairmanship of the NIC .
And Freeman ’s willingness to ask the big questions frightened many on the Right .
For example , following 9/11 , Freeman shared his disappointment that “ instead of asking what might have caused the attack , or questioning the propriety of the national response to it , there is an ugly mood of chauvinism . ”
His ability to look inward instead of simply attack “ the other ” is what apparently made him unworthy in the eyes of his critics .
Prior to Freeman ’s decision to withdraw , Chris Nelson of the influential Nelson Report , a daily private newsletter read by top Washington policymakers , wrote , “ If Obama surrenders to the critics and orders [ Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair ] to rescind the Freeman appointment to chair the NIC , it is difficult to see how he can properly exercise leverage , when needed , in his conduct of policy in the Middle East .
That , literally , is how the experts see the stakes of the fight now under way . ”
Obama apparently did n’t order Freeman ’s appointment to be rescinded .
But Obama ’s refusal to come to Freeman ’s defense will make it all the more difficult for the president to challenge future right - wing attacks on his administration ’s policies in the Middle East and beyond .
Smelling victory , the Right will only become bolder in challenging any progressive inclinations in Obama ’s foreign policy .
As Joe Klein so aptly put it in his Time blog , “ Barack Obama should take note .
The thugs have taken out Chas Freeman .
They will not rest .
Their real target is you , Mr. President . ”

At least 90 people are believed dead and tens of thousands homeless after an earthquake hit L'Aquila and other towns in central Italy , rescuers say .
About 1,500 people were injured and many people are still missing as rescuers search desperately for survivors trapped beneath rubble .
The 6.3 - magnitude quake struck at 0330 ( 0130 GMT ) close to L'Aquila .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who is in the city , has promised a " record number of rescuers " .
" Nobody has been left on their own , " he said , adding that a field hospital was being set up to help local medical services .
Earlier , he declared a state of emergency .
Altogether , 26 cities and towns have been damaged , officials say .
In L'Aquila , 95 km ( 60 miles ) north - east of Rome , between 3,000 and 10,000 buildings in the medieval city may have been damaged .
Between 30,000 and 40,000 people are believed to have lost their homes and the authorities are working to find them shelter before nightfall .
The BBC's Duncan Kennedy in L'Aquila described bemused and confused locals wrapped in blankets and carrying their personal belongings in suitcases walking , like a stream of refugees , through the devastation .
The rescue service is stretched to breaking point as it tries to reach all the devastated buildings and deal with the mounting casualty toll , our correspondent adds .
State of emergency Earlier , the mayor of L'Aquila , Massimo Cialente , said some 100,000 people had left their homes .
Latest from Duncan Kennedy , L'Aquila
Here in the centre of the city , building after building has been left destroyed or half standing with cracks and holes .
We watched as rescue workers struggled to pull out survivors , crawling on their stomachs to try to reach those trapped inside .
There is a stream of almost ghostly figures , local people caught up in the early hours this morning in this earthquake , who are pouring past us wearing blankets .
They are pulling suitcases and luggage past this collapsed building trying to get to safety .
People are wandering around in a dazed state .
Eyewitness : ' Everything falling '
In pictures : L'Aquila in shock A university dormitory , churches and a bell tower are believed to be among the buildings that had collapsed .
Many residents and rescuers used their bare hands to clear the debris from collapsed buildings , although the army and civil protection units from around Italy are joining the effort .
Survivors , some still in their night clothes , hugged each other as they waited for news of friends and relatives .
Hundreds waited at the city 's main hospital , where doctors were forced to treat people in the open air because only one operating room was functioning .
Francesco Rocca of the Italian Red Cross said two field hospitals were arriving from Rome , but warned of the difficulties ahead .
" The biggest problem will arrive in the night because there are thousands and thousands of people that we have to host in tents , in the hotels , " he told the BBC .
Deaths were reported in the surrounding towns and villages of Castelnuovo , Poggio Picenze , Tormintarte , Fossa , Totani and Villa Sant ' Angelo .

But it is feared the toll could rise further as rescuers try to reach the many outlying villages and homes in the quake zone .
Phone and power lines remain down , and some bridges and roads have been closed as a precaution as the region was hit by a series of aftershocks .
Panic
The earthquake happened hours after a 4.6 - magnitude tremor shook the area but caused no reported damage .
L'AQUILA
Medieval city , founded in the 13th Century Capital of the mountainous Abruzzo region Population 70,000 , with many thousands more tourists and foreign students Walled city with narrow streets , lined by Baroque and Renaissance buildings
Thousands of the city 's 70,000 residents ran into the streets in panic following the 30 - second tremor .
Survivors described finding themselves looking out on to open streets as the walls of their buildings fell away .
A student dormitory was said to be one of the buildings badly damaged .
Rescuers were reportedly searching the rubble for people feared trapped inside .
" We managed to come down with other students but we had to sneak through a hole in the stairs as the whole floor came down , " student Luigi Alfonsi , 22 , said .
" I was in bed - it was like it would never end as I heard pieces of the building collapse around me . "

Dr. Laura Schlessinger is the go - to girl for conservatives ( and others ) who want folksy but direct advice on their lives and relationships .
Although she has had a less - than - friendly relationship with the gay community in the past , in July of last year we reported on our impression of a much gay - friendlier Dr. Laura .
She seemed to have adopted a more pragmatic approach to gay men and women .
Last night she was on Larry King Live to plug her new book , In Praise of Stay - At - Home Moms .
Asked about lesbian parenting , Dr. Laura gave a vague answer that seemed to suggest that she was not favorable ( an issue we discussed last June ) .
But this was followed by an exchange in which Dr. Laura seemed to endorse same - sex relationships , if not the term “ marriage ” .
KING : This week , the Washington City Council voted to recognize same - sex marriages performed in other states .
And the Vermont legislature voted to override a gubernatorial veto of a bill legalizing same sex .
Do you think this — now we have four states , about to be five states .
SCHLESSINGER : Well , it ’s issues of — sometimes it ’s done by courts , sometimes it ’s done by legislatures .
KING : Basically , five states now say you can have it .
What do you think of that ?
What are you laughing at ?
SCHLESSINGER : Well , I do n’t have much of an opinion on it .
KING : You have no opinion on it ?
SCHLESSINGER : Not much , no .
KING : But you ’ve always favored that marriage must be between a man and woman .
SCHLESSINGER : I ’m very big on human beings finding love , attachment and commitment and being faithful to it , because there ’s more to benefit when there is real true commitment and faithfulness to it .
I still believe , as just every president has , and all the people who ran for office , that marriage is a sacrament between a man and a woman .
So not calling it marriage works for me .
But that two people would have that sort of commitment to me is very healthy and very positive thing in their lives and society as a whole .
KING : So , you favor marriage between a man and a woman , but you applaud the fact that even people of the same - sex can have that kind of commitment to each other .
SCHLESSINGER : That ’s a beautiful thing and a healthy thing .
KING : We ’ll be back with more of Dr. Laura Schlessinger .
Dr. Laura has great sway in influencing the thinking of your average conservative housewife .
And if Dr. Laura is n’t much upset by recent changes to state marriage laws , then this gives plenty of folks in Iowa permission to not be upset either .
And while I ’d prefer an endorsement of marriage equality , I ’m delighted that she is defining same - sex commitment as healthy and positive in the lives of gay people and in society as a whole .

If there were any doubt that open access publishing was setting off a bit of a power struggle , a decision made last week by the MIT faculty should put it to rest .
Although most commercial academic publishers require that the authors of the works they publish sign all copyrights over to the journal , Congress recently mandated that all researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health retain the right to freely distribute their works one year after publication ( several foundations have similar requirements ) .
Since then , some publishers started fighting the trend , and a few members of Congress are reconsidering the mandate .
Now , in a move that will undoubtedly redraw the battle lines , the faculty of MIT have unanimously voted to make any publications they produce open access .
So far , the battle lines on open access have been drawn with publishers on one side , funding groups on the other .
Funding groups , such as the NIH , Wellcome Trust , and Howard Hughes Medical Institute , feel that the research they pay for will have a larger impact if more people have access to it .
In the case of government agencies , there 's the added issue of allowing access by the tax payers that ultimately fund the work .
This has led a number of them to adopt policies in which the researchers they fund retain the right to freely distribute their works some time after publication .
This grace period , usually six months to a year , allows the publishers to extract some value out of their role in arranging for the review and formatting of the works .
The NIH had been promoting open access for several years , but the policy was made mandatory in 2008 , and that change was made permanent this year .
With its multibillion dollar budget , the NIH policy change was a seismic shift ; although some publishers embraced the change , there has been a notable backlash .
Meanwhile , the House Judiciary Committee felt it had not been properly consulted when the mandatory policy was enacted .
For the past two years , bills have been introduced that would overturn it .
Although there are some passionate advocates of open access publishing within the community of research faculty , this fight was , to an extent , going on over their heads .
After all , faculty are completely reliant on both parties involved : the funding agencies pay for their work , and publishers ensure that it finds an audience .
Obviously , this puts the faculty in no position to negotiate .
All of that helps explain the significance of the policy adopted by the MIT faculty , which commits everyone at MIT to a policy that is even more aggressive than the one that governs NIH grant recipients .
( Hal Abelson , who chaired the committee that drafted the policy has posted a copy of it ) .
In short , as of last week , everyone at MIT is expected to retain rights to distribute their works at no cost for their parent institution .
Anybody who wants to publish with a journal that refuses to grant these rights will have to submit a written request for an exception to the MIT provost .
The faculty will have to prepare an appropriately formatted copy of their works to the provost for hosting .
MIT plans to place them on its DSpace system , a content hosting system it developed with HP and distributes under a BSD license .
Far more striking than the policy itself , however , is the perspective of those who were instrumental in formulating it .
Professor Hal Abelson , in a statement provided by MIT , said , " scholarly publishing has so far been based purely on contracts between publishers and individual faculty authors .
In that system , faculty members and their institutions are powerless .
This resolution changes that by creating a role in the publishing process for the faculty as a whole , not just as isolated individuals . "
Ann Wolpert , who directs MIT 's libraries , said , " in the quest for higher profits , publishers have lost sight of the values of the academy . "
Those are pretty clearly fighting words .
The policy itself does n't seem to involve any attempt to find middle ground with the publishers , as there is no grace period where journals would have exclusive access , in contrast to the NIH policy .
Clearly , the MIT faculty produce a lot of research that academic publishers will be anxious not to lose access to , but MIT seems to be hoping that other universities follow along , citing similar policies enacted by individual schools at Harvard and Stanford .
Another approach to open access publishing is being tested by Sweden 's Lund University , which is allocating money to support those of its faculty that wish to publish in open access journals .
In this case , the money goes to support open access publishers ; Lund refused a campus - wide discount for publishing with the Public Library of Science , and will instead pay the higher individual rates .
It 's also decided not to use this money to pay for open access articles in an otherwise closed publication .
These developments indicate that faculty want to have more options than contributing to the open access debate as individual advocates .
If more institutions that have the size and intellectual heft of MIT stake out similar positions , then the researchers may have a very powerful voice .

LUCEDALE , Miss . —
A star Mississippi high school football player accidentally shot himself with his shotgun after he was pulled over during a traffic stop , a grand jury ruled Thursday .
Billey Joe Johnson , 17 , a junior at southern Mississippi's George County High School , died of a wound to the left side of his head on Dec. 8 after a deputy pulled him over for running a red light .
After an initial investigation , authorities said the blast had been self - inflicted .
The grand jury was looking at whether it was an accident , suicide or even a possible slaying .
Bloom , 78 , who lives alone in Fulham , north London , rose to prominence after being chosen by Charlie Chaplin to appear in his film Limelight in 1952 .
She is said to be excited by her new role .
Despite this , when Ms Johnson was finally re-united with her son after police found him at Merrylands train station on Good Friday , she found he'd shed substantial weight .
" He is safe , has lost about 20kg and is skin and bone .
I 'll have to feed him up again , '' Ms Johnson said , on an internet appeal site she set up after Ethan went missing .
Ethan disappeared on the morning of March 30 , and was last seen on CCTV footage at Robina train station on the Gold Coast about 9.20 am .
Fears for his safety were raised after he failed to turn up to classes at Runcorn State High School , and did not contact any family or friends .
As it turned out , he was pedalling to prove a point .
" He rode his bicycle to Sydney for no better reason than to see if he could , '' Ms Johnson wrote the internet site .
" He wanted to prove to some bullies [ and everyone else ] that he 's not an idiot .
" And he is n't - he actually planned the whole trip himself - which is so very far outside his comfort zone . ''
Another motivation for Ethan was that he had n't seen enough of the city during a school excursion when he was 12 , Ms Johnson said .
" Because we had the CCTV footage , we knew he was safe and the fact that he kept using his keycard as he went along we knew where to find him when he hit Sydney , '' she said .
" We kept putting a little bit in his account each day so he could buy food but not too much so he could n't get too far .
" We got him on the morning he took the last bit of money from his account . ''
Ms Johnson said she gave Ethan a big cuddle and he started crying when she was re-united with him .
He had planned to ride even further when he was tracked down by police .
" He got a bit disappointed because he was found a bit quicker than he thought he would be .
He did n't get too explore too far , '' Ms Johnson said .
" He had ventured into the heart of the city but there were too many people so he left the city area - he does n't like crowded areas . ''
However he has told his mother it was good to be back home and he would not do it again .
Although Ethan is now back with family , Ms Johnson has decided not to remove the internet appeal site - on Facebook - to show him how many people cared for him .
More than 9000 people signed up to the site , and most posted warm , motivational messages aimed at instilling Ethan with self - confidence .
" Ethan , we love and appreciate you , mate .
Ca n't wait to see you back at school , '' wrote one person , Chris Godde .
Another , Kate Metzdorf , wrote : " Being bullied can make you feel pretty sad and lonely , but if you did n't know before and least you now know that you have lots of family and friends who think you are pretty cool , so do n't ever let anyone let you think that they are better than you , because they are not .

Airwave exploits fingertip energy with battery - free lighting controls .
The act of pushing the Airwave light switch captures kinetic energy ( the energy of motion ) that transmits wireless commands to turn lights on and off .
Airwave ’s photosensors also rebel against battery power , relying instead on photovoltaic cells to monitor light levels and signal the lighting unit to reduce output when sufficient daylight is available .
Since Ledalite ’s controls are battery - free , they can be installed on almost any available surface without ripping open walls to install new wiring .
The truly lazy can even pocket the controls and use them wherever Ledalite ’s wireless signal is available .
According to Ledalite , the switches cost $ 80 and light sensors cost $ 150 .
That could be comparable to traditional lighting systems , but it depends on the complexity of wiring in individual homes versus the upfront cost of a wireless solution .
Ledalite may be the latest player in the kinetic energy game , but it ’s not the first .

I ’m the lead of the GPSD project , a service daemon that monitors GPS receivers on serial or USB ports and provides TPV ( time - position - velocity ) reports in a simple format on on a well - known Internet port .
GPSD makes this job looks easy .
But it ’s not — oh , it ’s decidedly not — and thereby hangs an entertaining tale of hacker ingenuity versus multiple layers of suck .
Away back in the dark and backward abysm of time when GPS technology was first being made generally available ( 1993 ) , only military - grade receivers were sensitive enough to use it where there were things like buildings and trees partly blocking the sky view .
The first civilian customers to actually find a use for it were people messing about in boats .
Thus it came to pass that the manufacturers of marine navigation systems were the first civilians to grapple with the question of how a GPS receiver should report TPV information over a wire to a navigational computer .
Our first layer of suck begins with the National Marine Electronics Association , or NMEA .
They wrote a standard describing a protocol for GPSes reporting over serial ports called NMEA 0183 which , despite being a technical expert in the field , I ’ve never dared to look at .
The reason is that they made it proprietary and expensive , and their lawyers have been known to threaten legal action against people who quote it on the net .
To add injury to insult , NMEA 0183 was ( and still is ) a crappy standard .
How crappy ?
Well , before I get into that , let ’s note that there is one thing NMEA did right that later attempts to replace it got wrong .
Each NMEA report is a text packet , or sentence , that begins with a dollar sign and ends with a carriage - return and line feed .
The data elements in in NMEA sentences are just text fields separated by commas , like this :
$ GPRMC,225446.33,A,4916.45,N,12311.12,W,000.5,054.7,191194,020.3, E,A*68
This means that log files of collected NMEA sentences are easy to read and edit .
And that number on the right - hand end , after the “ * ” but before the CRLF ?
A data checksum , so you can tell whether you have a valid sentence or just line noise ( and this is important : we ’ll come back to it later ) .
A GPS speaking NMEA emits sentences like this onto the wire , usually in once - per - second bursts .
The first layer of suck actually begins with what NMEA 0183 has you put in those packets .
If you are a mathematician , you have a pretty good notion of what a TPV report is .
It ’s a 7 - tuple describing your position in four dimensions and your velocity in three .
If you are an engineer or the more practical sort of physicist , you want to add expected - error estimates at some fixed confidence level , usually 50 % or 95 % , and return 14 numbers .
Internally , this is what a GPS sensor computes from the signal times to GPS satellites .
Actually , to be pedantic , it does n’t compute the error bars in exactly this form ; rather , you get scale factors for the errors derived from the geometry of the satellites when the fix was taken , and have to multiply that by an experimentally - derived bugger factor dependent on things like how turbulent the radio - reflecting layer in the ionosphere is .
Now let ’s look at what NMEA 0183 tells GPS devices to actually report .
Here is a breakdown of the data in our sample sentence , which is in fact the most commonly used GPS reporting format for TPV :
1 225446.33 Time of fix 22:54:46 UTC 2 A Status of Fix : A = Autonomous , valid ; D = Differential , valid ; V = invalid 3,4 4916.45 , N Latitude 49 deg. 16.45 min North 5,6 12311.12 , W Longitude 123 deg. 11.12 min West 7 000.5
Speed over ground , Knots 8 054.7 Course Made Good , True north 9 181194 Date of fix 18 November 1994 10,11 020.3 , E Magnetic variation 20.3 deg East 12 A FAA mode indicator ( NMEA 2.3 and later ) A=autonomous , D=differential , E=Estimated , N=not valid , S=Simulator , M=Manual input mode 13 * 68 Mandatory NMEA checksum
Alert readers will notice what ’s missing here .
Altitude , for starters — we ’ve got no Z !
People in boats , remember ?
They think they do n’t need no steenking altitude .
And no error estimates at all .
And the T report is incomplete , giving only a two - digit year .
Yup , that one got annoying real fast when the millennium turned .
And it ’s not like the designers could n’t see that coming in 1993 .
Eventually , NMEA wised up about the altitude thing .
The sane way to proceed would have been to define a new sentence containing all the GPRMC information , plus altitude , plus a real four - digit year , even if error bars had to remain suppressed for some inexplicable reason .
Here ’s what we got instead :
$ GPGGA,123519,4807.038,N,01131.324,E,1,08,0.9,545.4,M,46.9 , M , , *42 1 123519 Fix taken at 12:35:19 UTC 2,3 4807.038 , N Latitude 48 deg 07.038 '
N 4,5 01131.324 , E Longitude 11 deg 31.324 ' E 6 1 Fix quality : 0 = invalid , 1 = GPS , 2 = DGPS , 3 =PPS ( Precise Position Service ) , 4=RTK ( Real Time Kinematic ) with fixed integers , 5 = Float RTK , 6 =Estimated , 7 =Manual , 8 = Simulator 7 08 Number of satellites being tracked 8 0.9 HDOP = Horizontal dilution of position 9,10 545.4 , M Altitude , Metres above mean sea level 11,12 46.9 , M Height of geoid ( mean sea level ) above WGS84 ellipsoid , in Meters
Now we ’ve got X , Y , and Z… but T is even more damaged !
You get a time of day , no month , no year , no century .
No velocity report at all .
We ’ve got one number , HDOP , that tangles EDX and EDY together to give a circular horizontal error .
And despite the fact that this sentence reports an altitude ( Z ) , there ’s an EDX / EDY and no report of EDZ !
For some inexplicable reason , NMEA also describes a GPGLL sentence that has all the brain - damage of GPGGA , but without the altitude .
And a GPVTG that gives only a velocity report – no position , and naturally no error bars .
Do I need to add that both have missing or incomplete timestamps ?
And oh , yes , there are actually two different incompatible variants of GPVTG .
Remember I said GPS receivers emit bursts of NMEA packets once a second ?
Well , the bursts typically consist of a GPRMC , followed by a GGA , possibly followed by a GPGLL and / or GPVTG .
Er , no , I ’m lying , they could be in a different order .
The sentences in the burst have overlapping , incomplete information .
The NMEA standard does n’t specify even which ones must be sent , let alone the order they ’re sent in .
Some NMEA GPSes part - repair the timestamp damage by shipping a sentence called GPZDA that gives you a full UTC timestamp with century .
But the standard does n’t require it , and most do n’t , so you ca n’t count on it .
The first layer of suck was about what NMEA 0183 specifies .
We are now passing into the second layer of suck , which is what it does n’t specify .
Like , the minimum set of sentences that have to be sent per reporting cycle .
Oh , and nothing in the standard stops a GPS from simply omitting fields it does n’t feel like reporting .
It ’s fairly common , for example , for receivers to not report magnetic variation or geoid separation ( the geoid is an imaginary surface representing the difference between mean sea level and local sea level , which varies because the earth ’s mass is not uniformly distributed . ) .
GPS designers can save some absurdly tiny fraction of a penny per unit by not having these data tables in ROM , and they ’re generally more than willing to shaft their customers to do it .
A mob of crack - smoking rhesus monkeys could have designed a better standard than NMEA 0183 .
It means that if you want to assemble a proper TPV report from NMEA sentences , you actually need to wait until you ’ve seen an entire reporting cycle .
Only … you can’t tell without knowing the type and firmware version of the GPS which sentences start and end the cycle !
And even if you did know , buffering the partial data introduces latency that may be unacceptable for some applications .
A very practical way this manifests is that if you have a GPS client faithfully reporting the NMEA sentences coming over the wire , your altitude will typically flicker from known to unknown and back twice a second as it gets hit by alternating GPRMC and GPGGA sentences .
That is , unless you buffer , in which case the altitude you see could be up to one second stale and associated with a previous fix .
The incomplete timestamps mean various sorts of lossage can bite you if you have a GPS client active at midnight .
Unless your software is actually watching for the moment when the GGA timestamp goes to 00:00:00 and can compensate , it ’s going to look like you ’ve dropped back in time 24 hours until the GPRMC next comes in .
Human eyes can just reject this , but what if you ’re logging telemetry and try to graph against time ?
Similar anomalies lurk at the edges of years and centuries .
Yes , and if you want to report true altitude over ground correctly and consistently across devices , you better have your own geoidal separation table in software somewhere .
And I have nowhere near plumbed the stygian depths of the NMEA standard ’s top two layers of suck .
To spare the reader ’s sanity , we shall lightly draw a veil over the spiky , vague , ill - documented horror that is NMEA error and status reporting and pass directly to the third layer of NMEA suck , the complete absence of any standardization of GPS control codes .
Here are some of the more important things there is no NMEA - standard way to tell a GPS to do :
Report its vendor , model , and firmware version .
Change the set of sentences it ships per cycle .
Change the baud rate at which it reports .
Change the number of samples it reports per second .
Of these , ( 1 ) is the most harmless - looking , but actually the deadliest .
Many GPSes have vendor - defined commands to do ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , but it is far from trivial to figure out which set of vendor - defined commands might apply .
If you are a GPS - using application , and you are handed the name of a port with a GPS on it , you have to either settle for the minimum common subset of GPS behaviors , or throw all the vendor - specific ID probes you know of at the device hoping it will respond to one of them .
Hint : too often , it wo n’t .
But wait .
Things get worse !
There are , broadly speaking , three major different ways that GPS vendors could have responded to the admitted fact that NMEA 0183 , as given , is a festering pile of rancid camel vomit .
They could have pressured NMEA into cleaning up the damn standard .
They could have de - facto standardized on a decent set of extensions using the NMEA sentence packet format – a sentence that reports all 14 location parameters , a probe - for - ID query , a standard baud - rate change , etc .
Or…they could invent a dozen mutually incompatible and poorly documented proprietary binary protocols , all of which throw away the transparency advantages of the NMEA textual packet format and each one of which introduces unique and special brain - damage of its own !
Guess which alternative most of them chose .
Just guess …
You are now in a twisty maze of GPS reporting protocols , all different .
Many devices have two different operating modes , one in which they emit NMEA packets and one in which they emit a vendor binary protocol that looks like nothing so much as line noise .
At least one major vendor has dropped NMEA support entirely .
If your location - sensitive application is naively expecting NMEA , you lose .
To be fair , one things the vendor binary protocols generally get right that NMEA does n’t is shipping something close to a full TPV in one sentence per cycle .
This at least avoids the nasty problems associated with integrating partial NMEA reports and worries about where the start of cycle is .
However , I had to say “ something close ” ; not one protocol ships the full and correct TPV 14 - tuple .
Usually one or more velocity components and error estimates are missing and have to be computed .
Let ’s back off at this point and consider how people who use GPS sensors would , ideally , like their GPS sensors to behave .
You plug it in , your software figures out what protocol it ’s using , autoconfigures to match it , and starts collecting TPV reports and using them .
If “ your software ” is a GPSD - enabled application on a system with gpsd installed , it actually works this way .
Those of you who have been following our descent into this fourth major layer of suck can be excused for wondering how in the flipping hell GPSD ever managed this trick in the twisty maze of vendor protocols , all different .
Certainly the vendors are n’t being much help here .
Many of them ( I ’m looking at you , Garmin ! ) are cheerfully willing to assume that you will never use anything but their one idiosyncratic piece of GPS hardware , and that it will only talk to a limited , vendor - controlled selection of closed - source binary blobs provided by them or their business partners .
Hello , vendor lock - in ; goodbye , customer choice .
There is an Ariadne ’s thread through this maze .
It ’s this :
All the vendor protocols , like NMEA 0183 , use packets with checksums and fixed header / trailer bytes .
The intention is that they ’re an integrity check so you do n’t get fooled by line - noise - induced glitches .
The side effect is that , if you ’re sufficiently clever , you can do GPS protocol autodetection on the fly .
It takes a fairly complex state machine that tangles together structural knowledge about every packet protocol in your supported set , but it can be done .
In GPSD - land we call this piece of code the packet sniffer .
There ’s something else the packet - sniffer does : it autobauds .
Again , this is only possible because packet checksumming gives you a way to know for sure when you ’re looking at valid data .
When a serial GPS device is presented to gpsd , the packet sniffer does n’t have to be told the baud rate the device is shipping at – it cycles through all possible combinations of speed , parity and stop bits looking for a combination under which it sees valid packets of some type .
Normally this takes less than a second .
The packet sniffer is the real reason for the existence of gpsd — and I ’d add “ other programs like it ” , except that there are n’t any others that I know of .
Long ago , all the gpsd daemon did was serve as a multiplexer that read and buffered TPV reports from a single serial device so that several GPSD - aware applications could get simultaneous access to them .
That ’s all GPSD ’s closest competitors today , like Gypsy , can do ; they ’re NMEA multiplexers .
They typically can’t cope with non-NMEA devices at all ; no packet sniffer .
The gpsd daemon also copes with the data management problems surrounding NMEA partial TPV reports , doing everything from supplying missing geoidal separation for altitude to computing and reporting error estimates from the geometry of the satellite skyview if the GPS does n’t supply them .
Most of the suck surrounding GPSes can be summed up by “ all this cleverness is actually necessary if you want to get clean TPV data out of more than one different kind of device ” , or even out of just one kind of device that fails to supply a complete TPV .
And , as we ’ve noted , all of them fail in a dizzying variety of ways .
It ’s true that in theory , every single GPS - aware application could include its own packet sniffer , the matrix algebra needed to compute missing error estimates , its own geoidal separation table , and all the other random logic needed to cope even with GPSes that are working nominally correctly .
But have we mentioned yet that some … do n’t ?
We know of at least three circumstances under which popular GPS chipsets return un-obviously corrupted NMEA – detectable , but you actually have to know how .
Then there ’s one chipset we know of that returns incorrect packet checksums when it does n’t have a fix .
And we ’re not done yet , because there at least two other sets of issues about extracting sense from these devices .
One set is an artifact of the way USB GPSes are put together .
Now , USB is generally a good thing in this context ; unlike old - school serial ports , USB devices raise notification events on connect and disconnect , which clever GPS software can listen for and use to automatically hook up and sync to GPS sensors when they ’re available .
However …naked GPS chips report serial data at TTL levels .
The standard way to build a USB GPS is to hook up your GPS chip with a serial - to - USB bridge ; there ’s one in particular called a Prolific Logic 2303 that tends to show up on about 70 % of the USB GPSes out there .
There are two problems with this kind of design , one obvious and one subtle .
The subtle one is that both the bridge and the UART on the GPS chip have their own data buffers .
Under most circumstances this does n’t matter because the introduced latency from both together is very small – but some control operations ( notably the serial - speed changes you ’re going to be doing while you try to sync up with the device ) need an amount of delay sufficient to flush both , otherwise you get odd race conditions that can result in garbage data coming back up the wire or your control operation silently failing .
The right combinations of OS - level buffer flushes and delays will avoid this problem , but clumsy ways to do it cause fix latency and application slowdown .
The comment explaining these issues in the GPSD code leads off with “ Serious black magic begins here . ” and continues for 48 lines — because it needs to .
( This is n’t the worst thing you have to be careful of while hunting , though .
Some Bluetooth GPSes with defective firmware will actually go so badly catatonic if you try to change their baud rate that you actually have to crack the case and unsolder the battery to unbrick them ! ) .
Here ’s the more obvious USB problem : there is no USB device class for GPSes .
A USB GPS will present the vendor / product ID of the serial - to - USB converter .
This means that , even if you ’re fortunate enough to have an operating system that can do something reasonable with hotplug events , you ca n’t just tell it to watch for GPS devices going live and connect them to your software ; you have to know which bridge - chipset IDs are likely to have GPSes behind them , sniff the data , and let go of the device if it ’s not shipping GPS packets !
Otherwise you might eat events from non-GPS serial devices that some other application badly needs to see .
And so on , and so on .
Dealing with all this crap is further complicated by vendor documentation that is scanty if you can get it at all , and often written in rather broken English when you can .
Part of of the problem is the structure of the GPS sensor market , which largely consists of dozens of tiny Pacific - Rim companies – each popping up out of nowhere , shipping the cheapest possible spin on one of about a half - dozen reference designs , and disappearing six to eighteen months later .
A friend who works in embedded systems tells me these little outfits are n’t even intended to last long ; they ’re actually run by giant electronics combines through several layers of shell companies as a way of providing deniability in case of lawsuits by patent trolls .
They spin up , they ship , they funnel money back to daddy … and before there ’s time for a process - server to show up , they disappear .
All the engineers get rehired by a different sock puppet a week later .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
And …er …product support ?
What ’s that ?
It ’s messy .
Really messy .
Those who love the law , sausage , or GPS devices really should n’t watch any of them being made .
Expecting GPS - aware applications to keep track of all this stuff would be just nuts .
The best way to cope is to have a dedicated service layer that specializes in knowing about GPS idiosyncracies , hides all that ugliness , and presents a simple TPV - reporting interface to the application layer above .
Ideally , the service layer should have a sharp crew of developers who are specialist GPS experts so that nobody else has to be .
And that ’s exactly what the GPSD project is .
It looks like a simple job … but it ’s not .
Swine influenza
The Emergency Committee , established in compliance with the International Health Regulations ( 2005 ) , held its second meeting on 27 April 2009 .
The Committee considered available data on confirmed outbreaks of A / H1N1 swine influenza in the United States of America , Mexico , and Canada .
The Committee also considered reports of possible spread to additional countries .
On the advice of the Committee , the WHO Director - General decided on the following .
Nothing can bring utter insanity to the lives of otherwise reasonable people like a nasty divorce .
People in that situation suddenly find within themselves untapped wells of pettiness and crazy , leading to the kind immature behavior that would embarrass the average 10 - year - old .
How bizarre do these cases get ?

10 A Cambodian Couple Split Their Assets Last year , in Cambodia 's rural village of Phnom Penh a couple ended their 18 years of marriage because Moeun , the husband , has suspected for years that his wife was screwing around with the local cop .
So like a reasonable couple they talked over their differences and then at some point Moeun decided to fucking cut their house in half .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
" Actually , I 'm gonna need something a little bigger . "
Moeun and his relatives showed up equipped with lots of saws , and we 're guessing even more alcohol , and cut the bastard neatly in two .
We 're guessing if you were to rewind about two hours you 'd find said man and relatives in a bar , just sort of drunk , when one of them says , " You know what you should do ... "
There 's laughter , but then about 15 Cambodian beers later , the idea comes up again .

So is there an American story that tops them both ?
We believe so .
While filing for divorce , citing physical and mental abuse , the aspiring - to - be-ex Mrs. Chana Taub hit a roadblock when the judge dismissed the entire case , based on what appears to be the fact that the couple were already living out an 80s sitcom plot device .
You know , where the feuding couple decides to draw a line down the middle of their house , then a series of wacky hijinks ensue while they try to sabotage each other ?
Only in this case instead of a line , it was a wall built down the center of the three - story home .
And we do n't mean some kind of temporary thing to teach them a lesson , but an actual wall of plywood and sheetrock through the middle of their Brooklyn residence .

See that white separation wall in the back ?
Yeah .
This is retarded .
What 's more , it was n't even their idea .
An earlier judge had ordered the wall built , after both husband and wife refused to move out ( this was presumably the first case in U.S. history to cite an episode of The Facts of Life as its basis ) .
We note that the judge gave the wife the kitchen and the husband the dining room , which would seem like he was trying to set up some kind of wacky / romantic reconciliation dinner .
You know , except for the big goddamned wall separating them .
A 16th - Century map that refers to " America " is one of the exhibits
A website offering free access to rare manuscripts , books , films and maps from around the world is being launched by the UN 's cultural agency .
Unesco says the World Digital Library will help to promote curiosity and understanding across cultures .
Among the artefacts are a 1,000 - year - old Japanese novel and the earliest known map to mention America by name .
About a tenth of the 1,200 exhibits are from Africa - the oldest an 8,000 - year - old painting of bleeding antelopes .
But this is an ongoing project in its early stages , and the collection is expected to grow substantially .
The World Digital Library was first mooted in 2005 by James Billington , librarian at the US Library of Congress , the world 's biggest library .
The project hopes to expand access to " non-Western " items - though the largest number of items digitised so far are from Europe .
The material is drawn from about 30 libraries and archives across the world , and will be made available in English , Arabic , Chinese , French , Portuguese , Russian and Spanish .
By making cultural treasures accessible to a huge audience , Unesco also hopes to reduce what it sees as a digital divide between rich and poor .
The project is the third such big digitalisation project .
Last year the European Union 's digital library crashed within hours of its launch , but it is up and running now .

Google was n’t kidding when they indicated that they were going to re-focus on their key products .
Gmail is getting yet another useful upgrade today – the introduction of a “ Move to ” option that lets you apply a label to a thread and archive it in one - step , and a “ Labels ” option that lets you add labels or edit your existing ones .
This makes Gmail a bit more like traditional email programs , where you can simply drag and drop messages into folders in one step .
However , as Gmail engineer Emil Eklund notes in a blog post , “ unlike with folders , messages can have several labels , so if I get an email from a friend about a trip we 're taking together , I can add both a " Friends " and a " Travel " label to it . ”
Eklund says the features are being rolled out “ over the course of the day , ” so you might not see them just yet .
Previously , these tasks all lived under the “ More Actions ” pull - down menu that hovers above your inbox and threads in Gmail – and if you wanted to archive a labeled post , you ’d have to click “ Archive ” separately .
Unlike Gmail " Labs " features that are initially optional , " Move to " is being pushed right into production .
Today ’s addition follows a host of other upgrades and new features added to Gmail in the past few weeks – a task list for iPhone and Android devices , offline support with Google Gears , and a send and archive button that can also reduce your clicks .

Civil War Raging in Right - Wing Blogosphere
Created : April 21 , 2009 12:48 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
Charles Johnson ( YouTube )
Since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , jazz musician and Web designer Charles Johnson has devoted his blog , Little Green Footballs , to exposing Muslim extremism in and outside the United States .
His targets have included the Council on American - Islamic Relations , filmmaker Michael Moore , Reuters , Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , Dan Rather , and the late pro-Palestinian activist Rachel Corrie — who some LGF commenters ( not Johnson ) call “ St. Pancake , ” a tribute to the Israeli steamroller that killed her .
LGF helped write the lexicon of the self - styled “ anti-Jihadist ” blogosphere — from “ moonbat ” ( “ an unthinking or insane leftist ” ) to “ anti-idiotarian ” ( “ anyone who grasps the significance of and does his or her best to combat the post - 9/11 political alliance between the ‘ Old Left ’ and militant Islam ” ) .
Image by : Matt Mahurin
But in the early days of Barack Obama ’s presidency , LGF has become better known for the various fights it picks with many on the right — including conservative bloggers , critics of Islamic extremism , and critics of Islam in general who used to be Johnson ’s fellow travelers .
Johnson has blasted Fox News host Glenn Beck , promoting a video from a Beck - inspired party that shows conservatives ranting about evolution and arguing that “ this turn toward the extreme right on the part of Fox News is troubling , and will achieve nothing in the long run except further marginalization of the GOP . ”
In response to the news that the Department of Homeland Security was watching for increased right - wing extremism — something that most of the conservative blogosphere , like most Republicans , responded to with angry ridicule — Johnson pointed to the recent arrests of right - wing terrorists and criticized bloggers for buying into “ distorted claims ” about the DHS report .
When Obama genuflected before King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia , Johnson found archival video of President Bush bowing to take a medal from the King and urged conservatives to turn down their “ hyperventilating nonsense . ”
This has the blogger ’s peers asking themselves the same question , over and over :
What the heck happened to Charles Johnson ?
“ I do n’t think I ’ve changed , ” Johnson said .
“ I ’ve always been pretty independent .
This is something I ’ve really tried to put out there on my blog .
I do n’t consider myself right - wing . ”
It sounds strange coming from a blogger who played an underrated role in forcing CBS News to back down from its 2004 story on President George W. Bush ’s Texas Air National Guard service , and whose first reaction to Obama ’s election in November — after a quick post congratulating him — was to note that the Muslim Brotherhood , “ the world ’s largest jihadist organization , ” was pleased .
Johnson supported Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) in 2008 , but he spent some of the campaign attacking anti-Obama conspiracy theorists , and he rejected the idea designs were malicious , rather than merely naive .
Johnson worries , in conversation and on his blog , that his old allies have been duped by far - right European political parties and have bought into wild attacks on the president that discredit their own causes .
“ I do n’t think there is an anti-jihadist movement anymore , ” Johnson said .
“ It ’s all a bunch of kooks .
I ’ve watched some people who I thought were reputable , and who I trusted , hook up with racists and Nazis .
I see a lot of them promoting stories and causes that I think are completely nuts . ”
Johnson ’s disgust with the terrorism - focused conservative blogosphere has had a traumatic effect on a dogged and dogmatic community of bloggers and scholars .
When Johnson began blogging about Islam and terrorism after 9/11 , he inspired untold other supporters of an aggressive war on terror to start their own Websites , link up , and push back against “ Dhimmitude ” — organizations and foreign policy decision makers that were “ soft ” on terrorism .
Now , some of his followers have started blogs that track Johnson ’s “ madness , ” while a video that portrays Johnson as Adolf Hitler going mad in his bunker makes the rounds .
“ He ’s the reason I started blogging , ” said Atlas Shrugs editor Pamela Geller , a New Yorker who says she was “ mugged by Sept. 11 ″ and started reading LGF for news and fellowship .
“ I wrote birthday messages to him .
I respected and admired him . ”
Robert Spencer , the director of JihadWatch and the author of the bestselling , “ Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam , ” had an established career as a critic of militant Islam before he met Johnson .
“ But right after 9/11 , he was the only one out there reporting on this , ” Spencer said .
“ He built my Website .
I learned how to blog from reading his stuff . ”
Johnson has turned hard against Spencer and Geller , attacking the former for joining a “ genocidal Facebook group , ” while referring to the latter as a “ shrieking lunatic , ” and labeling both of them “ hatebloggers . ”
Johnson now points to Geller ’s posts about Barack Obama ’s heritage and her quest to fund a headstone for the victim of a Muslim honor killing as proof that “ the woman is deranged . ”
Other bloggers in the movement have been purged from Johnson ’s blogroll or pilloried on the site , never to be mentioned again .
The most successful sites that arose in LGF ’s wake , including Gateway Pundit , Gates of Vienna , and Brussels Journal , are also on the outs .
While Johnson ’s own blog was a launchpad for the movement and his comment sections have often been a place for anti-Muslim and anti-liberal rage — one Web quiz lets users guess whether a quote comes from “ Little Green Footballs or Late German Fascists ” — Johnson believes that LGF is now policed for fringe activity .
“ A lot of the people most responsible for causing our bad reputation are now gone , ” he said .
“ I wrote all the backend software , and I have ways of cleaning up the site . ”
Johnson ’s former allies can pinpoint the month , if not the moment , when he started to turn on them .
In October 2007 , some of the leading terrorism - focused conservative bloggers flew to Belgium for a Counterjihad Summit sponsored in part by the Center for Vigilant Freedom ( now the International Civil Liberties Alliance ) , an outgrowth of the LGF - inspired blog Gates of Vienna .
“ It was the best conference I ever went to , ” remembered Geller .
But the summit included members of Vlaams Belang , a controversial Belgian political party that criticizes Islam and Shariah law , and had been attacked within the Netherlands for its connections to extremism and racism .
Johnson went to work exposing this , and the attendees reeled from the negative attention .
“ He chose to portray the Brussels Conference as evil and he unconscionably slandered the people who attended , ” said Dymphna , one of the editors of Gates of Vienna .
Baron Bodissey , the other site editor ( both editors use pen names ) , worries that Johnson “ did serious damage to the American blogosphere ’s view of European nationalists who oppose the EU , even those who have no anti-Semitic tendencies . ”
“ Not only that , ” said Bodissey , “ he made it harder for certain American anti-jihad groups to raise funds if they failed to repudiate his designated ‘ fascist - enablers ’ like us . ”
Johnson is unapologetic about his actions .
While he was attacking the attendees of the Counterjihad Summit , he was also blasting Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) for taking money from , and being photographed with , the owner of the extremist Web site Stormfront.org .
“ Some people at that summit in Belgium were not people we should have been associated with , ” Johnson said , pointing out that since 2007 the terrorism - focused conservative bloggers have become supporters of Dutch politician Geert Wilders , who wants to outlaw Islam in his country .
“ Some of these people outright want to ban Islam from the United States , which I think is crazy , completely nuts .
That ’s not something we do in this country .
These people will outright defend banning the Koran or deporting Muslims .
That ’s popular with the Geller / Spencer crowd . ”
When they talk about Johnson today , the rest of the terrorism - focused bloggers alternate between anger and regret .
He has smeared them , they say , and according to Dymphna he ’s “ destroyed a lot of networking that was beginning to emerge ” between American and European critics of Islamic extremism .
“ He ’s really gone off the deep end , ” Geller said , pointing to Johnson ’s more and more frequent criticisms of creationists , such as the attack on the anti-evolution , Glenn Beck - inspired event , which made the host angry enough to lash out at LGF on his show .
“ He ’s a leftist blogger now . ”
Johnson brushes that criticism aside .
“ A lot of people think I discovered this creationism thing overnight , ” he said , “ but that ’s not true .
I was posting about this before 9/11 .
After 9/11 I had other things on my mind .
And now I ’ve come back to it . ”
But Spencer accuses Johnson of losing sight of the threat of extremist Islam by obsessing over the American religious right and equating the two faiths .
“ There is no global movement of Christians trying to subjugate the world , ” Spencer said .
“ There is such a movement on the extreme of Islam .
I wrote a book called ‘ Religion of Peace ’ — which Johnson wrote a favorable review of — and I looked , and did n’t find , Christian extremists who were trying to replace the Constitution with Biblical law .
They ’re a myth .
They ’re the Santa Claus of the left . ”
Some of Johnson ’s former allies experienced a decrease in traffic numbers when he started attacking them , but they all now feel they ’ve recovered from the break .
“ LGF tried to destroy my reputation so I would n’t have the access I have to my sources in law enforcement and academia , ” said Spencer , “ but that has n’t happened . ”
Geller has rebounded with increased prominence — she was a guest on the Fox News show “ Red Eye ” last week — and she said she has survived the “ besmirching ” of her reputation and she now fills the information - spreading role that Johnson once did .
“ I get my stuff from people on the inside , ” she said , “ from people in Europe .
I field 800-900 emails a day .
We all depend on our readers for these tips .
That ’s where Charles was getting his stuff .
And now he ’s cracked and he ’s not getting that anymore . ”
Johnson brushes off that kind of criticism .
LGF is his site , and if it has to name names and shame the people who are debasing the movement against extremist Islam , he ’ll do it .
“ I ’ve definitely seen an uptick in craziness since the election , ” he sighs .
“ Well , I do n’t know if Geller got crazier .
She always was nuts . ”

These ants do not need males
An Amazonian ant has dispensed with sex and developed into an all - female species , researchers have found .
The ants reproduce via cloning - the queen ants copy themselves to produce genetically identical daughters .
This species - the first ever to be shown to reproduce entirely without sex - cultivates a garden of fungus , which also reproduces asexually .
The finding of the ants ' " world without sex " is published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Anna Himler , the biologist from the University of Arizona who led the research , told BBC News that the team used a battery of tests to verify their findings .
Unusual evolution By " fingerprinting " DNA of the ant species - Mycocepurus smithii - they found them all to be clones of the colony 's queen .
And when they dissected the female insects , they found them to be physically incapable of mating , as an essential part of their reproductive system known as the " mussel organ " had degenerated .
This species has evolved its own unusual mode of reproduction
Anna Himler
University of Arizona Asexual reproduction of males from unfertilised eggs is a normal part of some insect reproduction , but asexual reproduction of females is " exceedingly rare in ants " , wrote the researchers .
" In social insects , there are a number of different types of reproduction , " explained Dr Himler .
" But this species has evolved its own unusual mode . "
She and her colleagues do not know exactly why this particular species has become fully asexual , and how long ago the phenomenon evolved .
They are carrying out further genetic experiments , which will enable them to estimate how long ago the evolutionary change occurred .
No sex please
There are advantages to life without sex , Dr Himler explained .
" It avoids the energetic cost of producing males , and doubles the number of reproductive females produced each generation from 50 % to 100 % of the offspring . "
But combining genetic material in sexual reproduction gives future generations many more advantages .
" If we 're more diverse , we 're more resistant to parasites and disease , " explained Laurent Keller , an expert in social insects from the University of Lausanne .
" In a colony of clones , if one ant is susceptible to a parasite , they will all be susceptible .
So if you 're asexual , you normally do n't last very long .
" But in ants we 're seeing more and more reports of unusual methods of reproduction , " added Professor Keller , who was not involved in this study .
He also points out that social insects , like ants , may be particularly well suited to this type of reproduction because it enables the queen to control the caste and sex of all the offspring in her colony .
The first farmers Dr Himler 's interest in Mycocepurus smithii was originally sparked not by their unusually biased sex ratio , but by their ability to cultivate crops .
" Ants discovered farming long before we did - they have been cultivating fungus gardens for an estimated 80 million years .
More interested in gardening than sex " They collect plant material , insect faeces and even dead insects from the forest floor and feed it to their crops , " she said .
Many different species of ant - including the famous leafcutter ants - cultivate fungi , relying on it for nutrition .
But this particular species is able to grow " a greater number of crops than other ant species " , she explained .
" When we started to study this species more closely , we just were n't finding any males .
That 's when we started to look at them in a different way . "
Since the fungus crop reproduces asexually , Dr Himler thinks it might give the ants some kind of advantage " not to operate under the usual constraints of sexual reproduction " .
" There is certainly more work to be done in this system , " she added .
" We 're quite excited about the direction this research might take us , and its implications . "

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
The government threatened to oust Bank of America Chief Executive Ken Lewis if the bank did n't go through with its acquisition of struggling investment bank Merrill Lynch , according to the results of an investigation by New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo released Thursday .
Hank Paulson , Treasury secretary at the time , told Lewis in December that the management and board of directors of Bank of America BAC , +1.15 % would be removed if the deal was n't closed , Cuomo said in a letter summarizing his findings to regulators and legislators .
Paulson told Cuomo's office that he made the threat at the request of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , according to Cuomo 's letter .
Read the full letter here .
Federal regulators also warned Lewis that a meltdown of the financial system could be triggered if the deal fell through .
This and other facts unearthed by the probe raise questions about the transparency of the government 's Troubled Asset Relief Program , as well as corporate governance and disclosure practices at Bank of America , Cuomo wrote .
Cuomo's findings show how aggressive the Treasury and the Fed have been in trying to stabilize the financial system in the face of the worst credit crisis and recession for decades .
Paulson told Lewis that if Bank of America pulled out of the Merrill deal , that would create " systemic risk , " Cuomo said in the letter .
Systemic risk usually refers to a damaging domino effect in which the collapse of a major financial institution leads to more failures .
The revelations may also put Lewis in a more precarious position .
Bank of America 's annual meeting is on April 29 and some shareholders have been calling for Lewis to step down .
CtW Investment Group , which helps union pension funds be more active investors , is calling for Bank of America shareholders to vote against Lewis , lead director O. Temple Sloan and governance committee chair Thomas Ryan at the meeting .
CtW said Thursday that Cuomo's findings suggest Lewis went ahead with the Merrill deal to protect his job , rather than because it was in the best interests of Bank of America investors .
" Mr. Lewis and the board owe their fiduciary obligation to the corporation and its shareholders , not to the regulators who reportedly pressed them to close the deal , " CtW said in a statement .
" He and his board violated their legal duties to shareholders in order to protect their own employment interests . "
Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri said the company believes it " acted legally and appropriately with regard to the Merrill Lynch transaction . "
Bank of America 's directors stressed in a Dec. 22 meeting that they were n't " persuaded or influenced " by the government 's threat to oust management and the board , according to minutes of the meeting disclosed by Cuomo .
However , Cuomo said that Lewis admitted that Paulson 's threat " changed his mind " about pulling out of the Merrill deal .
With so much riding on the Merrill acquisition and the government so deeply involved , Lewis and Bank of America had to consider more than just the short - term interests of investors .
Lewis also weighed " serious concerns " about the health of the U.S. financial system and the damage that a broad collapse might do to Bank of America when deciding to go through with the Merrill deal , according to minutes of a Dec. 30 board meeting that were released by Cuomo .
Disclosure
Bank of America agreed to buy Merrill on Sept. 15 , in the midst of the financial crisis , and shareholders approved the deal on Dec. 5 .
Soon after that , Merrill finalized billions of dollars in bonuses , according to Cuomo 's letter .
Merrill 's losses then began mounting quickly and ended up reaching roughly $ 15 billion in the fourth quarter -- $ 7 billion more than was projected before Bank of America shareholders voted on the acquisition and Merrill set its bonuses , Cuomo recounted .
" These additional losses , some of which had become known to Bank of America executives prior to the merger vote , were not disclosed to shareholders until mid-January 2009 , two weeks after the merger had closed , " Cuomo wrote .
Martin Bryant was not the first toddler to love wandering , to show a spirit for adventure or levels of energy that could try a saint .
But his mum 's response was an unusual one : " I started to leave him on the house veranda , with a harness and lead to secure him , with plenty of toys all around him .
Some person made a complaint about us tying him up like a dog .
But of course as his mother , I knew he was happy and safe . "
For Carleen , Martin 's energy appeared unmanageable .
His father , Maurice , however , saw nothing abnormal - a disagreement and pattern of response to their son that began early and was to colour the couple 's parenting style throughout his life .
For Carleen , coping with Martin was a daily reality , a problem of strategy , logistics and survival .
There would be little time for physical affection or for day - to - day nurture in such dire circumstances .
Maurice 's fathering was different : hands - on , intense and , as time went on , driven by the desire to normalise the boy .
Decades later , Carleen would recall , without bitterness , her disappointment and frustrations with her son , such as the day he swallowed a nail , the lack of cuddles , his slow speech development .
Other problems were appearing , too : while he ran and climwbed and wandered the neighbourhood , his fine motor skills were impaired and he did not seem to be maturing .
By the time Martin was three years old , it was clear something was seriously amiss .
Enrolment at primary school only highlighted Bryant 's impaired development , sparking a cycle of rejection , isolation and solitude ...
" He used to walk around with his face all squinted up , as if the sun was too bright , " one former classmate recalled , the imprint of Bryant 's oddness already heavy .
He stood out as a loner at New Town Primary in Forster Street , not by choice but simply because he was so different that it would drive the others away .
Efforts to make friends were misinterpreted as aggravating , such as his " silly games " of creeping up and leaping on other kids as they walked home after school .
The message was clear that he did not belong .
If he was caught in the chase through the laneways , Martin would cry and squeal as if he was being hurt : " We 'd always let him go because we felt sorry for him , " one would recall .
As Bryant moved into his teens , the theatrical , high - voltage child of primary school was replaced by a high - school recluse ...
Maurice had given his son an air rifle for his 14th birthday .
It was the worst decision he ever made because it introduced Martin to the power of firearms .
It coincided with a marked change in behaviour .
Martin took to hiding in a creek bed alongside the house and firing at passing traffic or wildly out into the bay at night .
There is a chilling story of the day he shot a parrot out of a tree , then walked up to the dead bird and fired several more slugs into its head .
He was also blamed for untying boats from moorings .
It was around this time that his schoolmate , Greg , ended their friendship after Martin stuck the point of a spear gun into the top of his head .
On Friday , May 6 , 1983 , the day before his 16th birthday , Bryant left school ...
The decision to take Martin out of school was vindicated in February 1984 when Maurice and Carleen took him to a clinical psychiatrist , ostensibly to assess him for a pension .
Dr Eric Cunningham
Dax was an esteemed psychiatrist who had helped establish community mental health awareness services in Tasmania as well as a research unit .
Remembers Carleen : " It did n't take him long to see that Martin had a problem .
Martin was not able to concentrate on what Dr Dax was saying and interrupted him to talk about the age of the house and the fireplace in the room .
After a few more consultations
Dr Dax said Martin would be unemployable as he would upset and annoy people to the extent he would always be in trouble .
He would have to be put on a disability pension . "
Cunningham Dax , who died in 2008 , made an even more profound assessment and warning .
His surviving case notes state : " Cannot read or write .
Does a bit of gardening and watches TV ...
Only his parents ' efforts that prevent further deterioration .
Could be schizophrenic and parents face a bleak future with him . "
Under the constant care and vigilance of Maurice , Bryant passed the next three years uneventfully .
Then , in early 1987 , he met 54 - year - old heiress Helen Mary Elizabeth Harvey , whose grandfather , David Hastie Harvey , had been general manager to George Adams , creator of the Tattersall 's gambling empire ...
Helen Harvey did manage to hold down an office job with the Tasmanian Railways for a few years , according to all accounts , but at the age of 28 , after the premature death of her father , quit to spend the rest of her life with her mother in the imposing family home , Wibruna , at No. 30 Clare Street , New Town .
By the mid-1980s , Helen and her ageing mother were virtual recluses within the square white walls of Wibruna , a faintly art deco structure perched well above the street as if peering down on its less well - to - do neighbours but forever hidden behind a garden that was almost as neglected as the two women within .
The shopkeepers in the small collection of stores on New Town Road regarded Helen as an eccentric but essentially harmless character ; heavyset , missing a couple of teeth , with a whiff of body odour , combined with ageing clothes desperate for a wash and some air .
She loved to chat with them , often talking about her Hollywood " friends " , Errol Flynn and Rock Hudson , with whom she insisted she was in contact .
According to Carleen , it was Martin who found Helen one day in early 1987 while wandering the neighbourhood streets , as was his wont , during lonely afternoons while his father , Maurice , was at work .
Now almost 20 , he was treading water but existing with an established routine of mowing lawns and vegetable rounds but always on the lookout for new customers .
He noticed the overgrown grounds through the iron fence , and decided to knock at the door .
The woman who answered agreed that he do some work for her , and a friendship was forged , almost on the spot .
Perhaps they had an intuition about each other , an echo that both struggled with the misunderstanding of the outside world .
Soon , Helen provided Martin with regular work doing the gardening and odd jobs such as feeding the 40 or so cats living in the garage .
There were already 14 dogs living inside the house .
They had the run of the downstairs rooms while Helen and her mother seemed happy to live confined to the upper level of the house in two bedrooms on opposing sides .
The two misfits forged a bond .
Martin had found someone who did n't see the contradictions that turned others away ; a good - looking young man with an easy grin who revealed his disabilities , social and intellectual , the minute he opened his mouth .
Much later , forensic psychiatrist Professor Paul Mullen asked Bryant about the relationship with Helen Harvey : " He describes Miss Harvey as having been his only real friend .
He said from the outset they got on well together .
It was not a sexual relationship . "
The tragic consequences of their relationship , however , began early .
As the friendship moved from employer - employee to friends and then constant companions , Helen 's mother , Hilza , was left increasingly alone inside what was fast becoming a filthy hell hole .
She had been moved downstairs into the kitchen at some stage , and it was here that the old woman was forced to sleep , upright in a chair , writhing and wriggling in a bid to gain relief from an undiagnosed and untreated broken hip for most of the last two years of her life .
In June 1990 , after someone made a report to the health authorities , medics arrived to find both Hilza and Helen in need of urgent hospital treatment with infected leg ulcers and living in squalor in the kitchen , surrounded not only by roaming animals , but unwashed dishes and saucepans and bowls with mould so high it was climbing out of the oven .
Seventy - nine - year - old Hilza Harvey was an abject horror of neglect , sitting untended with her broken hip and withering slowly in the kitchen on her chair .
As horrified as they were , the ambulance officers cast no judgement on the situation .
Hilza 's deterioration was rapid .
After several weeks in hospital , she was moved to a nursing home where she died at the end of July .
The RSPCA took away most of the animals while Helen recovered in hospital .
A clean - up order was also placed on the house , and Maurice Bryant took it upon himself to take long - service leave and attempt to co-ordinate the job with his son .
It took three months to scrape the filth from the floors , walls and surfaces of almost every room .
A dozen skips were filled with rubbish while Helen 's entire wardrobe had to be thrown away .
It was as if her previous life was removed , allowing her to start again in a pristine environment with a new live - in companion , Martin Bryant .
The strange couple spent days wandering the shops looking for new ways to spend money and add to the growing collections at home .
Their ventures were most often in the afternoon after a leisurely lunch in a local restaurant .
Car dealers , in particular , loved the funny couple .
Registration records would show " The Tatts Lady " , as many of the shopkeepers referred to Helen , also collected and hoarded cars , buying 50 in her lifetime ; some during a splurge in the 1970s but most in the few strange but happy years with Martin Bryant .
Some vehicles were kept a few months , others a matter of weeks and , occasionally , just a few days .
And yet , despite the friendship , Bryant was changing , his moods darkening and becoming more erratic .
Behaviour that could previously be ascribed to his inept social skills and intellectual shortcomings was deteriorating : stupid pranks began to give way to outright threats and an increasingly quick - to - flare temper .
It was not to be his parents or Helen who would raise the alarm and insist that he undergo a new assessment .
Indeed , Martin Bryant may never have been reassessed at all had it not been for the requirements of the social security system - and even then , this chilling assessment that would allow him to remain on the disability pension was attached to his file and forgotten : " Father protects him from any occasion which might upset him as he continually threatens violence ...
Martin tells me he would like to go around shooting people .
It would be unsafe to allow Martin out of his parents ' control . "
For Maurice , the ever - patient father , it was confirmation of his darkest fears .
The quietly spoken , unassuming Englishman knew Martin was getting worse as he grew up .
It was he who had taken on the role of a restraint ; he had become the human equivalent of the leash his wife had used to tie the child to the veranda and keep him under control .
Increasingly fearful and despondent , in November 1991 Maurice filed a will with the Public Trustee 's office .
The document , succinct and without emotional flourish , recognised that his son would find it difficult to manage life in the event of his father 's passing .
Maurice bequeathed the family home in New Town to Carleen or , in the event of her death , its division between his two children .
Martin would require extra resources and so he left him the proceeds of the superannuation fund held with Commonwealth Life Policy No. 10311246 , worth more than $ 250,000 .
Maurice must have told Helen Harvey about his will because three weeks later she filed her own , naming Maurice Bryant as a trustee .
She left her fortune to " my friend Martin Bryant for his own absolute use and benefit " .
The phrase would be repeated four times in the paragraphs where she bequeathed her worldly goods , her livestock , her animals and birds , her Clare Street mansion , a farm in Copping and her Tattersall 's income .
Martin Bryant , the increasingly unstable misfit , became a multimillionaire in waiting .
By this stage , Harvey and Bryant had moved to a rundown , 29 - hectare property in Copping , a village halfway between Hobart and Port Arthur .
The property , which they had named Taurusville , alleviated their frustration at no longer being allowed to keep animals at the house in Clare Street .
The first animals were bought within weeks of moving in ...
The neighbours watched Bryant with growing concern , avoiding him at all costs and refusing the occasional eccentric offers of friendship .
He was unpredictable , erratic , changing from foolhardy schoolboy to temperamental spoiled brat - or worse - in seconds .
Some remembered a wild - eyed boy who appeared to take delight in firing his air rifle at tourists as they stopped to buy apples at a stall on the highway .
Bryant 's dress changed , too , from his preferred white overalls and red cardigan to the natty pretensions of the country squire , complete with cravat .
For some neighbours , his penchant for roaming the properties in the dead of night provoked a palpable fear as he was hardly ever seen but the dogs would bark madly , sensing an intruder , and then they would hear the sound of gunfire - the air rifle Bryant carried with him everywhere .
Home may have changed but the rhythm of life had not .
Helen and Bryant still rose late , wandered listlessly , shopping and eating , often leaving their car full of animals parked in the local village .
The odd sight of a car with dogs , cats and even miniature ponies jammed in the back seat began to disturb locals .
Rumours about the couple abounded , fuelled by their habit of leaving cash strewn around the house , under books and secreted , in big rolls of notes , in odd places such as ice - cream containers .
What the odd visitor saw in the house only added to the couple 's mystique , although , in truth , much of what was left around the place was due to carelessness rather than strategy .
Martin had become a dangerous , potentially lethal passenger in a moving car .
Helen simply could not predict when the 25 - year - old , who had still not learned to drive and would never attempt to get a licence for fear of failure , would reach across her and wrench the steering wheel .
It was the reason she had taken to crawling along the gentle but narrow country roads , never travelling above 60 k mh .
Twice she had run off the road while trying to fend him off , once running up against an embankment and the other time into a drain .
Martin's was not a death wish but a sudden , childlike impulse , one he could neither control nor suppress .
Worse still , he had no ability to understand the potentially fatal consequences of his actions .
On October 20 , 1992 , he and Helen loaded three dogs into their Mazda 121 and headed north to do some shopping in one of the larger towns along the highway .
It was after 5 pm when they started back for the farm .
Sunset was still more than an hour away , but the light was fading as the sun lowered towards the hilltops behind Hobart .
As they entered a straight , uphill stretch of road just over a kilometre west of the town of Copping itself , something happened .
There are those who believe that Martin probably succumbed to another impulse and reached over and grabbed the wheel , forcing the car to the wrong side of the road .
Bryant himself told police that Helen had been distracted by dogs fighting in the back seat , and his last recollection was turning to look back at the dogs and Helen veering to cross the double white lines and straight into the path of an oncoming Ford sedan .
When police arrived at the scene , they found Helen dead behind the wheel , her neck snapped by the impact .
One of the dogs lay dead in the back seat and another on the verge .
The third had survived and would be found back at Taurusville a few days later .
Martin Bryant was in the passenger seat , barely alive with serious neck injuries : X - rays would reveal two fractured vertebrae .
The bereavement notice posted by Maurice Bryant in The Mercury newspaper a few days later was poignant in its simplicity : " From quiet homes and first beginning " Out to undiscovered ends ,
" There 's nothing worth the wear of winning " But laughter and the love of friends . "
Martin settled back into the family home to see out his long and painful convalescence .
He had lost Helen , his best friend and maternal companion , and her loss had a profound impact .
Despite his father 's attentiveness , Martin began to regress , desperately seeking new relationships to replace the old .
This time , he turned his attention to much younger children and began pestering kids as young as nine to join in their games .
" The kids were wary of him , " one neighbour would recount .
" They understood instinctively that he was someone to stay away from .
He was just a little scary . "
A few weeks after Helen 's death , Maurice had felt so low he had visited the family GP , Dr Bernard Mather , complaining about a sense of constant anxiety and encroaching sadness and depression .
It was the second time in six months he had asked for help , unusual in a man usually so stoic .
Mather prescribed Prothiaden , a tricyclic antidepressant .
In his burgeoning internal desperation , Maurice knew it was impossible for Martin to manage the fortune he had inherited without some help and feared he would fritter it away if he was not around to stop him .
Maurice decided that a court order , under the Mental Health Act , was the only way to take control of Martin 's financial affairs and have them managed independently .
This way , his son would be given a stipend that he could spend as he wished , but the money would be doled out in a controlled way to ensure it lasted for life .
This was not the only arrangement Maurice was organising .
Secretly , he had put his and his wife 's joint bank accounts in Carleen 's name alone and signed the bills for household utilities over to her .
A few days later , on Friday , August 13 , 1993 , Maurice Bryant drove to Copping for the weekend .
Carleen did n't question the time her husband wanted to spend alone but became anxious when he telephoned about 7.30 that evening .
He sounded particularly quiet and withdrawn : " Over all the years when any of us would travel to Port Arthur , we would always telephone to say we had arrived safely .
On Friday evening Maurice telephoned and said very little other than ' I love you ' .
At the time I was surprised , as he had not said that before when calling , and so I assumed he had had a few drinks . "
Maurice made another call that night , to daughter Lindy in Queensland to tell her he loved her .
He did not make a call to his son .
The next morning a man came to the front door of the Copping farmhouse to answer an advertisement for a horse float .
No one answered but pinned to the door was a note in Maurice 's handwriting : " Call the police . "
By mid-morning , police had scrambled to the property , bringing in 20 cadets and local rural fire service volunteers to help scour the hillside .
It took two days to find the body .
Maurice Bryant was lying face down in almost three metres of water in the dam at the back of the house .
His body was weighed down with Martin 's diving belt strung bandolier fashion around his neck and across his torso .
There was a strip of the anti-anxiety drug Serepax in his pocket .
Eighteen of the 30mg tablets were missing .
Martin bryant 's loss was close to complete .
Helen was gone and so was his father .
He was now rudderless , floating without a goal or his dad 's gentle moral compass .
As Stella Sampson , his former teacher , would later tell the media : " My personal view is that his dad kept him in check , and when he died he did n't have that restraining influence any longer . "
He would appear at a suburban cafe for afternoon tea in the grey linen suit and lizard skin shoes of a roue , sporting a rakish Panama hat .
He would tell the sympathetic ladies behind the counter at the shopping - centre sandwich bar that he was carrying a briefcase because he had a job earning $ 400 a week .
There was also an unforgettable electric blue suit with flared trousers and ruffled shirt he wore to the North Hobart restaurant where he was a regular .
The owner , Chris Jackman , recalled the response : " It was horrible .
Everyone was laughing at him , even the customers .
I really felt suddenly quite sorry for him .
I realised this guy did n't really have any friends .
He was like a child , trying to impress everybody .
He struck me as a very eager sort of young guy , like a labrador puppy .
Always having something to say , always trying to impress . "
In December 1993 , flush with funds , he decided to venture outside the little world of Hobart and see what he might find elsewhere .
He had been paid his first regular stipend from the Tattersall 's coffers and bought himself an air ticket , first to Melbourne and then on to Singapore .
He managed to stay away just three days before returning home .
In April 1994 , however , not long after selling the Copping farm , he went further .
This time he travelled to Melbourne , took a flight to Bangkok and continued on to London , Sweden and Los Angeles before flying back to Melbourne on May 7 .
In the two years to the end of 1995 , Bryant visited Europe six times and the US and South - East Asia three times , as well as New Zealand and Japan .
The summary of his domestic travel over the same period would take three pages to list , travelling to Queensland and South Australia but most often to Melbourne , where he loved the zoo .
But had the travel filled the void ?
No , he would tell Professor Mullen : " Mr Bryant stated that the best part of his international trips was the long plane journey .
It transpired that the attraction of the long aeroplane journey was that he could speak to the people next to him , who presumably being strapped to their seats had no choice but to at least appear friendly .
Mr Bryant became quite animated in describing some of what he regarded as the more successful interactions with fellow travellers .
This account is confirmed by statements obtained by the police from passengers who found themselves seated next to Mr Bryant . "
Martin Bryant was not just a young man born with a personality disorder , intellectually impaired and struggling with autistic traits .
His genetic load was the baggage he carried with him into life .
What occurred around him , a devoted and vigilant father who effectively managed him - and an heiress mentor and eccentric friend - were equally important , creating a cushion around him that for a long period of his life protected him from reality .
More importantly , they acted as constraints that impeded or at least diffused , and gave an outlet for , his most obsessive tendencies .
Once Helen and his father were gone , Bryant was left to his mounting frustrations , his angers , his resentment of rejection and social misunderstanding .
The media defends executive bonuses
By Tom Eley
21 March 2009
On Friday , the US media intensified its counterattack against " populist outrage " over the AIG bonuses .
Cast aside was the argument that the same CEOs who have ruined their corporations and the larger economy merit their big pay days , as New York Times columnist Andrew Sorkin argued with apparent seriousness on March 17 .
( " New York Times columnist who demanded concessions from auto workers , ' makes case ' for AIG bonuses " )
In its stead were other arguments .
The most typical is little more than blackmail .
The media , echoing Wall Street , claims that should Congress in any way limit the pay packages of top CEOs , the latter could thwart the economic recovery , essentially holding the world ransom to their personal enrichment — an argument Sorkin also pioneered .
Thus , Charles Krauthammer , the Washington Post 's far - right columnist , warns " the AIG debt manipulators ... may be the only ones who know how to defuse the bomb they themselves built . "
( " Bonfire of the Trivialities " ) New York Times columnist David Brooks tells us that politicians " risk destroying the entire bank - rescue plan because of [ the AIG ] bonuses . "
( " Perverse Cosmic Myopia " )
In the Wall Street Journal , Ian Bremmer and Sean West of the risk - consulting firm Eurasia Group warn that should the Obama administration " pander to an angry public , " it " may scare potential investors away from bailout recipients because they cannot trust our government 's will ... "
( " AIG and ‘ Political Risk ' " )
Another Post columnist , Michael Gerson , laments that " congressional demagoguery is compromising " Geithner 's efforts to rescue the financial industry .
" Geithner has floated the idea of ... giv[ ing ] loans or subsidies to mutual funds and hedge funds if they buy toxic securities .
But few would make such a risky investment without the hope of large returns . "
( " Commanding the Heights of Hypocrisy " )
The Post 's liberal economics commentator Steven Pearlstein elaborates on this argument at length .
" There 's a danger in letting this outrage get to the point that it undermines the effort to contain the financial crisis , " he warns ( " Let's Put Down the Pitchforks " ) .
" This is n't about fairness , " Pearlstein continues .
[ T ]he reality is that we can punish the bankers or we can save the banking system , but we can't do both at the same time . "
To Pearlstein , in other words , no approach to the economic crisis is possible that does not begin and end with the enrichment of the bankers .
Pearlstein asks his readers to sympathize with the plight of the financial elite .
" But how eager do you think private equity and hedge funds will be to invest those billions of dollars if they fear that their participation will subject them to front - page accusations , congressional inquiries and public outrage over how much they might be paying for bonuses or employee travel or office decoration ? , " Pearlstein implores .
" Will they participate if they think that Congress , in a moment of populist pique , will try to tax back their profits if they earn more than originally expected ? "
Pearlstein takes it for granted that the bankers and hedge fund managers have the inalienable right to earn a profit off their largely self - created disaster .
To understand this , one really must view things from the vantage point of the " financiers , " Pearlstein explains .
" As the financiers see it , " he tells us , there is a problem with " a government that is [ an ] unreliable partner , that tries to micromanage their businesses and changes the rules of the game with every zig and zag of public opinion . "
This , he concludes , " is the financiers ' view and one we need to be mindful of , since at this point we need their money and cooperation as much as they need ours . "
We should have little doubt that Post 's economics columnist , who rubs elbows with the " financiers , " is accurately articulating their outlook .
The financial aristocracy , Pearlstein threatens , is not a power to be trifled with .
Pearlstein also claims it is too late to really do anything about the AIG bonuses — a position he shares with President Obama .
In this vein , Pearlstein allows that " we 're angry . "
But , he quickly adds , " the reality is that no matter what we do now , tens of trillion of dollars in wealth have been lost . "
This argument sets up a false distinction between " executive compensation " and the plundering of the economy .
In fact the former process is but the most noxious expression of the latter .
Executives and top investors made vast fortunes not because they contributed anything of value to the economy , but precisely because they liquidated productive capacity and purged jobs from " the real economy " for their personal benefit .
The AIG bonuses were entirely in keeping with the culture of plunder that has typified American capitalism for decades .
The media defenders of the AIG bonuses have also argued that the amount of money in question is inconsequential .
Nothing could more clearly reveal the class bias and the privileged social world these media figures inhabit .
So Times columnist Brooks refers to the AIG bonuses as " dust bunnies under the bed . "
For his part , Krauthammer reassures us that " in the scheme of things , $ 165 million is a rounding error . "
But on February 6 , Krauthammer was busy singling out for censure the Milwaukee public schools — for potentially receiving half that sum !
To Krauthammer , public school construction is " pork , " " such as the $ 88.6 million for new construction " in Milwaukee .
But $ 165 million in bonuses for AIG executives ?
A mere " rounding error , " really .
( " The Fierce Urgency of Pork " ) .
While $ 165 million may be a trifle to Krauthammer and his milieu , it is a king 's ransom to workers .
The top bonus paid out at AIG , $ 6.4 million , represents about 128 times the median annual US household income .
Another typical response , particularly from the liberal media , has been to ridicule the popular outrage over the bonuses with the vaguely pejorative moniker " populist , " a term meant to connote ignorance .
These arguments reveal a degree of hatred and fear .
The nation 's top columnists are horrified that the public mood has shifted against the culture of greed that they have worked for so long to promote .
According to Pearlstein , popular anger " feels good and is a way for a political system to let off some steam before a more dangerous explosion occurs . "
Post columnist Michael Kinsley demands to know why Americans are angry over the AIG bailout in the first place .
" In short , you knew about this , if you cared , " Kinsley writes to his readership .
" So why did n't your self - righteous populist fury boil over before now ? "
Part of this populist fury , Kinsley says , " has a know - nothing , bullying quality that I do n't like " ( " Bonuses on a Slow Boil " ) .
Brenner and West warn that " pandering to [ public outrage ] jeopardizes the administration 's credentials in a sloppy attempt to score populist points . "
Alas , " the financial - sector rescue necessitates unpopular actions . "
The media has also moved to place the blame for executive bonuses not on those who have reaped the windfall , but those who have born its brunt — the American people .
So Pearlstein lectures , " A final point on outrage : We need to save some of it for ourselves . "
" It was we who ran up the credit card bills , we who drew down the equity in our homes and we who refused to tax ourselves for the government services we demanded , " he adds .
" Wall Street bankers may have been the pushers , but it was we Americans who became addicted to the easy credit . "
This is thoroughly dishonest .
In the first place , Pearlstein is not speaking for " we Americans , " as he claims .
The Post columnist is part of a privileged layer of multimillionaires .
He speaks , as his column makes clear , for the CEOs , bankers , and hedge fund managers .
Working class Americans " ran up credit card bills " and " drew down the equity in [ their ] homes " not because they made foolish decisions , as the well - heeled Pearlstein implies .
They did so to pay for college tuition , major health procedures , and for basic consumer goods .
They borrowed , in other words , in order to survive .
The financial aristocracy has benefited from the impoverishment of the working class three times over .
First , beginning in the late 1970s they cut jobs and gutted basic industry , transferring vast social wealth into financial speculation .
Then , from the 1980s on , they relentlessly promoted to impoverished workers various forms of debt and credit , including subprime mortgages .
This debt the financiers packaged , sold and resold , creating unfathomable fortunes in the process .
Now the financiers , with this mountain of speculation and paper values crashing down about their ears , are profiting from yet another swindle .
With the politicians and media figures like Pearlstein hard at work on their behalf , they have been handed trillions of dollars in government funds .
Capitalism 's media spokesmen insist that the financial elite will brook no limitation , no matter how slight , on how they will dispose of these funds .
