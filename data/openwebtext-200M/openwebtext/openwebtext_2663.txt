Washington
THE 1931 collapse of the Austrian bank Creditanstalt provoked financial panic across Europe and almost single - handedly turned a bad downturn into the Great Depression .
Last week , when I read about the brewing European banking crisis , I suddenly began to dread that history might be repeating itself .
You might think that my worries are a bit late .
After all , losses on subprime mortgages in the United States have already caused a Depression - like banking collapse .
Well , believe it or not , Europe ’s current crisis is scarier .
For while losses on Eastern European debts may be only a small fraction of those on subprime mortgages , the continent ’s problems are politically harder to solve , and their consequences may prove to be much worse .
Much as in our subprime mess , Eastern Europe ’s problems began with easy credit .
From 2004 to 2008 Eastern Europe had its own bubble , fueled by the ready availability of international credit .
In recent years countries like Bulgaria and Latvia borrowed annually the equivalent of more than 20 percent of their gross domestic product from abroad .
By 2008 , 13 countries that were once part of the Soviet empire had accumulated a collective debt to foreign banks or in foreign currencies of more than $ 1 trillion .
Some of the money went into investment , much of it into consumption or real estate .
When the music stopped last year and banks retrenched , the flow of new capital to Eastern Europe came to an abrupt halt , and then reversed direction .
This credit crunch hit the region just as its main export markets in Western Europe were going into free fall .
Moreover , with so much of the debt denominated in foreign currencies , everyone in Eastern Europe has been scrambling to get their hands on foreign exchange and local currencies have collapsed .
As a Tribute to the Notorious B.I.G .
Assignment :
Please translate the following song lyrics from ebonics to standard English .
Artist : Notorious B.I.G .
Album : Ready to Die
Song :
One more chance ( remix )
First things first , I poppa , freaks all the honeys Dummies - playboy bunnies , those wantin ' money
Those the ones I like ' cause they do n't get nathan '
But penetration , unless it smells like sanitation Garbage , I turn like doorknobs Heart throb , never , black and ugly as ever However , I stay coochied down to the socks Rings and watch filled with rocks
TRANSLATION :
As a general rule , I perform deviant sexual acts with women of all kinds , including but not limited to those with limited intellect , nude magazine models , and whores .
I particularly enjoy sexual encounters with the latter group as they are generally disappointed in the fact that they only receive penile intercourse and nothing more , unless of course , they douche on a consistent basis .
Although I am extremely unattractive , I am able to engage in these types of sexual acts with some regularity .
Perhaps my sexuality is somehow related to my fancy and expensive jewelry .
Lyrics :
And my jam knock in the Mitsubishi Girls pee pee when they see me , Nava - hoes creep me in they tee pee
As I lay down laws like I lay carpet Stop it - if you think your gonna make a profit
TRNSL :
I enjoy playing my music loudly on my car stereo .
Apparently , women enjoy this also because they become sexually aroused when they see me driving .
Oddly enough , when I visit the Native American reservations , some of the more sexually promiscuous Indian women attempt to seduce me in their homes .
Their intent is to divest me of my earnings .
Such actions are unacceptable .
Lyrics :
Do n't see my ones , do n't see my guns - get it Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it then split it In two as I flow with the Junior Mafia I do n't know what the hell 's stoppin ' ya I'm clockin ' ya - Versace shades watchin ' ya Once ya grin , I 'm in game , begin
TRNSL :
Understand this fact : you can have neither my money , nor my weapons .
I suggest that you inform your peers that we engaged in violent sexual acts .
Currently , I am rapping with my associates , the Junior Mafia .
I 'm having some difficulty understanding why you refuse to approach me .
I am attempting to make eye contact with you through my expensive glasses , and as soon as you respond with a smile , I will approach you .
Lyrics :
First I talk about how I dress and this And diamond necklaces - stretch Lexuses
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get Deeper and deeper - help ya reach the Climax that your man can't make Call and tell him you 'll be home real late Let 's sing the break
TRNSL :
I prefer to open the conversation with light banter about my wardrobe and jewelry , then I like to discuss my collection of expensive cars .
This is more than enough to convince you to have sexual intercourse with me .
I am able to insert my penis further into you when I enter you from behind .
Furthermore , you will be able to reach orgasm .
I understand this to be a problem with your current sexual partner .
He need n't be concerned about your whereabouts .
Please phone him and inform him that you wo n't be home for a while .
By the way , please sing the chorus of the song for me also .
Lyrics :
She 's sick of that song on how it 's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is - major pain like Damon Wayans Low down dirty even like his brother Keenan Schemin ' - do n't bring your girl ' round me True player for real , ask Puff Daddy
TRNSL :
Your current love interest no longer wishes to hear your fabrications about the length of your member .
After I had sexual intercourse with your woman , she became enlightened as to the proper way it is supposed to be performed ; violently and immorally .
It would be in your best interest to keep your woman away from me as my sexual prowess is very strong .
If you are unconvinced , ask Puff Daddy .
Lyrics :
You - ringin ' bells with bags from Chanel Baby Benz , traded in your Hyundai Excel Fully equipped , CD changer with the cell
She beeped me , meet me at twelve
TRNSL :
Despite the fact that you attempted to win her at her doorstep with bags full of expensive clothes and a car ( the lower end model Mercedes Benz which you financed by signing over your current vehicle ) containing an expensive stereo and a cellular phone , your woman has contacted me through my pager indicating that we should rendezvous at midnight .
Lyrics :
Where you at ?
Flippin ' jobs , playin ' car notes ?
While I 'm swimmin ' in ya women like the breast stroke Right stroke , left stroke what 's the best stroke Death stroke - tongue all down her throat Nuthin ' left to do but send her home to you I 'm through - can ya sing the song for me , boo ?
TRNSL :
You , on the other hand , jump from job to job , barely able to maintain payments on the Mercedes Benz you purchased for your woman .
Meanwhile , I continue to engage in sexual intercourse and commit lewd osculatory acts with your women .
My only remaining option is to request that they leave my home and return to you because I have reached orgasm and no longer have a need for their presence .
Lyrics :
So , what 's it gonna be ?
Him or me ?
We can cruise the world with pearls Gator boots for girls
The envy of all women , crushed linen Cartier wrist - wear with diamonds in 'em
The finest women I love with a passion Ya man 's a wimp , I give that ass a good thrashin '
TRNSL :
The ultimate decision rests with you .
Whom do you choose as your sexual partner .
I can take you on cruises around the world .
I will dress you in the finest jewelry and footwear .
You will be envied by women worldwide in your fine clothes and jewelry .
There is a special place in my heart for beautiful women .
I will defeat your man in an altercation because he is effeminate .
Lyrics :
High fashion - flyin ' into all states Sexin ' me while your man masturbates
Is n't this great ?
Your flight leaves at eight
Her flight lands at nine , my game just rewinds Lyrically I 'm supposed to represent I 'm not only the client , I 'm the player president
TRNSL :
You will be dressed in finest clothes on the runways of Paris .
I will fly you to every state to shop for fine clothes and jewelry .
You will enjoy sexual intercourse with me and your man will be forced to pleasure himself through manual stimulation .
What a life !
I 'll return you to LaGuardia in time to catch your 8 o'clock flight .
The timing is perfect because I have scheduled a date with a second woman who arrives at the same gate at 9 o'clock .
I 'll seduce her in the same way that I seduced you .
I rap well and I am a positive reflection of my hometown .
Not only am I a sexually deviant , misogynistic , immoral , wealthy , male prostitute , but I also sit on the board of directors of the organization that governs others of my kind .
EU antitrust regulators are expected to say this week that Intel illegally paid computer makers to postpone or cancel the launch of products containing chips made by its main rival , sources familiar with the case said on Sunday .
AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - EU antitrust regulators are expected to say this week that Intel Corp illegally paid computer makers to postpone or cancel the launch of products containing chips made by its main rival , sources familiar with the case said on Sunday .
The European Commission is set to decide on Wednesday to fine the world 's largest chipmaker and order changes to its business practices for what the EU executive sees as " naked restrictions " to competition , the sources said .
There was no indication of how big a fine might be levied .
The largest fine levied by the EC for an abuse of market dominance was the 497 million euros ( $ 655 million ) demanded from Microsoft on March 24 , 2004 .
The sources said the Brussels - based Commission is expected to rule that Intel committed two violations in which the firm abused its dominance of the market for central processing units , the chips at the heart of the world 's 1 billion personal computers .
The EU executive will say Intel gave rebates to computer makers to restrict or eliminate the use of chips made by its rival , Advanced Micro Devices , and provided other inducements to retailers to sell only machines with Intel CPUs .
In its ruling the Commission will order Intel to end by a specific date those rebates which it deems to be illegal , the sources said .
In its second finding , the Commission will say Intel paid PC makers to delay or scrap the launch of products containing AMD chips .
The Commission will characterize the payments as " naked restrictions " to competition , the sources said .
The Commission will state that the violations occurred during a period stretching back eight years , they said .
In committing the first violation , Intel set percentages of its own chips that it wanted PC makers to use , the sources said .
For example , NEC Corp was told that 20 percent of its desktop and notebook machines could have AMD chips , the sources said .
All Lenovo notebooks had to use Intel chips , as did relevant Dell products .
The figure was 95 percent for Hewlett - Packard 's business desktops , they said .
European Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said the commission had no comment .
Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy , speaking by telephone from California also declined to comment .
The EU executive charged Intel in 2007 over illegal rebates to computer makers .
In July last year , it charged the firm with paying retailers not to sell PCs using AMD chips .
Intel has said repeatedly it has done nothing wrong .

" You may have concluded by now that I think this is a pretty big deal .
It really is , " remarked interim Federal Communications Commission chair Michael Copps at Wednesday 's Open Commission meeting .
Copps was talking about the agency 's Notice of Inquiry asking for feedback on how to create a National Broadband Plan .
" If we do our job well , " he told his audience , " this will be the most formative — indeed transformative — proceeding ever in the Commission ’s history . "
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 requires the FCC to come up with the plan .
It asks for public input on " the most effective and efficient ways to ensure broadband access for all Americans , " strategies for making it more affordable , the state of high speed Internet progress so far , and advice on how to deploy it to " advance consumer welfare , civic participation , " and a dozen other worthy things .
The agency has until February 17 , 2010 to bang out the report and hand it over to Congress .
Whimsical arbitrage
We want pragmatic , practical , achievable goals , and proposals and recommendations to send up to Congress .
Not everybody was quite as apoplectic as Copps about this NOI .
Republican Commissioner Robert M. McDowell offered three cheers in a cagey sort of way .
" Let ’s all work hard to get it right , " he declared .
But while the chair said that the inquiry indicates that " we are coming to grips " with the reality " that we have a long way to go to get high - speed , value - laden broadband out to all our citizens , " McDowell rolled out a list of statistics suggesting that the country is doing better , broadband - wise , than his Democratic colleague might think .
He cited estimates that $ 80 billion dollars has already been spent on high speed Internet this year , an impressive sum given the bad economic climate .
And : " In order to attract investors to fund the build out of new networks , we must not engage in rulemakings that produce whimsical regulatory arbitrage , " McDowell warned .
" Rather , we must allow market players to succeed or fail on their own merits and not due to the government picking winners and losers .
In short , our rules must allow network operators to have a reasonable opportunity to pay back their investors .
That ’s the only way to improve existing networks and build new ones . "
McDowell 's statement doubtless received an amen chorus from U.S. Telecom , one of various trade associations looking warily upon this undertaking and issuing a statement against " unnecessary intervention [ that ] would slow broadband deployment and the arrival of a wide variety of pro-consumer advances . "
Reporters asked Copps about these concerns after the formal meeting .
" We want pragmatic , practical , achievable goals , and proposals and recommendations to send up to Congress , " he responded .
" But we 've somehow gotten ourselves into the mind set in the last eight years or so that , unlike all the infrastructure we ever built in this country where we 've had a public private partnership to do it , " in this case the private sector could roll out broadband alone .
" Do n't worry .
Be happy .
Sail on , " Copps rhetorically continued .
" Let the good times roll .
So we 've ended up way down in the rankings of nations in our ability to get broadband out . "
Meanwhile reform groups hailed the Notice as long overdue .
" This is the first time a government agency will take a comprehensive look at the situation and recommend a course of action to remedy our rapidly declining broadband ranking , " declared Public Knowledge 's Gigi Sohn .
Mildly as I can
But the broadband plan was only one of three data collection measures announced at the meeting .
The Commission has also launched a renewed effort in pursuit of its 14th Annual Report to Congress on video competition .
The 13th , as everyone at the meeting acknowledged , was a disaster .
It was supposed to assess the state of video in 2006 , but did n't formally get out until this year .
" We have n't done a very good job recently of meeting our obligation to report annually to Congress on the state of video competition , " Copps conceded at the meeting .
" That 's putting it about as mildly as I can . "
McDowell put a jovial spin on the mess .
" So what 's three years among friends ? " he asked the laughing crowd .
During that debacle , accusations flew that former FCC Chair Kevin Martin had selectively privileged certain studies concluding that the cable industry has surpassed both tiers of the dreaded " 70/70 " rule .
Congress defines this threshold as so : if 70 percent of households can access cable TV services with 36 or more active channels and 70 percent actually subscribe to them , " the Commission may promulgate any additional rules necessary to provide diversity of information sources . "
Angry questions about the means by which Martin concluded that the second part of the 70/70 tier had been reached , and fear and loathing over the prospect that he might try to implement a la carte cable as a result , delayed the report 's release until January .
Now the FCC is playing catch - up , and will issue a study assessing competition for 2007 , 2008 , and through the end of June 2009 .
The Supplemental Notice of Inquiry the agency released on Tuesday should produce an interesting document .
It asks for intel on the impact of the slump on programming investment and the migration of video and advertising from cable and broadcast TV to the Internet .
The supplement does n't take on questions about the " 70/70 " test — the Commission will tackle that in a later inquiry .
But the cable industry is still pretty nervous about this project .
The National Cable and Telecommunications Association recently called burdensome a 70/70 - related survey form the FCC proposes to use .
" No survey is necessary to prove that a variety of competitors have substantially eroded — and continue to erode — the share of the video distribution marketplace that traditional cable operators serve , which inevitably leads to the conclusion that the second prong of the test is not met , " NCTA 's comments with the FCC insisted .
We 're looking at that
Finally the agency issued an Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to boost its collection of data on how much broadcast media minorities and women own .
FCC
Form 323 now will ask for more information about minority / female ownership from more sources , including stations owned by individuals or " partnerships of natural persons , " which it did not before .
Low Power TV stations will have to fill out the form too .
And outgoing FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein announced that the Commission will soon launch an inquiry into Arbitron 's Portable People Meter system , which critics charge undercounts minority listeners to radio stations .
" In light of the challenging economic times and the fact the Commission uses Arbitron 's market definitions and rating data , we need to ensure PPM 's accuracy and reliability , " Adelstein declared .
" The Commission can not be left in the dark . "
But while talking to reporters , Copps ' remarks seemed to indicate that the investigation is n't in cement yet , referring to Adelstein's " suggestion " for some kind of probe .
" So we 're looking at that , " he added .
" I do n't have anything to announce today . "
Today , while my boyfriend was sleeping , I got naked and sat on top of him .
He woke up and I asked him if he would rather stay awake or go back to sleep , in hopes that he would stay awake and want to do some naughty stuff with me .
His response ?
To grab my butt , and then go back to sleep .

Eritrea is becoming a " giant prison " due to its government 's policies of mass detention , torture and prolonged military conscription , according to a report published today .
Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) said state repression had made the tiny Red Sea state one of the highest producers of refugees in the world , with those fleeing risking death or collective punishment against their families .
There is no freedom of speech , worship or movement in Eritrea , while many adults are forced into national service at token wages until up to 55 years of age .
In its 95 - page report cataloguing violations against civilians , the New York - based organisation also criticised a € 122 m ( £ 107 m ) assistance package from the EU to President Isaias Afewerki's regime , citing concerns that development projects are carried out by prisoners or conscripts , in violation of international law .
Georgette Gagnon , Africa director at HRW , said : " Eritrea 's government is turning the country into a giant prison .
[ It ] should immediately account for hundreds of ' disappeared ' prisoners and open its jails to independent scrutiny . "
Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 after a bloody 30 - year conflict .
The countries fought again five years later over a still unresolved border dispute , and Afewerki , whose party led the independence struggle , has kept Eritrea on a permanent war footing ever since .
All secondary school students complete their final year in a military camp .
The mandatory 18 - month national service was extended in 2003 so that adult males and females must be available to work for the state until the age of 40 .
In practice , people are required to serve the government if needed until 55 , Human Rights Watch said .
Many of the conscripts are sent to the army , while others work in ministries , on agricultural or construction projects , or in companies owned by the military or political elite .
Though the independence struggle infused a strong sense of patriotism and sacrifice among Eritreans , the extended national service is unpopular , particularly because the wages are barely enough for a family to survive on .
Aware of the widespread discontent , the government has made exit visas difficult to obtain for anyone under 50 .
Thousands of young people who try to flee through Ethiopia or Sudan risk being shot at the border , while their parents will usually suffer if they get away .
An officer formerly responsible for pursuing deserters told Human Rights Watch : " If you disappear inside Eritrea then the family is put in prison for some time and often then the child will return .
If you cross the border then [ your family ] pays 50,000 nafka ( £ 2,210 ) .
If there 's no money then it can be a long time in prison . "
The extended conscription has coincided with an almost complete suspension of democratic rights .
In September 2001 , 11 senior government officials who called for free and fair elections were detained .
Dozens of political opponents and journalists were also arrested , with most independent media organisations shut .
The location and condition of all those detained remains unknown .
There has also been a purge of religious groups , with thousands of Christians , mostly from small evangelical groups , kept in prison .
Conditions are known to be harsh .
Shipping containers in the desert serve as jails , while other secret detention centres are located underground .
Guards use torture techniques such as " the helicopter " , where a prisoner 's hands and feet are tied behind the back , with the victim left face down , often in the hot sun , the report says .
Eritrea has also become increasingly isolated diplomatically .
While independent observers say Eritrea has reason to feel anger over Ethiopia 's refusal to accept the decision of an international border commission after the war – and the west 's reluctance to pressure Ethiopia into doing so – the government 's provocative policies have quickly eroded the goodwill it enjoyed at independence .
In the past year it has antagonised neighbouring Djibouti over a separate border dispute , and openly hosted militant Islamist leaders from Somalia .
" Eritrea 's human rights crisis is worsening and making the Horn of Africa ever more volatile , " said Gagnon .
" The US , European and other governments need to co-ordinate their policies on the Horn to defuse regional tensions , and make human rights progress an essential benchmark for engagement with Eritrea . "
Factbox
A former Italian colony , Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia after a 30 - year war in 1993 .
It is a single party state , ruled by the People 's Front for Democracy and Justice .
National elections have never been held .
The country 's population is estimated at 5 million but it has one of Africa 's largest armies , more than 200,000 strong .
President Isaias Afewerki , 63 , initially hailed as one of the continent 's more progressive leaders , is widely regarded as one of its worst due to his repressive policies .
Up to 10,000 people are in jail without charge or trial , excluding army deserters , who might number in the tens of thousands , according to Human Rights Watch .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Pentagon and Lockheed Martin Corp , its top supplier , discounted a Wall Street Journal report that cyber spies had stolen secrets of the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft being built for the United States and nearly a dozen allies .

“ I ’m not aware of any specific concerns , ” Bryan Whitman , a Defense Department spokesman , said of the reported compromise of the Pentagon ’s costliest arms acquisition plan .
He spoke after the Journal said on Tuesday that “ terabytes ” of data about the plane ’s design and electronics had been taken , according to current and former officials said to be familiar with the matter .
Former U.S. officials were cited as saying the alleged cyber espionage appeared to have come from China .
A Chinese embassy spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters .
Such computer intrusions , if confirmed , could make it easier to defend against the multirole F - 35 , a roughly $ 300 billion program in the early stages of production .
The United States alone plans to buy 2,443 of three F - 35 designs for its Air Force , Navy and Marine Corps .
The radar - evading aircraft is being developed with financing from the United States , Britain , Italy , the Netherlands , Turkey , Canada , Australia , Denmark and Norway .
Other projected early buyers include Israel and Singapore .
Lockheed Martin , the primary contractor , said , “ We actually believe the Wall Street Journal was incorrect in its representation of successful cyber attacks on the F - 35 program . ”
“ I ’ve not heard of that , and to our knowledge there ’s never been any classified information breach , ” Bruce Tanner , the company ’s chief financial officer , said during a teleconference on the company ’s latest earnings .
The Wall Street Journal is standing by its story , according to Robert Christie , a spokesman for the newspaper ’s publisher , Dow Jones & Co , which is owned by News Corp .
Tanner acknowledged attacks on Lockheed Martin ’s systems , much like those on U.S. government networks , “ are continuous . ”
“ We do have stringent measures in place to both detect and stop these attacks , ” he said .
Later , the Defense Department said it did not comment on “ alleged or actual cyber infiltrations , potential impacts to DoD operations , or any possible investigations . ”
This was to deny information on a potential success or failure that might help an attacker , said Lieutenant Colonel Eric Butterbaugh of the Air Force , a department spokesman .
Lockheed ’s chief subcontractors on the F - 35 are Northrop Grumman Corp and BAE Systems Plc. Representatives of Northrop and BAE referred questions to Lockheed .
Last October , the Pentagon ’s chief internal watchdog office withdrew a finding that U.S. technology in the F - 35 might have been compromised by unauthorized access at units of BAE Systems .
In a rare climbdown , the inspector general ’s office said in an October 23 - dated statement that it had lacked “ sufficient appropriate evidence ” to support the conclusion of a March 6 report in which it had raised alarm about the security oversight of BAE facilities and computers .
The withdrawn report had noted that BAE was also playing a key role in the Eurofighter Typhoon , a competitor to the F - 35 for billions of dollars in overseas sales .
EADS , with a 46 percent stake , is the largest shareholder in the Typhoon - building consortium , Eurofighter GmbH , based in Halbergmoos , Germany .
BAE has 33 percent and Italy ’s Finmeccanica SpA holds 21 percent through its Alenia Aeronautica unit .
The Defense Science Board , a Pentagon advisory panel , said in a just - released report that the U.S. Defense Department was “ not yet organized , trained , equipped or in many cases adequately focused on threats to cyberspace - enabled operations . ”
A task force formed by the board concluded in the March - dated report that “ threats from cyber - intelligent adversaries represent a clear and present danger to U.S. national security ” in the absence of tightened cyber security plans .

divorced from the reality I experience every day .
Obama ’s proposals for reform , and the variations discussed in recent congressional hearings would add billions to our national expenditures for health care and extrapolate savings , in the long term , through an emphasis on prevention , widespread use of health information technology , chronic disease management , outcome based payment reform ( i.e. expanded pay - for - performance ) , and propagating research findings on cost effective disease management .
Unfortunately , extensive research has shown that although there is some prospect of benefit from these approaches , the benefit is likely to marginal , and many years in the coming .
A recent analysis in the Annals of Internal Medicine subtitled " Hope vs. Reality " emphasizes these points and concludes that to control cost we must " embrace price restraint , spending targets , and insurance regulation . "
Nevertheless , from my seat as a primary care physician in clinical practice , I ca n’t embrace this diagnosis , either .
It does n’t fit with my experience .
And the solution my experience suggests would require a simpler , but more fundamental reform than that proposed by President Obama or by Marmor and his colleagues in the Annals .
To illustrate this , I chose to go to the office one random morning and analyze each case I encountered in an effort to find opportunities and direction for cost control efforts .....
Late in the evening , home after finishing a short day at work ( eight appointments , a dozen phone calls , medication refills , etc ) , getting my younger son off on a sleepover weekend , watching The San Francisco Giants win a rare 2 - 0 shutout , and tucking in my older son I returned to the task at hand .
It was difficult , in the hubbub of a busy clinic , to keep track of each patient visit and call for the purpose of this examination of possible routes towards heath care cost control , but I think what follows provides the gist of thoughts brought on by a rather ordinary day :
" I do n’t know what I have to pay for with the insurance I ’ve got , " bemoaned my first patient , holding back sobs .
" It ’s a big shock for me , a big worry . "
The 22 year - old unemployed mother of a six week - old infant , was suffering from post - partum depression and topping the list of issues which had led her to see me was anxiety about health care costs , and stress in dealing with the hassles of her complex insurance .
This kind of concern is no surprise .
Indeed , the April 18 business section of the Las Vegas Sun headlines " Rising health care costs spur more anxiety than job loss . "
Perhaps to treat that anxiety , Aetna is pushing in its advertising a new book , Navigating Your Health Benefits for Dummies .
How ironic !
Aetna , which is in the middle of a big campaign to sell more individual health policies , bare - boned policies which feature large deductibles and co-pays and offer their corporate sponsors fat profit margins , is using health insurance premiums to push a book that helps patients manage the complexities created by the insurers own activities !

John Pizelle ( names have been changed for confidentiality ) , my next patient , spurred in by the fact that his wife had recently been treated for potentially serious disease , greeted me warmly , " How ’s the economy treating you ? ! "
His wife had recently lost her job and they were contemplating the possibility of securing health coverage through C.O.B.R.A. , the option created by the federal government which " gives workers and their families who lose their health benefits the right to choose to continue group health benefits provided by their group health plan for limited periods of time under certain circumstances . "
He was considering becoming one of the only 10 % of Americans eligible for COBRA benefits who actually enroll , as the qualifying circumstance , unemployment , makes most unable to afford to pay the premiums .
Mr. Pizelle made his appointment to see me , fundamentally an unneeded one , because he was worried about what lurked in his health care future and was undertaking an individual cost - benefit analysis about the value of paying for COBRA .
Those who oppose making health coverage more widely available often express concern that lowering economic barriers to care might result in an excessive increase in visits to the doctor .
Maybe , but the " Please - order - every - test - and - make - every - referral - because - I'm - about - to - lose - my - insurance " visits will surely decline .
Indeed , data on the frequency with which patients forego needed care , miss doses of medication , or otherwise avoid care which is their own best interest has revealed over and over again the economic wisdom of reducing barriers to care .
I am reminded about another patient of mine , a " non-compliant " diabetic whose lifetime of complications had cost tens ( if not hundreds ) of thousands of dollars , who returned from an extended trip overseas with his diabetes finally under control .
" What happened ? " I asked , incredulous .
And he matter - of - factly replied , " Medicine is free in Tonga . "
Of course nothing is " free . "
But in a system where a societal judgment has been made to pay for health care through a system of central financing , reducing barriers to care at the " retail " level , patients and their physicians make health care decisions based upon need , resulting in a greater focus on preventive care and leading to improved management of chronic conditions .
As a study commissioned by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation published in the scholarly journal Health Affairs concluded , fully insuring all Americans under such a plan would not increase overall health spending because increased costs from covering the underinsured and uninsured would be offset through the reduction in administrative costs .
The next two patients of my morning failed to show .
One called , saying she was " too sick " to make it in .
I spoke with her , finding her to be not really that ill , but in need of a prescription for an antibiotic for a sinus infection .
My thoughts drifted to the possible role of the co-pay in preventing her visit and brought to mind how the structure of physician payment , based upon face - to - face encounters , may push up the costs of providing care .
Paid in this way , physicians are encouraged to see patients whom they might have managed equally well over the phone or through an online interaction .
After two " physicals , " the next two patients , one requiring a rather large excisional biopsy , the other ( Mary ) with a non-displaced distal radial fracture , pointed to the beneficial role of an extensive primary care infrastructure in the battle to reduce costs .
As I removed the cyst from Mr. Martinez ’ axillary fold I recalled my brother - in - law ’s experience in New York City , a locale dominated by specialty care .
He presented to his dermatologist ( family physicians are few and far between in New York ) with a small mole on his upper arm .
Rather than remove it herself , biopsy a section , or conclude that it was benign ( it was ) based upon clinical features , she referred him to a plastic surgeon who , more than a thousand dollars later , removed the lesion .
Finally , arranging for Mary ’s late Friday referral to the Emergency Room for splinting of her fracture ( no orthopedists available for patients with her health coverage ) , I recalled the days when I used to manage such fractures and considered the systemic savings to be had if we operated within a system dominated by widely competent primary care providers working in a more integrated system which did not distinguish among patients based upon the source of their health benefit payment .
Rather than Mary ’s moving from me , to the emergency room , to the orthopedist , she might have gotten all her care in one place , saving resources for other public needs .
It ’s clearly not so much my fees ( or even those of my more richly rewarded specialist colleagues ) , but the associated costs of the care we direct and the increasingly complex , balkanized , and bureaucratic system within which we all operate which feels like the driver of the explosion in health care costs which threatens to sink business and government .
President Obama understands and has articulated the risk that uncontrolled costs impose on our government and society .
But physicians understand best from where this risk derives and where we must turn .
A fundamental transformation of our health care system is required , away from the confusion and profit - maximizing bureaucratic buck passing of the private health insurance system , and towards a new system which is defined by centralized funding and universal enrollment of everyone living in this land .
With this change we will waste no more resources on achieving a favorable risk selection , marketing , underwriting , investor relations , product development , nor profits .
Providers will spend virtually no revenue on billing and we will all operate within a clear cut set of rules that applies to all patients .
It is a dream , but it is a dream that can be realized now , if we can only get going and act .
Politics , and political change , has been described as the art of the possible .
But what is possible only comes about when those who believe in the need for change act upon that belief .
Possibilities can be created .
Hope can lead to change .

Now that the American crew members of the Maersk Alabama have retaken the ship from four Somali pirates ( USA ! USA ! USA ! ) , it ’s important to note that like all the people involved with the safe landing of US Airways Flight 1549 in the Hudson River in January , the crew members of the Maersk Alabama are union members .
( Thanks to Marcy Wheeler for the blog title and the meme . )
The unions in question are the Seafarers International Union , which represents 12 of the 20 - person crew , the Marine Engineers ’ Beneficial Association ( MEBA ) , and the International Organization of Masters , Mates & Pilots ( MM&P ) .
As former safety chairman of the Airline Pilots Association , Chesley Sullenberger , the hero pilot of Flight 1549 , fought to make sure his colleagues got the training they needed to do what he did in January .
And as I just heard on Fox News ( and confirmed with the SIU ) , crew members of the Maersk Alabama received anti-piracy training from ( where else ? ) their union .
You can see an SIU member at small arms training at the union ’s Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education in the photo to the right ( more photos here ) .
In addition to small arms training , the Hall Center offers anti-terror , basic safety , first aid , and other security - related courses .
A while ago , I sat down examining a few alternative programming languages I might decide to learn someday .
Each of those languages has its own peculiarities , and I did n’t choose them randomly , I chose them based on their popularity , power , paradigm and how actively they are developed .
I included Factor as the only representative for concatenative programming , an interesting way to write programs , but seldom used in “ recent ” languages ( except for Factor and a few others ) .
The Joy of concatenative programming
If you have absolutely no clue on what I ’m talking about , you should consider looking at the home page for the Joy Programming Language , or maybe just the overview : it should be enough to tikle your curiosity .
Joy is often considered the canonical concatenative programming language : a basic — but working — implementation of a simple programming language to illustrate the fundamentals of concatenative programming .
Joy looks like this :
2 3 + dup *
This simple programs computes the sum of 2 and 3 , pushes it on the stack , duplicates it ( using the dup combinator ) and then multiplies the two values , obtaining 25 as a result .
Let ’s slow down a second .
Here ’s what happens , exactly :
Element entered Stack contents 2 3 [ 2 3 ] + dup [ 5 5 ] *
Got it ?
Let ’s take it one step further .
When you enter dup and then * , you are effectively computing the square of a number , so we can define the function square simply as :
square == dup *
In Ruby , this would be :
def square ( x ) x*x end
What ’s unusual here ? —
Simple , there are no variables involved .
Joy does n’t need any explicit variable or formal parameters of any sort .
There ’s more .
Take the following code :
[ 1 2 3 4 ] [ dup *] map
The map combinator expects a list and a quoted program ( the same one used to compute the square ) and produces a new list containing the result of that program applied to each element of the original list .
Basically the equivalent of :
[ 1,2,3,4 ] .map { |e| e*e }
Do you notice anything different ? —
Yes ,
Joy does n’t need blocks or lambdas either , it uses quoted programs instead , which are nothing but slightly fancier lists ( or arrays , as you like ) .
Let ’s recap then , Joy does n’t need of :
lambda functions or blocks ( quotation does the trick )
explicit parameters ( everything you need is on the stack )
variable assignments ( same as above )
explicit recursion ( provided you can use combinators like linrec , primrec , binrec , etc. )
I would consider this one of the best examples of programming minimalism : an incredibly simple syntax , a very small set of rules , but a good deal of power .
Ruby objects on the stack
After reading about Joy , I realized that implementing something similar in Ruby would be an interesting mini-project ( let ’s say a week of lunch breaks ) to understand more about concatenative programming .
It would also be pointless , too : a stack - based programming language implemented on top of one of the most high - level programming languages you can find is n’t going to be fast , is it ?
Nevertheless , it would still be interesting .
Ruby offers everything you need to build a Joy - like DSL :
You can use arrays as … arrays , but also as quoted programs , and to model the stack itself .
You can use integers , strings , etc. as themselves
You can use Symbols as functions ( we ’ll get to this in a minute )
If you think about the following expression in postfix notation :
2 2 +
We could translate it into infix notation ( 2 + 2 ) , because Ruby supports it , but it ’s not general enough .
What you could do is this though :
2.send ( :+ , 2 )
Message sending .
I can see all the SmallTalk sympathizers drooling already .
Well yes ,
In Ruby , everything is an object , so everything has a receiver and maybe some parameters .
In other words , every method call can be reduced to the following syntax :
receiver.send ( method , * params )
In this way , it is safe to assume that everything has a receiver , which could be understood as a function parameter , and may have 0 or more parameters .
Take the following then :
[ 2 , 2 , :+ ]
It ’s not too different from Joy , and it ’s still Ruby code .
All you have to do is use something to do the following :
Take an array , and examine each item :
If it ’s an object ( non-Symbol ) , then push it on top of the stack .
If it ’s a Symbol , then do something different , i.e. : Find its receiver and its parameters and call a method .
Manipulate something on the stack .
In this case , we have to find :+’s receiver and its parameter and we ’re sorted .
Unfortunately Ruby ’s arity method is n’t that reliable .
For example : " test".instance_method( :sub ) .arity returns - 1 , while it should return “ 2 ” to be useful .
So we have no choice but find a way to pass the method ’s arity explicitly , in some cases .
For example like this :
[ " Ciao , Fabio " , / Ciao / , " Hello " , :sub|2 ]
If we define a | operator for the Symbol class , it ’s not too bad after all .
It ’s heavy , but in this way we can use any Ruby method in postfix notation .
Introducing the Concatenative Ruby DSL
Concatenative is a simple Ruby DSL for concatenative programming .
You can write concatenative programs inside ordinary Ruby arrays and execute them by calling either Array #execute or Kernel # concatenate , like this :
require ' concatenative ' concatenate ( 10 , [ 0 , :== ] , [ 1 , :+ ] , [ : dup , 1 , :- ] , [ :* ] , : linrec )
This simple program calculates the factorial of 10 .
As you can see , no matter how unusual it may look , it is perfectly valid Ruby code and it is equivalent to the following Joy code :
10 [ 0 = ] [ 1 + ] [ dup 1 -] [ *]
linrec
Granted , Joy looks better , but that ’s the tradeoff for not writing a parser for Joy syntax , after all .
Looking at the code above , there are a few things to keep in mind when programming with Concatenative :
You are using Ruby arrays , so you have to use commas , at least
functions , operators and combinators ( let ’s just call them words ) are available as Ruby symbols
The arity of all Ruby infix operators has been already set to “ 1 ” by concatenative using the set_arity method ( which simply stores the arity of a particular symbol in a constant hash )
method ( which simply stores the arity of a particular symbol in a constant hash )
You can specify explicit arities using the | operator ( : gsub|2 , or : join|1 )
, or )
Unless the arity has been specified , an arity of 0 is assumed .
You can define your own concatenative functions using the Symbol # <= method , which expects a quoted concatenative program .
Performance issues
In its current form , Concatenative can be very slow , as show the “ benchmarks ” provided in the / examples folder , especially if you use recursive combinators .
This is understandable because everything is implemented in pure Ruby , which is totally unsuitable for low level stuff .
If you are interested , you are more than welcome to submit patches and suggestions to improve Concatenative ’s performance , or , if you feel brave enough , you could help me create a C extension instead : things would become much faster then .
At any rate , feel free to play with it .
You can get the source from GitHub , you can get the gem from RubyForge and you can submit ticket through GitHub as well .

A new computer model reveals how a pandemic like the avian flu might spread quickly across the United States and what methods would best thwart the scenario .
Researchers assumed a starting point of 10 highly infectious influenza cases in Los Angeles , then let the model take it from there .
The virus spread quickly , peaking in just 90 days with 100 or more infections per 1,000 residents of just about every corner of the country [ Animated Map ] .
The simulation is an attempt to map out what might happen with a very uncertain bug : the avian flu virus H5N1 is a particular strain that does not yet easily pass between humans .
If it morphs into such a strain , however , human deaths could mount quickly .
Meantime , vaccines developed for current strains would likely not be effective against whatever variety ultimately emerges .
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt has said the country is not prepared for such a scenario .
Lessons learned
The virtual pandemic suggests advance preparation of a modestly effective vaccine in large quantities is preferable to waiting to see exactly what strain emerges .
Quarantines , school closures and travel restrictions alone wo n't thwart the spread , but such measures can buy time while vaccines production is ramped up and tailored to the specific flu strain .
In the simulation , long - range travel was cut to 10 percent of normal based on travel advisories that would presumably be instituted .
" Based on our results , combinations of mitigation strategies such as stockpiling vaccines or antiviral agents , along with social distancing measures could be particularly effective in slowing pandemic flu spread in the U.S. , " said Ira Longini , a biostatistician with the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington .
The variables
The model uses census data and 281 million synthetic people at work , play , school and home , along with Department of Transportation travel data that incorporates rapid spread from one city to another by air travel .
The computer model employs probabilities that an infected person will cross paths with others at home or , with lower probability , elsewhere .
" So we are only computing the probability of any person becoming infected on any given day , and a roll of the dice is needed to decide whether they are infected or not , " said Timothy Germann of the Los Alamos National Laboratory .
The computer also considered one vexing aspect to the flu :
About 33 percent of those infected do n't develop symptoms and can unknowingly transmit the disease .

In a highly unusual reversal , the Defense Department ’s inspector general ’s office has withdrawn a report it issued in January exonerating a Pentagon public relations program that made extensive use of retired officers who worked as military analysts for television and radio networks .
Donald M. Horstman , the Pentagon ’s deputy inspector general for policy and oversight , said in a memorandum released on Tuesday that the report was so riddled with flaws and inaccuracies that none of its conclusions could be relied upon .
In addition to repudiating its own report , the inspector general ’s office took the additional step of removing the report from its Web site .
The inspector general ’s office began investigating the public relations program last year , in response to articles in The New York Times that exposed an extensive and largely hidden Pentagon campaign to transform network military analysts into “ surrogates ” and “ message force multipliers ” for the Bush administration .
The articles also showed how military analysts with ties to defense contractors sometimes used their special access to seek advantage in the competition for contracts related to Iraq and Afghanistan .
The report released in January took issue with the articles .
It said investigators could not find any instance where an analyst used special access “ to achieve a competitive advantage for their company . ”
It also said there was “ insufficient basis ” to conclude that the program violated laws prohibiting propaganda .
The agreement that the Obama administration will announce today forcing dramatic reductions in vehicle greenhouse gas emissions and improvements in auto mileage marks a potentially pivotal shift in the battle over global warming -- and a vindication of California ’s long battle to toughen standards .
After decades of political sparring , legal challenges and scientific arguments over climate change , three of the central players -- the federal government , major U.S. automakers and California -- have found that the time has come to suspend hostilities and make a deal .
For cars and trucks , the agreement would establish a single nationwide standard that would require a 30 % reduction in carbon dioxide and other emissions from vehicles sold in the United States by 2016 .
The new limits are projected to reduce U.S. oil consumption by about 5 % a year .
The nation currently uses about 7.1 billion barrels a year .

For its part , California will essentially accept the national standard as a substitute for the state ’s own tough emission requirements .
The Obama standard is designed to achieve the same level of emission cutbacks as the California rule , but automakers will be given more time to adapt .
Completing the three - way deal , automakers will pledge to drop their effort to block the California rules through legal challenges .
“ Everybody wins , ” said David Doniger , policy director of the Natural Resources Defense Council ’s climate center .
“ It ’s going to cut carbon pollution .
The drivers of these cars are going to save money at the pump .
It ’s going to cut our national oil dependence . ”
During the Bush administration , California unsuccessfully sought federal permission to tighten its vehicle emission standards .
The Obama administration had ordered the Environmental Protection Agency to reexamine the issue .

Not everyone hailed the agreement Monday .
“ We think these new mandatory fuel standards are most unfortunate , ” said Myron Ebell , an energy expert with the pro-market Competitive Enterprise Institute .
“ They will price people out of larger vehicles and force them into smaller vehicles . ”
But in embracing a deal , the major parties appear to have concluded that some kind of action on greenhouses gases was inevitable and that their separate interests were better served by compromising now than by further delay .
President Obama will announce the deal in Washington , joined by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and others .
A White House official , briefing reporters Monday on condition of anonymity , said the agreement would push new vehicles sold in the U.S. to average 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016 , up from 25 mpg today .
The agreement , coupled with increased fuel - efficiency requirements that Congress approved in 2007 , would add $ 1,300 to the price of a new car in 2016 , the administration estimated .
Neither the Obama plan nor the rules California has sought to impose include explicit mileage requirements .
But capping the greenhouse gas emissions that scientists blame for global warming would effectively require better mileage .
Advertisement
In 2002 , California passed a law to reduce vehicle emissions , but auto industry lawsuits held up its enforcement .
The state also needed a waiver from the EPA , which refused -- even after a series of court rulings in the state ’s favor .
Bush administration officials said they wanted a single nationwide standard that would unite the greenhouse gas regulations and tougher fuel economy standards that Congress approved in 2007 .
Officials cast such standards as a key to encouraging the design and sale of the fuel - sipping cars that Obama calls vital to the Detroit automakers ’ recovery -- and crucial to the international fight against global warming .
Detroit has never liked the idea of government telling it what kind of cars to build , but its power to head off tougher emission standards was undercut by a series of events that decreased its political influence -- including the financial troubles of General Motors Corp . and Chrysler , which made the companies more open to government demands for fuel - efficient vehicles , especially after they needed federal money to stay afloat .
Advertisement
In addition , Rep. John D. Dingell ( D - Mich . ) , a powerful ally of the auto industry , was ousted as chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and replaced by Rep. Henry A. Waxman ( D - Beverly Hills ) , an advocate of tougher standards .
And during last year ’s presidential campaign , both Obama and Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona backed California ’s efforts .
Obama ’s EPA also issued a draft ruling last month declaring greenhouse gases a danger to public health , subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act .
The proposal singles out cars and trucks , which comprise about one quarter of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions .
The EPA began public hearings on the proposal Monday .
Assuming the reductions come to pass , a trip to a dealership in 2016 might prove remarkably different than one today .
Rows of SUVs and full - sized luxury cars could be replaced by highly efficient compact sedans powered by hybrid drive trains , small SUVs running on clean diesel motors and possibly electric cars that emit no greenhouse gases .
Advertisement
Jeff Holmstead , a senior EPA official under President Bush , said he saw the deal as a vindication of the Bush administration ’s approach .
“ It looks like the Obama administration is agreeing with the Bush administration that there needs to be a national standard and that it does n’t make any sense to have multiple state standards , ” Holmstead said .
But Capitol Hill Democrats welcomed the deal .
Rep. Edward J. Markey ( D - Mass. ) , an author of the House energy bill who also co-wrote the 2007 bill increasing fuel economy standards , said , “ President Obama has solved the energy and economic policy equivalent of a Rubik ’s Cube . ”

The basics
The Obama administration is set to announce an agreement today that would force cars and trucks in the U.S. to achieve dramatically better gas mileage .
Here is a look at the plan :
What would the new rules do exactly ?
Advertisement
They would restrict greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks -- essentially forcing them to get better fuel economy .
By 2016 , vehicles sold in the U.S. would average 35.5 miles per gallon , up from 25 mpg today .
The White House estimates that the new regulations would save nearly 2 billion barrels of oil from 2011 to 2016 and , in global warming terms , be the equivalent of taking 177 million cars off the road .
Do I have to trade in my Yukon SUV for a Prius hybrid ?
No .
The regulations would apply only to new cars .
You do n’t have to scrap your gas guzzler and you wo n’t need to retrofit it .
Would this change my car - buying choices ?
Advertisement
Yes .
For one , the Obama administration projects you would pay an extra $ 1,300 per vehicle , on average , in 2016 because of the new rules .
It ’s also likely that U.S. dealerships will stock more lighter vehicles with less trunk space , and possibly more advanced - fuel vehicles such as plug - in hybrids .
The federal government right now has such a heavy hand in running two big U.S. automakers , General Motors Corp. and Chrysler , because of their need for federal aid .
Is that why the auto companies agreed to this ?
It ’s one of several factors that pressured automakers to compromise on a single national fuel standard .
Other factors include California ’s push to set aggressive vehicle emissions standards and the Environmental Protection Agency ’s decision , spurred by a Supreme Court ruling , to propose regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act .

LAST year , Coppertone rolled out two easy - to - use sprays with its highest - ever sun protection factor : SPF 70 +.
Not to be outdone , Neutrogena offered its Ultra Sheer Dry - Touch lotion in SPF 85 strength , that year ’s big gun .
This sun season , Banana Boat is retaliating with a pair of SPF 85 sprays , which it trumpets on its
Web site as “ our highest SPF level in a continuous spray formula . ”
But now , SPF creep has hit the triple digits with Neutrogena ’s SPF 100 + sunblock , leading some dermatologists to complain that this is merely a numbers game that confuses consumers .
The parade of stratospheric SPFs is “ crazy , ” said Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest , a dermatology professor at Boston University School of Medicine .
“ For a normal person who is fair - skinned and concerned about skin damage and photoaging , ” Dr. Gilchrest said , “ it ’s really in my opinion tremendous overkill . ”
CIA ordered to turn over documents relating to destroyed interrogation tapes John Byrne
Published : Friday April 24 , 2009
Print This Email This The Central Intelligence Agency must turn over records regarding detainee interrogation tapes the agency destroyed in an alleged effort to protect the identity of its officers .
A federal judge rejected the CIA 's attempt to withhold records relating to the agency 's destruction of 92 videotapes that depicted interrogation of CIA prisoners in a ruling Friday afternoon .
The tapes were said to have shown some detainees ' torture .
The American Civil Liberties Union is suing for the documents ' release under the Freedom of Information Act , and aims to have the agency held in contempt of court for refusing to provide them .
The ACLU has been remarkably successful at obtaining previously secret government documents .
President Barack Obama was recently forced to release Bush administration memos which outlined torture techniques to be employed on detainees .
ACLU staff attorney Amrit Singh lauded the court 's decision .
" We welcome the court 's recognition that the ACLU 's contempt motion against the CIA must be promptly resolved , " Singh said in a release .
" Recent disclosures about the CIA 's torture methods further confirm that there is no basis for the agency to continue to withhold records relating to the content of the destroyed videotapes or documents that shed light upon who authorized their destruction and why .
" The public has a right to this information and the CIA must be held accountable for its flagrant disregard for the rule of law , " Singh added .
In a release , the civil liberties group noted " the CIA had previously said it would only turn over documents from August 2002 that relate to the content of the videotapes .
But U.S. District Court Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein of the Southern District of New York today ordered the CIA to produce records from April through December 2002 that relate to the content of the tapes , as well as documents from April 2002 through June 2003 that related to the destruction of the tapes and information about the persons and reasons behind their destruction . "
" Judge Hellerstein also ordered the government to reconsider the extent of redactions it intends to make to the documents in light of last week 's release , also as part of the ACLU 's FOIA litigation , of four secret memos used by the Bush administration to justify torture , " the release adds .
" In addition , the court ordered the government to explain whether contempt proceedings would interfere with a federal criminal investigation into the destruction of the tapes led by prosecutor John Durham . "

Television personality David Letterman opens the 67th annual Academy Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles March 27 , 1995 .
REUTERS / Gary Hershorn
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - Late - night TV comic David Letterman has quietly married his longtime girlfriend , telling audience members of his show on Monday that he almost missed the ceremony because his truck was stuck in mud .
Letterman , 61 , and Regina Lasko tied the knot during a courthouse ceremony near their Montana ranch last Thursday .
The couple , who have been dating since 1986 , were accompanied by their 5 - year - old son , Harry .
” ... I had avoided getting married pretty good for , like , 23 years , and I -- honestly , whether this happened or not -- I secretly felt that men who were married admired me ... like I was the last of the real gunslingers , ” Letterman said , according to a “ Late Show ” transcript provided by a spokesman .
But the afternoon ceremony at the Teton County Courthouse in Choteau ( pop. 1,700 ) was delayed by an hour because the family ’s pickup truck was stuck in mud two miles from their house .
Letterman was forced to walk back in a howling gale to get the car .
“ So then we get in the car and Harry says , ‘ Are we still going into town ? ’ and I said , ‘ Yes , we are , ’ and he gets very upset because Mom had told him if I was n’t back in an hour , the deal was off . ”
Letterman ’s spokesman declined to reveal any details about the ceremony , or to give Lasko ’s age .
Letterman , who was married once before , is intensely private , and is rarely photographed with his family .
The news of his nuptials was first broken by celebrity tabloid US Weekly .

Crafting with stash : Rostitchery used an intriguing concept for a recent project–she knitted a two - color ballband discloth , not only using stash , but also using two yarns whose only connection to each other was that they happened to be sitting next to each other in her stash drawer .
And although the colors did n’t seem to go together at all , the result was really quite pleasing in a different way .

Over at the Examiner , I ’ve written an article which calls for DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano to be fired and replaced by Fox News analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano .
Here ’s why Janet should pack her bags :
Considering the timing of the actual release of the report , it seems that law enforcement was being provided a message from the White House to be on lookout for hundreds of thousands of Americans participating in Tea Parties across the nation on April 15th .
While national political journalist Robert Stacy McCain may have been the first to the note the connection between Tea Parties and the Homeland Security Document , other local bloggers have recognized the coincidence as well .
Here ’s why Andrew is more than qualifed for the new job :
If I had to make a pick about which Napolitano serves as Attorney General , I ’d choose the one who is equally critical of both political parties , the one who chooses constitutionality over partisanship , and the one who favors civil liberties over politics as normal in DC .

Researchers have found fundamental differences between the brains of people who prefer to rise and greet the dawn each day , and those who do n't mind seeing a sunrise , but only if it's at the end of a long night .
A new study used brain scans and alertness tests to probe the brains of early birds and night owls , and found that
people tend to favor mornings or nights based at least in part on how they react to a kind of competition in the brain [ National Geographic News ] .
Two factors control our bedtime .
The first is hardwired : A master clock in the brain regulates a so - called circadian rhythm , which synchronizes activity patterns to the 24 - hour day .
Some people 's clocks tell them to go to bed at 9 p.m. , others ' at 3 a.m....
The second factor -- called sleep pressure -- depends not on time of day but simply on how long someone has been awake already [ ScienceNOW Daily News ] .
Sleep pressure builds up as hours of wakefulness increase .
The new study , published in Science , suggests that early birds are more susceptible to sleep pressure , giving night owls the advantage in stamina .
In a sleep lab , the researchers
studied people with extreme bedtimes , or chronotypes , both early and late .
The larks in the study typically woke up between 4 a.m. and 5:30 a.m. and went to bed by 9 p.m .
The night owls , or evening chronotypes , left to their own devices would go to bed at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. and rise at noon [ Science News ] .
All the test subjects maintained their preferred sleep schedules to avoid interfering with their circadian rhythms , and took tests measuring their alertness 1.5 hours after waking , and again 10.5 hours after waking .
In the earlier test researchers saw no difference between the two groups ' performances , but in the later test the night owls performed better than the early birds , and also topped their own prior test results .
FMRI brain scans told the rest of the tale .
In the night owls , increased activity was seen in two parts of the brain at 10.5 hours — the suprachiasmatic nucleus area and the locus coeruleus — that are involved in regulating the circadian signal .
Essentially , the circadian signal was winning out over the pressure to sleep .
In the early birds , on the other hand , " the sleep pressure prevents the expression of the circadian signal , " so those individuals were less able to keep their attention focused [ LiveScience ]
, says study coauthor Philippe Peigneux .
The study is the first to show that circadian rhythms and sleep pressure interact to govern behavior ; researchers previously believed that the two systems operated independently .
But while night owls seem to handle sleep pressure better , the late - to - bed strategy might backfire outside the lab ....
" Morning types may be at an advantage , because their schedule is fitting better with the usual work schedule of the society , " [ Peigneux ] said .
" It may represent a problem for evening types obliged to wake up early while having difficulties going to bed in the evening , eventually leading to a sleep debt " [ National Geographic News ] .

Specification
Jerry Gay continued his work on S19 - Command Line Interface with various improvements and corrections .
Larry
Wall clarified the meaning of things like *- 1 , which can be used in array indexes to access the last element .
If a noun starts with a Whatever Star * , it constructs a closure , so *- 1 is really the same as { $ _ - 1} .
The routine that handles the array subscript operator [ ] passes the number of elements to that closure .
Daniel Ruoso asked whether @@a ( slice view of array @a ) and @a could be made distinct variables , since the originally planned unification between them would imply too much magic to allow an efficient implementation ( so far no Perl 6 compiler implements slice context and variables ) .
Larry replied that it 's OK to separate them .
However that separation did n't make it into the specs yet .
Carl Mäsak published a S29 laundry list , and both encouraged other to work on S29 - Built - in Functions and Methods , and announced that he would try to tackle at least some of the missing items himself .
We 've also seen a few spelling and grammar corrections - the move of the Synospis documents to the pugs repository did have a positive impact on hackability .
Implementations
Rakudo
Since my last update there has been a lot of progress in Rakudo : Arrray and Hash slices ( as in @array [ 1..3 , 5 ] ) now work , list assignment ( as in my ( $x , $ y ) = 0 , 1 ; ) is implemented , and many reduction and some hyper meta operators now work , so you can write things like this :
my $ sum = [ + ]
1 .. 10 ; my @product = [ *] @numbers ; my @sum = @ n1 »+ « @ n2 ;
Rakudo now passes more than 6000 spec tests .
As always you can monitor its progress in the test suite on rakudo.de .
SMOP
The smop developers added support for the return function and control exception , and for integration with a C level coroutine library .
Test Suite
Over the hollidays I spent some time moving tests from the old part of the test suite to t/spec/ , in particular tests for object orientation .
I also moved many of the tests in t/ examples / 99 problems / to t/spec / integration / , which is the place for tests that do n't correspond to one particular synopsis , but which are common sense , or interaction between features from different synospis .
To reduce the number of tests , I merged ten of them into one .
I also noticed with joy that other started to move files to t/spec / as well , and added more tests .
The moving and test review is still an ongoing task .
To give you an idea of the dimensions of the test suite , here are some numbers :
Category Files Plan spec 461 10272 unspecced 16 108 examples 26 136 xx-uncategorized 26 135 pugs 4 38 other 197 7624 sum 730 18313
The plan is the estimated number of invididual tests .
spec menas the part that are official test suite , and are hopefully reviewed .
unspecced are tests that people wrote for features they would like to have , but that are n't covered in the synopsis .
They will only make it into the official test suite if the language design team decides that these features are desirable , and make it into the specs .
examples should be self - explanatory .
Some of them will likely be moved to t/spec / integration / .
The same holds true for xx-uncategorized , which is full of assorted tests .
pugs are the pugs specific tests .
other is the whole rest of the not yet moved tests , all of which need some review .
Cool Uses for Perl 6
Carl Mäsak started the implementation of a cool , 2 ½ - D board game named Druid .
A note to Implementors
You have probably noticed that these roughly monthly tidings are mostly about the Spec , the test suite and Rakudo .
That 's not because I want to neglect the other implementations , but because it 's hard to actually get news from them .
I read the mailing lists ( p6l , p6 c , p6u ) , the blogs , I 'm on #perl6 quite often , and try to backlog when I 'm not .
I can only encourage all compiler hackers and users to blog about their progress and challenges ( and , if it 's not already there , get it included in the planetsix feed by sending a mail to the perl.org webmasters ) .
If you do n't want to write a full - blown blog entry , just drop me a line on IRC about your progress and its impact , and I 'll include it in my next " tidings " post .
Tamil children as young as 11 were forced at gunpoint to fight for the Tigers in Sri Lanka 's civil war .
Survivors talked of their ordeal to Gethin Chamberlain in Ambepusse
Darchiga Kuken was sheltering in a bunker in the Mullaitivu area when a group of about 20 Tamil Tiger soldiers arrived and demanded that she went with them .
" I was sick with chicken pox .
My mother and father were screaming and crying , saying that I was sick and pleading with them not to take me , " she said .
The men went away .
And then at 5 pm on 14 March they came back .
They called me to come out and then they grabbed me and put me in a jeep .
I started to cry .
I was shouting : ' Mother , father , help me . ' "
The 16 - year - old is now being held in what the government describes as a " rehabilitation centre " , a jungle camp built on a hillside outside the town of Ambepusse in the south of the country .
Here children like her , who were forced to fight on the front line in the final stages of the war in Sri Lanka , gave the Observer compelling evidence of war crimes committed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) .
The camp currently houses 95 children , with another 200 on their way from internment camps around the town of Vavuniya in the north of the country .
Despite international concerns over the treatment of LTTE suspects , the children appeared to be well treated and were able to speak freely when the Observer visited the camp on Thursday .
The most distressing sight was a young boy howling in pain on the floor of one of the huts ; his friends said that he had recently arrived and still had a piece of shrapnel lodged in his skull from the recent fighting .
The accounts of these boys and girls who surrendered to the Sri Lankan army were shocking .
They say they were dragged screaming from their families and sent into action with only a few days of basic training .
The older members of the LTTE warned them to keep firing and advancing , or they would be shot by their own side from behind .
Those who did try to escape said they were fired on by their own side .
Children who were recaptured had their hair shaved off to mark them as deserters and boys were beaten .
Darchiga said she was shot in the stomach by the army two days after arriving on the front line , having been forced to pick up a rifle and go forward to fight .
She said LTTE cadres left her bleeding for four hours before she received any medical treatment .
According to her testimony , the Tigers had warned every family that those children who could carry a weapon were expected to join up , regardless of age .
Some as young as 11 and 12 had been taken , she said .
" They told families that one child was enough .
If they had five children , they would take four and leave just one . "
She was taken to a training camp at Mullaivaikal , where nine days of basic military training were interrupted by frequent air attacks .
On the morning of 24 March , she was sent to the front .
" I was scared and thought that I would die now and would never see my parents again .
They had scared us and said we should n't sleep because the army would come and cut our throats . "
She spent the first day hiding in a bunker , then she was shoved forwards because the senior Tiger cadres said they were running out of fighters .
" They gave me a rifle .
It was very heavy .
They threatened us that we had to go forward and shoot ; if we came back , they would shoot us themselves .
" I went a few hundred yards and hid behind a coconut tree .
I saw the army coming and I was very scared and I was lying down trying to hide , but then they shot me in the stomach .
" I started screaming because of the pain , but the cadres told me to shut up because the army would hear me .
They gave me a cloth to put on the wound .
There was a lot of blood .
It was four hours before they took me to the hospital at Matalan . "
On 13 April she escaped and ran back to her family .
The Tigers were looking for deserters , she said .
" If they caught them , they shaved their hair off and sent them back to the front line . "
Boys also received a beating .
She finally managed to escape with a group of civilians , but only after the Tigers had fired on them .
She was separated from her family , who were sent to the internment camps at Vavuniya , and taken to a court , which ordered her to be detained at Ambepusse for a year - the standard treatment for those who confess to LTTE membership , even if they had been coerced .
Ravindram Vajeevan , 17 , said he arrived at Ambepusse on 9 April after escaping from the Tigers four days earlier .
He had a large scar on his left arm where he had been shot by his former comrades as he ran away .
He had been taken from his family in Mullaitivu on 29 March , as fighting raged around the shrinking no - fire zone and LTTE numbers dwindled .
A large group of men arrived at the house , he said , and dragged him from the bunker where he had been sheltering .
" They hit me and my mother was crying and I was crying , but they said I had to go to fight .
My neighbours tried to stop them , but they said they would shoot .
Then they fired in the air , " he said .
He was taken to a camp with about 70 other young boys and taught how to make a bunker , how to handle a rifle , how to escape from an ambush and how to stage an attack .
They were told that if they did not fight they would be shot from behind , he said .
On the fifth day , he escaped .
" In the beginning , the LTTE were fighting for the Tamils , but in the end they were just fighting for themselves , " he said .
Thambirasa Jagadiswary , 20 , and her brother Thambirasa Thisanandan , 17 , were reunited at Ambepusse after the the Tigers took them from their family .
Jagadiswary was taken in June 2008 and drafted into a mortar unit before being captured ; her brother was dragooned in February this year .
He had spent 15 days with the rebels before escaping and surrendering .
Afterwards he was taken to Vavuniya with his parents .
" They told us there that those who were in the LTTE should register , so I did , " he said .
" Then they told me they would separate us from our parents . "
" I was talking with my friends when they brought him in , " his sister said .
" All of a sudden I saw my brother and I started crying and shouting and hugging him . "
Their mother remains in the internment camp at Menik Farm .
These teenagers ' revelations come days after the UN human rights council rejected a call for an investigation into allegations of war crimes by both sides during the 26 - year conflict and accepted an alternative Sri Lankan government resolution describing the conflict as a " domestic matter that does n't warrant outside interference " .
The Sri Lankan military has also been accused of committing war crimes by firing on civilians .
Among the traumatised and unwilling child soldiers of the Tamil Tigers , there is just a desire for normality to return .
" I was one year with the LTTE and I must be one year here , " said Jagadiswary .
" Now I would just like to find my mother and get on with my life . "

Since when do politicians listen to the people Period .
Bloggers are people .
However if you are out there blogging it is evident that our education and understanding are only based on what they are told from the stories they read .
No unlearned responses .
Being an outside the box thinker I am very often misinterpreted and all I am trying to do is open minds to new perspectives when most ( lightly ) people can only understand the lines in which they have been taught by others .
( The system works this way ) WHY ?
The amount of prejudice when you are hidding behind a screen name is astonishing .
( Including ) Those Dems , those Reps , those Libs , those Cons .
Politicians eat it up , playing hands , while behind the scenes they all eat and play together .

" I hear it 's delish with arugula lettuce . "
From Wikipedia :
Arugula : Plantae , Angiosperms , Eudicots , Rosids , Brassicales , Brassicaceae , Eruca , E. sativa
Lettuce : Plantae , Angiosperms , Eudicots , Asterids , Asterales , Asteraceae , Lactuca , L. sativa
Eudicots : " ... A large number of familiar plants are eudicots .
A few are forget - me - not , cabbage , apple , dandelion , buttercup , maple and macadamia .
So " I hear it 's delish with arugula maple syrup " or " I hear it 's delish with arugula applesauce " would have been just as accurate .
If you start from the Arugula line :

I was going to love Bobby big time , but , of course , they murdered him .
I think he would have fit into your 40 - year time frame .
I think the only way anyone could think Obama is doing a good job is if they are not paying close enough attention ... falling for the mouth instead of the actual .
I 'm pretty sure that has to be the explanation .
If you want to know precisely what I feel constitutes his perfectly hateful start in the job , just go here .

I 'm paying very close attention , and I think it 's way premature to be able to conclude , at this time , whether he 's doing a " good job " yet or not , given the mess he walked into ( and note : I did n't vote for him either ) .
He is doing a very good job , in some areas and in some respect , and not a very good job in others , where there may ( or may not ) be good reason at this early date .
I think it 's incredibly premature , and even counter - productive , to have decided to " already loathe , hate and despise our shiny new president " , but that 's just my opinion , which is not necessarily the same one held by all BRAD BLOG comment moderators , of course

I DID vote for him , because he was our only hope and I was terrified the Republicans would throw the election yet again unless a tsunami voted against them , but , er , if you have been paying close attention , I do n't see how you can say it is premature .
He has committed himself fully to a number of extremely *- like actions , including now letting the polar bear thing stand , and covering up for torturers and leaving loopholes torturers can drive trucks through in order to continue torturing and , well , I 'll go postal if I keep enumerating his huge failures , his abysmal start .
I 'm heavily in favor of optimism when there is a basis for it , but there is n't one on too many vital fronts .
He has very speedily committed himself to not only perpetuating , but worsening , some awful things .
I have to let go of how much I only want to like him , and I think others should too .
But in any case , at least stop taking what he only says as good or bad , and look at what he does .
That 's when you start seeing who you 've got .

I so totally grant you that he was handed the worst mess ever handed a president , except maybe FDR , but not even really because I do n't think the government itself has ever been this thoroughly broken before , even for the Civil War .
I would not feel this harshly if Obama had been making real efforts in accord with the Constitution and that clearly favor the good of the people over the plutocrats .
Even if he failed with those sorts of efforts , I would not hold it against him because he would have shown that he is here for The People .
He has n't done that .
He 's appeased criminals and corporate megaliths at HUGE cost to The People in terms of food , shelter , life and limb instead .

Look , the last place I 'd like to be is in one of defending Obama here .
But I guess I 'll have to , for the moment .
He has committed himself fully to a number of extremely *- like actions , including now letting the polar bear thing stand , and covering up for torturers and leaving loopholes torturers can drive trucks through in order to continue torturing Perhaps you do n't recall the job the Rs and their friends in the media did on both Carter and Clinton when they came in too gangbusters ( as they saw it ) , right off the bat ?
You do n't notice the effectiveness of moving forward cautiously in these early days , solidifying support with the American people , even while the Rs shoot themselves in the face at the same time ( as they think they 're dealing with Carter or Clinton , and thus making fools of themselves as they call plays from the wrong playbook ? )
There is plenty that I 'd prefer he do very differently .
But if you 're unable to a )
Note all of the very positive stuff he has done , along with b ) the possible political reasons for taking far - less than good stances , at this time , on a number of issues , than you 're being very shortsighted .
Just one example :
While the overstated notion that he's " covering up for torturers " is debatable at best ( in truth , it 's not his call whether to prosecute , and he has given leeway to his AG , whose call it is to make , on whether and how to move forward or not ) , there is a very real politik calculation to be made as to whether being seen as directly pushing forward with torture / war crimes trials might make health care and environmental objectives wholly unattainable in his first term entirely , due to out - and - out partisan spite / retaliation in the bargain .
While I 'd strongly suggest torture / war crimes accountability must move forward no matter what --- as should health care and environment efforts --- a legitimate argument can be made that in doing so one risks losing the other two entirely for many more years , at a time when both efforts are imperative , and more politically feasible than ever before .
I do n't dig that cynical political calculation , frankly , but I understand it , and recognize the reality of it , and that chess players win out over checkers players in general .
I also think he'd be making a mistake to fall prey to that cynicism .
However , to take those considerations and turn them into " covering up for torturers " and reason to " already loathe , hate and despise " him would be , as you charged , would be , as I suggested earlier , both premature and shortsighted .
I would not feel this harshly if Obama had been making real efforts in accord with the Constitution and that clearly favor the good of the people over the plutocrats .
But he has .
Perhaps not enough for you ( or for me ) , or enough for now , but to overlook those places where he has done so , and otherwise ignore the real politik conditions that he must negotiate if he wishes to pull off so many things over ( his hopeful ) two terms would be either politically naive or shortsighted in evaluation after just over 100 days in office .
IMHO , of course .
I 'd also remind you that no politician ever does anything just because it 's the right thing to do ( at least in most cases ) .
It 's usually a matter of people rallying , and then politicians coming to the front of the parade to the wave the flag .
If you give up , or inappropriately write off your best potential flag waver too early , you are also doing your own causes a disservice , IMO .

I 'm sorry , Brad .
I do n't mean to be insulting , truly , but it all just crashes onto my eyeballs like sophistry .
The REALITY of the situation is that our government is broken , and the politicians in it are never acting in good faith .
Arguing the perspective of realpolitik is just psychedelic nowadays .
Obama has gone to court to argue for positions * took and over which all of us were utterly scandalized .
He 's taken legal positions that are flat out un-Constitutional , including perpetuating the fallacy that he can tell the AG what to prosecute and what not to prosecute .
He 's upped the drone bombings of innocent civilians in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
He 's completely caved on the " Long War " CRAP and we just have to hope Iraq can make it impossible for him to defy the deadline to butt out ... and they probably can't .
I do n't want to argue about this stuff .
I 've given links before and a link to a universe of links that attest to the veracity of my position .
He 's doing a shit job .
I happen to think he 's doing it at gunpoint , but that is no excuse .
THAT IS NO EXCUSE .

In fact , I 'm beginning to suspect *'s obsession with the notion that history would vindicate him has to do with us all figuring out that he was doing it at gunpoint .
Everybody gets stuck on the notion that Congress is being blackmailed .
Despite all the institutionalized mechanisms for outright meretricious action in our government , and the certainty that there is plenty to blackmail them with , I think the stakes are a lot higher than having their greed , lawlessness and indiscretions exposed .
No , really !
That stuff is tossed off almost without a care on a regular basis nowadays .
They can't honestly fear it that much .
Maybe I 'm just too naïve , but I think they are all under some kind of much more horrible threat .
That explains this psychedelic " government " to me , where nothing else does .

In my mind 99 , that is political ambition / posturing , he would have gotten no where without it .
IMO , if he had voted like we want him to vote back then , he would have been relegated to the nose bleed seats politically , especially the presnutcy .
He is very good at it , better than Arlen anyway

Precisely , Flo , precisely !
And he belongs in the nose bleed seats if he did not use his peerless political skills to get in there to save lives , save our country , stop the psychedelic allegiance to fascistic principles that is all that functions in our government anymore !
I just read this a minute ago .
I was so strongly against Hillary because I knew in my bones she would do this stuff with alacrity .
Obama was the only one who offered any hope against it , and he 's dashed that hope .

I just now finally worked up the moxie to blubber my way through the half hour radio tribute to John we posted the other day .
As I was blubbering my way through it , it struck me that my feeling for John is exactly what I 'm talking about not going off what Obama says but what he does .
I never met John .
I had one email with him .
I loved , trusted and respected him from what showed up every day here from him .
I knew him from his deeds .
John Gideon was high on my list of great people , without even having to call it anything , without doing anything to get my attention , just flat out performing .
Why do we let politicians say stuff to cover or color what they do ?
What they do should do all their speaking ....
Our attention should be on the actual performance of their tasks , not their performance in front of the microphone .

In case there is any question , 99 , I assure you , my attention is , in fact , on what Obama ( and all the others ) do , rather than what they say .
My comments above are made with that in mind .

99 , John did n't have to get elected to the presidency .
That may sound like a cop-out , but its not if you consider the realistic viewpoint .
Its one thing to be strongly opinionated , its another thing to be elected and strongly opinionated .
As Obama mentioned in is very early Senate career .... he was quickly learning that " politics is a team sport " .
He knows , even as president , that he can't ramrod every possible change down the country 's throats .
He ultimately needs the support of congress , and if he needs that , he has to play the political games necessary to that end .
He ultimately has to pick his battles and not take on every single issue .
If the ONLY thing he does is tackle healthcare insurance and resolve it , that would be more than the vast majority of presidents have accomplished since this nation started .
Yet , he appears poised to possibly do much more that just that .
Think of how much of his first 100 days has been spent ' undoing ' 8 years of bush doctrine .
Surely he does n't want his legacy to just be " the president that undid bush " , so he 's trying to pick battles that will help the country consistent with his world view .
Maybe your biggest problem with him is that you voted for him .
I made that mistake in 2004 by voting for Kerry ( same logic as you indicate voting for Obama ) .
Never again .
I voted for REAL change even if there was n't a snowball 's chance in hell of it occurring .
I knew Obama would be a corporate shill , but at least LESS of one than Clinton or even McCain , and certainly less than bush .
Thus far I 'd say he 's more of a corporate shill than I thought he would be , but its at least believably motivated by an underlying need to save jobs at this point in time ( bailing out auto companies will save millions of jobs , esp when you consider vendors that supply parts and services to those companies ) .
I wish he'd do more on the constitutional issues as well , but I can at least understand he 's only got so many hours per day , and if he pursued every bush injustice , he 'd likely alienate certain elements from which he will need support to get his healthcare and other ideas passed .
His philosophy appears to be " you attract more flies with honey than you do with vinegar " .
While I 'd like to see him eventually drown the flies with vinegar , I 'm not holding my breath , and in the meantime hopefully he can get some decent stuff passed ( and un- passed ) , albeit with the help of those flies .

No , I thought of the voting for him angle , and I checked my gut again .
I checked it eighteen ways to Sunday before I voted for him .
I had three reasons --- beside the terror of another stolen election , that is . [ 1 ]
He was the only choice where there was any hope of truly positive action ; [ 2 ] the kids were batshit crazy for him ; and [ 3 ] it was a chance to help make Martin 's dream come true .
None of my intensely - held good reasons to try my hardest to trust in the hope he held out , slim as it was , have been ruined by his shit performance .
My problem is that I have way more time to look at and read the many reports of the many AWFUL things he 's DOING while we can't hear him pontificating .
Here 's just one more example from today .
He 's actively trying to thwart the prosecution of torturers .
His excuse for it is LAME ... outright barnswoggle on its face , and do n't even get me started on this latest crap about " healthcare reform " or I 'll go postal .
Maybe I 'm suffering under the delusion that he should be able to see clearly that being such a purely political animal spells doom for a huge swath of the global population , and discern that no matter if he 's positive it will make things harder for him , or even LETHAL for him , there are certain things he should do anyway .
But everywhere I look he is outright caving to the huge money interests , slitting our throats in the bank bailouts with NO help for homeowners , on healthcare , on MILITARY ADVENTURISM , flouting the rule of law , the CONSTITUTION , plain decency , without even grumbling about it .
The only excuse for it I would ultimately accept is that he 's been playing along while he cleans the federal government of the moles who are driving all this global perfidy .
I 'm pretty sure he 's not doing that .
He 's basking in his presidentude while criminals continue to loot and get away with it , and war criminals get to go on tv and try to define torture down to patriotic toughness .

The rupee is generally shortened to Rs or INR The Indian finance ministry has begun a public competition to select a design for the symbol of the rupee .
Unlike the major currencies of the world like the dollar , the pound , the yen and the euro , the rupee does not have a globally recognised symbol .
The new symbol would be the " identity of the Indian currency , " a finance ministry official told the BBC .
The contest , which closes on 15 April , is open only to resident Indians , a release on the ministry website says .
' Ethos of India '
The rupee is generally shortened to Rs or sometimes the currency is described as INR ( Indian rupee ) .
But , the government says , these are not symbols , they are mere abbreviations for rupee .
To get an internationally - accepted symbol , the finance ministry has invited entries from the public .
" The symbol should represent the historical and cultural ethos of India , " the deputy secretary in the finance ministry 's coin and currency department , BS Rawat , told the BBC .
" The entries can be in any of the Indian languages .
They can even be in English which is also an accepted language of use by the government , " Mr Rawat said .
Each entry has to be accompanied by a fee of 500 rupees ( $ 10 ) and a participant can send a maximum of two entries .
The rules also say that the " symbol should be applicable to the standard [ computer ] keyboard " .
Officials say the winning entry will be chosen by a seven - member jury of experts drawn from various art institutes , the government and India 's central bank , the Reserve Bank of India .
Five shortlisted entries for the final selection will be awarded a prize of 25,000 rupees ( $ 500 ) and the winner will take 250,000 rupees ( $ 5,000 ) .
" The final selected symbol will become the property of the government and the designer will have no rights over it any more , " Mr Rawat said .
Experts say implementing a new currency symbol can be an expensive exercise .
According to one estimate , when the euro was introduced in 1999 it cost Europe 's biggest companies more than $ 50bn to update their computer systems to deal with the changeover .
" We have not thought about the costs yet , " Mr Rawat said .
" First , we 'll select a symbol and then we 'll do the costing , " he added .
The contest closes on 15 April at 1300 local time ( 0730G ) .
Detailed guidelines on how to prepare the entries have been put up on the finance ministry 's website .

" Medical marijuana is an issue of mercy and compassion , " said Rev. Bill Pyatt of the First United Methodist Church of Carthage .
" We pray that the Illinois legislature will have the compassion to stop this war on patients . "
Religious proponents of the Senate bill , which is expected to be decided before Thursday , say although medical marijuana use and decriminalization of drug use are related , they are separate issues .
Several studies suggest that marijuana can mitigate nausea , pain and anxiety for patients with illnesses such as HIV , cancer , multiple sclerosis and chronic pain .
Theological arguments are based on these findings .
" Jesus lived his life healing those where he could , " said Rev. Al Sharp , executive director of Chicago - based Protestants for the Common Good .
" This is entirely consistent with that . "
Denominations that officially support medical marijuana include the United Methodist Church , Presbyterian Church ( USA ) , Union for Reform Judaism , Unitarian Universalist Association , Episcopal Church , and United Church of Christ .
If passed , the legislation would create a three - year pilot program allowing the state Department of Public Health to give registry identification cards to people with doctors ' recommendations for cannabis .
Eligible patients would be entitled to seven dried cannabis plants and 2 ounces of dried usable cannabis .
Illinois State Police oppose the bill , saying there is no way to measure impairment for enforcement of DUI laws , and calling marijuana a gateway drug .
For decades , the " holy war on drugs " has focused less on law enforcement and more on providing havens and recovery .
" There are a lot of folks who are looking at re-entry of folks coming out of prison , " Sharp said .
" We need to look at it from the front end called ' no entry . '
It is very repressive drug laws putting people in prison who should have other alternatives . "
Note : ' Medical marijuana is an issue of mercy and compassion , ' one religious leader said .

In our campaign to save Sarah Connor Chronicles , we 've asked supporters to take pictures of themselves with products from show sponsors .
Here are some results , including one person who got ( work - safe ) naked for Sarah !

In on ongoing efforts to remind FOX that the world loves Sarah Connor Chronicles , and does n't want to see it terminated , we 're joined by E !
Online ( whose readers voted it the show they most wanted to see renewed next year ) , CNN , Wired , and of course you , the human resistance .

It scares me a little that this fan is from renowned mega- physics research facility Fermilab ( check out his lanyard ) , and also seems very serious about his Terminator makeover .
Is he the guy who is actually building the Terminators ?
This fan loves Sarah so much that she even willingly chose to buy a Verizon product .
See how much we care about this show ?
Are you listening , FOX ?

And not only did this fan choose show sponsor AT&T as his provider , but he actually got a Brian Austin Green haircut .
Looks really good !

Make those FOX execs pay attention , and show them that you 'll do anything - even buy products from their show sponsors ( here 's a list ) - to keep this kickass show going .
Sources tell us that Verizon was one of the biggest sponsors , so be sure to throw them a bone if you can .

US scientists have reported a dramatic improvement in the activity of catalytic nanoparticles destined to replace platinum in fuel cells .
They say their bimetallic ’ nanodendrites ’ are more than twice as effective than current state - of - the - art platinum catalysts and could help make future fuel cells more economically viable .
Proton - exchange membrane ( PEM ) systems are promising fuel cell technologies , but they require rare metal catalysts .
The new catalyst , developed by a team at Washington University in St Louis and Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York , consists of platinum ’ arms ’ anchored to a palladium core .
These arms increase the surface area of the precious metal available for the oxygen reduction reaction ( ORR ) in a fuel cell and thus could substantially reduce the amount of catalyst needed .
’ One of the main barriers for commercialisation of fuel cells is the expense of the catalyst - we have to reduce the price by at least three or four times , ’ says Younan Xia , who led the team .
’ As we have shown , if you can increase the activity , then you can reduce the amount you need on the electrodes and significantly reduce the price . ’
Xia uses 9nm octahedral palladium nanocrystals as ’ seeds ’ from which to grow his dendrite structures .
The platinum arms , which bear facets that are particularly active for the ORR , are formed via the reduction of K 2 PtCl ?
4 by L- ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) .
Although the team have n’t yet pinned down the exact mechanism of growth , Xia says the palladium is crucial .
’ If you just use platinum , the particle you form is pretty close packed , so somehow this palladium is very important . , ’ he explains .
’ It defines where you ’re going to have nucleations for platinum and forms this open structure .
The arms stay separate from each other so the reagents can still diffuse to this area . ’
As a result , their catalyst is far more effective by mass at reducing oxygen than current commercial catalysts - two and half times that of platinum - carbon catalysts and five times that of platinum black .
’ I really like their synthetic approach , and praise them in their accomplishment in terms of faster rates for the ORR , ’ says Francisco Zaera , a surface chemist at the University of California Riverside .
’ If there is a weakness , it is in their limited characterisation of the stability of the catalyst .
This is critical if the technology is to be used in practical applications . ’
Adding gold , says Xia , could make the catalyst more durable - currently it loses around half its active surface area after 10,000 cycles .
Zaera thinks more research is needed to determine what causes the decrease in activity , which he suggests could be related to loss of the original morphology or mixing of the platinum and palladium phases .

NJIT 's new 1.6 - meter clear aperture solar telescope — the largest of its kind in the world — is now operational .
The unveiling of this remarkable instrument — said to be the pathfinder for all future , large ground - based telescopes — could not have come at a more auspicious moment for science .
This year marks the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's telescope that he used to demonstrate that sunspots are indeed on the Sun .
" With our new big , beautiful white machine , Galileo 's work can leap ahead with a capability never before available , " said NJIT distinguished professor of physics Philip R. Goode .
Goode , the heart and soul of the project , has been director of Big Bear Solar Observatory ( BBSO ) , since NJIT took over management of BBSO in 1997 from California Institute of Technology .
Located high above sea level in Big Bear Lake , CA , the observatory is one of six major land - based facilities supported by federal funding .
This photo is the first light image from the new solar telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory .

" We are already seeing photos offering a better understanding of the Sun , " said Goode .
" With this instrument we should be able to have a better understanding of dynamic storms and space weather — which can have dramatic effects on Earth . "
Earlier this month , researchers achieved what is called first scientific light .
This means the telescope is finally operational .
To achieve its full powers , at least three more years of work will be needed .
Photos from the first observations are still being processed .
Nevertheless , Goode and his researchers were able to extract a few unique images and one is shown here .
It clearly illustrates the before - and - after capabilities of the old versus new telescope .
" Our prized first image shows the Sun 's ever - present , turbulent granular field with its largest granules being about the size of Alaska , " Goode said .
" The small , bright points in the dark lanes are the smallest - scale magnetic structures on the Sun .
Look closely at the " after " photo ( which you may want to enlarge ) and you will see a string of pearls .
Each pearl is a cross-section of an intense , single fiber of the Sun 's magnetic field - the basic building block of the solar magnetism . "
Goode adds that the Sun is now in a state of prolonged magnetic inactivity , perhaps the longest such time in a century .
" The new telescope is ideal for studying the Sun as it rises from this strange state of quietude , " he added .
The new instrument has three times the aperture of the old telescope .
It represents a significant advance in high - resolution observations of the Sun , since it has the largest aperture of any solar telescope in existence , said Goode .
Other pluses include a marvelous location -- high in a Southern California mountain lake , and since it is an off - axis instrument , there is no part of sunlight blocked by the telescope , itself .
The new telescope will be used in joint observation campaigns with NASA satellites to optimize the scientific output of all observations of the Sun.
BBSO has always operated in such campaigns , but now can do so with greatly - enhanced capabilities .
The National Science Foundation ( NSF ) , Air Force Office of Special Research ( AFOSR ) and NASA have provided more than $ 5 million in hardware components .
The telescope is filled with new technologies .
The 1.7 - meter ( equivalent to 4.6 feet ) primary mirror was polished by the world - renowned Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory at the University of Arizona ( UA ) .
The extremely - precise measurements of the mirror 's shape required the application , for the first time , of a computer - generated hologram .
The development of this technology will be essential for figuring the next generation of even - larger night time telescopes .
The final error in the primary mirror is only a few parts in a billion from its desired parabolic shape .
" Buddy Martin at the UA Mirror Lab has described the mirror in ours as the pathfinder for large nighttime telescopes that are about - to - be built , " said Goode .
This is the new solar telescope at Big Bear Solar Observatory .

Another key design issue for this large - aperture solar telescope was the creation of a thermal control system capable of maintaining the temperature of the mirrors near or below ambient air .
To achieve this , the dome employs a wind - gate and exhaust system which controls the airflow from the wind .
The structure maintains the same temperature inside and outside the dome , and clears concentrations of heat in and around the optical paths .
In addition , BBSO engineers implemented a closed - cycle , chilled - air system as part of the telescope mount to limit so - called " mirror seeing . "
This sweeps away turbulent cells and directly cools the primary mirror .
After a day of observations , the mirror must be cooled overnight to ensure that it is somewhat cooler than ambient in the morning .
DFM Engineering , Longmont , CO , built and tested the optical support structure and active - support mirror cell for the enormous mirror .
It is supported by 36 actuators that can bend out low - order aberrations , such as those due to gravity and / or thermal effects .
The telescope is now in its commissioning phase in which more sophisticated observations are made possible with the implementation of advanced hardware .
These include adaptive optics to correct for atmospheric distortion and hardware to measure magnetic fields in visible and infrared light .
" It is good at last to have our destiny in our own hands rather than those of our capable partners , " said Goode .
" Seeing first light was a great moment because the team in BBSO finally knew that its big white machine works as we had planned . "

Rebuffing criticism of the warm greetings he exchanged with Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez , President Obama said Sunday that the United States , with its overwhelming military superiority and need to improve its global image , could afford to extend such diplomatic “ courtesy . ”
In a news conference capping a three - day meeting of leaders from the Western Hemisphere , Obama also said the U.S. must engage other countries through humanitarian gestures , not only military intervention .
Obama said it would be a mistake to measure the Summit of the Americas by the specific agreements reached .
By listening to his counterparts and eschewing heavy - handed diplomacy , he said , he was creating an atmosphere in which , “ at the margins , ” foreign leaders are “ more likely to want to cooperate than not cooperate . ”
A running theme of the summit was Obama ’s cordial dealings with Chavez , who once called former President George W. Bush the “ devil ” and who last month dismissed Obama as an “ ignoramus . ”
The two were photographed smiling and clasping hands .
At one meeting , Chavez made a show of walking around the table as the cameras rolled and handing Obama a copy of “ Open Veins of Latin America , ” a 1971 book by Eduardo Galeano chronicling U.S. and European imperialism in the region .
Republican Sen. John Ensign of Nevada , appearing on CNN on Sunday , said it was “ irresponsible ” for Obama to be seen “ laughing and joking ” with the Venezuelan president .
Obama dismissed such concerns .
He said the 2008 presidential campaign proved that American voters want the president to engage with his counterparts , whether or not they are avowed friends of the U.S .
He said it “ was a nice gesture to give me a book .
I ’m a reader . ”
The president added that the election was a referendum of sorts on the argument that U.S. solicitude toward foreign leaders could be seen as “ weakness . ”
“ The American people did n’t buy it , ” Obama said .
“ And there ’s a good reason the American people did n’t buy it , because it does n’t make sense . ”
The U.S. has nothing to fear from Venezuela , a large supplier of crude oil to the country , Obama said .
“ Its defense budget is probably 1/600th of the U.S. , ” he said .
“ They own [ the oil company ] Citgo .
It ’s unlikely that as a consequence of me shaking hands or having a polite conversation with Mr. Chavez that we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States . ”
That said , Obama aides were not so charitable toward Chavez .
In a background briefing earlier , one senior official accused Chavez of performing for the cameras .
The official , who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity , said , “ Anybody who ’s been at international conferences with Chavez knows that if there ’s a camera around , he ’s going to find a way to get in it . ”
Apparently impressed with Obama , Chavez seemed ready to reevaluate relations with the United States .
He announced that he was considering appointing an ambassador to Washington , an idea he discussed over the weekend with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton .
The two countries expelled each other ’s ambassadors last year .
“ We have a different focus , obviously , ” Chavez said on Venezuelan state television .
“ But we are willing .
We have the political will to work together . ”
Though Cuba ’s fate was not on the official agenda of the summit , which included only democratically elected leaders from the hemisphere , many Latin American leaders pressed Obama to lift the United States ’ 47 - year - old trade embargo on the island nation and normalize relations .
Obama resisted .
His administration has already announced that it is loosening travel restrictions on Cuban Americans visiting family on the island .
But at this point , Obama has refused to go further , calling upon Castro to move toward a more open and democratic form of government .
Lawrence H. Summers , the president ’s top economic advisor , said Sunday that the embargo would not end any time soon .
“ That ’s way down the road , and it is going to depend on what Cuba . . . does going forward , ” Summers , who accompanied Obama on the trip , said on NBC ’s “ Meet the Press . ”
In his news conference , Obama said he welcomed Cuban leader Raul Castro ’s statement last week that his government wanted a full dialogue with the U.S. about a range of issues , including human rights , treatment of dissidents and media restrictions .
Castro also acknowledged that the Cuban government may have been wrong in some of its positions .
“ And so we ’re going to explore and see if we can make some further steps , ” Obama said .
With three foreign trips now behind him , the president was asked to outline the “ Obama doctrine ” : the principles by which he will be conducting foreign policy .
He stressed the importance of acting in collaborative fashion , rejecting the more unilateral approach taken by his Republican predecessor .
He noted that Latin American leaders had mentioned to him that thousands of Cuban doctors were deployed across the region treating patients , the type of humanitarian aid that spreads goodwill .
That , he said , is “ a reminder for us in the United States that if our only interaction with many of these countries is drug interdiction , if our only interaction is military , then we may not be developing the connections that can , over time , increase our influence and have a beneficial effect when we need to try to move policies that are of concern to us forward in the region . ”
The summit exposed Obama to the personality quirks and grievances of leaders who ’ve chafed under past U.S. presidents and policies .
Daniel Ortega , Nicaragua ’s leader , gave a 50 - minute speech at the opening ceremony Friday in which he denounced capitalism .
At a news conference , Bolivian President Evo Morales alleged that the U.S. had been complicit in attempts to overthrow him .
Morales also wanted Obama to repudiate an alleged attempt to assassinate him last week .
In response , Obama said he wanted to “ condemn any efforts at violent overthrows of democratically elected governments , wherever it happens in the hemisphere .
That is not the policy of our government . ”
After spending much of the month steeped in international summitry -- first in Europe and then Trinidad and Tobago -- Obama seemed ready to get back to the White House .
“ Time to get home , ” the president said .

But there is a deeper structural and philosophical reason why the Palestinians remain stateless — a reason more profound than the political narrative would indicate .
It is best explained by associate Johns Hopkins professor Jakub Grygiel , in his brilliant essay , “ The Power of Statelessness : the Withering Appeal of Governing ” ( Policy Review April / May 2009 ) .
In it , Grygiel does not discuss the Palestinians in particular , but rather the attitude of stateless people in general .
Statehood is no longer a goal , he writes .
Many stateless groups “ do not aspire to have a state , ” for they are more capable of achieving their objectives without one .
Instead of actively seeking statehood to address their weakness , as Zionist Jews did in an earlier phase of history , groups like the Palestinians now embrace their statelessness as a source of power .
New communication technologies allow people to achieve virtual unity without a state , even as new military technologies give stateless groups a lethal capacity that in former decades could be attained only by states .
Grygiel explains that it is now “ highly desirable ” not to have a state — for a state is a target that can be destroyed or damaged , and hence pressured politically .
It was the very quasi- statehood achieved by Hamas in the Gaza Strip that made it easier for Israel to bomb it .
A state entails responsibilities that limit a people ’s freedom of action .
A group like Hezbollah in Lebanon , the author notes , could probably take over the Lebanese state today , but why would it want to ?
Why would it want responsibility for providing safety and services to all Lebanese ?
Why would it want to provide the Israelis with so many tempting targets of reprisal ?
Statelessness offers a level of “ impunity ” from retaliation .
But the most tempting aspect of statelessness is that it permits a people to savor the pleasures of religious zeal , extremist ideologies , and moral absolutes , without having to make the kinds of messy , mundane compromises that accompany the work of looking after a geographical space .
Grygiel raises a challenging proposition .
If his theory is correct , then the Palestinians may never have a state , because at a deep psychological level , enough of them — or at least the groups that speak in their name — may not really want one .
Statehood would mean openly compromising with Israel , and , because of the dictates of geography , living in an intimate political and economic relationship with it .
Better the glory of victimhood , combined with the power of radical abstractions !
As a stateless people , Palestinians can lob rockets into Israel , but not be wholly blamed in the eyes of the international community .
Statehood would , perforce , put an end to such license .
The closest that Israelis and Palestinians ever came to peace was at the end of the Clinton Administration in 2000 , when then - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak of the center - left Labor Party offered a slew of concessions to the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat — only to have Arafat reject them .
Arafat ’s epitaph was that he remained loyal to the cause of his people , that he never compromised , and that he was steadfast to the bitter end .
He may have seen that as a more morally and emotionally satisfying conclusion to a life of statelessness than that of making the unenchanting concessions associated with achieving statehood .
Government officials handed confidential police intelligence about environmental activists to the energy giant E.ON before a planned peaceful demonstration , according to private emails seen by the Guardian .
Correspondence between civil servants and security officials at the company reveals how intelligence was shared about the peaceful direct action group Climate Camp in the run-up to the demonstration at Kingsnorth , the proposed site of a new coal - fired power station in north Kent .
Intelligence passed to the energy firm by officials from the Department for Business , Enterprise and Regulatory Reform ( BERR ) included detailed information about the movements of protesters and their meetings .
E.ON was also given a secret strategy document written by environmental campaigners and information from the Police National Information and Coordination Centre ( PNICC ) , which gathers national and international intelligence for emergency planning .
At first officials at BERR refused to release the emails , despite a request under the Freedom of Information Act from the Liberal Democrats .
The decision was reversed on appeal and although large sections have been blacked out , they show :
• BERR officials passed a strategy document belonging to the " environmental protest community " to E.ON , saying : " If you have n't seen this then you will be interested in its contents . "
• Government officials forwarded a Metropolitan police intelligence document to E.ON , detailing the movements and whereabouts of climate protesters in the run-up to demonstration .
• E.ON passed its planning strategy for the protest to the department 's civil servants , adding : " Contact numbers will follow . "
• BERR and E.ON tried to share information about their media strategies before the protest , and civil servants asked the energy company for press contacts for EDF , BP and Kent police .
Last night the disclosures were criticised by environmentalists , MPs and civil liberty groups , adding to the growing controversy over the policing of protests .
The Met commissioner , Sir Paul Stephenson , last week requested an independent review of his force 's tactics , amid mounting evidence of violent behaviour by officers at the G20 protests .
Two Met officers have been suspended for alleged brutality , including one who has been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter following the death of the newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson on 1 April .
Denis O'Connor , the chief inspector of constabulary , who will carry out the review , is now expected to look at other demonstrations , including last year 's policing of Kingsnorth .
Further concern about police tactics emerged last week when 114 environmental campaigners were arrested in a pre-emptive raid .
David Howarth MP , who obtained the emails , said they suggested BERR had attempted to politicise the police , using their intelligence to attempt to disrupt a peaceful protest .
" It is as though BERR was treating the police as an extension of E.ON 's private security operation , " he said .
" The question is how did that [ police ] intelligence get to BERR ?
Did it come via the Home Office or straight from police ?
And once they'd got this intelligence , what did they do with it ? "
Shami Chakrabarti , the director of Liberty , said the sharing of police intelligence between BERR and E.ON was a serious abuse of power .
" The government is in danger of turning police constables into little more than bouncers and private security guards for big business .
Police should be used to protect potential victims but also to facilitate people 's right to protest , " she said .
Kevin Smith , a spokesman for the Climate Camp , said : " The proposed coal - fired power station at Kingsnorth is a source of both international climate embarrassment to the government and reputational damage to E.ON , so it comes as no surprise that they are colluding to undermine the growing social movement of people in this country who are determined to prevent it from happening ...
We demand to know who is responsible for passing on this information and see them held accountable . "
One email from E.ON to BERR on 24 July gave details of the company 's security strategy .
In another , sent on 28 July , BERR forwards intelligence from the PNICC , detailing activists ' movements , listing times , dates and numbers involved .
Last night a spokesman for E.ON said it was normal practice for energy companies to confer with " relevant authorities ... when strategically important energy assets such as power stations are being threatened with mass trespass and potentially violent closure " .
He said : " We absolutely respect people 's right to protest peacefully and lawfully .
However , it is clear that there are some groups which very publicly aim to disrupt the safe operation of our sites , in which case our priority will always be for the safety of everyone involved . "
A spokeswoman for BERR said : " Policing the climate camp protests was firmly a matter for the local police force concerned .
However , given the potential threats to the security of energy supplies posed by the protests , it is only right that the government liaised with the police and the owner of the power station to exchange factual information and discuss contingency plans . "

HOSTS ABC'S " THIS WEEK "
FEBRUARY 8 , 2009
LAWRENCE H. SUMMERS , DIRECTOR , NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL
GOP CHAIRMAN MICHAEL STEELE
GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS , HOST
STEPHANOPOULOS : Welcome to " This Week . "
After bitter debate ...
SEN .
LINDSEY GRAHAM , R- S.C. : Look at this bill .
This bill has got to be done by tonight .
SEN .
BARBARA BOXER , D - CALIF . :
Holding up a bill , theatrical .
Did you ever do that when George Bush was president ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : A deal in the Senate .
SEN .
SUSAN COLLINS , R- MAINE :
At a time of crisis , we can work together .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Can Congress pass the president 's test ?
Will the plan forestall more staggering job loss ?
And what can be done to shore up failing banks and save peoples ' homes ?
Questions this morning for the president 's top economic adviser and the Republican Party 's brand - new chairman .
STEELE : Get ready , baby .
It 's time to turn it on .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Michael Steele and Larry Summers , only on " This Week . "
Then ...
OBAMA : This is a self - induced injury .
I screwed up .
This is a bad mistake .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... President Obama 's first setbacks .
That and the rest of the week 's politics on our roundtable with George Will , Robert Reich , Newt Gingrich , and Claire Shipman .
And , as always , the Sunday funnies .
JAY LENO , TALK SHOW HOST :
You can tell a lot of these CEOs do n't get it .
They said , " Well , that 's $ 500,000 a month , right ? "
ANNOUNCER : From the heart of the nation 's capital , " This Week " with ABC News chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos , live from the Newseum on Pennsylvania Avenue .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS : Hello again .
It is all about the economy .
Late last night , senators filed the latest version of the stimulus deal they hope to pass Tuesday , and that same day , President Obama 's team is likely to unveil its latest version of the bank bailout plan .
Here to discuss all that this morning , the president 's top economic adviser , Larry Summers .
Welcome back to " This Week . "
SUMMERS : Good to be with you , George .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Let me start out by putting up a little chart that shows the House and Senate versions of this stimulus package .
Let me show our viewers that right now .
The overall cost is about the same , the House $ 820 billion , Senate $ 827 billion , but the composition different .
The Senate has about $ 100 billion more in tax cuts , but $ 40 billion less in state aid , $ 20 billion less in education , $ 15 billion less in payments to individuals , some other differences .
I know that , when the president was meeting with these moderate Republican senators this week , including Senator Susan Collins of Maine , he told them he endorsed their efforts to scrub the bill of what they called excessive spending .
Does that mean the president prefers the Senate version to the House version ?
SUMMERS : No , the president feels that , above all , we need a major program enacted very quickly that will create 3 million to 4 million jobs .
He believes we need to perfect it in every way we can .
If there are programs that are n't going to serve important purposes , they should be -- they should be eliminated .
He certainly believes that .
He 's open to good ideas from both -- from both sides .
But we 're going to have to look at both these bills , assuming the Senate bill passes , as most people expect at this juncture , and craft the best possible approach going forward .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But some ...
SUMMERS :
There are certainly good ideas in both versions , and we 'll have to draw from those ideas in creating an ultimate vehicle , but the most important thing is that people come together and create the 3 million to 4 million jobs .
You know , there 's 90 percent overlap now .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , let 's ...
SUMMERS : We 've got to get to closure on the last 10 percent , George .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Some of the critics of the Senate bill say that the most important elements have been -- have been brought down .
Paul Krugman , writing on his blog this morning , said , " Some of the most effective and most needed parts of the plan have been cut . "
He 's citing especially that $ 40 billion in state aid .
And he goes on to say that , " My first cut says that the changes to the Senate bill will ensure that we have at least 600,000 fewer Americans employed over the next two years . "
SUMMERS : There 's no question we need -- we need a large , forthright approach here .
There are crucial areas , support for higher education , that are things that are in the House bill that are very , very important to the president .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But will the Senate bill produce fewer jobs ?
SUMMERS : There 's no question -- no question what we 've got to do is go after support for education .
And there are huge problems facing state and local governments , and that could lead to a vicious cycle of layoffs , falling home values , lower property taxes , more layoffs .
And we 've got to prevent that .
So we 're going to have to try to come together in the conference .
And the president is certainly going to be active in sharing his views as that process -- as that process ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That 's what I 'm trying to get at .
If he -- if he shares his views ...
SUMMERS : ... goes on .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... is he going to be saying , " Wait a second .
Move this more to the House side , because I do n't want this education and state spending cut , or move it more to the Senate side " ?
SUMMERS : George , I do n't think this is about the House bill or the Senate bill .
It 's about the best bill for America .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So which of the ideas are better ?
SUMMERS :
There are respects -- there are respects in which both bills can surely be improved , and the president 's going to work as thoughtfully and aggressively as he can to move this process along , drawing on the -- drawing on the very important strengths that are contained in both these bills .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But it sounds ...
SUMMERS :
There are certain priorities -- education , health care , infrastructure investment -- that the president is certainly not going to want to lose sight of .
SUMMERS :
At the same time , he has insisted that this not be Washington business as usual , no earmarks .
We do n't engage in wasteful programs just because they 're a tradition or someone 's prerogative .
So it 's not going to be a matter of choosing between two products .
It 's going to be a matter of creating the best possible bill we can for the country .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So it sounds like what -- it sounds like what you 're saying is the president 's overall message is , " There 's great overlap here .
I might as president prefer to have more education funding , but the most important thing right now is to get this done . "
That 's his most important goal .
SUMMERS :
The most important thing is to get this done for the sake of an economy that lost 600,000 jobs in one month alone .
That 's as many jobs as there are in the state of Maine .
So coming together , making sure that the investments are as productive as they possibly can be , that 's the president 's priority .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
As you know , the overwhelming majority of Senate Republicans and House Republicans are opposed to this bill .
And the Senate Republican leader , Mitch McConnell , said the other day that Democrats have failed to learn the lessons of history .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
SEN .
MITCH MCCONNELL , R-KY . , SENATE MINORITY LEADER :
The big- spending programs of the New Deal did not work .
In 1940 , unemployment was still 15 percent .
What got us out of the doldrums that we were in during the Depression was the beginning of World War II .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
They say the president is repeating mistakes of the past .
SUMMERS :
Those who presided over the last eight years , the eight years that brought us to the point where we inherit trillions of dollars of deficit , an economy that 's collapsing more rapidly than at any time in the last 50 years do n't seem to me in a strong position to lecture about the lessons of history .
We need an approach that 's very different than the approach that we had that brought us to this point .
That 's what the president is providing .
There are millions of people in this country who need work .
There is a huge amount of work that needs to be done modernizing our schools , creating a green economy .
And what the president 's program does is give that needed work to the millions of people who need work .
That 's why a very wide consensus of economists -- they may disagree about the details or which particular step you should take , but a very wide cross-section of opinion believes that this economy needs help quickly .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
The president hoped for far more bipartisan support , a much broader bipartisan coalition to support this bill .
Do you accept the criticism from some that what he should have done is weigh in harder when the House was passing their legislation to make sure that some of the spending that 's been criticized was n't in there or -- I guess I 'm saying , was there a better way to do this ?
Or is the failure of bipartisanship a failure of Republicans ?
SUMMERS : The president 's walked a long mile .
You know , in his first week as president , George , he went up to speak to the Republican Senate caucus and the Republican House caucus .
Already he 's asked me to be up with the Republican caucus twice .
That 's two more ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But they say he ...
SUMMERS :
That 's two more times than I was there ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... he went and talked to them , but did n't take any of their ideas .
SUMMERS : ... with the -- with the eight years .
He 's been open to a number of ideas .
The president was very strongly criticized by many in his own party for the fact that the measure includes more than a third tax cuts , including several major tax cuts for business .
But it has n't really been enough .
And ultimately the president can't do more than walk a long way down the road towards bipartisanship .
But if you look , traditional Republican areas , small business , support for business , business investment more generally , they 're represented in this program .
So we 've been very open to the best ideas from all sources .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But on the biggest criticisms coming from the bulk of Republicans right now , that the package should be smaller and more targeted to tax cuts , less spending , the president has reached his bottom line ?
He 's not going to go any further in that direction ?
SUMMERS :
The president wants the most effective program he can possibly -- he can possibly have at a time when , frankly , even since the process of developing this package began six or eight weeks ago , the economy looks worse than it did at that time .
And bringing the amount of help we give the economy down at a time when the economy is looking worse and worse does not seem the right -- does not seem the right way forward .
Rather , the right way forward is to improve the -- is to improve the program .
Look , the president has said again and again and again that if there are programs that are n't effective , if there are programs that wo n't work , he is open to compromise and discussion on those .
His bottom line , though , is we need a major program , we need it quickly to create those 3 million to 4 million jobs .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me -- let me get to the state of the economy , because some economists have been even more alarming than you are right now .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
This week , two economists , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco , Janet Yellen , said , " I think we do have the same type of dynamics taking place that do happen in a depression . "
The managing director of the IMF , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , was quoted in Bloomberg News as saying , " Advanced economies are already in a depression , and the financial crisis may deepen unless the banking system is fixed .
The worst can not be ruled out . "
Already in a depression ?
SUMMERS : We 're in a very serious situation , George .
This is worse than any time since the Second World War .
It 's worse than I think most economists like me ever thought we would see .
But let 's remember .
In the Depression , the unemployment rate was 25 percent .
GDP had fallen in half .
We were really in a very different situation than that .
But all of this concern -- the risks of deflation , for example -- points up the importance of acting as aggressively as we can .
That 's why the president 's economic recovery program is so important .
That 's why it needs to be twinned , as it will be this week , with the financial recovery program directed at shoring up the flow of credit so that people can get the loan to buy a car ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me -- let me ask you about that .
SUMMERS : ... so that we can address the problem which has , frankly , gone unattended for much too long of declining house prices .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask about that financial overhaul .
Originally , Secretary Geithner was supposed to give that speech tomorrow .
Administration officials are telling me it's now more likely on Tuesday ?
SUMMERS : Yes , I think there 's a desire to keep the focus right now on the economic recovery program , which is so very , very important .
STEPHANOPOULOS : So Tuesday it is .
Let me show what 's been reported so far about the elements , the broad - based elements of what are in the plan that you 've been working on with Secretary Geithner : a proposal to insure banks against more losses , as has already been done with Citibank ; some kind of a facility to purchase the toxic assets , although that may be done through trying to encourage private investors to buy up the toxic assets ; injecting more capital into the banks ; increased lending by the Federal Reserve ; and , of course , foreclosure relief for homeowners .
Are those the basic , broad principles inside the plan ?
SUMMERS : You know , I 'm not going to get into previewing Secretary Geithner 's announcement , but I can tell you this :
The focus is going to be on increasing the flow of credit and doing it with transparency , with accountability for those who receive support , and with a kind of consistency that , frankly , we have n't seen so far .
So , yes , there will be support for banks so that they remain stable , are in a position to lend .
There will be support for the credit markets more generally .
And absolutely critically , there will be support and pressure that assures that these needless foreclosures are avoided and that government is acting aggressively to contain the damage in the housing markets .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So it 's probably $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion in the package to prevent these foreclosures ?
SUMMERS :
The president 's made clear that he 's very committed to foreclosures .
I expect that it will be $ 50 billion or more that will be directed at providing support for the housing sector of our economy .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And there was a -- a report in the New York Times yesterday that this plan would not require banks to start -- to start lending or to lend more .
Is that true ?
SUMMERS :
The program will have -- I 'm not -- as I say , George , I 'm not going to get into describing Secretary Geithner 's program ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But that 's a pretty fundamental point .
SUMMERS : But he will be -- he will be proposing a program that will make certain that we are stabilizing this system and increasing credit -- credit flows , because that 's got to be -- that 's got to be the objective to increased credit flows .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But you will not be asking for more money in this package ?
SUMMERS :
In this package , we are going to use -- you know , it 's pretty rare for -- I 'm not sure there 's any precedent for a president being successful in passing legislation even before he 's elected .
And so it was a very significant step when the authorization to use the remainder of the $ 700 billion TARP funds was given to the president even before he was elected .
And , frankly , after all the problems that program has , the priority now has to be restoring trust , demonstrating that the financial system can be supported in ways that are accountable and transparent , and make a difference .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But Senator ...
SUMMERS : And that 's what -- that 's where the president 's focus is going to be .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But Senator Conrad and many private economists have said that you 're going to need to be asking for $ 300 billion to $ 500 billion more for the financial institutions down the road .
Is that a reasonable estimate ?
SUMMERS : Right now , the focus is on beginning a process of repair .
SUMMERS : What was done averted what could have been a profound collapse , but the credit markets in the country are n't working right .
And that 's an important part of the reason why the economy 's not working right .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But more money going to be needed down the road ?
SUMMERS : And right now , we 've got to put more money -- right now , we 've got to put more money in to make that system more effective and to do it with transparency and accountability .
We 'll do what 's -- we 'll do what 's necessary .
That 's something the president has been very clear on .
He wants us -- he believes the government needs to be leaning forward , that we need to make sure that we are ahead of these problems .
And he 'll be recommending whatever necessary -- whatever measures are necessary to achieve that objective .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So no new money now , but maybe down the road ?
SUMMERS : We 'll see what happens , George .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Mr. Summers , thanks very much for your time today .
SUMMERS : Thank you .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And now for the Republican perspective , the chairman , the new chairman of the Republican National Committee , Michael Steele .
Welcome to " This Week " and your first appearance as chairman .
STEELE : Good to be here .
Yes , it is .
It 's great to be with you .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Well , you heard Larry Summers right there on the stimulus package .
He says that after eight years , after the last eight years , your party has no credibility on the economy .
STEELE : Well , I think that 's laughable .
I mean , he acts like we have spent the last eight years in -- in this -- in the mess that we 're currently in .
This is about 18 months old .
The reality of it is , Bush inherited a recession .
He got us through that recession .
The spending was out of whack .
There 's no doubt about that .
And a lot of Republicans had a problem with the level of spending that took place during that time .
But the economy did grow .
Close to 6 million jobs were created .
Now we 're on the downside of that and -- in that cycle .
And the question now becomes , how do we as a country shore up this economy ?
And I had -- did n't hear anything from Mr. Summers that assured me or reassured me that this administration gets it when it comes to how you create wealth in this nation .
It is not by spending dollars on programs that you can put in a separate bill and deal with later on , instead of focusing on , you know , tax credits and -- and relief for small - business owners , incentives for people to get back into the credit markets , to deal with the mark - to - market rules that have stymied the banks and -- and deal with the housing crisis .
STEPHANOPOULOS : But outside of Washington , some strong Republican voices have said the stimulus package is needed now .
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger , Governor Charlie Crist of Florida , he supports the package .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GOV .
CHARLIE CRIST , R- FLA . :
This program will help us with education , with health care , Medicaid specifically , infrastructure .
These are the kinds of things that produce jobs .
It could mean $ 13 billion to the sunshine state .
It comes at a time when we need it .
People need jobs .
It 's about jobs , jobs , jobs .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
He suggests that you and Republican Party leaders here in Washington are on the wrong side of the biggest issue , jobs .
STEELE : Well , no -- you know , with all due respect to the governor , I understand where he 's coming from .
Having been a state official , I know what it means to get those dollars when you 're in tight times .
But you 've got to look at the entire package .
You 've got to look at what 's going to create sustainable jobs .
What this administration is talking about is making work .
It is creating work .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
But that 's a job .
STEELE : No , it 's not a job .
A job is something that -- that a business owner creates .
It 's going to be long term .
What he 's creating ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So a job does n't count if it 's a government job ?
( CROSSTALK )
STEELE : Hold on .
No , let me -- let me -- let me finish .
That is a contract .
It ends at a certain point , George .
You know that .
These road projects that we 're talking about have an end point .
As a small - business owner , I 'm looking to grow my business , expand my business .
I want to reach further .
I want to be international .
I want to be national .
It 's a whole different perspective on how you create a job versus how you create work .
And I 'm -- either way , the bottom line is ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : I guess I do n't really understand that distinction .
STEELE : Well , the difference -- the distinction is this .
If a government -- if you 've got a government contract that is a fixed period of time , it goes away .
The work may go away .
That 's -- there 's no guarantee that that -- that there 's going to be more work when you 're done in that job .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Yes , but we 've seen millions and millions of jobs going away in the private sector just in the last year .
STEELE : But they come -- yes , they -- and they come back , though , George .
That 's the point .
When they go -- they 've gone away before , and they come back .
And the point is that the small - business owners take the risks .
They 're the ones that are out there in the morning putting that second mortgage on the house , taking the risks that are necessary so that they can employ your -- your kids and my kids and future generations .
That 's sustainable , long - term growth .
Otherwise , then why do we need the small - business community ?
Why do n't we all just get a government job and call it a day ?
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So your plan would simply be more incentive to small businesses ?
STEELE : Pardon me ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : Your plan would simply be more incentives to small businesses ?
STEELE : More incentives -- more incentives to small businesses , at the same time correcting those rules in the markets that have hindered and frustrated the banking process , that have lent itself to drying up the credit markets as we see them , dealing with the Fannie and Freddie crisis more respectfully and more proactively , instead of sitting back and figuring out , " Oh , well , let them take care of it . "
That 's how we got into this mess from the beginning .
Remember , in 2003 , George Bush sent a bill to the Congress asking them to deal with the Freddie - Fannie crisis at that time .
And the committee said no .
So the reality of it is , all of this stuff that we are now dealing with could have been dealt with along the way .
STEELE : And I do n't think -- and I think a large , significant number of Republicans and -- and Americans out there who are n't Republican -- believe that the best way to handle this is not throwing more money at it , but rather dealing with the crisis at hand ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : And , in fact ...
STEELE : How does -- how does -- I mean , I 'm all for Pell Grants , but how does a Pell Grant , increasing funding for Pell Grant get me a job when I just lost mine ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : Well ...
STEELE : And that 's the question Americans are asking themselves .
And that 's why the president is upside - down with the voters on this issue .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
That is one program .
Democrats would say that the broader school construction funding will create jobs .
Do you accept that ?
STEELE : For a short term , yes .
It 's a construction job .
I agree with that .
But , you know , do we need to put -- is that what you -- we need to put in place right now when you can look at other ways in the economy to stimulate that type of growth ?
STEPHANOPOULOS : And your Republican National Committee has passed a resolution about the government bailout of the financial industry .
It says , " Be it further resolved that the members of the Republican National Committee call for all Republican members of the Senate and the House of Representatives to oppose any and all further bailout legislation . "
Does that mean you expect to oppose the plan that Secretary Geithner will be announcing this week and any future requests for funding ?
STEELE : Let 's see what -- see what the secretary 's putting on the table .
But if he 's talking about more spending , yes , I have a problem with that , and I think a lot of people do .
Look , no one 's talking about the downstream effect of all this money getting into the markets , let alone what 's happening internationally with governments flooding their -- their economies with cash .
There 's a little thing called inflation .
There 's a little thing called -- you know , that form of taxation on your earnings is worse than anything else you can do .
So this is -- this is not being done in balance .
This is being done out of balance , where everybody is feeling -- let 's solve this problem by taking more money out of -- out of people 's pockets and putting it into the system .
What I 'd rather have us do is invest dollars in creating pathways , incentives for small - business owners , for the business community of this country to take the risk again in the marketplace .
STEPHANOPOULOS : You just got elected of the Republican National Committee last week ...
STEELE : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... yet you 're already facing some headlines about potential financial irregularities in your past .
The Washington Post yesterday ...
STEELE : Yes .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... and I want to give you a chance to respond to these allegations -- here was the Washington Post yesterday .
It says that " Steele 's campaign spending is questioned . "
It goes on to say , " Michael S. Steele , the newly elected chairman of the Republican National Committee , arranged for his 2006 Senate campaign to pay a defunct company run by his sister for services that were never performed , his finance chairman from that campaign has told federal prosecutors . "
Is that true ?
STEELE : No , it 's not true .
And -- and -- and those allegations were leveled by a convicted felon who is trying to get a reduced sentence on his -- on his conviction .
And the reality of it is that the U.S. attorney , as well as the judge , looked at what he presented and did not apply it , said there was no credibility to it .
The Washington Post ought to be ashamed of itself for getting out in front of something without all the facts .
To the extent that we gave the Washington Post the documentation to show the receipts that were -- that were used and applied towards the $ 37,000 , it was a legitimate reimbursement of expenses .
If my sister had not been reimbursed , I and she would have been in violation of McCain - Feingold finance law .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Yet the records show -- and I hope you can clear this up , as well ...
STEELE : Sure .
STEPHANOPOULOS : ... that the payment was made in December 2007 , and your sister 's company had been dissolved 11 months before that .
STEELE : Well , that was -- that 's -- that I do n't know about .
What I do know about is the fact that , as she understood it , the company was still in existence .
Her lawyers were -- were telling her they were in the process of dissolving the company .
So at the time when the checks were written back to her to reimburse her , she just said go ahead and write the checks to the company , because the company had , you know , done the services that were provided .
But , again , even in that instance , you can still -- there are many companies out there that dissolve and still receive payments for services that are rendered , and so forth .
So I -- that aspect of it for me is , again , is clarified , cleared up with the lawyers , and was a legitimate transaction back to her .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
And all of the other allegations in -- in the article about financial transfer is false ?
STEELE : It 's all false .
Everything -- the thing about this , George , that is so frustrating to me is that you 're -- you 're -- you 're looking -- the Washington Post elevated this -- this guy to a level and gave him credibility when no one else would .
That 's disturbing .
The fact is , we 've supplied -- all these documents are on record with the state board of elections , with the FEC .
And I think , if there were any funny business there , in two - and - a - half years -- because they audit , and the lord knows I have enough Democrats pouring through my records to -- you know , in the last few years , they would have caught that .
So this is ...
STEPHANOPOULOS :
You say it 's been cleared up , but the Washington Post also reports that federal agents have contacted your sister just in the last few days .
STEELE : And that is for purposes of closing out this -- closing out this matter , because , once the judge -- once the judge did not apply or did not think that this was credible , in terms of reducing this gentlemen 's sentence , the FBI is now in the position of winding this thing ...
( CROSSTALK )
STEPHANOPOULOS :
So they have told you , you are not being investigated ?
STEELE : I have not -- this is the thing .
I have not been contacted by the FBI at all .
And what we sent to the Washington Post is , would you just wait ?
You 're getting ahead of yourselves here .
You 're trying to make a story out of something that is n't a story .
We 'll provide you with the information .
STEELE : We faxed to them , gave to them the receipts , all the documentation that we have .
And let me tell you one other thing , George .
We 're going to -- we 're being very proactive about this , because I 'm sick and tired of this -- this " gotcha " business that the Washington Post and other -- others in the media attempt to engage in .
We 're getting out in front .
We 're pulling all the data together .
We 're going to take it to the FBI .
I 'm not going to wait for them to come to me .
I 'm going to take it to them and give them everything that they think they need .
And if that 's not enough , we 'll give them more ...
STEPHANOPOULOS : OK .
STEELE : ... because I want to clear up my good name .
This is not the way I intend to run the RNC , with this over my head .
We 're going to dispense with it immediately .
STEPHANOPOULOS :
Thank you for sharing that this morning .
STEELE : Thank you .
Just to be a jerk , Glenn Beck yesterday used his show to demonstrate -- like a number of his fellow right - wingers -- his utter contempt for Earth Hour : running his klieg lights at full blast to show how much energy he could waste .
Yeah , that 's the kind of responsible rhetoric we need more of .
Whatever .
But the really special moment in the broadcast came when he started talking about wind power as an alternative form of energy with Tom Borelli of the " Free Enterprise Action Fund " -- a right - wing anti-environmental outfit -- about the Obama energy plan , and this burst out :
Beck :
You can't make wind energy work without nuclear energy as well .
Wind stops -- Borelli :
You know that , but Congress does n't know that .
Beck :
Use your common sense !
Hey America !
Use common sense here !
Let just try this out !
Wind , when it blows , makes energy .
When it stops , you can't store it , so what 's making the energy ?
Wind energy does n't work without something else making energy for when the wind stops , which it does -- especially if Al Gore controls the temperature , and all the winds and everything else , so we never have blowy days !
Agh !
The problem with Beck is that he packs so much ignorance and misinformation into a single rant that it 's hard to figure out where to start .
Suffice to say that one can easily find out that there are numerous strategies for dealing with the unreliability of wind power :
Electricity generated from wind power can be highly variable at several different timescales : from hour to hour , daily , and seasonally .
Annual variation also exists , but is not as significant .
Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability , this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system .
Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation , incremental operating reserve , and ( at high penetration levels ) could require an increase in the already existing energy demand management , load shedding , or storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables .
At low levels of wind penetration , fluctuations in load and allowance for failure of large generating units requires reserve capacity that can also regulate for variability of wind generation .
A series of detailed modelling studies which looked at the Europe wide adoption of renewable energy and interlinking power grids using HVDC cables , indicates that the entire power usage could come from renewables , with 70 % total energy from wind at the same sort of costs or lower than at present .
Intermittency would be dealt with , according to this model , by a combination of geographic dispersion to de-link weather system effects , and the ability of HVDC to shift power from windy areas to non-windy areas . [ 27 ] [ 28 ]
Pumped - storage hydroelectricity or other forms of grid energy storage can store energy developed by high - wind periods and release it when needed . [ 29 ]
Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods .
The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage ; the cost of storage may add 25 % to the cost of any wind energy stored , but it is not envisaged that this would apply to a large proportion of wind energy generated .
Thus the 2 GW Dinorwig pumped storage plant adds costs to nuclear energy in the UK for which it was built , but not to all the power produced from the 30 or so GW of nuclear plants in the UK .
In particular geographic regions , peak wind speeds may not coincide with peak demand for electrical power .
In California and Texas , for example , hot days in summer may have low wind speed and high electrical demand due to air conditioning .
Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers , to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70 % more efficient ; [ 30 ] widespread adoption of this technology would better match electricity demand to wind availability in areas with hot summers and low summer winds .
Geothermal heat pumps also allow renewable electricity from wind to displace natural gas and heating oil for central heating during winter , when winds tend to be stronger in many areas .
Another option is to interconnect widely dispersed geographic areas with a relatively cheap and efficient HVDC " Super grid " .
In the USA it is estimated that to upgrade the transmission system to take in planned or potential renewables would cost at least $ 60 billion [ 31 ] .
Total annual US power consumption in 2006 was 4 thousand billion kilowatt hours . [ 32 ]
Over an asset life of 40 years and low cost utility investment grade funding , the cost of $ 60 billion investment would be about 5 % p.a. ie $ 3 billion p.a .
Dividing by total power used gives an increased unit cost of around $ 3,000,000,000 x 100 / 4,000 x 1 exp9 = 0.075 cent / kWh .
In other words , it 's entirely possible to build all kinds of storage capacity to overcome the problem .
Wind power certainly works best as a complementary part of a larger energy grid in which there are multiple forms of power generation .
The key is building a grid that carries the capacity to storage .
Moreover , there 's nothing that says nuclear power needs to be the source for this complementary power .
Here in the Northwest , we have lots of hydroelectric power as our energy base ; other regions use coal - fired plants .
Solar energy is also becoming a bigger player in the puzzle , as are other forms of generation .

Beck might understand all this a little better if he were using someone other than an industry shill for his information source .
The plan that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and lawmakers approved last month to fill California ’s giant budget hole has already fallen out of balance with a projected $ 8 - billion shortfall , the Legislature ’s nonpartisan budget analyst said Friday .
After analyzing recent data showing rapidly rising unemployment and lower - than - expected economic growth , Legislative Analyst Mac Taylor said the state is on track to have even less money than lawmakers anticipated in February .
State leaders said then that they had ended the financial crisis through $ 42 billion in lowered spending , increased taxes , borrowing and accounting shifts .
California ’s economy in is such bad shape that Taylor ’s office anticipates that residents ’ combined personal income will be lower this year than it was last year , leading to fewer tax dollars for state coffers .

“ I went as far back as 1950 , and I could not find a situation in which personal income had actually declined in the state , so that ’s a rather unusual event , ” Taylor said at a news conference Friday .
The dour projection is likely to complicate Schwarzenegger ’s effort to win voter approval for a package of budget - related ballot measures scheduled for a special election May 19 .
The governor and legislative leaders have said the propositions -- which include controversial bids to extend the recent tax increases , borrow against future lottery proceeds and siphon money from popular programs for children and the mentally ill -- are necessary to restore the state ’s fiscal balance .
For opponents , the new forecast is “ going to give them a tremendous argument , ” said Larry Gerston , professor of political science at San Jose State .

He noted that since last fall , Schwarzenegger and lawmakers have repeatedly announced that they have resolved the state ’s financial troubles , only to see deficits rapidly reemerge .
“ Their campaign was based on a shaky foundation as far as credibility goes . . . and this is n’t going to make it any better , ” said Jon Coupal , president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. , which opposes the special election measures .
H.D. Palmer , a spokesman for the state Department of Finance , noted that Taylor ’s estimate was based on more recent data than lawmakers had in February when they crafted their rescue plan .
“ We are continuing to work our way through a recession that has hit California ’s economy extraordinarily hard , ” Palmer said .
“ That means there is clearly a potential for the state ’s revenue picture to get worse . ”

The governor is scheduled to release a revised financial forecast in May , when the Capitol traditionally focuses on the state budget .
Lawmakers tried to head off a summer budget fight this year by tackling the deficit early and writing a spending plan that would last through the middle of next year , but Taylor ’s analysis suggests they will be forced to make major revisions this spring .
Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) said the new estimate made it more imperative that voters approve the May ballot measures .
If the package of propositions -- particularly the lottery borrowing -- is rejected , the budget gap would increase by $ 6 billion , she said .
“ We must keep a careful watch on revenues during these volatile times , ” Bass said .
“ All of us , Democrats and Republicans alike , must be prepared to continue to make tough decisions . ”
Assembly GOP leader Mike Villines , who supported the taxes and cuts passed in February , said the new budget hole would have to be plugged with further cuts if the economy does not recover .

Senate minority leader Dennis Hollingsworth ( R - Murrieta ) said he did not believe the three Republicans in his caucus who voted for tax increases would do so again .
“ We ’re going to have to find efficiencies and reduce spending on a lot of programs , ” he said .
“ It ’s very painful , but it ’s going to have to be a very necessary step . ”
Even though they are in the minority , Republicans can block any spending plan they do n’t like , because of California ’s requirement that budgets be supported by two - thirds of the Legislature .
Taylor said the new $ 8 - billion budget hole should not be as difficult to grapple with as was the $ 42 - billion gap .
He said the state may be able to tap $ 3 billion in federal money intended to increase schools spending as part of the federal economic stimulus package passed by Congress .
Advertisement
“ We ’re not that far away if we can use those federal dollars , ” he said in an interview .
That idea may not fly with California ’s school leaders .
Kevin Gordon , a lobbyist for school districts in Los Angeles , San Bernardino , Riverside , Orange and other counties , said Taylor was proposing to “ hijack federal dollars that the president and Congress intended to use to offset cuts that have already been made . ”
Beyond the short - term problems , Taylor also projected a grim long - term fiscal outlook for the state , with a $ 12.6 - billion shortfall emerging by mid-2011 and growing to $ 26 billion three years later .
“ Given these budgetary pressures , the state could experience recurring cash flow pressures in the coming months and years , ” Taylor wrote .

On his MSNBC show Countdown , host Keith Olbermann almost blew a gasket during his worst persons segment as Michelle Bachmann used some completely seriously bungled history to try to blame FDR for prolonging the Great Depression .
Here is the video :

Hoot - Smalley , that still cracks me up .
Olbermann is right .
How is the woman allowed to vote on legislation ?
She thinks that FDR signed a bill that was written by Republicans and passed 3 years before he assumed office .
What makes this even worse is that she said this on the floor of the House .
Bachmann can’t even get the GOP revisionist history about the Great Depression right .
The more I think about it , the more I start to believe that Michelle Bachmann would be the perfect running mate for Sarah Palin , should the Alaska governor with the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 .
Those two on the campaign trail would be appointment viewing .
Can you imagine Michelle Bachmann at the vice presidential debate ?
Palin debating Obama would be funny enough , but Michelle Bachmann playing the role of attack dog would be priceless .
Of course , this ticket would probably be the first ever to lose all 50 states .
What am I thinking ?
They would win Alaska , and still carry the Deep South .
I think we need to start a draft Bachmann movement for 2012 .
The Republican Party is so fractured right now that Palin and Bachmann would have a chance at being the ticket .
The Republicans need to do something about Bachmann before she drags down the last little bit of a party that they have left .
HOUSING MARKET : IRELAND
WILL see more demolition than construction of houses over the next decade , as the economy struggles to recover from the collapse of the housing market and the emergence of “ zombie ” banks , UCD economist Morgan Kelly told the conference .
In a presentation that drew several collective intakes of breath , Mr Kelly predicted that house prices would fall by 80 per cent from peak to trough in real terms .
“ Construction , but not demolition , of residential and commercial property will fall to zero for the foreseeable future , ” he said .
Low levels of education among those employed in construction – where worker numbers peaked at about 280,000 – meant retraining would not be straightforward .
Recovery will be slow : “ It has taken us 10 years to get into this situation – it will in all likelihood take us 10 years to get out of it . ”
Mr Kelly said he had been hailed as being extremely prescient as a result of his warnings in relation to the property bubble , when in fact he and a handful of other “ amateurs ” were merely stating what was obvious .
Sparing no blushes , he said professional economists in the Central Bank and the Economic and Social Research Institute “ need to look very closely at their analyses of the Irish economy and figure out what went wrong ” .
Mr Kelly said Ireland ’s “ reputational capital ” had been damaged by “ chancers ” such as ex-Anglo Irish Bank chairman Seán FitzPatrick , who had been abetted by “ buffoons ” such as former financial regulator Patrick Neary , Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan and the Taoiseach .
In discussing the € 110 billion given in loans to developers , Mr Kelly said a typical regional housing collapse in the US saw banks sustain a 20 per cent loss on these loans , but the narrowness of the Irish market increased the risk of “ substantially larger losses ” for Irish banks .
“ The guarantees of Anglo and [ Irish ] Nationwide liabilities have a strong chance of being called in over the next 21 months , ” he said .
Extending the Government guarantee to these two financial institutions was “ extraordinarily unwise ” and could produce losses that the State cannot afford to repay .
The global financial crisis may have been positive for the Irish economy as it “ stopped us dragging ourselves even deeper into our hole , ” he said .
“ If it had taken another year or two , we would have ended up in an Icelandic - shaped hole , which is not to say that we wo n’t end up in one . ”
Mr Kelly said the Government should abolish stamp duty on property , compile proper price and quantity statistics and restore competitiveness through a public sector pay cut of 10 per cent .
A paper by TCD economist Patrick Honohan on the banking crisis argued that capital injections in the banks were a prerequisite for recovery .
The financial regulator needed to decide now which banks had systemic importance to the economy – in other words , are “ too big to fail ” , and which are “ zombie ” banks .
“ The goal is to avoid the continued operation of an undercapitalised , error - prone bank with a flawed business model and administrative practices , a problematic customer base and a compromised management facing distorted incentives , ” the paper stated .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Kyrgyzstan 's decision to close a key U.S. military base is " regrettable , " Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said , but it wo n't affect the U.S. military effort in nearby Afghanistan .
Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan serves as a U.S. supply route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan .
On Friday , Russia announced it would assist the U.S. in transporting nonmilitary cargo to Afghanistan , Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said .
The United States uses Manas Air Base in Kyrgyzstan as a route for troops and supplies into Afghanistan .
Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiyev announced Tuesday that " all due procedures " were being initiated to close the base .
" It 's regrettable that this is under consideration by the government of Kyrgyzstan , and we hope to have further discussions with them , " Clinton told reporters Thursday after a meeting with French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner .
" But we will proceed in a very effective manner no matter what the outcome of the Kyrgyzstan government 's deliberations might be . "
Bakiyev made his announcement at a news conference in Moscow , Russia , following news reports of a multimillion - dollar aid package from Russia to Kyrgyzstan .
Lavrov said on Russian television that his country intends to help get vital cargo -- but no weapons or troops -- to NATO troops in Afghanistan .
The United States asked to transport the cargo through Russian territory to Afghanistan , Lavrov said .
The U.S. military is planning to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan to halt a resurgence of the Taliban .
Gen. David Petraeus , who oversees U.S. operations in the Middle East and Central Asia , described Manas as having " an important role in the deployment of these forces " and in refueling aircraft .
Senior State Department officials said the State and Defense departments are working with Kyrgyzstan to keep the lease to the base .
The officials said the Kyrgyzstan government has not yet responded to an offer to renew the lease .
Discussions are being conducted through the U.S. Embassy in Kyrgyzstan and relevant State Department and Pentagon bureaus , the officials said .
One official said the United States has almost 18 months to renegotiate the lease before it expires and hopes Kyrgyzstan will reconsider their position .
Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell called Manas " a hugely important air base . "
" It provides us with launching point to provide supplies in Afghanistan .
We very much appreciate [ Kyrgyz ] support in using that base , and we hope to continue , " he said at a daily news briefing earlier this week .
Clinton said the Defense Department " is conducting an examination as to how else we would proceed that will not affect whatever decisions we make . "
Petraeus was in Kyrgyzstan last month , partly to lobby the government to allow the United States to keep using the base .
He said he and Kyrgyz leaders did not discuss at all the possible closure of the base and said local officials told him there was " no foundation " for news reports about the issue .
The mountainous former Soviet republic is Central Asia 's second poorest country .
The United States pays about $ 63 million a year for use of the base and employs more than 320 Kyrgyz citizens there , Petraeus said .
The base has been in operation since December 2001 under U.N. mandate .
The Russian newspaper Kommersant reported Tuesday that Russia would offer Kyrgyzstan a $ 300 million , 40 - year loan at an annual interest rate of 0.75 percent , and write off $ 180 million in Kyrgyz debt .
Kyrgyzstan also is home to a Russian military base , at Kant , that officially opened in 2003 .
Kyrgyz Prime Minister Igor Chudinov told Russian news agency Interfax it was coincidence that talk of the base closure comes at the same time as the loan .
" The Russian decision to grant a major loan has nothing to do with the pullout of the U.S. air base from the Kyrgyz territory , " Chudinov said .
The relationship between the United States and Kyrgyzstan was damaged when a U.S. airman killed a Kyrgyz citizen in December 2006 .
The airman was transferred out of Kyrgyzstan , and the dead man 's family was offered compensation .
Petraeus said in January an investigation into the death was being reopened .
In announcing the base closure , Bakiyev said he was not satisfied with the inquiry and that his government 's " inability to provide security to its citizens " was proving a serious concern .
CNN 's Maxim Tkachenko contributed to this report .

T here was the American overreach under George W. Bush .
Now there 's Barack Obama 's outreach to the Muslim world .
On Wednesday , he will be in Saudi Arabia to meet King Abdullah .
On Thursday , he will be in Egypt to deliver his much - anticipated address to Muslims .
He has already taken four mini-jabs at the subject – in his inaugural address ; his Jan. 27 interview with Al - Arabiya TV ; his March 19 video address to Iran ; and his April 6 speech to the Turkish parliament .
This has drawn mixed reviews :
He would n't be addressing the Christian world , or the Jewish , Hindu or Buddhist worlds .
Why the exception for Muslims ?
By framing terrorism in religious terms , he 's treading the same turf as militant Islamists , on the one hand , and Bush , on the other .
He has no choice but to fix the shattered relationship between the U.S. and the Muslim world .
What are his challenges ?
Four experts I spoke to outlined them :
Where 's the beef ?
Juan Cole , author of Engaging the Muslim World ( Palgrave Macmillan ) , said Obama has done well to ditch Bush 's formulation that tackling Muslim militants was " like taking on the Axis powers in World War II , and the way to do it was through conquest , occupation and a transformation of the Muslim world .
" That was a huge conceptual error , doomed to failure . "
Jihadists are not the old Soviet Union nor Nazi Germany .
Non-state actors are best dealt with as the criminals they are .
However , Obama has a challenge of his own .
" Beyond denying the Bush paradigm , he must develop his own positive paradigm .
I have n't heard that articulated , " said Cole , professor of history at the University of Michigan .
John Esposito , co-author of Who Speaks for Islam ?
What a Billion Muslims Really Think ( Gallup Press ) , also feels Obama is running out of time .
" The window is beginning to close on him . "
Egypt : " There 's a real irony in the leader of the free world delivering a major speech to Muslims in one of the most repressive parts of the world , " said Nader Hashemi , author of Islam , Secularism and Liberal Democracy ( Oxford ) .
Hosni Mubarak is an oppressive dictator , " one of the most despised , in part due to his close alliance with the U.S. and collusion with Israel in maintaining the siege on Gaza . "
A better platform would have been Indonesia , the largest Muslim nation , or Pakistan , Turkey or Bangladesh , all evolving democracies .
Israel - Palestine :
It 's the No. 1 issue for Muslims , said Esposito , director of the Center for Muslim - Christian Understanding at Georgetown University in Washington .
Hashemi , a native of Toronto now teaching Middle East and Islamic politics at the University of Denver , recalled Obama 's words in Sderot last year that if his daughters were subject to daily rocket fire , as Israelis were from Hamas , he'd do everything in his power to stop it .
" This begged the question : if the president 's daughters were refugees who could not return home , stuck in one of the most densely populated areas of the globe , and subject to an ongoing siege , would Obama also do everything in his power to alleviate their suffering ?
" Failure to speak in moral terms about the plight of the Palestinians will be a massive setback for his Muslim outreach initiative . "

Iraq : If Obama 's pullout plans work out , he 'll have neutralized the second biggest source of anger .
Embracing dictators : Polls show that Muslims are as desirous of democracy as any other people .
And they resent the Western hypocrisy of promoting democracy and human rights but cavorting with Arab dictators and monarchs .
" Without naming Egypt , I think Obama will say that the U.S. will no longer be supportive of autocrats , who deprive their people the right to freedom , " said Shuja Nawaz of the Atlantic Council , a Washington think - tank on international affairs .
But that 's what Condoleezza Rice said in Cairo in 2005 , and nothing came of it .
Nawaz : " Frankly , that 's his biggest challenge – how to deal with the Islamic autocrats . "
Iran : Cole said Obama is sending mixed signals .
" He wants face - to - face talks with Iran but has named Dennis Ross as the point person .
He 's a well - known hawk on Iran .
The Iranians are upset and have made it clear they 're not going to sit down across the table from Ross .
" Also , Obama is using the Bush rhetoric about not allowing Iran to have a nuclear weapon .
But American intelligence agencies do not see an Iranian nuclear program . "
Esposito noted that Obama is not threatening to go to war with North Korea , despite its nuclear blasts .
It is , thus , important to " indicate that he is not going to be stampeded into a military action against Iran . "
Afghanistan / Pakistan : Nawaz , author of Crossed Swords : Pakistan , its Army , and the Wars Within ( Oxford ) , said Obama 's economic package for Pakistan 's tribal areas has been well - received by Pakistanis .
They are also behind the military initiative against the Taliban , being undertaken under U.S. pressure .
" The public is fed up with the Taliban but the anger can quite easily turn against the government and the U.S , given the dire situation of the internally displaced people . "
Is all this doable ?
Cole , for one , thinks so .
" Give Obama eight years , and things will look different . "

Fierce fighting is taking place between Pakistani troops and Taliban militants in Mingora , the main city in the militant - controlled Swat valley .
At least 17 militants have been killed in the clashes , the army says .
The Taliban deny the deaths .
The push into Mingora is seen as a key phase of an offensive aimed at crushing the militants , whose influence extends across a wide area of the north - west .
The fighting began after a peace deal broke down earlier this month .
See a map of the region " Street fights have begun , " Maj Gen Athar Abbas told reporters .
Barbara Plett , BBC News , Swat Clearly , the army has been bolstered by political support .
" There is a national will , " Maj Gen Ghani said .
" The operations have been endorsed by parliament , the entire nation is behind this operation . "
And this time the army will stay to provide a security umbrella so that the police and civil administration have time to recover .
Pakistan army vows
Swat victory
He said soldiers had cleared parts of the city , but added that the pace of the offensive was " painfully slow " .
" This is an extremely difficult , extremely dangerous operation , because clearance has to be done street by street , house by house . "
The military says the city is surrounded , most of the militants ' ammunition dumps are destroyed and their supply routes cut off .
The BBC's Shoaib Hassan , in Islamabad , says it is the most important battle yet in the army 's offensive against the Taliban in Swat .
A swift victory would bolster public support for a greater fight against the militants , our correspondent adds .
Exodus A Taliban spokesman confirmed that the military had entered Mingora , but denied that any militants had been killed .
The spokesman also said the Taliban would fight the security forces to their last breath .
The army says it has cut off the militants ' supply routes Residents say the militants are still in control of the city .
Nearly 1.5 million people have been displaced by this month 's fighting in the north - western region , and about two million since last August , the United Nations refugee agency says .
One resident who fled the Mingora area told the BBC that he was among many who had lost everything .
" Our homes were destroyed - we left behind our cattle and our properties , " he said .
" We walked all the way and had to walk for two days on the mountains . "
On Friday , the UN appealed for $ 543 m in humanitarian aid to help those displaced by the conflict .
Pakistan 's army began an offensive against the Taliban on 2 May after the peace deal broke down and the militants began expanding their area of influence .
A recent investigation by the BBC suggested that less than half of Pakistan 's North West Frontier Province ( NWFP ) , which contains Swat Valley , and the neighbouring Federally Administered Tribal Areas is under full government control .
In Swat , the army says that about 15,000 members of the security forces are fighting between 4,000 and 5,000 militants .
It says more than 1,000 militants and more than 50 soldiers have been killed since the offensive began .

The Kissingers ’ bourgeois existence ( piano lessons , theatre visits ) abruptly ceased .
Non ?
Jewish neighbours turned their backs .
It was Louis ’s wife , Paula , who insisted that the family leave for a new life in America .
On August 10 1938 they sailed from Le Havre to New York .
It was a narrow escape : in November , Fürth ’s synagogues were destroyed and the inhabitants of the Jewish orphanage were deported .
By 1942 , Louis and Paula ’s siblings , and Kissinger cousins who had remained behind , believing that because they had been decorated during the First World War they would be immune , had all been sent to the gas chambers .
The nonprofit organization Film Independent has announced on Monday that Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli's Ponyo will be the closing night film of the 2009 Los Angeles Film Festival on June 28 .
The story follows an ordinary boy named Sosuke ( Frankie Jonas ) and his friendship with Ponyo ( Noah Cyrus ) , a goldfish who wishes to be human .
The other castmembers include Cate Blanchett , Matt Damon , Tina Fey , Cloris Leachman , Liam Neeson , Lily Tomlin , and Betty White .
Walt Disney Pictures will open the film throughout the United States on August 14 .
TOHO released the film in Japan last July , and it became Japan 's highest grossing film of 2008 .
The Los Angeles Film Festival is also showing three live - action films from Japan : Tadashi Mori's Panda Diary , Hirokazu Kore-eda's Still Walking , and Koji Wakamatsu's United Red Army .

Recent figures also showed a surprise jump in mortgage approvals House prices rose in March for the first time since October 2007 , according to the Nationwide .
The building society said that property prices increased by 0.9 % compared with the previous month .
That reduced the annual rate of house price falls from 17.6 % in February to 15.7 % in March , with the average UK home costing £ 150,946 .
Nationwide described the change as a " surprise bounce " and warned against concluding the market had turned .
" While the rise in prices in March is welcome , it is far too soon to see this as evidence that the trough of the market has been reached , " said Fionnuala Earley , Nationwide 's chief economist .
She added that cuts in interest rates and the Bank of England 's move to expand the amount of money in the system - known as quantitative easing - would take time to work through into the housing market before there was a " sustained " recovery in house prices .
Nationwide 's guarded comments on reading too much into the monthly figures are backed up by the three - month on three - month data , often seen as better indicator of underlying price trends .
See the national and regional breakdown The Nationwide survey found UK prices dropped by 4.2 % in the first three months of 2009 compared with the last quarter of 2008 .
Signs of recovery ?
Ms Earley said that the significant slowdown in falling prices year - on - year was distorted by the sharp decline in the market last year .
Nationwide 's figures show that prices of flats have been more volatile than other types of properties .
The figures come shortly after the Bank of England reported that mortgage approvals for house purchases in Britain rose more than expected in February .
The rise in mortgage approvals by all lenders - to 38,000 approvals in the month , up from 32,000 in January - is a good short - term indicator of actual lending and suggests this may now pick up .
Recent surveys from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors ( Rics ) have shown rising interest from prospective buyers .
Simon Hayes , economist at Barclays Capital , said that thanks to " the improvement in mortgage approvals and the rise in buyer enquiries that Rics has been showing , there are tentative indications the housing market may be stabilising " .
" It may be six months to a year before we see a durable recovery , " he added .
On Monday , the Nationwide said it was to buy the Dunfermline Building Society 's branches , good loans and deposits .
The Scottish mutual was put up for sale after incurring losses of £ 26 m .
National breakdown
During the first three months of the year , Northern Ireland experienced the largest annual rate of house price falls - down 29.6 % .
But this was the only part of the UK to see some moderation in the rate at which prices had fallen in the past three months .
Scotland had the slowest annual fall in prices in the first quarter of 2009 , at 12.6 % , but the rate of price falls " picked up significantly " in the first three months of the year - suggesting that price falls in Scotland are lagging behind much of the UK .
Wales saw an annual fall in property prices of 18.2 % , but also witnessed the biggest drop in the three - month on three - month figures compared with the rest of the UK , at 8.3 % .
The Nationwide said that the quarterly figures in Wales tended to be more volatile than elsewhere .
In the English regions , house prices in the South , on average , fell faster than those in the North over the year .
The most expensive homes in the UK were in London , at an average price of £ 242,678 , and the cheapest were in the north of England at £ 112,986 .
National / regional house price breakdown Region Average Price Quarterly % change Annual % change North £ 112,986 - 4.40 % - 14.60 % Yorkshire & Humberside £ 127,412 - 3.90 % - 16.00 % North West £ 130,572 - 3.20 % - 15.30 % East Midlands £ 126,673 - 4.50 % - 17.20 % West Midlands £ 136,166 - 3.90 % - 15.30 % East Anglia £ 143,987 - 5.60 % - 19.90 % Outer South East £ 172,356 - 4.50 % - 18.40 % Outer Metropolitan £ 209,667 - 3.70 % - 17.40 % London £ 242,678 - 5.30 % - 18.20 % South West £ 167,470 - 2.90 % - 14.90 % Wales £ 123,990 - 8.30 % - 18.20 % Scotland £ 130,975 - 5.10 % - 12.60 % Northern Ireland £ 138,537 - 4.10 % - 29.60 % UK £ 149,709 - 4.20 % - 16.50 %

Wells Fargo sells house at a Texas foreclosure auction for $ 49,000 less what was offered just days before the foreclosure sale AND by the same buyer !
According to a recent article in the Houston Business Journal , last fall a potential homebuyer found the home of his dreams listed for sale in Kingwood , a suburb of Houston .
The home was listed for $ 339,000 .
Since the home was in disrepair , the buyer made an offer to purchase the home for $ 260,000 .
The owners turned down the offer because they owed more than that on the property .
( The estimated balance on the home loan taken out with Wells Fargo in 2006 was $ 297,535 according to Foreclosure Information & Listing Service , Inc. )
After the owners of the home moved out , the potential home buyer started negotiations with Wells Fargo .
He offered Wells Fargo $ 260,000 cash – but got no response from Wells Fargo .
According to the article , the buyereven made a last - minute effort to buy the home from Wells Fargo the day before the foreclosure sale on February 3 , 2009 .
Wells Fargo required a minimum bid of $ 211,000 for the house at the foreclosureauction .
The buyer was the only bidder at the foreclosure saleand offered the minimum bid price .
He bought the home at the foreclosure salefor $ 49,000 lessthan he had originally offered Wells Fargo !!!
I hope Wells Fargo is smart enough not to seek a deficiency from the previous owners of the home .
If Wells Fargo does try to collect the difference between what was owed on the debt and the amount the property sold for at the foreclosure sale ( the deficiency ) , I think a jurywill have a thing or two to say to Wells Fargo !
US Navy boffins say they have made a significant breakthrough in countermeasures against sea mines - by using superconductors to nullify the magnetic signature of an American destroyer .
The Office of Naval Research ( ONR ) says that high - temperature superconductor ( HTS ) " degaussing " coils fitted to the destroyer USS Higgins were first turned up to full earlier this month in trials off San Diego , and worked successfully .
" We were pleased to have been selected as a test platform , " said Commander Carl W Meuser , captain of the Higgins .
" The benefits of HTS degaussing will give us a great warfighting advantage going forward .
This technology has a myriad of potential applications . "
The ONR describes its new high ( er ) - temperature superconductor degaussing kit as a " cloaking device " , and notes correctly that three - quarters of US naval vessels put out of action by enemies since 1950 have been victims of mines .
Famously , Saddam Hussein 's forces were able to knock out a US cruiser and a helicopter carrier - USS Princeton and USS Tripoli - in the Gulf War of 1991 using mines : inflicting far more naval damage than they sustained .
" Finding better ways to mitigate the threat of naval mines is something the whole program team takes a lot pride in because we know our work will save lives , " says George Stimak of the ONR .
" HTS degaussing technology will provide new options to the naval architect in designing future advanced degaussing systems . "
In this context , " high " temperature is actually very cold .
The Higgins ' ceramic superconductor degaussing coils actually have to be kept chilled to - 240 °C in order to function .
But this is worth doing , according to the ONR , because the much greater flux density which can be generated by a superconductor can generate a given magnetic field - necessary to cancel out that of the ship 's ferrous structure - for less power and less weight .
" The superconductivity of this new degaussing system means less energy is required , yet it enables greater degaussing performance , " according to Brian Fitzpatrick , an engineer who worked on the system .
" Additionally , there is significant weight saving – up to 80 percent in some cases . "
That does sound worthwhile : but it may be a while before superconductor degaussing becomes universal .
Steel warships have been fitted with copper degaussing coils ever since magnetic mines came in , during WWII .
No new " cloaking device " is on offer , just a somewhat refined one .
And degaussing is n't really a cloaking device against sea mines anyway .
Simple buoyant mines which are triggered by a ship banging into them are still very common ; others , generally laid on the sea bed like magnetics , sense the noise a vessel makes as it passes overhead .
Still others detect the pressure wave caused by the target vessel 's hull passing over .
Modern designs often use two or three different sensors .
Even if you are up against purely magnetic mines , degaussing - no matter how good - is only a partial protection .
It is n't practical to eliminate a large steel ship 's signature altogether : thus minehunting ships , designed to work in minefields , are made of wood , glass - reinforced plastic or stainless steel - and have enhanced degaussing coils too .
Then , the weight and power consumption of existing degaussing coils are n't all that significant in the context of warship design : the DG coils are n't all that big a headache for naval architects to put in , or for the ship 's generators either .
So superconductor degaussing probably is n't going to revolutionise naval mine warfare - which is three - quarters of modern naval warfare , much though you would n't know it from being in a modern navy .
But it is interesting , all the same . ®

A new study of jackdaws shows that these crow - like birds react to humans watching them , changing their behavior depending on who is looking and how the gaze moves .
“ Jackdaws seem to recognize the eye ’s role in visual perception , or at the very least they are extremely sensitive to the way that human eyes are oriented , ” said Auguste von Bayern one of the study ’s authors from the University of Oxford .
The study , published in Current Biology , found that hand - reared jackdaws took significantly longer to retrieve food if a human was staring at the food than if the person was looking away .
The bird would only react in this way if the person was a stranger and therefore potentially threatening .
The jackdaws were also able to interpret certain eye movements and hand gestures from the humans to find food that had been hidden , such as finger pointing or moving eyes .
The jackdaws were unable to read communication that was static , however , such as an unmoving stare or a tilted head .
The discovery is particularly surprising since other intelligent species , like chimpanzees and dogs , have been found to be insensitive to staring or eye movement , according to von Bayern .
Instead , these species appear to depend on other forms of communications , such as head or body orientation or movement .
They do not appear to comprehend eyes as communicative organs .
“ We may have underestimated the psychological realms of birds , ” von Bayern said .
“ Jackdaws , amongst many other birds , form pair bonds for life and need to closely coordinate and collaborate with their partner , which requires an efficient way of communicating and sensitivity to their partner ’s perspective . ”
The researchers hypothesis that jackdaws respond to human eyes , because unlike many species they use eyes to communicate with each other .
Similar to human eyes , jackdaws ’ have a dark pupil surrounded by a white iris .
Jackdaws are corvids , the same genus as crows and ravens , and are one of the smallest birds in this genus .
Highly sociable , they live in large hierarchal groups and are one of the only known species to have been observed giving and sharing food frequently .

Conficker worm found in hospital equipment
The worm , known as “ Conficker , ” has not harmed any patients , they say , but it poses a potential threat to hospital operations .
“ A few weeks ago , we discovered medical devices , MRI machines , infected with Conficker , ” said Marcus Sachs , director of the Internet Storm Center , an early - warning system for Internet threats .
Around March 24 , researchers monitoring the worm noticed that an imaging machine was reaching out over the Internet to get instructions — presumably from the programmers who created Conficker .
The researchers discovered that more than 300 similar devices at hospitals around the world had been compromised .
The manufacturer of the devices told them none of the machines were supposed to be connected to the Internet — and yet they were .
Normally , the solution would be simply to install a patch , which Microsoft released in October .
But the device manufacturer said rules from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration required that a 90 - day notice before the machines could be patched .
“ For 90 days these infected machines could easily be used in an attack , including , for example , the leaking of patient information , ” said Rodney Joffe , a senior vice president at NeuStar , a communications company that belongs to an industry working group created to deal with the worm .
Mr. Chapnick is an assistant professor of Defence Studies at the Canadian Forces College and a writer for the History News Service .
As Barack Obama looks abroad for allies in the war in Afghanistan , he should move fast to put Canada at the top of his list .
Thus far , however , the incoming administration 's message to Canadians has been disappointing .
The principal problem is Obama 's use of Defense Secretary Robert Gates as his primary recruiter of Canadian support .
Gates 's voice threatens Obama with losing his key northern ally completely .
Unbeknown to many in the United States , the Canadian forces have been critical contributors in Afghanistan .
They have suffered a disproportionate number of fatalities doing the work that some of America 's European NATO allies have stubbornly avoided .
As a result , after seven years , Canada 's military is tired and damaged , and the Canadian public is divided over whether the Afghanistan experience has been worthwhile .
In the 2008 Canadian election , the governing Conservatives , who support the military 's efforts in Kandahar , nevertheless promised to end Canada 's Afghanistan mission in 2011 .
Changing Ottawa 's mind will be difficult .
Canadians have a history of reacting unpredictably when placed under pressure by great - power allies , and their support must be sought with more caution than the United States has shown thus far .
Sixty - five years ago , in the midst of another epic conflict , the British ambassador to the United States , Edward Halifax , called on Canada to embrace greater Commonwealth cooperation in foreign and defense policy .
Working with the governments in Great Britain , Australia , New Zealand and South Africa , he claimed , Ottawa could maximize its international influence .
Together , he argued , the Commonwealth states had the resources necessary to compete with the superpowers .
Halifax 's ideas were neither new nor particularly provocative .
Indeed , his message was hardly different from the recent comments of Defense Secretary Gates , who has praised Canadian participation in Afghanistan and subtly encouraged Ottawa to extend its commitment .
Nonetheless , Halifax 's public comments ignited a national political crisis .
Left - leaning Canadian nationalists , most of whom lived in French - speaking Quebec and had no familial ties to Britain , were furious that a foreign representative dared to tell them how to pursue their interests abroad .
For the nationalists , closer cooperation with London would automatically have led to a loss of Canadian independence .
More conservative Canadians of British origin , on the other hand , agreed with Halifax completely .
They believed that a Commonwealth approach to world affairs could provide Ottawa the leverage it needed to become a major global player .
With his voting public dangerously split , Canada 's centrist Liberal prime minister , William Lyon Mackenzie King , denounced the ambassador 's ideas .
Ottawa made its own decisions in world affairs , he said .
His government worked with all countries , not just with members of the British Commonwealth .
King , the most successful Canadian prime minister in history , recalled how a similar ethnic divide during the World War I had cost the governing Conservatives support in Quebec for a generation .
Moreover , as Canadians began to think seriously about reconstruction at home , he needed to consolidate the left side of his political base .
King 's public denunciation of Halifax 's ideas effectively ended any chance of closer Commonwealth coordination .
For Canadian governments who hoped to survive in power , threats to national unity trumped even a discussion of foreign policy options .
The rules of foreign policy in Canada have n't changed .
Although a number of Canadians worry that leaving Afghanistan will reduce Canada 's global influence and prestige , others , particularly left - leaning French Canadians , think that their country has already done enough in Kandahar and are suspicious of U.S. foreign policy initiatives .
They 'd prefer to act as part of a broader UN coalition , perhaps in Darfur or Haiti .
Using Defense Secretary Gates to deliver a Halifax - like message through the Canadian media 65 years later is therefore a serious mistake .
Canada 's Conservative government cannot hope to achieve majority status if it appears too supportive of anyone linked to what Canadians perceive as right - wing American interests .
Just like Mackenzie King , it must tilt to the political center and maintain domestic harmony at virtually any cost .
If the Obama administration has any chance of changing Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's mind about withdrawing from Afghanistan , it must learn to appreciate the politics of Canadian foreign policy .
Using an outsider to tell Canadians how to manage their approach to world affairs in today 's political climate is a recipe for failure .
Canadians must see Afghanistan as a global mission , not an American one , and certainly not one supported by George W. Bush .
President Obama must demonstrate a genuine understanding of the political as well as the practical needs of his allies if he hopes to sustain their loyalty .
Whether it 's already too late to change Canada 's mind is unclear , but the incoming administration can certainly do better than it did in transition .

The rise in gold was dominated by a long - term uptrend .
The long - term uptrend line A starts in July 2005 , and uses the lows during June 2007 as the second point for the position of the trend line .
This long - term trend was broken in October 2008 , and many people believed this was a signal for a new long term downtrend .
They were wrong — support and resistance defines the character of this market .
The most important trend breakout developed in September 2007 , when the price moved above $ 690 .
This level had been a very powerful long - term resistance level .
It was n't surprising when the market retested the $ 690 level in 2008 and used this as a support and rebound level .
The location of support and resistance levels is an important feature that defines the price activity .
The rebound from support near $ 690 in November 2008 was very rapid and the price moved above the long - term uptrend line in December 2008 .
This rise meant the long - term uptrend that had started in July , 2005 , was again the most important support level for the uptrend .
Horizontal support and resistance levels had developed near $ 840 and $ 930 .
The strongest resistance level is near $ 1,000 .
The $ 840 level was a weak resistance level in 2007 and it has been a middle point consolidation level in 2008 .
This combination of long term uptrend line and support and resistance levels defines the way the trend will move towards resistance at $ 1,000 .
The combination of resistance near $ 690 and the long - term trend line in 2005 to 2007 created an up sloping triangle pattern .
The target for this chart pattern is $ 930 .
This level has acted as a new resistance level several times since the end of 2007 .
A move above the $ 930 level is bullish and establishes the condition necessary for a strong rally towards $ 1,000 .
More From CNBC.com
A retreat from the $ 930 area can test support from the long term uptrend line .
This support is currently near $ 865 .
The level of this support continues to rise as the up trend line develops .
This increases the upwards pressure on the price and increases the probability of a successful rally to resistance at $ 1,000 .
A successful breakout above $ 1,000 has a first target near $ 1,150 and a long - term target near $ 1,300 .
These price levels may take many months to achieve .
Traders watch for price to move above or below the significant trend line and support / resistance levels before they take action .

( CNN ) -- Videos purportedly shot by Britain 's Prince Harry and including offensive language prompted an official apology Saturday from the prince and the royal family .
Prince Harry apologized when video surfaced of him making offensive comments while on military duty in 2006 .
According to the British - based News of the World , which released the videos on its Web site , the videos show British soldiers while a voice presumed to be Harry 's calls one solider a " Paki , " and in another clip tells soldier wearing a cloth on his head that he looks " like a raghead . "
A spokesman for Prince Harry apologized in a statement released by St. James 's Palace Saturday after the videos surfaced online .
The spokesman said the prince -- who is third in line to the British throne -- " understands how offensive this term can be , and is extremely sorry for any offense his words might cause . "
It is not first apology for offensive behavior by Prince Harry .
In 2005 , he was photographed wearing a Nazi uniform to a party , for which he said he was sorry .
" It was a very stupid thing to do and I 've learned my lesson , simple as that really , " he said in a September 2005 interview marking his 21st birthday .
" I 'd like to put it in the past now .
What 's done is done .
I regret it . "
The videos , filmed during his military service in 2006 , were shot by the prince , according to the Web site .

Harry to train as military pilot
In one video , a voice from behind the camera says " Ah , our little Paki Friend ... Ahmed , " as the camera zooms in on a soldier from across the room .
The video does not show Prince Harry 's face , but News of the World suggests that the voice is his .
The soldiers were waiting for their flight to Cyprus for a mission , according to the Web site .
The royal family said the ' paki ' term was a nickname for a friend in his platoon .
" There is no question that Prince Harry was in any way seeking to insult his friend , " the St. James 's Palace statement said .
The second video was filmed after arriving in Cyprus , according to News of the World , and shows a British soldier with a cloth over his head .
A voice , which the News of the World claims to be Harry 's , is heard saying , " ( expletive ) me , you look like a raghead . "
In response to that comment , St. James 's Palace said , " Prince Harry used the term ' raghead ' to mean Taliban or Iraqi insurgent . "
Dickie Arbiter , a former press secretary to Queen Elizabeth II , Prince Harry 's grandmother , urged people to take the prince 's words in context .
" Harry is not the same man as he was three years ago , " Arbiter told Britain 's ITN network .
" You do n't think when you are shooting a video . "
And he pointed out that Harry was serving in the army , where language is not always delicate .
" It is quite common for names to be used in the military ....
He 's a serviceman first and foremost , but people see him as a prince first and he has to be careful of what he says . "
The British Ministry of Defense said it was not aware of any complaints against Prince Harry and would investigate the allegations of inappropriate behavior , according to a written statement released Saturday .
" Bullying and racism are not endemic in the Armed Forces , " it said .
CNN 's Katy Byron contributed to this report .
All About Prince Harry of Wales
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE , Calif . — Space Shuttle Atlantis and its crew of seven returned to Earth on Sunday , ending their exalted Hubble Space Telescope repair mission in California after stormy weather prevented a return to NASA 's Florida home base .
Mission Control waited as long as possible for the weather to improve before finally giving up and directing commander Scott Altman and his crew to the Mojave Desert .
Atlantis swooped through a clear morning sky and touched down on the runway at Edwards Air Force Base .
" Welcome home , Atlantis , " Mission Control radioed once the shuttle came to a safe stop .
" Congratulations on a very successful mission giving Hubble a new set of eyes . "
" It was a thrill from start to finish , " Altman replied .
" We 've had a great ride . "
After 13 days in orbit , many of them tending to Hubble , Altman and his crew were anxious to be back on the ground .
They were supposed to land Friday , but NASA kept the astronauts circling the world in case thunderstorms from a lingering low - pressure system eased up .
The weather did not improve enough Sunday , and Mission Control passed up landing opportunities for a third straight day at Kennedy Space Center .
Altman was grateful for the pristine conditions at Edwards , NASA 's backup landing site .
" A beautiful day in the desert , " he said before heading back .
NASA loses at least a week of work and close to $ 2 million in ferry costs by landing in California .
And the astronauts will have to wait another day to be reunited with their families , who were in Florida .
The previous shuttle landing at Edwards was in November .
Atlantis ended up circling Earth 197 times and logged 5.3 million miles during its journey .
The astronauts left behind a refurbished Hubble that scientists say is better than ever and should keep churning out pictures of the universe for another five to 10 years .
They carried out five spacewalks to give the 19 - year - old observatory new science instruments , pointing devices and batteries , and fix a pair of broken instruments , something never before attempted .
Stuck bolts and other difficulties made much of the work harder than expected .
The $ 1 billion overhaul was the last for Hubble and , thanks to the crew 's valiant effort , won praise from President Barack Obama and members of Congress .
But with space shuttles retiring next year , no more astronauts will visit the telescope , and NASA expects to steer it into the Pacific sometime in the early 2020s .
The astronauts brought back the old wide - field camera they pulled out , so it can be displayed as a souvenir for the masses at the Smithsonian Institution .
The replacement camera and other new instruments will enable Hubble to peer deeper into the universe , to within 500 million to 600 million years of creation .
It will take almost all summer for scientists to check out all the new telescope systems .
NASA expects to release the first picture in early September .
This mission almost did n't happen .
It was canceled in 2004 , a year after the Columbia tragedy , because of the dangers of flying into a 350 - mile - high orbit that did not offer any shelter in case Atlantis suffered damage from launch debris or space junk .
The public protest was intense , and NASA reinstated the flight after developing a rescue plan and shuttle repair kits .
Shuttle Endeavour was on standby for a possible rescue mission until late last week , after inspections found Atlantis ' thermal shielding to be solid for re-entry .
Endeavour now will be prepped for a June flight to the international space station .
Wedding Saving Tips
As many of you already may know this summer I ’ll be getting married , to be exact August 2nd is the big day WHOOHOO !
So I thought I share a little bit of our experience and give some tips for those planning on getting married soon .
Budget
Sit down with your significant other and set up a realistic budget .
Estimate how much you would like to spend and give yourself about 0.5 - 1 % wiggle room , but stick to it there is not point in having a budget if you are going to blow it up .
We set a budget for $ 20,000 and so far have kept that in check , if we went over budget on one item we would make sure to cut back on others to bring things back inline .
Make sure you put it down on paper otherwise chances are you will blow the budget , we used a spreadsheet to keep us on track .
Start Planning Early !
This is probably the most valuable tip I can give you , start early .
We start wedding planning in August 2008 , so about a year in advance .
The good thing was that I have had several years of experience in event planning so we knew exactly where to look and who to talk to .
Starting early wo n’t just save you a lot of last month headache , but can save you thousands of dollars because you have more time to look around and more leverage .
Simplify
If you start attending wedding shows and wedding planners you ’ll notice that there are at least 6 different categories for flowers and many more for other items , keep it simple !!
Make a list of things that are most important to you and start scratching everything else out , if you have money left you can always go back .
Avoid Saturday’s
Saturday ’s will be the most expensive day to have a wedding , by avoiding Saturday we saved at least 25 - 30 % .
Go for Friday or Sunday and save yourself thousands of dollars , we picked a Sunday but it ’s a long weekend Sunday so if you can do that even better .
Have a Wedding Calendar
My fiance , who is sometimes a little bit of an organizing freak , made a “ Wedding Calendar ” she set out things we need have done in every month which was great and kept us on track .
Right now we have about 3 months to go till the big day and we have pretty much everything done , when we tell others everyone seems very surprised .
Yes of course there will be the last minute things that we overlooked , but we will have more time to deal with those surprises .
So get a calendar and mark down things you want to do in any given month and than get them done !
Shop Around and Negotiate
Although I have a fairly decent network when it comes to event planning , we still took some time and shopped around and the best deal we got was one outside of my network .
Put together a list of potential ’s and play them against each other , we went back 3 or 4 times between two venues and were able bring down their prices by about 30 % from their original quote .
Avoid Loans
This is a trap too many newlyweds fall into , they want things they ca n’t afford so get a loan .
Starting out your lives together in debt is probably not the best way , avoid a wedding loan at all costs .
When you budget keep it realistic , if you do not have the funds right now start saving towards it .
I do not want to get into the concept of compounding now , just remember compounding can work for you but also against you !
We hate debt and did not want to get a loan for our wedding so when we budgeted we worked backwards , we looked at how much we can realistically save over the next several months and based our budget on that .
We set a budget of $ 20,000 and were able to save that much in about nine months now we can enjoy a debt free wedding .
Get a DJ and $ ave
Music is probably one of the top five expenses you will have , by getting a DJ instead of a band yo u can save couple of thousands .
Although we have a band booked for our wedding we did this because we had good relations with this band and were able to get them at a similar price a DJ would have cost .
Make Your Own Wedding Invitations
When I was looking for wedding invitations I could not believe the ridiculous amounts charged for having wedding cards , so we decided to make our own .
We got some already made cards and printed them at home total cost for wedding cards was about $ 30 .
The Wedding Gown
Wedding gown can be very expensive , I suggest buying used gowns or renting .
You can find used wedding dresses on the net , I do n’t see a reason to spend thousands of dollars on a dress that will be worn only ones .
Not to take away from the importance of a wedding dress , but if you can get just as good of a dress of less than half the price why not take it ?
If you do buy your dress I suggest you sell it afterward , you can sell it on ebay or using Preowned Wedding Dresses , they charge you $ 25 annually and list your dress ( including 5 photos ) on their site no commissions or other fees are charged .
I know when you see us spending $ 20,000 on the wedding you think this guy is crazy this is not a frugal wedding , but couple this to know is that we have 310 people ( which is small for where we come from ) and we come from a different culture have extra expenses that we ca n’t cut much .
Could it have been less ?
yes but we are happy with how we have manged things so far .
I am specially happy because we have managed to do a $ 35,000 wedding for $ 20,000 , I know this because I have helped several friends and family members with their wedding over the last two years and from my event planning experience .

Psystar filed [ PDF ] for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on May 21 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida .
There was a hearing at 11 AM this morning regarding some emergency motions , like the amended motion [ PDF ] for permission to keep using business forms , that kind of thing .
I have the filings for you .
It will not surprise you that there were deficiencies in the filings , and the court has given them until June 5 to file correctly .
Psystar has begun to fill in the blanks already .
Friendly tip : the amended motion to continue using business forms lists the date of the bankruptcy as 2008 , so more corrections are likely .
The initial filing [ PDF ] lists 1 - 49 as the number of creditors , $ 0 - $ 50,000 as their assets , and $ 100,000 to $ 500,000 as their estimated liabilities .
They do n't expect unsecured creditors to get a thing .
They also checked the box that states that they are not " a small business debtor as defined in 11 U.S.C. Section 101 ( 51D ) . "
The creditors listed as owed the most , the top 20 creditors , are their attorney , Carr & Ferrell , listed as owed $ 88,468.84 , and may that be a lesson to them , the IRS , around $ 12,000 , JAMS ADR , some more debt paid for by credit card , I gather ( NCO Financial Systems , OCZ , TIMBAR ) , and -- heh heh -- $ 120,000 to Rodolfo Pedraza , President of Psystar , an " Officer loan " , and finally folks like UPS , FED EX , and DHL .
I 've seen a couple of articles claiming that at the hearing we 'll find out who the investors were who were backing this adventure .
However the same articles are saying that the investors have backed away , so both can't be so .
If they have pulled out , Psystar will not have to list them in their filings , I do n't think .
That may be the point .
I think this means we may never know .
Chapter 11 means they are asking the court to let it stay in business , a business that Apple alleges is violating its rights .
Asking a court to let you infringe another company 's rights is not likely to be a winning strategy in the long run , but as we 've seen in the SCO saga , it certainly can prolong the death spiral .
I 'm sure Apple will have something to say to the court about using bankruptcy protection to continue to infringe its asserted rights , however .
How long it takes to work through all that -- well , we 'll have to wait and see .
In the meantime , I presume this tolls the deposition of a Psystar executive knowledgeable about Psystar 's business , which the California court just ordered Psystar to endure on June 3 in Apple 's law firm , Townsend & Townsend 's , offices in San Francisco .
The list of unsecured creditors [ PDF ] adds Google and Heartland Payments Systems ( no amounts owed them are listed , which indicates they do n't know the figure yet but will supply it later ) to the list on the initial filing .

And Beta News has a report on the filings and the hearing , including this bit : Psystar 's profits were " diminutive " during the bad economy , it goes on , with the hopes of a turnaround on the horizon .
That has n't happened , and while the company now seeks time and space to make a fresh start of things , its plan so far is to build again around its " valuable intellectual property " -- no doubt a reference to its ability to produce Mac work - alikes .
... which made me smile .
Update 3 : Psystar has filed its notice of bankruptcy with the California court , titled Defendant and Counterclaimant Psystar Corporation 's Suggestion of Bankruptcy [ pdf ] .
It says this , in part : PLEASE TAKE FURTHER NOTICE that pursuant to section 362 ( a ) of the Bankruptcy Code , the Debtor 's filing of its voluntary petition operates as a stay , applicable to all entities , of , among other things : ( a ) the commencement or continuation of all judicial , administrative , or other actions or proceedings against the Debtor ( i ) that were or could have been commenced before the commencement of the Debtor 's cases ; ( b ) the enforcement , against the Debtor or against any property of the Debtor 's bankruptcy estates , of a judgment obtained before the commencement of the Debtor 's cases ; of ( c ) any act to obtain possession of property of or from the Debtor 's bankruptcy estate , or to exercise control over property of the Debtor 's bankruptcy estate .
Unlike in the SCO v. Novell case , here there is no judgment yet , other than the discovery order , so I gather Psystar intends to try to resolve this in bankruptcy court , where Apple would get what ?
Probably nothing it can collect , I 'm guessing , because they are an unsecured creditor .
Who Knew Discussing A Long Repealed Copyright Law Could Be So Interesting ...
from the copyright - geeking dept
Bill Patry ( whose blog is seriously missed ) tried to hammer home the point that it 's absolutely ridiculous that Congress does n't ever look at copyright law in terms of whether or not it promotes the progress , and totally trashed anyone ( including Supreme Court Justices ) who seem to think that the " to promote the progress ... " part of the Constitution is meaningless preamble , even noting that in 1909 the legislative history made it quite clear that anything that did not promote the progress was outside the scope of Congress 's power .
It 's sad that both Congress and the Supreme Court now seem to ignore this point .
International trade agreements are evil when it comes to copyright .
Sorry , but it needs to be said .
There was a lot more talk about whether or not certain changes in copyright law would keep us in line with either the Berne Convention or TRIPs ( and soon , ACTA ! ) than about whether or not it made sense .
Basically , these trade negotiations , often pushed by industry reps without considering consequences for the public , have locked us into a narrow range of bad options .
We simply can't do what 's best for society and creativity , because we agreed to be bound by some really bad trade agreements .
No wonder the industry loves them .
They get to put a stranglehold on pertinent discussion ( does this promote the progress ? ) and force people into discussing something entirely separate ( does this violate our trade agreements ? ) .
It gets everyone focused on the trees and missing the forest .

There 's a lot of bubbling concern about conflicts between copyright law and the First Amendment .
I 'd mentioned how often this issue seemed to be coming up lately , and this event was no exception .
While the old guard again insists this matter is settled and there 's absolutely no conflict between the two , a large number of scholars disagree , and point out that it 's a big open question , and some earlier rulings conflict and leave open some big loopholes to be challenged in court .
Expect this issue to get a lot more play in the coming years .

I was n't at all sure what to expect yesterday when I went to a conference in honor of the 100th anniversary of the US 's Copyright Act of 1909 .
After all , that law was superseded by the Copyright Act of 1976 , and so it has n't even been in effect for 33 years .
However , the program was organized , in part , by Eric Goldman and Pamela Samuelson , and had some really big names on the speaker list , so I figured I 'd at least check it out .
Looking over the schedule , I figured I 'd sit in on a few sessions and probably head out .
However , the program actually turned out to be so interesting , that I stuck around for almost the entire thing ( had to duck out for a bit at one point ) .
Bill Patry joked that only a bunch of lawyers could get excited to discuss a law that was " repealed " 33 years ago , but what was so interesting was how much of the discussion was really about what 's going on today .
The summary ?
Copyright law is so screwed up that even if you put a significant number of the top copyright scholars and students in an auditorium for a day , they 'll disagree on almost everything , and only agree that the system is a total mess .
Even simple questions like " how should copyright be handled on blogs " created a collective shoulder shrug , with everyone effectively admitting that copyright law has no answer for such basic questions .
That should worry people .
If the intention of copyright is to " promote the progress of science " then it should n't be so incredibly ambiguous and contentious .
All in all , it seems to reinforce the point that copyright law has been stretched and twisted in so many different ways over the years , that it may be fundamentally broken .
Basically , copyright law is adjusted every so often not based on any look at whether or not it actually promotes the progress , but based on whatever new technological innovation comes along that throws some legacy providers ' business models into doubt .
That industry freaks out , and politicians respond with some patch that protects that industry , but has little to nothing to do with actually promoting progress .
This goes all the way back throughout history .
One speaker pointed out that the big innovation of the 1909 copyright was compulsory licensing on mechanical rights .
This was put into place for one reason : fear about player pianos and how they would dominate the market and destroy the need for musicians .
Within a matter of decades , the player piano market was effectively gone ... and yet , these massive changes designed solely to deal with the player piano have stuck around .
Now apply that same story to basically every other technological innovation , and that gets you copyright law .
If there was a key theme running throughout the conference , though , it was on the single biggest change that the ' 76 Act brought into play : switching the copyright system from opt- in to everyone - automatically - in ( not even to " opt- out " realistically speaking ) .
In the terminology of copyright lawyers , in the '09 Act you had " formalities " to get copyright .
In the ' 76 Act , you do n't .
While it was heartening to hear an awful lot of support for the idea of moving back to an opt - in system ( i.e. , if you want copyright protection , you need to proactively register / add a notice to get it , rather than automatically getting it on everything at the moment of expression ) , there was plenty of disagreement .
Registrar of copyrights Marybeth Peters ( who has a long history of supporting worrisome expansion of copyright law ) kicked off the day by talking about why it was athing to switch to automatically in , because the old system resulted in too many questions about whether or not something was in the public domain .
Later on , Jon Baumgarten , who also participated in crafting the ' 76 Act , berated supporters of an opt - in system , saying that having practiced under it , it was only good for the lawyers , because everyone spent all of their time trying to determine ways to prove that someone had screwed up registering their copyrights , and thus the end result was lots of works accidentally fell into the public domain .
On this last point , Peters concluded her remarks with the rather stunning statement ( I 'm paraphrasing the exact statement , but it was close ... hopefully video will be up shortly and I can get the exact quote ) .
Think about that for a second .
Yes , the context is important : her problem was mostly with items getting into the public domain because of confusion in the registration process , but it suggests a mindset that says " the public domain is bad . "
Later speakers pointed out that the difficulty of putting a copyright on creative works was actually aof the system , intended by the Founding Fathers to be difficult on purpose , because they believed how important it was to have a large and fruitful public domain .
Also , what was stunning was how much the " old guard " such as Peters and Baumgarten insist that an opt - in system can't work because it was such a mess under the '09 Act .
They seem to be confusing the '09 with the entireof opt-in .
Sure , things were a mess before ' 76 , but perhaps the problem was with the specifics of the " formalities " rather than with the concept itself .
And , they do n't even seem to acknowledge that modern technology could ( and , in fact , should ) change the entire thinking around copyright and how any sort of registration / opt - in process might work .
And , in fact , David Nimmer 's final keynote suggested that new technological solutions ( he discussed a hypothetical system amusingly named " the panopticon " ) has shifted his thinking from being totally 100 % against formalities to now believing that an opt - in system absolutely makes sense .
This post is long enough , even though there were plenty of other interesting discussions , but I did want to bring up three separate points that were interesting :
All in all , a very interesting event that generated lots of thoughts and discussions .

In the aftermath of the election of the first Black president , Keeanga - Yamahtta Taylor examines the tasks ahead for combating racism in the U.S .
THE HISTORIC election of Barack Obama represented an undeniable blow against the legacy of racism in the U.S.
For the first time ever , a Black man was elected president of a white majority country .
Slavery persisted in the U.S. for more than 300 years , and when slavery was abolished , Blacks were legally designated second - class citizens until the civil rights rebellion of the 1960s finally produced full legal equality .
This backdrop made Obama 's victory last November all the more astonishing .
Even in the desperate dog days of the McCain - Palin campaign , when Republicans tried to make race an issue by reviving the dead issue of Obama 's former pastor Jeremiah Wright , calling Obama " dangerous , " letting conservative followers believe Obama was Muslim and Arab , and calling Obama " uppity " -- they failed miserably .
In fact , the Republicans ' strategy backfired .
The closer we got to the election and the more desperate they became , the more they began to slip in the polls .
For the first time in 40 years , the staples of American politics -- race - baiting and racial scapegoating -- failed as a political strategy , and the result was the election of the nation 's first African American president .
The optimism among African Americans as a result of Obama 's victory has come into conflict with the reality that Blacks are bearing the brunt of the crisis
Since the election , the media has manufactured a discussion about whether the U.S. has entered some netherworld of post - racialism .
The mantra was quickly picked up by conservative pundits who have always denied the saliency of racism .
They concluded that the political ascendancy of Obama was the final " proof " that the U.S. was a color - blind society .
Dinesh D'Souza , who wrote the 1995 book The End of Racism , recently gloated :
As I watched Obama take the oath of office , I was moved , along with many others , but I also felt a sense of vindication .
In 1995 , I published a controversial book The End of Racism .
The meaning of the title was not that there was no more racism in America .
Certainly in a big country , one can find many examples of racism .
My argument was that racism , which once used to be systematic , had now become episodic .
In other words , racism existed , but it no longer controlled the lives of blacks and other minorities .
Indeed , racial discrimination could not explain why some groups succeeded in America and why other groups did not ... for African Americans , their position near the bottom rung of the ladder could be better explained by cultural factors than by racial victimization .
D'Souza 's outburst aside , the idea that Black poverty and unemployment is the result of individual failure and personal dysfunction is a regular staple of political parlance in the U.S. Even Obama made news when he spoke at a Black church last Father 's Day and chastised Black men for not being more involved in their children 's lives .
" We need fathers to realize that responsibility does not end at conception , " he said .
Without a condemnation of the racism that shapes the communities , choices and interactions of poor and working - class African Americans , this kind of moralistic finger - pointing essentially blames the victim .
Moreover , D'Souza 's outburst underlines the problem with measuring racism in American society simply by changing ideas or attitudes , as opposed to barometers that actually measure the quality of life of African Americans .
The current meltdown of the American economy , which faces its gravest crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s , demonstrates the institutionalization of racism in the U.S .
A Black depression
While most Americans are struggling to find ways to cope with the economic recession , African American communities have been experiencing a protracted financial collapse since 2000 .
The impact of the unraveling U.S. economy on African Americans is nothing short of startling and should give lie once and for all to worn axioms that describe Black poverty and inequality as products of the Black community itself or the result of cultural deviance .
While the media have marveled at how quickly the national unemployment level ballooned to 8 percent over the last two months , Black unemployment currently stands at more than 13 percent , while Latino unemployment creeps toward 12 percent .
Since 2000 , Blacks and Latinos have been 40 percent more likely to experience unemployment than whites .
But the national unemployment rates do n't really speak to the catastrophic levels of job displacement in Black communities , particularly among African American men .
In a study conducted by the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee , social scientist Marc Levine looked at the total unemployment of Black men aged 16 to 65 in urban America .
He included men who were out of the labor market for a range of reasons , including those who were incarcerated and those who were jobless because they had given up looking for work .
He found that Black men in Milwaukee had the highest rate of unemployment at 51 percent , followed by Buffalo , Detroit and Chicago , where Black male unemployment is 45 percent .
In other large metropolitan areas like New York City and Washington , D.C. , unemployment rates for African American men of working age were more than 30 percent .
In Detroit , the 11th largest city in the U.S. , Black workers have been devastated by the plunging fortunes of the auto industry , where , by last December , more than 20,000 Black autoworkers had lost their jobs .
This rise in unemployment will undoubtedly increase the numbers of African Americans without health insurance -- already at a high of 19 percent .
The job losses that began before the current economic crisis have led to an increase in Black poverty , from a historic low of 19 percent in 1999 , back up to 24 percent in 2007 .
Poverty rates for Latinos are also at more than 20 percent .
This number will surely rise if predictions are that official Black unemployment will exceed 20 percent by the end of 2009 .
In addition to the job losses shaking African American communities , the collapsing housing market is having a disproportionate impact on Black homeowners .
Because of a racist legacy of redlining , housing discrimination and the patterns of predatory lending as their result , Blacks were three times more likely to be steered toward subprime loans for home mortgages than whites .
This has meant that as rates for these loans readjusted upward and beyond the means of Black homeowners , tens of thousands have been forced into foreclosure , destroying what little net worth exists among African Americans .
Home foreclosures are not measured by race , but a recent study found that since 2004 , Black homeownership has dropped from 49 percent to 46 percent .
By 2007 , 30 percent of Black households had zero net worth , compared to 18 percent of white households .
According to the nonprofit think tank United for a Fair Economy , households of color lost between $ 164 billion and $ 213 billion over the past eight years because of foreclosures and ballooning subprime loan rates .
According to economic analyst Dedrick Muhammad , the cumulative impact of these losses will result in a 33 percent reduction of the Black middle class .
The election of Obama , while significant , does n't change the daily struggle against deprivation that shapes the Black experience in the U.S .
What 's race got to do with it ?
The crisis is having a disproportionately brutal impact on Black workers because of the racism inherent in American capitalism .
U.S. capitalism was built on the labor of Black slaves , and when slavery ended , capitalists in the North and South stoked racism to divide their workforces , drive down wages and increase their profit margins .
Throughout the first 70 years of the 20th century , millions of African Americans moved from the rural South to the urban North and South in search of jobs and freedom from the codified racism of Jim Crow .
Black workers found that racism in the North was only different by degrees from the racism they encountered in the South .
Violent white mobs and racially restricted covenants in housing deeds -- which allowed private homeowners to forbid the selling or renting of homes to African Americans for up to 20 years -- hemmed African Americans into ghettos .
Federal housing policy stipulated that Black inner cities be restricted from mortgage insurance , guaranteeing that businesses and developers would n't invest or build in the cities .
Instead , government monies subsidized building and investment in white suburbs .
The disinvestment in the central cities fueled residential and school segregation , creating a political economy of racism where Blacks paid more for inferior housing and services , while the managers of inner cities reaped the profits of minimal investment .
Existing employment in the inner cities became increasingly elusive as businesses either moved to the suburbs , to the South or out of the country altogether in search of cheaper labor .
The conditions of diminishing employment , low - wage service jobs , underfunded schools and segregated housing created by racist federal policies are maintained and policed by a racist criminal justice system , and have been since Blacks arrived en masse in the North .
These public and private practices have led to historic disparities between African Americans and whites .
The social movements of the 1960s eliminated the last vestiges of legal racism and opened up greater opportunities for the economic and political advancement of a small layer of African Americans , but for the majority of ordinary Blacks , racism continues to restrict opportunity .
This means that Blacks have borne the greatest brunt of this economic catastrophe .
The managers of capitalism profit handsomely from inequality and racism in the U.S. because they guarantee a combination of low or lower wages paid to Black workers and the absence of a welfare state .
Moreover , these same managers have historically used racism to divide political struggles for public or state entitlements -- welfare - - to poor or unemployed workers regardless of race .
The material impact on the lives of Black workers should be clear enough , but ideologically , the systematic and institutional impoverishment of African American communities perpetuates the impression that Blacks are inferior and defective .
These perceptions are perpetuated and magnified by the mass media , Hollywood and the general means of ideological and cultural production in bourgeois society .
The recurrence and persistence of racism in this economic system is not accidental or arbitrary .
American capitalism is intrinsically racist .
A new era
The racist nature of American capitalism does n't mean that workers of color and white workers do not challenge it .
The political struggles of the 1960s are but one example of this potential , but so are the heroic struggles to build unions and anti-poverty movements during the Depression era in the 1930s .
The era of Obama is a welcome change from the era of Bush and opens the potential for a new period of struggle that can both fight for economic reforms and against racism .
During the Bush administration , not only did the economic gains of Black America during the 1990s go into reverse , but the racial symbolism of the Bush administration was downright regressive .
From his theft of the 2000 election at the expense of Black voters in Florida , to the malfeasance of his administration during the Katrina disaster in New Orleans , to the unleashing of raids in Latino communities , to the imprisonment and internment of Arab and Muslim men across the U.S. , the Bush administration was a disaster for communities of color .
The election of Obama represented a popular rejection of this state - sanctioned racist hostility .
But what concretely replaces the racist Bush agenda will depend upon struggle from below .
While Obama 's candidacy and election represented a dramatic shift in racial attitudes in the U.S. , Obama , has eschewed almost any racial discourse -- and continues to .
Obama 's attorney general , Eric Holder , made the strange comment that when it comes to race , " Americans are cowards , " when it is the Obama administration that has gone out of its way to avoid putting forward coherent policies aimed at curbing the racism evidenced by the overwhelming impact of the economic crisis on Black families .
To be sure , the almost $ 300 billion in economic stimulus aimed at working - class communities is a welcome change to the tired mantra of tax cuts -- but it 's woefully inadequate when compared to the more than $ 1 trillion filling the troughs of corporate America and Wall Street .
Moreover , given the disproportionate way in which the crisis is impacting African Americans , there needs to be specific programs and solutions aimed at Black urban communities .
This must include more than infusions of cash to increase food stamps and unemployment cash benefits .
Economists predict that the jobs that have been lost are not likely to come back , as American capitalism restructures and retools itself .
This means there could be a long period of unemployment until new , sustainable jobs are created , rather than short - term " project " - oriented jobs .
This in turn means that the U.S. needs a new public welfare system that can house , feed , clothe , pay and take care of its population while the job market fluctuates .
The public entitlement to welfare was gutted in 1996 during the boom , as recipients were made to " work " for their meager cash benefits .
The assumption was that the economy was supposedly awash in jobs -- which were largely low wage and in the service sector -- and , if people were n't working , it was because they did n't want to .
These anti-poor policies , shrouded in anti-Black rhetoric , were underpinned by the politics of " personal responsibility , " which looked to shift the blame for poverty and unemployment away from inherent problems in the system -- as they were identified in the 1960s by everyone from the Black Panther Party to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. -- to the individual failings of Blacks themselves .
But the rapid disintegration of the job market has opened up the ideological space to expose the racist assumptions that Black workers are more interested in welfare than work .
When 650,000 jobs have been lost every month since December , it 's difficult to mount an argument that the problem of unemployment is a moral one .
Moreover , when banks and corporations fail as a result of the personal irresponsibility and greed of executives , but are still bailed out to the tune of trillions of tax dollars , it rightfully raises the question of where is the bailout for ordinary workers -- Black , white and Latino .
The ruling class proposal for resolving the economic crisis -- blank checks and no questions asked for Wall Street - - diminishes the extent to which they can argue that workers should n't also demand our piece , in the form of direct cash stimulus , universal health care , a new welfare system , real affordable housing , an end to home foreclosures and more .
The key to winning any of those demands depends on building a movement of workers , the unemployed and the poor to take on the obvious economic inequities that have been exposed as a result of the crisis , but it also demands the building of an explicitly antiracist movement that can highlight and organize against the specific ways this crisis is affecting Black workers .
While Obama has been reluctant to discuss the issue of race or racism , the vast majority of African Americans viewed his election as their own victory -- as demonstrated by the dancing in the streets in Black communities across the country last November when he beat McCain .
A CNN poll conducted in the days leading up to Obama 's inauguration found that 69 percent of Blacks felt that King 's dream was now fulfilled because of Obama 's victory .
In March , a poll found that African Americans were more optimistic than the general public that the financial crisis would be resolved by the end of the year .
Fifty - eight percent of Blacks said they expected their household financial situation to improve by next year , and 85 percent said they were generally optimistic about the future .
But the confidence and optimism that resulted from successfully sending a Black president to the White House has come into conflict with the reality that African Americans are bearing the brunt of the economic downturn in the U.S .
At the same time , the election of Obama has raised the expectations of African Americans -- and most workers -- for more , not less .
While the Obama honeymoon within Black communities may not end for while , the worsening economy will demand politics , organization and activism from Black workers .
This new reality , in a new political era , represents an opportunity to build a movement to demand new social programs for the working class , with Black workers and antiracist demands at its center .
There is also the possibility that as conditions grow worse , there could be a rise in racism against Obama and other minorities in the guise of right - wing populism -- as racists and the right intensify their efforts to scapegoat and blame sections of the population for the crisis .
This is why the revival and rebuilding of progressive forces and the radical left must put the fight against racism at the center of its politics -- as opposed to focusing only on the economic dimensions of the crisis .
Racism and class oppression have always been the nexus of American politics , and today is no different .

_grau | d 2004 | 10:01 min
director , producer , animator : robert seidel
music : heiko tippelt , philipp hirsch
_grau is a personal reflection on memories coming up during a car accident , where past events emerge , fuse , erode and finally vanish ethereally various real sources where distorted , filtered and fitted into a sculptural structure to create not a plain abstract , but a very private snapshot of a whole life within its last seconds
KunstFilmBiennale 2004 | Honorary
Award | the jury assigns the movie _grau by robert seidel an honorary award , because of the technological mastership which is used to show never seen phenomena in the borderland of science and aesthetics .
SHIFT Japan | DOTMOV Festival 2004 selected and commented by Motion Theory | _grau is a mesmerizing , beautiful and disturbing work of art that fuses dark and light to create organic forms and amorphous shapes .
The scenes unfold slowly , elegantly revealing tensions between seemingly simple fragments of life .
It feels like a long look at some primordial soup giving birth to some of the world 's first life forms , or one - celled organisms that can't quite fully resolve themselves .
The soundtrack , with its lonely drones rising and falling , make us believe we are witnessing a dark creation .
The director 's most impressive accomplishment was in going beyond the technology of the computer to create something that feels as if it is made of real moments in time , inside a reality only slightly offset from our own .
Media critic Matt Hanson , author of The End of Celluloid and founder of onedotzero festival | _grau appeals to me because it is organo - tech .
it does not deliberately ape the abstract pioneers of abstract cinema , and it is worlds away from the motion graphic masturbation of many of those enamoured by digital animation .
seidel 's work is impressionistic , melding biological and emotional currents .
out of amorphous shapes we make out bones , heads , a hand .
a spirit leaving the body .
at least , this is what i sense out of the chaos of galactic reconfigurations , neurological connections , and biological forms .
this is a powerful piece of digital animation precisely because it does not feel like such , it feels emotional , epic .
and once you release the background to the animation -- communicating a ' coming to terms ' with the aftermath of a car accident -- you realise why .

More than 200 teams of engineering students from 29 countries battle for the top prize in this Shell - sponsored annual green car rally , where futuristic , lightweight cars race around the EuroSpeedway circuit with the goal of burning as little fuel as possible .
The best cars could travel the entire length of Britain five times on a single gallon of petrol–in other words , at least 3,000 miles to the gallon .
Health authorities in New South Wales have defended a decision to disrupt the travel plans of thousands of cruise ship passengers over a swine flu scare .
Almost 2,000 passengers and 900 crew onboard the Dawn Princess arrived back in Sydney on Saturday morning after a 35 - day Pacific cruise .
When NSW Health learned that two of the passengers had been sick but recovered from the flu , passengers and crew were confined to the ship for up to six hours while four travellers were screened .
Queensland man Gil Harvey was one passenger forced to wait to disembark .
" Some of them are terribly annoyed , " he said .
" They had flights to catch and appointments made .
It 's just been blown out of the water . "
All of the passengers were advised to stay in Sydney overnight while swine flu tests were carried out .
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant says it was a necessary precaution .
" We obviously consider the consequences of any public health measures we do , but in this case we felt this action was warranted , " he said .
" The staff , the medical staff and the crew have been very vigilant in the way they 've managed this situation .
" Assessing the information we had to hand , we felt that the actions were prudent and taking a cautionary approach and warranted in this circumstance . "
Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon says authorities were right to quarantine the cruise ship .
She has told Channel Nine the Government is doing everything it can to minimise the spread of swine flu .
" I think it is necessary for us to take all the precautionary steps that we can , particularly while this disease is not yet widespread in Australia , " she said .
" That 's why we are taking the steps that we are .
Luckily the testing has got a lot quicker , although that was an inconvenience for several hours for people . "
All four passengers were cleared of swine flu last night .
Currently the number of confirmed cases of swine flu across Australia stands at 14 .
Medical marijuana charges pit Californians against DEA Joe Byrne
Published : Saturday March 14 , 2009
Print This Email This Charlie Lynch had a medical marijuana dispensary in Morro Bay , on the coast of California .
Though he had yet to repay the loan he had taken out to open his business , and was working six days a week against the public opposition of the Morro Bay sheriff 's department , he liked his job .
He stopped liking his job when the DEA raided his home and arrested him for selling marijuana , a federal crime punishable with years of prison time .
Last night , ABC 's 20/20 with John Stossel featured Charlie Lynch in a report on marijuana advocacy .
He had closely obeyed all the state law associated with opening a marijuana dispensary .
There was a public ribbon - cutting ceremony on opening day , and he had even called the DEA to make sure they were n't going to raid him .
 It s up to the cities and county to decide how to handle the matter ,  they had told him .
With that advice , he thought his store was in the clear .
Now , he faces a federal trial and lengthy jail time .
Prop 215 , or the Compassionate Use Act of ' 96 , established California as the first state in the union to allow medical bud , and received more votes than any other question on the ballot .
The act gave seriously ill Californians  the right to obtain and use marijuana for medical purposes under the discretion of a doctor .
Senate Bill 420 , in 2004 , re-enforced the state 's right to allow medical marijuana .
However , federal law is a separate jurisdiction , and still applies to those who ' legally ' grow for themselves .
Congress or the U.S. attorney general has the power to reclassify marijuana so it can be dispensed by a physician .
Alternatively , the U.S. Department of Justice could use its discretion and stop prosecuting medical dispensation and use in states that have legalized it .
But it has not .
The DEA has been actively shutting down bud dispensaries with their legal growing operations and prosecuting Californians in federal court .
In the last two years of the Bush administration , the DEA raided over 100 medical marijuana growers and sellers .
Since the passing of the Compassionate Use Act , 11 other states have followed suit with medical marijuana laws .
Nowhere is it as popular or common as California , but Oregon is proposing selling and taxing its own marijuana , and last year Massachusetts voted 65 % to make the possession of an ounce of bud equivalent to driving over the speed limit .
Charlie Lynch , a 46 - year - old businessman , opened Central Coast Compassionate Caregivers in the spring of 2006 with the blessing of the town mayor .
The shop , located in the heart of the downtown shopping district , provided more than 200 lbs. of bud to more than 2000 patients over the course of 11 months .
Owen Beck , a 17 - year - old amputee with bone cancer , often got his marijuana for free because Lynch was a compassionate kind of guy ,  according to the boy 's father .
On ABC 's 20/20 with John Stossel , Charlie Lynch described the night he was arrested at his home .
 I hear the banging on my front door , and they say , ' Search warrant , open up or we 're going to tear it down . '
I opened the door and 10 - 15 agents with shields , bulletproof vests , masks , guns ... they came barreling in ... threw me on the ground ... one of the agents had a gun to the back of my head ,  Charlie said .
This was the third time the DEA had raided Charlie , and this time they did n't just take his money and marijuana .
Local Sheriff Pat Hedges , who had opposed the opening of Charlie 's store , assisted the DEA with their arrests , even though Charlie was in violation of no state law .
After a trial that depicted him as a ' cynical entrepreneur ' making a heavy profit , He was found guilty of 5 cannabis - only federal felonies .
His sentencing is set for March 23 .
With the arrival of a new administration , some are wondering if the DEA raids are done for now .
At least 4 dispensaries in California have been raided since Obama took office , but the White House said it expects the raids to stop once Obama nominates someone to replace Michele Leonhart , Bush 's DEA administrator .
However , the economic crisis has stalled much of Obama 's work on nominations , and marijuana advocates wait for the change that the White House is predicting .
Lynch 's case has become national news .
Charlie Lynch and the 17 - year - old cancer patient appeared in an episode of Drew Carey 's ' Reason.tv ' , and MSNBC's Al Roker interviewed Charlie for " An Hour on Marijuana " .
The popularity of Lynch 's trial in the media shows that politicians are n't the only ones who are re-considering how we think about marijuana in our country .

As a big old Pervert , I ’m always glad to get tips from my friends , twisted or not , about the interesting dark matter they unearth here and there .
So I was tickled when my buddy Mike Twittered me about this cool looking on Joe Shuster , on of the guys behind the Superman comic .
Then I read the forward by grizzled - ass Stan Lee .
This book lays bare the dramatic story of an enthusiastic , perhaps even inspired , artist who gave the reading public one of its greatest icons , only to become so disillusioned and desperate that he was later forced to accept commissions to draw what amounted to S&M erotic horror books , material that was the diametric opposite of the type of heroic adventure with which he had hoped to make his living — and for which he will ever be known .
The entire story of Joe Shuster , one replete with drama and tragedy , is a tale that has never before been revealed in such a graphic and uncensored manner .
Some of the material in the book may seem shocking ; some figured strongly in censorship investigations in Congress ; but all of it will certainly give you pause as you consider the consequences that can ensue when a gifted man is forced to lend his talent to the most sordid of projects .
Excuse me ?!
Fuck you very much , dude !
Yeah I know but …really ?
And yes , it may be that the man himself was horrified and ashamed at drawing kinky pr0n .
But is n’t it far more interesting to engage with the work for its prurient value to those aficionados of edgy pulp ?
By arms - lengthening it , you miss the chance to really see what motivates the market for this particular type of fetish art , and perhaps miss out on some very real insight as to what it takes to produce it .
Also , Stan Lee is just kind of a douchebag , f’realz .
That “ EXCELSIOR ! ” shit always bugged the fuck outta me .
You just know he came up with it when he was 12 and waited his whole life to be able to use that word alla time .
But I digress …
Feel free to buy me this book , BTW , so I can …um … research it myself .
Yeah .
That ’s the ticket …
Oh yes , more pictures of stickers and tags and street art .

BBC Washington correspondent
The collapse of disgraced financier Bernard Madoff 's multi-billion dollar pyramid scheme has had wide - ranging consequences - not least on American charities .
Bernard Madoff's pyramid scheme wrecked many investors ' lives Bernard Madoff is responsible for many things : from the biggest pyramid scheme in US history , to a series of ruined lives , shattered friendships and battered bank accounts .
He is also responsible , in part , for Steven Barnes walking free from jail , after serving 20 years for a crime he did not commit .
Steven is the embodiment of a little - mentioned aspect of the Madoff affair , the dozens of charitable foundations , being financed by his mythical money , that now find themselves as out of pocket , and pursued by the authorities .
In Steven 's case , the money went to the Innocence Project , a New York - based criminal justice organisation , which uses the latest DNA techniques to prove the innocence of the wrongfully imprisoned .
Innocence Project
It was partly funded by the JEHT Foundation , a private charity backed by a wealthy couple , Ken and Jeanne Levy - Church .
Steven Barnes was freed by a charity funded by Madoff 's ' mythical money '
Like many of the Madoff victims , they were wealthy Jews who had placed their money with their old friend .
When he went down so too did their foundation .
Within days all of JEHT 's employees had been fired , its offices closed .
Steven had been freed just in time .
I met Steven at the Innocence Project 's Manhattan office .
He is a well - built man , in his early forties , with spiky fair hair and the distant gaze of someone still adjusting his focus , as he contemplates the freedom he was denied for so long .
As he sat and told me his story , his right knee jerked up and down in a staccato rhythm , like a needle in a sewing machine .
A mixture of nerves and anger .
He had been arrested in 1985 , after a local girl was raped and murdered .
Three years later he was convicted and sentenced to 25 years in prison .
DNA tests Steven always protested his innocence and so did his family .
When he told them about a TV item he had seen about the Innocence Project they were quick to act .
The results took somewhat longer though .
An initial DNA test proved inconclusive , but a second , several years later using improved technology , finally cleared Steven .
" I called my mother one Friday , " he told me , the shadow of a half - remembered smile flitting across his face .
" She said the tests had come back and they 'd cleared me .
I yelled down the gallery : ' I 'm going home .
I 'm going home ' . "
The following Tuesday , 25 November 2008 , he was home .
Sixteen days later Bernie Madoff was arrested .
As Steven regained his freedom the man whose funds had helped to liberate him was losing his .
These days , Steven talks on behalf of the Innocence Project .
He is angry that Madoff 's corruption has deprived it of necessary funds to secure the release of others .
" I hope he gets his day with the guy upstairs ... or in prison , " he says .
Missing cure Across town , in a laboratory at the University of Columbia 's medical school , neurologist Dr David Sulzer , leads a group of eager young researchers , peering at slides .
They are looking for connections between neurons , but have been hampered by their connection to Bernie Madoff .
This research into the causes of Parkinson 's disease was being partly funded by another wealthy couple , Jeffrey and Barbara Picower , their Picower Foundation was the hardest hit by the Madoff scandal losing nearly $ 1bn .
Mr Madoff recruited several clients at the Palm Beach Country Club Through it the Picowers 's had poured vast sums into the kind of cutting edge research for which it is hard to get federal funding .
In the lab , the centrifuges are still whirring but the dots that were being connected , in the form of a Picower - financed , seven lab consortium , are no longer joined .
A potential cure for Parkinson 's may have evaporated .
Not everyone is sympathetic to the foundation 's plight in Palm Beach , Florida , where Madoff befriended , and then defrauded , people like the Picowers .
' Irresponsible ' greed I met Jose Lambiet , society columnist with the Palm Beach Post .
He says there is an element of one - upmanship to the charitable work of the rich and famous , whose endeavours were being bankrolled by Madoff .
Their huge returns may have gone towards positive ends he says but they were still the product of greed .
The Palm Beach investors , victims , call them what you will , are a private bunch .
In the words of one of the lawyers involved , Bernie Madoff has wiped out a whole generation of Jewish philanthropy
They shun the media and make every effort to shield their exclusive homes from prying eyes .
As you drive along the the lanes surrounding the Palm Beach Country Club , the place where Madoff persuaded members of this tight - knit Jewish community to invest their millions with him , you pass a succession of what appear to be green , leafy battlements , 30 feet high in places , the flat top foliage offers towering , natural protection to the people in the barely - glimpsed houses behind .
They once spent their days counting their Madoff - made money .
Now they are licking their Madoff - inflicted wounds .
Claw back time
And , in the latest legal twist , the foundations are being targeted by the authorities , trying to recover tens of billions of fraudulent dollars .
That stolen money , which the foundations have dispersed , is the subject of a process known as " claw back " .
As victims sue victims , the foundations hope that tracking down money that has already gone into medical research , criminal justice programmes or school systems will seem absurd but the process will be charitable to the charities .
Enough damage has been done already .
In the words of one of the lawyers involved , Bernie Madoff has wiped out a whole generation of Jewish philanthropy .

VIRGINIA WATER , England -- John
Daly wore bright pink trousers during Sunday 's final round of the BMW PGA Championship in a gesture of support for Phil Mickelson 's wife after she was diagnosed with breast cancer .
Amy Mickelson was diagnosed last week with the disease and received a message of support on Friday from Darren Clarke , who lost his wife to breast cancer in 2006 .
" I had a pair , so I figured I 'd do that for her today .
I thought it would be a good gesture , " Daly said of his trousers .
" I know Phil very well and I know Amy .
I 've known them for a long time -- we 've played the Tour together .
She 's a great lady .
She has always been a sweetheart to everybody . "
Daly had not yet spoken to Phil Mickelson , but said he had been impacted personally by breast cancer .
" I sent out a media message , " Daly said .
" He 's probably surrounded by callers right now and I did n't want to bother him .
I 'm sure everybody on Tour and everybody in the world is thinking about her .
" There 's been some [ breast cancer ] in the family and a lot of friends .
It 's just a tough thing women have to go through .
But if they caught it in time , it is curable . "
WASHINGTON , April 9 ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama asked the U.S. Congress for an additional $ 83.4 billion to fund the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan on Thursday , saying the security situation along the Afghan - Pakistan frontier was urgent .
“ The Taliban is resurgent and al Qaeda threatens America from its safe haven along the Afghan - Pakistan border , ” Obama said in a letter to Nancy Pelosi , the speaker of the House of Representatives , that was released by the White House .
Obama said 95 percent of the $ 83.4 billion in supplemental funds he was requesting would go to support U.S. military operations in Iraq and the U.S. effort to disrupt and defeat al Qaeda .
Half an hour after Prometheus tore into Saturn 's F ring , Cassini snapped this image just as the moon was creating a new streamer in the ring .
The dark pattern shaped like an upside down check mark in the lower left of the image is Prometheus and its shadow .
The potato shaped moon can just be seen coming back out of the ring .
The moon 's handiwork also is apparent in two previous streamer - channel formations on the right of the image .
The darkest streamer - channel stretching from the top right to the center of the image shows Prometheus ' previous apoapse passage about 15 hours earlier .
Prometheus ( 86 km /53 mi across ) dips into the inner edge of the F ring when it reaches apoapse , its farthest point from Saturn .
At apoapse , the moon 's gravity pulls out particles of the ring into a streamer .
As Prometheus moves back toward periapse - its orbit 's closest point to the planet - the streamer gets longer .
Then , as Prometheus moves back toward apoapse , the streamer breaks apart which results in a dark channel .
This streamer - channel cycle repeats once every orbit .
The image was taken on Jan. 14 , 2009 at a distance of approximately 555,000 km ( 345,000 mi ) from Saturn .
Image scale is 3 km ( 2 mi ) per pixel .

Today , Facebook previewed changes it plans to make to their site next week .
There are quite a few :
A redesigned home page with live updates , filters and a universal publishing model ( very much like FriendFeed ’s ) .
One minor change that ’s part of the universal publishing box is changing the verbiage “ What are you doing right now ? ” to “ What ’s on your mind ? ” .
People will no longer be capped at 5,000 friends .
A Twitter / FriendFeed like follow feature will be added to allow people to keep tabs on others asynchronously .
Pages will converge with profiles , creating a more uniform experience whether person , brand , whatever .
These changes point to the convergence of the life - streaming model with the social network and to Facebook ’s stated goal of being its own Internet within the ‘ tubes .
When Facebook first introduced the News Feed in 2006 , it became the first social network to show a network ’s activity in this way .
Since then , Twitter pioneered status ( or micro - blogging ) allowing the network to tell everyone explicitly what it ’s doing , rather than using activity to infer that .
Facebook added status shortly thereafter to capture the same activity .
FriendFeed applied the News Feed concept to the entire ‘ tubes , but as Facebook has added the ability to share more objects , beyond simply activity contained within Facebook , the News Feed has become increasingly more life stream focused .
So , no big surprises in the home page redesign .
The follow feature , however , sounds like an area for user revolt .
Facebook has a very different feel than Twitter or FriendFeed primarily because following ( or subscribing ) can be asynchronous .
Facebook has always enforced that profiles must be real people , probably dating back to its roots as the anti-MySpace ; they have frequently enforced this citing it as a violation of their terms .
Now , profiles and pages are merging , and people can follow each other .
Sounds a shade like stalking .
Because Twitter and others do n’t have the rigorous profile requirements , you may not know who is really following you .
You ’ll know on Facebook though , and that will lead to a whole mess of issues .
This is going to be interesting .
Expect a “ revolt ” , by which I mean a bunch of whining from people .
After all , Facebook has a history of upsetting its users .
Here ’s a brief score card .
September 2005 : Adds high schools to its previously college - only crowd causing college kids to complain about allowing uncool , high schoolers into their Fortress of Solitude .
May 2006 : Adds work networks of selected companies , causing recently added high schoolers to join “ old sk00l ” college kids to whine that work people are uncool .
September 2006 : Adds News Feeds , Mini Feeds , irking hordes of users who are up in arms about flooding their pristine Facebook pages with mind - numbing details about their so - called friends .
March 2007 : Adds f8 platform for application development , which actually is met with user happiness for a change , until sheep throwing , vampire biting and spamming your friends to see your cool - points ranking get annoying .
November 2007 : Beacon social advertising program face - plants as users are aghast that Facebook would use their data to , um , make money or try to at least .
September 2008 : New UI launch is met with widespread hatred , even though apps have polluted the once clean aesthetic that made it the anti-MySpace .
February 2009 : Changes to its terms of service cause widespread outrage .
It ’s actually pretty funny .
When I started this list , my viewpoint was that Facebook would ( again ) run roughshod over its users , as it did in its infancy .
However , looking back at the last 18 months , when the most growth has occurred outside the saturated demographics for social networking ( talking to you Gen Y ) , Facebook has actually done a decent job listening to its user base .
Sure , they ’ve made mistakes , but they ’ve ultimately been responsible for them and have accommodated reasonable requests .
Not a bad thing .
Although , as a highly visible company ( and pop culture punchline ) , this course of action seems logical .
Anyway .
I do n’t really think the changes are all that noteworthy , except maybe to early adopters who know Twitter ( which is also inching toward mainstream as evidenced by its Daily Show cameo ) and FriendFeed and think it matter who was doing what first .
Meh .
The user revolt will be fun to observe .
Most interesting will be how mainstream users feel about life - streaming and micro-blogging .
The changes to Facebook ’s UI will shape the future of the ‘ tubes , like it or not .

Think one or two people can't make a difference ?
Then you do n't know about Amanda Huhman and Libby Burks .
The two animal lovers double - handedly rallied an entire community to support a cause they believe in .
Because of their efforts , the deteriorating , crammed - full Central Missouri Humane Society won a nationwide shelter - makeover contest Monday worth up to $ 1 million in cash and services .
Did I mention yet that Amanda and Libby are 13 years old ?
" When my mom told me we'd won , I was dancing around , so excited , " Amanda giggled into the phone hours after learning CMHS had taken the prize .
The seventh - graders , who have been volunteer dog - walkers and kitty - cuddlers at the shelter since age 9 , got it into their heads in January that their coming - apart - at - the - seams shelter was the perfect candidate for the Zootoo makeover contest they read about in a magazine .
They approached the shelter director to get her blessing and then they got to work .
The rest , as they say , is history .
But that 's not to suggest it was easy .
By the time the girls had learned about the contest , conducted by Zootoo , an online community of animal lovers , it had already been going on for months .
Late - starter CMHS was in 859th place in mid-January .
Libby and Amanda — friends since third grade , animal - lovers since birth — launched a major publicity effort ( local shelters won points when people signed on , posted journal entries or pictures or reviewed products ) .
They collared folks in parking lots to ask them to go online and support the shelter , papered the city with posters and fliers , did radio appearances before school and gave speeches to civic groups .
They attended fundraising dinners and went to seniors ' communities to teach residents how to go online and cast votes .
" It was a lot of work , " Libby acknowledges , but it was paying off .
Within weeks , CMHS had moved up several hundred positions .
" Once we 'd advanced into the top 200 or so , the girls were convinced we could win , " says shelter executive director Patty Forister .
When the community - support points were tallied in March , CMHS had advanced to first place .
But the competition was n't over yet .
Zootoo founder Richard Thompson was to visit the top 20 point - earners and choose 10 finalists for a national online vote .
The residents of Columbia went to some lengths to make sure CMHS would make the cut .
Hundreds lined the streets when Thompson flew into town .
The mayor said a few words .
The atmosphere was festive .
CMHS was named one of the 10 finalists .
Now the nation would decide which shelter was worthy of the makeover .
Columbia residents e-mailed friends all over the country , asking them to vote for CMHS .
Amanda and Libby redoubled their efforts .
At the end of seven days of voting , CMHS had won .
Is there a chance this could have happened without the efforts of the two girls ?
" That 's a big , fat , absolute no , " Forister declares .
The two teens were a compelling catalyst who presented a case in ways officialdom could n't .
The girls are " personable and professional , " says Forister , and " their enthusiasm was absolutely infectious . "
The two missed some school because of their efforts .
But mom Angie Huhman says , " The skills they 've learned are priceless . "
Also , it should be mentioned they 're both straight - A students , and they were " very conscientious about keeping up with their assignments . "
The contest win will bring huge changes to the shelter .
The most pressing needs : better ventilation so disease does n't spread , an isolation room for sick animals , a separate area away from the dogs for stressed - out cats , room to accommodate more animals , and attention to a drainage problem that flooded the building last fall .
Forister regards all that has happened in four short months as an object lesson for parents … for the world , really .
" If a child wants to do something she 's passionate about , supporting that effort and watching it bloom can bring unimaginable reward . "
Thompson regards it as exactly what he had envisioned when he established the contest .
" Shelter people work very hard to do the best for the animals in their care , " he says .
" But often they 're working in obscurity , the community has little or no awareness of the needs .
When a community gets behind a shelter , as happens in this contest , it realizes it must provide ongoing help .
Shelters that participate in the makeover contest regularly see a big boost in volunteers and donations .
That 's what this is all about . "
The girls regard it as nothing more than stepping up to make sure a need was met .
The win , Amanda hopes , will transform a " shelter that 's old and outdated " into one that better meets the needs of the animals and the community .
Minutes after the win was announced , the teens had embarked on their next project — a weekly Web show called Animal Talk that makes its debut this week .
It will highlight shelter needs and the makeover progress , as well as feature adoptable pets and discuss such problems as pet overpopulation and puppy mills .
They 're hoping to capitalize on the Zootoo momentum and generate even more funds and help for the shelter .
The impetus , says Libby , is simple : " We want a better life for the animals . "
Get all of your geocache games in while you can , kids ... if the Worst Case Scenario® goes down , the nation 's GPS system could begin to fail sometime next year .
According to a Government Accountability Office report , the Global Positioning System has been so mismanaged that when aging equipment starts to fail , there may be no new satellites to take their place .
" If the Air Force does not meet its schedule goals for development of GPS IIIA satellites , " the report states , " there will be an increased likelihood that ... the overall GPS constellation will fall below the number of satellites required to provide the level of GPS service that the U.S. government commits to . "
All we can say is that between this , Internet Doomsday , and the imminent Robot Apocalypse , it 's gonna be a fun couple of years .

WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to overrule a 23 - year - old decision that stopped police from initiating questions unless a defendant 's lawyer is present , one of several moves to limit rights that have disappointed civil rights and civil liberties groups .
Since taking office , President Barack Obama has drawn criticism for backing the continued imprisonment of enemy combatants in Afghanistan without trial , invoking the " state secrets " privilege to avoid releasing information in lawsuits and limiting the rights of prisoners to test genetic evidence used to convict them .
The case at issue is Michigan v. Jackson , in which the Supreme Court said in 1986 that police may not initiate questioning of a defendant who has a lawyer or has asked for one unless the attorney is present .
The decision applies even to defendants who agree to talk to the authorities without their lawyers .
Anything police learn through such questioning may not be used against the defendant at trial .
The opinion was written by Justice John Paul Stevens , the only current justice who was on the court at the time .
The justices could decide as early as Friday whether they want to hear arguments on the issue as they wrestle with an ongoing case from Louisiana that involves police questioning of an indigent defendant that led to a murder confession and a death sentence .
The Justice Department , in a brief signed by Solicitor General Elena Kagan , said the 1986 decision " serves no real purpose " and offers only " meager benefits . "
The government said defendants who do n't wish to talk to police do n't have to and that officers must respect that decision .
But it said there is no reason a defendant who wants to should not be able to respond to officers ' questions .
At the same time , the administration acknowledges that the decision " only occasionally prevents federal prosecutors from obtaining appropriate convictions . "
The administration 's legal move is a reminder that Obama , who has moved from campaigning to governing , now speaks for federal prosecutors .
The administration 's position assumes a level playing field , with equally savvy police and criminal suspects , lawyers on the other side of the case said .
But the protection offered by the court in Stevens ' 1986 opinion is especially important for vulnerable defendants , including the mentally and developmentally disabled , addicts , juveniles and the poor , the lawyers said .
" Your right to assistance of counsel can be undermined if somebody on the other side who is much more sophisticated than you are comes and talks to you and asks for information , " said Sidney Rosdeitcher , a New York lawyer who advises the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University .
Stephen B. Bright , a lawyer who works with poor defendants at the Southern Center for Human Rights in Atlanta , said the administration 's position " is disappointing , no question . "
Bright said that poor defendants ' constitutional right to a lawyer , spelled out by the high court in 1965 , has been neglected in recent years .
" I would hope that this administration would be doing things to shore up the right to counsel for poor people accused of crimes , " said Bright , whose group joined with the Brennan Center and other rights organizations in a court filing opposing the administration 's position .
Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson and former FBI Director William Sessions are among 19 one - time judges and prosecutors urging the court to leave the decision in place because it has been incorporated into routine police practice and establishes a rule on interrogations that is easy to follow .
Eleven states also are echoing the administration 's call to overrule the 1986 case .
Justice Samuel Alito first raised the prospect of overruling the decision at arguments in January over the rights of Jesse Montejo , the Louisiana death row inmate .
Montejo's lawyer , Donald Verrilli , urged the court not to do it .
Since then , Verrilli has joined the Justice Department , but played no role in the department 's brief .
When I was in elementary school my parents told me it did n’t matter what I did when I grew up , so long as it made me happy .
“ Happiness is the whole point of life ” , my father said .
“ Your mother loves to help people , so she became a nurse .
I love reading , writing and poetry , so I became an English teacher .
We both find happiness in the work we do each day . ”
A few years later when I was in junior high , my grumpy 6th grade homeroom teacher put me in detention for “ being difficult ” .
She went around the classroom and asked each student what they wanted to be when they grew up .
When she got to me , I told her I wanted to be happy .
She told me I was missing the whole point of the question .
I told her she was missing the whole point of life .
What do we all want to be when we grow up ?
Happy … that is all .
Find what makes you happy and do it until you die .
A man died last night during the G20 protests in central London as a day that began peacefully ended with police saying bottles were thrown at police medics trying to help him .
The man had collapsed within a police cordon set up to contain the crowds who had assembled in central London and the City to protest over the G20 summit .
There were 63 arrests on the day .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission was being notified last night .
Scotland Yard said the alarm had been raised by a member of the public who spoke to a police officer on a cordon at the junction of Birchin Lane and Cornhill in the City .
He sent two medics through the cordon line and into nearby St Michael 's Alley where they found a man who had stopped breathing .
They called for ambulance support at about 7.30 pm and moved him back behind the cordon where they gave him cardio - pulmonary resuscitation .
" The officers took the decision to move him as during this time a number of missiles – believed to be bottles – were being thrown at them " , said a police statement .
The ambulance service took the man to hospital where he died .
A London ambulance spokesman said : " Our staff immediately took over the treatment of the patient and made extensive efforts to resuscitate him both at the scene and on the way to hospital . "
The directorate of public standards at both the Metropolitan and City of London police had been informed , the statement said .
One protester at the scene said the man was in his 30s and died of natural causes , the Press Association news agency reported .
The man 's death ended a day in which the contrasting faces of British policing were on display in London .
The Met called in support from 30 forces across the country to create a 5,000 - strong team of officers for at least six diverse demonstrations in the City of London and Trafalgar Square .
Outside the Bank of England police horses and riot officers were pushed back by the sheer force of demonstrators – helmets were torn from officers ' heads and cans , fruit and flour rained down .
In retaliation the police surged forward , cracking heads with batons , using pepper spray and CS gas , and sirens wailed all around .
Three minutes ' walk away , in Bishopsgate , smiling officers shared a joke with men and women pitching tents along the road , a family offered them chocolate brownies from an organic food stall and a few lads politely queued up outside the compost toilet tent .
But late last night there was a stand - off as officers moved to start to break up the climate camp that had been set up .
Violence spread as far as London Bridge , with riot police chasing groups of demonstrators , who responded with bottles and other missiles .
Commanders at the Met , who are said to be among the best public order officers in the world , insisted they would not let the city be brought to a standstill .
They used familiar tactics to trap 4,000 people into streets outside the Bank of England in a practice known as " kettling " , tightening the cordon when violence flared in one part of Threadneedle Street and a group of protesters , whose faces were covered , broke into the Royal Bank of Scotland .
Commander Bob Broadhurst , in charge of the operation , said his aim was to facilitate peaceful protest .
But those peaceful demonstrators caught inside the cordon with no toilet facilities , and little water , questioned the idea that they were being allowed to exercise their right to march .
" The police should let us dribble out when we need to , " said June Rogers , a gardener from south London .
" We 've just come on a peaceful protest .
We 've got fire in our belly and we want to say something and be heard , we are just ordinary people but they made the situation worse . "
Jeannie Mackie , a barrister who had attended the climate camp as an observer , was penned in for two hours after police cordoned off both ends of Bishopsgate .
" I thought it was completely unnecessary , " she said .
" I was kept for two hours .
Lines of police lined up with their batons and they were completely pumped up and looking to have a go .
My feeling was everyone in there was peaceful but they wanted to clear them out . "
Responding to the police use of the kettling technique she said that although the courts had ruled that it was legal , there had to be a good reason .
" I asked one officer could I go and he said no – I might to and cause trouble .
I giggled and said that was n't very likely and he said , ' you can never tell with these people ' . "
Scotland Yard said a cordon was used because missiles were being thrown at officers .
It also said that portaloos and water had been moved in .
Earlier in the day demonstrations had started close to the Bank of England , storming a Royal Bank of Scotland branch , and baton - wielding police charging a sit - down protest by students .
Much of the protesting was peaceful , but some bloody skirmishes broke out as police tried to keep thousands of people in containment pens surrounding the Bank of England on Threadneedle Street .
Some buildings in the City had been boarded up in anticipation of trouble , with staff warned to work from home or dress down .
As protesters began to gather , after 11 am , some City workers were seen waving £ 10 notes at them from office windows .
After the charge against the sit - down protest at students , there were complaints that officers had been heavy handed .
" When people surrounded RBS , I could understand police tactics , " said Jack Bright , 19 .
" We were sat down , trying to have a peaceful protest , but they started whacking us . "
The poignancy of this is pretty profound :
Attorney Dan Monnat said Tiller was shot as he served as an usher during morning services at Reformation Lutheran Church .
Monnat said Tiller 's wife , Jeanne , was in the choir at the time of the shooting .
To assassinate someone is evil enough ; to do it in a church service , as his wife looks on is staggering .
And the terrorist is still at large :
Capt .
Brent Allred said Wichita police were looking for a gunman who fled in a 1993 light blue Ford Taurus registered in the Kansas City suburb of Merriam , Kan .
Gateway Pundit notes :
Police were looking for a blue Ford Taurus with a K - State vanity plate , license number 225 BAB .
Police described him as a white male in his 50's or 60's , 6 ' 1 , " 220 lbs , wearing a white shirt and dark pants .
The car is reportedly registered out of Merriam , Kansas a suburb just to the southeast of Kansas City , Kan .
Robert Stacy McCain , about as far right as one can get , is appalled :
Sometimes , when the stubborn wickedness of a people offends God , the Almighty witholds
His divine protection , permitting those sinners to have their own way , following the road to destruction so that they are subjected to evil rulers and unjust laws .
Never , however , does the wise and faithful Christian resort to the kind of lawlessness practiced with such cruelty today in Kansas .

A Michigan lawmaker is calling upon Gov. Jennifer Granholm to extricate the state from an agreement made with the Department of Homeland Security to foist upon motorists there an Enhanced Driver 's License that includes a long - range RFID chip .
DHS says it is also working with Arizona , California , Michigan , Texas , Vermont and Washington to distribute the same technology to their drivers .
( Note : Important update below . )
" Michigan entering into a federal agreement to put unencrypted , long - range RFID computer chips into our driver 's licenses presents a huge privacy risk with very little benefit " , says Republican State Rep. Paul Opsommer , in a statement .
" I do n't think we need RFID in our licenses period , but even if we did , there is absolutely no reason it could n't be short range and encrypted .
The federal government has made some bad technology choices that they now want to cram down the rest of our throats .
Canada is totally rethinking this whole program from the ground up , and so should Michigan . "
Leaping to second Opsommer 's motion is Hugh D'Andrade , a staffer with Electronic Frontier Foundation , who writes on that organization 's blog : " Rep. Opsommer has good reason for concern .
Studies have found that the long - range RFIDs embedded in the new IDs broadcast a unique number that can be read remotely from tens of feet away , using tools that are inexpensive and relatively easy to assemble .
Michigan citizens who carry the IDs could be reasonably concerned about being tracked when they attend a political rally , go to a gun show , or take part in any controversial activity . "
According to the Department of Homeland Security Web site , there is absolutely nothing for Opsommer , D'Andrade or anyone else to be concerned about :
State - issued enhanced drivers licenses provide proof of identity and U.S. citizenship .
These new documents are being developed by many states to comply with travel rules under the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative ( WHTI ) .
Enhanced drivers licenses can be used by U.S. citizens instead of a passport to cross the border with Canada , Mexico .
Enhanced drivers licenses will make it quicker and easier to cross the border back into the United States because they will contain : a vicinity Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) chip that will signal a computer to pull up your biographic and biometric data for the CBP Officer as you pull up to the border ; and , a Machine Readable Zone ( MRZ ) or barcode that the CBP officer can read electronically if RFID is n't available .
No personally identifiable information will be stored on the card 's RFID chip or be transmitted by the card .
The card will use a unique identification number which will link to information contained in a secure database .
This number will not contain any personal information .
DHS issued this press release trumpeting Michigan 's participation in October 2008 .
When I called for comment , Gov. Granholm 's press office transferred me to the press office of Michigan Secretary of State Terri Lynn Land , who oversees the licensing program .
A staffer in Land 's office said it might be tomorrow before they have anything to say about Opsommer 's request .
Personally , I 'm not what you 'd call a privacy zealot , having long ago come to grips with the fact that we have next to none of it left to defend .
And , I would dearly love to trust my government when it offers reassurances of the kind DHS proffers on this matter .
But I do n't .
So , I 'll take my driver 's license without the chip , if it 's all the same .
( Update , 3:40 p.m. :
Well , it turns out I can get my wish should I ever move to Michigan , as a spokeswoman for Secretary of State Land tells me the RFID - enabled Enhanced Driver 's License is " strictly voluntary " and that anyone who wants an old - fashioned one sans chip can still have one .
" The secretary sees ( EDL ) as a convenience that allows people to not carry a passport . "
While the spokeswoman stressed that she cannot speak for Gov. Granholm , she did say the EDLs are scheduled to be made available at the end of this month , so I 'm thinking critics best not hold their breath waiting for a reversal . )
El médico no perdió tiempo en empezar .
Tomó el rostro de Ana con sus ” .
manos y dirigió el lado izquierdo hacia la luz .
Apretó y presionó los dobleces de piel en su barbilla , la mejilla y su frente .
Separó los párpados para mirar su ojo .
" ¿Ves algo ? ”
“ Sí " .
Le pidió que siguiera con la mirada un dedo del médico , de izquierda a derecha .
" ¿Un poco borroso ? ”
“ Sí " .
El no acostumbraba trabajar tan rápido , pero se había desorientado con esta paciente nueva .
Ella era la última cita al final de un día muy ocupado y él no había leído bien el archivo .
Pensó que ella había acudido a su consultorio para hablar sobre un estiramiento facial .
Dio un paso hacia atrás para poner en orden sus pensamientos .
Tenía frente a él un caso del que tal vez podía escuchar en la escuela de medicina o en una conversación con sus colegas , pero que nunca hubiera esperado ver por sí mismo .
Las consultas rutinarias del día se desvanecieron , los aumentos de busto , los estiramientos faciales y la abdominoplastia .
Empezó a preguntarse cómo trataría su condición y las posibilidades de lo que podría lograr .
Trató de mantener controlada su emoción .
“ Creo que le podríamos ayudar ” , comentó .
“ Pero me gustaría conversar con los otros médicos del equipo ” .
El quería primero tomarle algunas fotos y salió de la sala para ir por la cámara .
Ana fijó su mirada hacia adelante .
A sus 24 años , ya había visto cantidad de médicos y había escuchado su optimismo y su preocupación .
No quería esperanzarse .
Pero este doctor -- él dijo que su nombre era Munish Batra -- no era lo que ella se esperaba .
Era joven , guapo y alentador .
Tal vez las cosas saldrían distintas esta vez .
::
Ella tenía las finas facciones de su abuela y el cabello de su madre .
En los corazones de sus padres , Ana Rodarte era la bebé más hermosa .
Era fácil para Ismael y Margarita pasar por alto lo que en sus principios parecía ser una simple marca de nacimiento .
Nació ochomesina y pesó poco más de cinco libras .
Parecía suficientemente diminuta para caber en una caja de zapatos , pensó Ismael .
Una vez que la llevaron a casa del hospital en Tijuana , todos sus tías , tíos y primos querían sumarse a su cuidado .
Creció rápidamente y Margarita capturó cada momento significativo con una cámara Polaroid antigua .
En el borde de cada foto , escribió cuidadosamente la edad de Ana .
“ Tenía 2 meses ” .
“ Tenía 4 meses ” .
Ella era su Princesa .
En la playa en Ensenada .
En la cama con sus ositos de peluche rosado y café .
En su bautizo en California .
En su primer cumpleaños con su primera piñata .
Ellos ponían crema de manzanilla en la peque ña marca roja de su mejilla .
Les recordaba a una picadura de abeja .
Estaban dispuestos a escuchar a cualquiera que tuviera una opinión sobre lo que debían hacer .
Fueron muchos los que opinaron , pero de nada sirvió .
Cuando Ana empezó a caminar , compraron una cámara de fotos con el flash en la parte superior .
La llevaban dondequiera .
A la zapatería en el día de venta de dos por uno .
A casa de los vecinos donde ella jugaba en un triciclo .
Al parque al cruzar la calle donde se sentó en el columpio por primera vez .
Margarita puso las fotos en un álbum .
A Ana le gustaba verlas .
En una competencia de bailes folclóricos , su tía tomó una foto de ella bailando en el escenario con su primo , agarrando su falda roja de volantes .
Ella tenía una sonrisa que a duras penas contenía su felicidad .
A la vez que la marquita roja se iba desplazando por su mejilla y se esparcía , se iban distorsionando sus facciones .
Sus padres le decían que no debía preocuparse ni fastidiarse por las miradas ajenas .
Ellos sintieron que crecía todavía más su amor aun cuando se sintieron más marginados por tener que sobrellevar un problema que nadie parecía entender .
Es la sangre de mi sangre , pensó Ismael .
Cuando Margarita lloraba , se aseguraba de que Ana no viera sus lágrimas .
Pero Ana sabía que algo no estaba bien .
A temprana edad , “ en algún lugar entre los creyones y la goma de pegar , los columpios y los cartones de leche ” , según recordó más tarde , se dio cuenta de que era diferente a los demás niños .
Cuando le preguntaba a su madre el por qué , Margarita le decía que Dios la había hecho de esa manera .
“ Entonces ” , preguntaba , " ¿por qué Dios ha sido tan malo ? ”

El rostro es nuestra tarjeta de presentación al mundo .
Las facciones que heredamos de nuestros padres tienen una elocuencia : la simetría de los ojos enmarcados por las cejas y los pómulos ; la elevación de la nariz , la curva sensual de la boca , la suave separación de los labios .
El rostro transmite información esencial  sexo , edad y etnicidad  y más delicadamente expresa un amplio espectro de ánimos y emociones ; la curiosidad , el amor , el aburrimiento , la impaciencia , la indiferencia , el enojo .
También evoca reacciones de los demás que dan forma a nuestras vidas .
Todos los días percibimos rostros y hacemos conjeturas sobre la identidad y el carácter sin ninguna otra base que no sea la apariencia .
Resulta difícil decir cuáles fueron mis conjeturas cuando vi a Ana por primera vez .
La persona encargada de relaciones públicas del Hospital Scripps Memorial en La Jolla me había dicho que el hospital y un médico local estaban a punto de tratar a una jovencita con tumores faciales similares a los del Hombre Elefante .
El plan quirúrgico era ambicioso y , ya que ella y su familia no podían correr con los gastos , el hospital y los doctores donarían sus servicios .
¿ Me interesaría ?
Ciertamente que sí estaba intrigado .
Yo sabía sobre Joseph Merrick y recuerdo vivamente la película en 1980 acerca de su vida , “ El Hombre Elefante ” de David Lynch .
Hice arreglos para conocer a Ana en Scripps unos días antes del Día de Navidad de 2005 .
Ella había ido para que le tomaran imágenes de Tomografía Computarizada y de Resonancia Magnética .
Aguardaba en una recámara privada , lejos de la curiosidad de los demás pacientes .
Nos sentamos uno frente al otro y conversamos sobre trivialidades .
A principios noté todo menos su rostro : los pantalones vaqueros acampanados , la sudadera gris oscuro y suelta que cubría una camiseta de Rock de los años ’ 80 , la bolsa de mano rosada de Hello Kitty .
Su cabello oscuro y rizado era abundante y estaba amarrado hacia atrás .
Sus orejas estaban adornadas con pequeños aretes de plata .
Era recatada y se volteaba para apartarse cuando me hablaba .
Tuve la impresión de que ella quería que todo esto desapareciera , el hospital al igual que el reportero .
Aún así , su timidez fue un reto para mí .
Quería mirarla de frente pero no lo hice .
No quería hacerla sentirse incómoda , pero al mismo tiempo quería ver la evidencia de la maldad de Dios .
La presencia de ella me daba tanto pena como curiosidad .
Al conversar acerca de la complejidad de las cirugías que le esperaban , le pregunté qué era lo que más le asustaba .
“ Las agujas ” , me dijo sin vacilar .
Me sacudió su vulnerabilidad .
Me sentí avergonzado .
Me di cuenta de que había perdido la perspectiva de ella como persona y sólo veía su afección .
Esto hizo que me preguntara si acaso yo era diferente a los voceadores de carnaval y los médicos que habían explotado a Merrick .
::
Ana y yo empezamos a comunicarnos por correos electrónicos y yo iba de vez en cuando al Condado de Riverside a reunirme con sus padres , para asistir a una fiesta y a una quinceañera , y para ver cómo sería para ella un fin de semana de verano .
No demoré en descubrir a una jovencita complicada que no era muy diferente a cualquiera de su edad .
“ Vivo mi vida igual que la gente normal ” , escribió , “ no es que tenga una razón para no hacerlo , ¿sabes de lo que hablo ? ”
Me di cuenta de que le gustan las películas , las fiestas familiares y hacer compras de artículos en oferta .
Comparte con sus amigos , le encanta comunicarse por correo electrónico y por mensajes instantáneos y a menudo contesta su teléfono celular a la primera timbrada .
Ella tiene una colección de 250 grabaciones en DVD , en su mayoría de películas de terror .
Dijo ser tímida .
Pero he llegado a creer que su comportamiento recatado es su manera de tener cierto control del mundo que la rodea .
“ tú no vas a ver mi lado sensible .
. . . casi nunca dejo que nadie lo vea ” , expuso en uno de sus correos electrónicos .
" ¿por qué dejar que la gente se aproveche de eso ? ”
Aún así percibí que tenía tristeza por los aspectos de la vida que la evadirían .
“ No quiero tener hijos , no .
El riesgo de que nazcan con la misma condición es muy grande .
. . .
No me gustaría que ellos pasen por lo que yo he pasado , además no puedo trabajar , nadie me contrata , así que ya renuncié a eso , y no planeo casarme tampoco , no creo en eso ” .
Por su puesto que hacía como si no le importara .
“ No todos los sueños se vuelven realidad ” , escribió una vez , con tono más bien de resignación que de amargura .
Con el transcurso del tiempo , llegué a interpretar sus razonamientos como indicio de su vulnerabilidad frente a la verdad :
No se casaría nunca , nunca contemplaría a su propio hijo ni dejaría nunca de depender de los demás para su sustento .
Y todo ello se debería a su rostro .
Me pregunté si tal vez llegaría el día en que me mostraría lo equivocado que estaba .
::
Neurofibromatosis .
Ana escuchó esta palabra extraña y sin gracia por primera vez cuando era una niña .
Un médico la había mencionado en una de sus primeras visitas al hospital .
Al igual que la mayoría de las enfermedades genéticas , neurofibromatosis presenta un reto a la fe que depositamos en el proceso de la concepción , en el riesgo que aceptamos correr al tratar de crear una vida .
Aparece tan pronto como los dos grupos de cromosomas empiezan a emparejarse , los de él con los de ella , óvulo y esperma , 23 pares y 46 cromosomas , y tiene tres manifestaciones distintivas , cada una caracterizada por el crecimiento de tumores en el tejido alrededor de los nervios .
El tipo que tiene
Ana es conocido como NF1 , o la enfermedad de Von Recklinghausen , por el hombre que lo estudió hace más de un siglo .
Tiene que ver con un gen en el largo brazo del cromosoma 17 que produce una proteína llamada “ neurofibromina ” .
Una mutación del gen puede tener como consecuencia bien sea una insuficiencia o la falta total de producción de la neurofibromina y el estropeamiento de la proliferación celular , la cual consiste de una danza bioquímica compleja entre la proteína RAS , que funciona como agente activador , y la neurofibomina , que es el mecanismo supresor .
Es un defecto común que ocurre en 1 de cada 3,000 personas .
Sus síntomas pueden ser benignos como las marcas de nacimiento o pequeñas protuberancias debajo de la piel y tan severos como tumores como los de Ana , los cuales pueden en algunos casos convertirse en cancerosos .
( A pesar de que se parezca tanto a la condición de Merrick , los investigadores creen ahora que él tenía una enfermedad diferente , el síndrome de Proteo ) .
La mitad de los casos de la NF1 resultan de las mutaciones que ocurren durante la concepción y la otra mitad son heredados de uno de los padres , hecho que rompió el corazón de Ismael Rodarte aun cuando lo acercaba más a su niñita .
Es la sangre de mi sangre .
::
El tenía 16 años cuando lo operaron en Mexicali para extraerle protuberancias parecidas a verrugas grandes de su zona lumbar por creer que podrían ser cancerosas .
Cinco años más tarde , tuvo una operación similar en Ciudad México y en 1977 una tercera intervención en San Diego .
A pesar de que los doctores mencionaron neurofibromatosis , nadie le habló sobre los riesgos genéticos y cuando conoció a Margarita él pensó que ya había pasado lo peor .
Ellos trabajaban en una fábrica en Tecate , México .
El tenía 31 años de edad y ella 23 .
Ellos eran una pareja algo atrevida .
Algunos parientes afirman que se fugaron .
Ellos indican que se trató de una simple ceremonia civil .
La hermana de Ismael les dio dinero para una recámara de hotel y muy pronto Margarita quedó embarazada .
A principios concordaron en que querían una familia numerosa , con al menos cuatro hijos .
Pero después del nacimiento de Ana empezaron a cambiar de parecer .
En el hospital de Tijuana no podían hacer nada para bajar la hinchazón del lado izquierdo del rostro de la pequeña .
Ellos querían que la atendieran médicos estadounidenses .
Querían para ella una vida mejor .
Su casa era del tamaño de un trailer pequeño , con piso de tierra y cucarachas .
Hicieron los arreglos para que Ana fuera a vivir en Estados Unidos con Teresa , hermana de Margarita , y su familia .
Iban cada dos semanas a visitarla .
Primero pasó un año y luego otro .
Cuando la fábrica en la que trabajaban fue reubicada , decidieron mudarse al norte .
El 16 de enero de 1983 , con $ 10 entre los dos , Ismael y Margarita cruzaron la frontera para siempre .
Primero se mudaron a casa de Teresa .
Su nuevo hogar en el Condado de Riverside se encontraba en medio de una gran zona de repartos residenciales , viejas granjas , parques para trailers y plazas comerciales con las montañas sin árboles de fondo y los picos de las San Jacinto a la distancia .
Era un lugar tan bueno como cualquier otro para desaparecer .
Margarita encontró trabajo en una empresa distribuidora de papas .
Ismael tomó un trabajo cargando furgones ferroviarios y , al pasar la temporada para eso , recogía cebollas .
Muchas veces se escondió de la migra .
Ella no tuvo tanto problema .
Una vez , lo atraparon y lo enviaron de regreso a México ; a la quincena ya había vuelto .
Para esa época , ya la ceja , la mejilla y el labio de Ana habían comenzado a colgar y le era difícil mantener abierto el ojo izquierdo .
Ella tenía 4 años y medio .
Algo tenían que hacer .
::
La familia había escuchado acerca del Centro Médico de la Universidad de Loma Linda .
Ismael había visto en la televisión cómo sus doctores pudieron reemplazar el corazón enfermo de una niñita con el de un babuino .
Si ellos podían hacer eso , de seguro que podían ayudar a Ana .
El viaje hacia el hospital , ubicado entre Riverside y San Bernardino a casi 45 minutos de su casa , puso nerviosos a Ismael y Margarita .
Sabían que , de quedar detenidos serían deportados .
Pero una vez que vieron el complejo de torres blancas , se sintieron seguros .
Había colgado en el vestíbulo un gran retrato de Cristo .
Quedaron atolondrados por el bullicio que los rodeaba , con el ir y venir de residentes en mandiles blancos cortos , de los médicos en mandiles blancos largos y el olor de alcohol .
Escucharon los términos extraños usados para describir la enfermedad de Ana ; hemangioma , linfangioma y eventualmente , neurofibromatosis .
Con el nuevo equipo de procesamiento de imágenes del hospital , los médicos pudieron observar la forma y la masa de tumores que habían infiltrado en el lado izquierdo de su rostro , en la órbita de su ojo y en la región del cráneo conocida como fosa pterigopalatina , por la que pasa un manojo de nervios y arterias .
NF1 puede afectar cualquier nervio del cuerpo , pero en el caso de Ana se puso de manifiesto en uno de los 12 nervios craneales , tratándose de la segunda de las tres ramas del nervio trigémino , el cual aporta sensación a la cara , el labio superior , los dientes superiores y las encías .
Estos nervios se ven como hilitos blancos que se ramifican a través de los músculos y llegan a las capas de la piel .
Si se diseccionara a uno de estos hilos , parecería un cable eléctrico , cuyo revestimiento exterior viene siendo la vaina de mielina que encierra las neuronas .
En el caso de Ana , las células de esta vaina se proliferaban sin control debido a que el mecanismo supresor , la neurofibromina , no funcionaba debidamente .
Con el paso de los años , estas células pasaron a convertirse en una red de tumores difusos .
Ana fue sometida en Loma Linda a una serie de intervenciones quirúrgicas .
La mayoría de los gastos fueron cubiertos por las aseguranzas de salud que tenían los Rodarte en sus trabajos ; un programa médico estatal de ayuda a los niños sufragó el resto .
La primera operación se llevó a cabo en 1985 cuando Ana tenía cinco años .
La meta era levantar la piel colgante de su rostro y aliviar la compresión del tejido dentro de la cavidad ocular izquierda .
La experiencia resultó ser agotadora para la familia .
Se encontraban en circunstancias mejores , ya que obtuvieron residencia legal en Estados Unidos en 1988 , se mudaron a una casa de alquiler e Ismael obtuvo un trabajo más seguro .
Pero les acechaba el miedo .
Los tumores seguían creciendo y las operaciones no resultaban en mejoras duraderas .
Su médico trazó en 1995 los planes para la quinta cirugía , que sería la más ambiciosa de todas .
Empezaría con una incisión más amplia en forma de C desde la frente hasta el cuello de Ana y con un estimulador eléctrico haría un esquema de los nervios de su rostro para reducir el riesgo de cortar uno de ellos .
Si esto ocurriera , según explicó , su cara quedaría paralizada parcialmente .
En preparación para la operación , se le hizo a Ana una máscara que ayudaría a minimizar la hinchazón post quirúrgica .
A Ismael y Margarita les preocupaba que la operación perjudicara a su hija o que muriera .
Ella tenía 14 años y estaba a punto de comenzar la escuela secundaria .
Salieron ese día del hospital y nunca regresaron .
A medida que Ana entraba en la adolescencia , los tumores habían crecido más rápidamente que antes y cubrieron el lado izquierdo de su cara .
Entre las páginas del álbum de retratos de la familia , no se encuentra ninguna foto de ella de esa época .
Ya no estaba la niñita cuya sonrisa a duras penas contenía su felicidad .
Ella trató de explicarlo a sí misma .
Tal vez en otra vida lo había pasado mejor y este era el precio que debía pagar .
O tal vez esta vida era una prueba , de manera que cuando fuera al Cielo ella sería premiada por su calvario en la Tierra .
::
Todos en su escuela secundaria conocían a Ana .
Algunos pensaban que tenía elefantiasis , otros pensaban que había sufrido quemaduras .
Hubo quien creía que su padre trabajaba en las cosechas y que su enfermedad era la consecuencia de los pesticidas con los que trabajaba .
Pero nadie sabía en realidad .
Nadie preguntaba y ella no hablaba de eso .
No hacía falta .
Había asistido a la escuela con los mismos amigos desde su niñez y estos ya la habían aceptado .
Ella iba a juegos de fútbol americano y de balompié .
Trabajó en una carroza del desfile de bienvenida de regreso a la escuela .
Disfrutó de su clase de arte y formó parte del Club Francés por los chocolates y las actividades de recaudación de fondos .
Sus maestros se hacían a veces de la vista larga por creer que ella tenía pendiente asuntos más importantes que leer “ La Isla del Tesoro ” .
Se graduó en 1999 .
Sus amigos se casaron y tuvieron hijos .
El Senior Circle , un lugar de reunión en el recinto escolar protegido del sol por sicomoros y fresnos , quedó en el olvido y el anuario escolar de Ana , con la foto para la que posó en ese día tan y tan frío , quedó en una repisa de su recámara , desvaneciéndose lentamente el sentido que tenían sus inscripciones para ella :
Haz todas las cosas que quieres hacer cuando las quieras hacer .
. . . no dejes que nadie te desanime .
Tendrás gran éxito en lo que sea que te propongas .
Gracias por ser siempre tan hermosa .
Bueno , este año fue divertido pelear contigo en P.E. [ la clase de Instrucción Física ] .
Eres una de las personas más simpáticas que he conocido y no cambies .
Ana se matriculó en el colegio universitario local y se ofendió cuando la administración trató de asignarle clases para estudiantes con incapacidades de aprendizaje .
Pero se desmayó una mañana cuando se preparaba para ir a clases .
Su perro la encontró en el piso .
Ella decidió que sería mejor esperar antes de ir a la universidad .
Su primo
Lalo se le acercó un día y le preguntó , " ¿Tu cara se está poniendo peor ? ”
“ Sí " , respondió .
Ya los tumores habían dejado sin la definición de costumbre el lado izquierdo de su cara , cubriendo bajo un panorama de hoyuelos y arrugas colgantes lo que en otrora serían los contornos del ojo , el puente de la nariz , la esquina de la boca .
Ella ya no quería salir .
Se pasaba las horas frente a la computadora .
Conoció a un muchacho por Internet y comenzaron a charlar regularmente por computadora hasta que un día llegó a visitarla y se quejó de que ella tomaba demasiado .
Ana lo dejó .
Su mamá le pidió a sus primos que la sacaran a pasear .
A veces iban al parque o a McDonald ’s , pero la gente se quedaban mirándola .
Ella trataba de ser educada y simplemente se alejaba .
Pero le era difícil .
" ¿Por qué no toman una foto ? ” les comentó bruscamente .
“ Durará más tiempo ” .
Una vez una niñita de su propia familia comenzó a llorar cuando vio a Ana .
En otra oportunidad , cuando ella y su mamá fueron a reciclar unas latas , dos extraños se le acercaron y la abrazaron .
“ Dios te bendiga ” , le dijeron .
Ella trató de conseguir un trabajo en el Hometown Buffet local , en McDonald ’s , y hasta en la planta de papas donde trabajaba su mamá .
Pero los administradores ni siquiera se molestaron en llamarla .
Las parrandas con sus primos se convirtieron en su pasatiempo favorito .
Los zombis eran su trago preferido .
Hacían viajes de improviso al Casino Morongo en Cabazon .
Madrugaban bailando y tomando .
Después del 9/11 , ella empezó a pensar en las personas que estuvieron en esos vuelos y en las que por suerte no habían llegado a subir a esos aeroplanos .
Se dio cuenta de que su vida , como las de ellos , era una lección de la volubilidad del destino .
La mayoría de nosotros crecemos creyendo que el mundo se nos abrirá y que encontraremos nuestro lugar : un hogar , el amor , un propósito fijo y trabajo .
Nunca fue tan simple para Ana .
¿ Cómo creas una vida cuando dependes tanto de los demás y esto por tan sólo como luces ?
::
Casi 20 parientes se habían reunido en el parque .
Hacía calor en ese día de agosto de 2005 .
Pero había sombra sobre las mesas de meriendas .
Fran Vigil pensó quedarse sólo el tiempo suficiente para dejar un vestido que había llevado para la cumpleañera , disfrutar de un plato de comida y tal vez probar el pastel .
La enfermera jubilada trabajaba en una agencia local de ayuda a las familias que tienen bajo su cuidado a los hijos de sus parientes .
Ella había ayudado a la tía de Ana , Teresa , con la patria potestad de su nieta de tres años , cuyo cumpleaños se celebraba ese día .
A la distancia , Fran vio por primera vez a Ana .
La pena no hizo nada para atenuar su conmoción .
Se acercó a Teresa varios días después .
" ¿ Quién era la muchacha con el tumor en la cara ? ” preguntó .
“ La sobrina ” , respondió .
" ¿Crees que les gustaría recibir ayuda ? ”
Teresa titubeó .
Hubieron algunas cirugías , pero la familia se había dado por vencida .
Sin embargo , ella les iba a preguntar .
Ana sintió sospecha cuando escuchó que una extraña quería ayudarla .
La familia no tenía dinero y , además , las operaciones en Loma Linda no habían logrado nada .
Aún así , Teresa les pidió una foto de la joven .
Ana cogió una foto de ella con su ex pretendiente .
Cortó el retrato para quitarlo a él y al día siguiente Teresa le entregó la fotografía a Fran .
Fran no estaba completamente segura de lo que haría con la misma .
La llevó a casa y se la enseñó a su nieta y a sus amigos .
“ Quiero que vean esto ” , les comentó .
“ Si ustedes creen que tienen de qué quejarse , entonces piensen en ella ” .
Fue al consultorio de su médico en Hemet y cuando vio pasar por la recepción a algunos jóvenes con mandiles de laboratorio y placas con sus nombres , los detuvo .
“ Quiero saber el nombre de la enfermedad que tenía el Hombre Elefante ” .
“ Neurofibromatosis ” , contestó uno de ellos .
Ella lo apuntó .
Más tarde , una persona donde trabaja
Fran le enseñó un artículo de revista acerca de una organización caritativa que ofrecía cirugía reconstructiva a las personas que no podían correr con los gastos .
Fran escaneó la foto de Ana y la envió por correo electrónico .
“ Hemos encontrado una jovencita con neurofibromatosis ” , escribió “ y nos preguntamos si de alguna forma podrían ayudarla ” .

In creating a modern - day update of classic ' 80s game Bionic Commando , the designers wanted to create a faithful follow - up to the original storyline .
Only problem is , the original story was really , really stupid .
In the 8 - bit game , you played totally dudical , pink - haired , shades - wearing Rad Spencer , who used his trusty bionic grappling arm to defeat evil members of the Badd army , who were trying to revive their fallen leader , Master - D .
To make things more complicated , the chintzy story was actually a bowdlerized version of the original Japanese game , which was titled Top Secret : Return of Hitler .
In it , Spencer faced off against swastika - wearing Nazis who were reanimating der Fuhrer himself .
The new Bionic Commando , which will be released Tuesday for Xbox 360 ( reviewed ) , PlayStation 3 and PC , does n't bring back the Nazis or the swastikas .
But neither does it throw away the old story .
Instead , it turns a silly situation into a serious one , recasting the one - dimensional , four - color characters as flawed heroes in a world gone wrong .
It 's a clever use of these retro heroes , but the gameplay does n't translate as well to the modern era .
In fact , besides the novelty of the story , Bionic Commando is a mostly forgettable experience that does n't make very good use of the game 's central unique feature – that amazing extendable bionic arm .
How do you turn a happy - go - lucky guy with gel in his hair into the battle - hardened antihero that jaded millennial gamers demand ?
Just throw him into jail for five years for a crime he did n't commit , then drop some nuclear bombs .
Emerging into a ruined , irradiated world , Nathan " Rad " Spencer ( his original moniker having been retconned into a cutesy nickname ) has been beaten down into the sort of dreadlocked , sarcastic , bitter a -hole that America craves .
In any other videogame , this story would be cliche .
But when the guy in your earpiece shouting gruff commands at you is " Super Joe " from a 1985 arcade game , the whole thing is just ironic and goofy enough to work .
Bringing Bionic Commando's story in line with contemporary tastes was only one challenge that Swedish development team Grin had to face .
Another was re-creating the bionic arm gameplay in a fully 3 - D world .
The original game 's unique appeal was that you could throw your left arm out like a grappling hook , catch hold of high ledges , then swing in the air .
It works well here : Your targeting reticule will light up when you 're in range of something you can grapple on to , and as long as you 're holding down the L button , Spencer will hook on and his momentum will start him swinging back and forth .
Let go at the right moment , and you 'll fly through the air , ready to grab another target and swing like Tarzan through the levels .
That 's how it works in theory , anyway .
In practice , Bionic Commando's levels are nothing more than highly linear , strung - together series of firefights against mundane bad guys , something that does n't feel substantially different from any other third - person shooter .
You can use your arm in fights to grab and throw enemies , or to throw things at enemies , which is quite a bit more effective than shooting them .
These moves also err on the side of perfection :
Once I picked up an enemy and threw him , and it auto - locked onto a sniper on a roof about half a mile away , and the two bodies collided perfectly .
Who needs guns ?
But in most cases , Bionic Commando punishes you for trying to enjoy it .
If you 're having too much fun swinging around and climbing buildings , you 're quite likely to fall into a bottomless death trap , or swing into an area of the city that 's full of radiation .
Both kill you very quickly .
To add insult to injury , you 're booted out to a very long loading screen when you die .
The checkpoints are spaced so far apart that you 'll quickly learn to be extremely cautious when swinging around .
When I finally completed some of the more frustrating objectives , I did n't feel like I 'd accomplished something – just relief that I was n't going to have to play that section of the game again .
( Bionic Commando features an online multiplayer battle mode , but technical issues on Capcom 's part kept us from being able to try it .
We will update the review when we can play the multiplayer . )
The single - player mode wo n't take longer than a weekend to complete .
Although the story moves along at a fast pace , the final stage is the very definition of anticlimax : a completely predictable plot twist , a frustrating shoot - a- thon of a final level , a boring boss fight and a completely incongruous quick - time event to cap it all off .
I could n't help but notice , playing Bionic Commando , that its interface design is highly reminiscent of Metroid Prime .
Too bad the developer did n't also borrow that game 's clever use of open worlds that let you backtrack and explore freely .
This is especially disappointing since that 's what the original ' 80s game featured .
The concepts behind the new Bionic Commando are strong , but the moment - to - moment action just does n't deliver on the promise of how awesome it would be to have a grappling hook instead of a hand .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
Yet another sign that when economic times are tough , things can get ugly : A new report suggests that right - wing extremism in the U.S. may be on the rise .
The Department of Homeland Security says these groups might be using the recession and the election of the country 's first African - American president as tools to recruit members .
The Department of Homeland Security says membership in extremist groups like this may be increasing .
They say there 's " no specific information " on planned violence by domestic right - wing terrorists ; but real - estate foreclosures , unemployment and tight credit could all lead to a " fertile recruiting environment . "
There 's even the possibility of confrontations between these groups and government authorities .
The report says many right - wing extremists are antagonistic toward President Obama and his perceived policies on issues like immigration , expanding social programs to minorities and restrictions on owning guns .
It also points to concerns about anti-Semitism , saying some people are blaming the loss of jobs and home foreclosures on a conspiracy planned by a " cabal of Jewish financial elites . "
The report cites " lone wolves and small terrorist cells " as the biggest threat - because their low profile makes it hard to catch them before they act .
The Southern Poverty Law Center agrees that President Obama 's election may have boosted membership in some groups , but questions the link to the economy .
Meanwhile at least one conservative radio talk show host suggests that this report is meant to step on free speech and First Amendment Rights - which the Department of Homeland Security denies .
It 's probably worth pointing out that the Obama administration also issued a warning about left - wing extremists in January .
Here 's my question to you :
What should be done about a potential increase in right - wing extremism ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Benny writes :
Jack ,
They claim they fear their guns will be taken away , but they 're making the case that their guns should be taken .
They 're about nothing but hate and disorder .
It seems to me they hate intelligence and embrace ignorance .
Pete from St. Louis , Missouri writes :
The same thing we did to other unpalatable groups , such as the Mafia and the KKK .
Let the FBI do their job .
If they are a legitimate threat , they will be brought down appropriately .
Mike writes :
Right - wing extremism is a fact of life .
They do not accumulate guns for nothing .
I believe they are sincere in their efforts to prepare for a war , and unfortunately I believe they think it is going to be here .
These people are dangerous and fueled by the right - wing nuts on the air .
Tim from Hot Springs , Arkansas writes :
This type of thing happens every time there is a recession …
Young , urbanites resort to crime to survive and whites in rural America unite to blame others and " protect " themselves .
Either the economy needs to recover and recover quickly or we will need to crush the extremists like pebbles just as we did in the mid-90s .
Let 's just pray we it happens before another Oklahoma City .
William from Minneapolis writes :
As a black man , I will shock your audience with this :
Do n't do anything .
If the government does anything to restrict 1st Amendment rights of these extremists , they will go underground with more venom than before .
Prosecute them under current law if they violate the law , but do n't squash their rights .
George from New York writes :
Now that they are out of the White House , I feel much better .
Mario from Montreal writes :

Dick Cheney 's MAD , just not in the way you think .
As Time , the AP and virtually every pundit across the political spectrum debate the meaning of Cheney 's ubiquity on your television screen , it may be an old Cold War theory which best explains his strategy .
The former vice president is n't merely trying to rewrite history or work the jury with his repeated claims that torture " saved thousands , perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives " and that there was " nothing devious or deceitful or dishonest or illegal about what was done . "
With his brinksmanship , Dick Cheney is threatening the political equivalent of Mutual Assured Destruction to produce a stalemate he apparently believes he will win .
Cheney 's escalating campaign against the Obama administration began within days of the election .
His charge that President Obama will " raise the risk to the American people of another attack " has reached a crescendo with appearances on CBS and Fox News this week .
And while Cheney Tuesday blasted Obama 's approach on Iran as a " giant conspiracy " which is " bound to fail , " next week at the American Enterprise Institute he will offer a full - throated defense of the Bush administration 's national security policies , including its regime of detainee torture .
All of which begs the question : why would a wildly unpopular figure who has proclaimed he has no future political ambitions mount such an unprecedented public campaign to criticize his successors ?
Over the Washington Monthly , Steve Benen ponders " is Dick running for something ? "
For its part , the AP explores the gamut of explanations , ranging from the sincere ( " it could be that Cheney really sees a threat out there " ) , routine revisionist history ( " He sees himself in a position where his legacy is called into question , and he wants to get his story out before history gels " ) to the Freudian :
" This is not the same level of control and discipline Cheney 's exercised over the last 40 years , " said John Baick , professor of history at Western New England College .
" I think it grows out of a deep sense of hurt and betrayal . "
Time 's Michael Duffy joins in the burgeoning " meaning of Dick " cottage industry to explain why Angler is now " so chatty all of a sudden . "
Noting Cheney 's belief that " in politics as well the best defense is often a good offense , " Duffy rightly concludes Cheney is seeking to " refocus the question about waterboarding and other interrogation techniques from whether they were legal to whether they worked . "
But lost in these analyses is Cheney 's real objective and strategy is his twilight struggle against the Obama administration .
For that , one need only look to Dick Cheney 's Cold Warrior roots and the doctrine of Mutual Assured Destruction ( MAD ) .
By raising the stakes over the torture issue with his repeated appearances , Dick Cheney is n't merely daring Democratic Congress and the Obama administration to investigate him and other members of the Bush torture team .
Cheney 's is a scorched earth game he believes he can win .
Cheney 's MAD strategy goes something like this .
If the DOJ or Congress proceeds with torture probes or prosecutions , Republican retaliation will be massive and total .
Nominees will be blocked , legislation filibustered and the gridlock in Washington permanent .
The blame for the carnage , the theory goes , will go to the side ( in this case , Democrats ) which launched the first strike .
As Ronald Reagan was fond of saying , " a nuclear war can not be won and must never be fought . "
With the prospect of an atomic political conflict assured of leaving both parties devastated , stalemate is the only alternative .
And in Dick Cheney 's case , stalemate equals victory .
By ratcheting up the public pressure , Cheney is forcing Obama 's hand : act on torture , or back down .
And by backing down , Obama would in essence codify the Bush administration 's criminality .
In the unsteady equilibrium which would endure , the Bush torture team would appear to be right , seemingly vindicated .
Like the Soviet threat , the risk from torture prosecution would be successfully contained .
In his eyes , Cheney 's omnipresence is n't a nightmare for Republicans , but their path back .
As the Associated Press noted , " Cheney seemed even more exercised after Obama released memos detailing how ' enhanced interrogation ' became a tactic used during the Bush administration . "
Cheney 's MAD , all right .
Just not in the way most people think .

This summer most people will attend a barbecue where they will be served grilled meat .
Some will opt for chicken over beef due to their health conscious nature .
However , the most dangerous element they will consume will not be the red meat or the white meat .
The real dietary danger will be the black meat !
Grilled meat contains one of the most potent carcinogens known : ( PAH ) , and the telltale signs are the black stripes from the grill .
This article will provide information about this toxin along with ways to avoid it .
When fire directly touches meat the fat liquefies and drips into the fire , vaporizing and creating dangerous compounds that rise in the form of gas and reattach to the meat .
While all substances have a temperature whereby they will vaporize , animal fats must be heated to extremely high temperatures in order to achieve this .
When they do vaporize ( as they do when they drip into the fire ) they become not only toxic but easily absorbed by the body .
The bad news is they are .
The good news is they are .
It 's like being bitten by a blood - thirsty , tasty shark .
It turns out the most dangerous substance found inside vaporized animal fat is PAH .
When scientists want to create cancer in a laboratory ( something done to animals as a matter of course ) , they will often use PAH because cooked animal fats are known to be one of the primary causes of cancer .
Throw in the hormones , MSG and sodium nitrate ( which also fuse into various bad things at high temperatures ) and it's obvious why about half of Americans develop cancer in their lifetime .
Does this mean the fancy outdoor grill was a complete waste of money ?
Not exactly , for some have a working egg timer and foot massager .
Plus , there is a fast solution to the problem : a cast iron skillet can be used on the grill to protect the meat from touching the flame ( one just needs to watch out for the handles that get hot ) .
Does this mean that meat can just as easily be cooked on the kitchen stove ?
Technically yes , but then nobody would get to smell butane while the head of the household dons a chef hat and thumps their chest .
When bread cooks under a flame on a hot stone , the blackening it obtains is actually a powerful antioxidant ( similar to activated charcoal ) .
Also , when meat or fish blackens in a pan or under a broiler it 's not as dangerous .
In fact , this is a key used by most chefs to obtain certain textures and flavors and to sear in juice .
One mainly wants to avoid having the fire directly touch the meat .
Nowadays many restaurants ask patrons if they prefer an item " blackened " .
A few years ago this meant flame broiled .
However now " blackened " usually means , an artificial flavor normally containing MSG along with cheap fillers .
Should you inquire the wait staff will most likely know nothing about it and will resent your even asking .
The wait staff will have to ask the cook who is likely to become equally annoyed .
The cook must then read the ingredients on that giant container of powder on the shelf for the first time .
Most wo n't be able to detect hidden forms of MSG such as Natural Flavoring , Casein , or Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein , and some wo n't even know that MSG also goes by the name Monosodium Glutamate .
They will say " no MSG " .
To make matters worse , a number of restaurants ( even high end chains ) do n't make the ingredients of their spice blends available to the chef ( or on their web site ) .
For a great MSG - like flavor try the following blend in equal parts : Ideally one will limit meat consumption , choose naturally raised meat and either pan-sear or slow - cook meat in a cast iron skillet .
There is still hope for the renegade types like comedian Denis Leary who only eat red meat from cows that smoke .
Studies have shown that many foods can help detoxify PAH , namely apples , cherries , sage , rosemary , garlic and olive oil .
Kirk Patrick has studied natural medicine for over a decade and has helped many people heal themselves .
NEW YORK – A woman has been wounded by an arrow on a New York City street .
Police say they think the arrow was shot into the air at random .
They say the 76 - centimetre arrow struck Denise Delgado - Brown in the stomach on Sunday as she was dropping off fellow parishioners at a nursing home in the Bronx after attending church .
She underwent surgery at St. Barnabas Hospital and was listed in stable condition .
She is about 50 years old .
Police said the fibreglass arrow is the type that can be used for either practice or hunting .
Officers searched the area but no arrests had been made as of Monday .
Friends say Delgado - Brown works as a traffic court officer in the suburb of Yonkers .
The troops are pushing the Tigers into a shrinking territory Sri Lankan troops are advancing on the last town still held by the Tamil Tiger rebels in the north , the military says .
There is intense fighting at the outskirts of the town of Puthukkudiyiruppu , it says .
A senior military officer in the area says this is the " last objective " and that the war could now be over in days .
The rebels have made no comment .
Over the past few weeks , the army has driven the Tigers into a shrinking zone of jungle in the north - east .
See map of the region Meanwhile , TamilNet , the pro-Tamil Tiger website , says at least six people were killed and many others wounded when troops fired a shell near a makeshift hospital at Puthumaaththa'lan .
On Monday the UN and the EU issued fresh appeals for an immediate end to the fighting .
' Last objective ' Soldiers are " on the fringes of Puthukkudiyiruppu " , defence ministry spokesman Brig Udaya Nanayakkara was quoted by news agency AFP as saying .
The Tigers say they will cease fire but they will not disarm
The defence ministry said that " battlefield reports indicate intense fighting is going on in the area as troops are closing " .
Puthukkudiyiruppu is on a narrow strip of land in the north - east still controlled by the Tigers .
The government forces are advancing on the town from the south .
" Troops marching north along the western bank of the Nanthikadal lagoon have breached the earth bund built by the Tigers south of Puthukkudiyiruppu , " a defence ministry statement said .
Military officials say this is the last town the Tigers still control - after that there are only a handful of small coastal villages left .
On Monday , Brig Shavendra Silva , the 58 Division commander , told Reuters news agency the town was the " last objective " and that the end of the war could be measured in days , not weeks .
Meanwhile , the military says it is still trying to establish how the rebels managed to buy light aircraft and smuggle them onto the island to establish a rudimentary air force .

The investigation follows a surprise rebel air attack on the capital on Friday using two Czech - made planes .
One was shot down while the second crashed into a government building and exploded .
" Forensic tests are under way and we have asked the manufacturer about who owned these planes , " air force spokesman Janaka Nanayakkara said .
Civilian deaths
The Tigers have been driven from most of the territory they held by an army offensive in the past few weeks .
But the military says the offensive has slowed because of the presence of tens of thousands of civilians in the area .
Independent journalists cannot travel to the conflict zone so reports from either side cannot be verified .
On Monday , the Tigers told the United Nations they were ready to comply with international calls for a ceasefire with government forces .
But they said they would not lay down their weapons , as the government had demanded .
The government insists that this must happen before the rebels can take part in negotiations .
TamilNet says the deaths at Puthumaaththa'lan were caused by " a single artillery shell fired by troops on Tuesday morning " .
Two teenage boys were among the dead , it said .
The hospital was treating 98 injured civilians who were admitted on Sunday and Monday , TamilNet said .
About 70,000 people have died in the past 25 years in the Tigers ' fight for a separate homeland in the north and east .

All those hardware guys at Dell , HP , and Asus have been watching the development of ebook readers and have come to the same conclusions as the rest of us who are not complete idiots .
" Huh ?
You are selling a .pdf reader for $ 500 ?
You think that con is going to last ?
" People are dumb , sure , but they are also poor , especially people who like to read .
This week , at the Consumer Electronics Expo in Las Vegas , all of the big PC manufacturers unveiled their versions of the " netbook , " which is a tiny , cheap computer that is as fast as you need it to be to do everything you need to do .
Soon , people will be masturbating in bed again instead of at their desks in front of their laptops .
Netbooks fit in your jacket pocket , connect to the internet , store your shit , let you play music , and let you take pictures .
If you use Skype , they even become a phone .
Kids in the Sudan have them , and soon you will , too .
The Asus model " netbook " even has tablet , touch - screen capability , which makes it pretty damn close to being the Prodex described here .
Apple has a thousand people working on making the iPhone into one of these .
I cannot say this loud enough , Publishing Industry : proprietary ebook formats are a BAD IDEA .
I 'm not talking to you people in the corner office , squeezing your stress ball and brokering deals with one of James Patterson 's ghostwriters .
I 'm talking to you publishing interns and editorial assistants who are the future and who are surfing the internet at work , bored , wondering why you went to college .
Your masters are wasting time and money dealing with Sony and Amazon .
By working for them , you are wasting your creativity and a chance to reinvent an electronic publishing industry that is democratic , writer - driven , and is n't REVOLUTIONARY at all .
In fact , tomorrow 's publishing industry will be positively Elizabethan .
All we are going to get rid of is the corporate whip
People eat chocolate bars in pieces , waiting and savoring .
They space their cigarettes through the day , their gossip sessions , their calls to friends .
They like their sports with timeouts , and practice their religion with fasts and periods of self - denial , like Lent .
So why is it that commercial interruptions always ruin TV programs ?
Maybe they do n’t .
In two new studies , researchers who study consumer behavior argue that interrupting an experience , whether dreary or pleasant , can make it significantly more intense .
“ The punch line is that commercials make TV programs more enjoyable to watch .
Even bad commercials , ” said Leif Nelson , an assistant professor of marketing at the University of California , San Diego , and a co-author of the new research .
“ When I tell people this , they just kind of stare at me , in disbelief .
The findings are simultaneously implausible and empirically coherent . ”
Over the years , psychological research has found that people are not always so clear on what makes them happy .
When reporting on their own well - being , they exhibit a kind of equilibrium :
After a loss ( divorce , say ) or a gain ( a promotion ) , they typically return in time to about the same happiness level as before .
Humans habituate quickly , to hardship and prosperity , to war and peace .

A new study shows how the behaviour of dogs has been misunderstood for generations : in fact using misplaced ideas about dog behaviour and training is likely to cause rather than cure unwanted behaviour .
A new study shows how the behaviour of dogs has been misunderstood for generations : in fact using misplaced ideas about dog behaviour and training is likely to cause rather than cure unwanted behaviour .
The findings challenge many of the dominance related interpretations of behaviour and training techniques suggested by some TV dog trainers .
Contrary to popular belief , aggressive dogs are NOT trying to assert their dominance over their canine or human “ pack ” , according to research published by academics at the University of Bristol ’s Department of Clinical Veterinary Sciences in the Journal of Veterinary Behavior : Clinical Applications and Research .
The researchers spent six months studying dogs freely interacting at a Dogs Trust rehoming centre , and reanalysing data from studies of feral dogs , before concluding that individual relationships between dogs are learnt through experience rather than motivated by a desire to assert “ dominance ” .
The paper “ Dominance in domestic dogs – useful construct or bad habit ? ” reveals that dogs are not motivated by maintaining their place in the pecking order of their pack , as many well - known dog trainers preach .
Far from being helpful , the academics say , training approaches aimed at “ dominance reduction ” vary from being worthless in treatment to being actually dangerous and likely to make behaviours worse .
Instructing owners to eat before their dog or go through doors first will not influence the dog ’s overall perception of the relationship – merely teach them what to expect in these specific situations .
Much worse , techniques such as pinning the dog to the floor , grabbing jowls , or blasting hooters at dogs will make dogs anxious , often about their owner , and potentially lead to an escalation of aggression .
Dr Rachel Casey , Senior Lecturer in Companion Animal Behaviour and Welfare at Bristol University , said : “ The blanket assumption that every dog is motivated by some innate desire to control people and other dogs is frankly ridiculous .
It hugely underestimates the complex communicative and learning abilities of dogs .
It also leads to the use of coercive training techniques , which compromise welfare , and actually cause problem behaviours .
“ In our referral clinic we very often see dogs which have learnt to show aggression to avoid anticipated punishment .
Owners are often horrified when we explain that their dog is terrified of them , and is showing aggression because of the techniques they have used – but its not their fault when they have been advised to do so , for example by unqualified ‘ behaviourists ’ recommending such techniques . ”
At Dogs Trust , the UK ’s largest dog welfare charity , rehoming centre staff see the results of misguided dog training all the time .
Veterinary Director Chris Laurence MBE , added : “ We can tell when a dog comes in to us which has been subjected to the ‘ dominance reduction technique ’ so beloved of TV dog trainers .
They can be very fearful , which can lead to aggression towards people .
“ Sadly , many techniques used to teach a dog that his owner is leader of the pack is counter - productive ; you wo n’t get a better behaved dog , but you will either end up with a dog so fearful it has suppressed all its natural behaviours and will just do nothing , or one so aggressive it ’s dangerous to be around . ”
But we know that [ Matthew Shepard ] was killed in the commitment of a robbery .
It was n't because he was gay .
The Hate Crimes Bill was named for him , but it 's really a hoax that continues to be used as an excuse for passing these bills .
I do a lot of work with a local youth organization in town and I 'm so utterly speechless that ANYONE could be so vacuous that they could see Shepard 's senseless murder as being motivated by anything OTHER than his sexuality .

Arsenal Boss Wenger Could Have Signed Didier Drogba For £ 100k
Regrets ?
Arsene Wenger has a few - and one of them is not signing Didier Drogba seven years ago for a paltry £ 100,000 ...
It ’s been a corruption scandal worthy of its name , complete with a shootout and a sexy video showing officials cavorting with scantily clad women .
It all came to a fittingly dramatic conclusion Saturday when the man at the center of the saga tried to flee the country and Iraqi authorities ordered his plane to turn back mid-flight .
When the plane landed at Baghdad ’s airport , Abdul Falah Sudani , the country ’s trade minister until he was forced to resign last week , was promptly arrested .
Sudani is accused of procuring substandard foodstuffs for Iraq ’s food - ration program , but the allegations against his ministry go beyond that .
Omar Abdul Sattar , a member of the Iraqi parliament ’s anti-corruption committee , said the money skimmed from the program could amount to “ hundreds of millions of dollars . ”
The arrest comes as part of an intensified effort to crack down on graft .
Advertisement
Prime Minister Nouri Maliki has called for a war on corruption to equal the one on terrorism , and billboards have been posted across Baghdad proclaiming that “ corruption is the breeding ground for terrorism ” in blood - dripping letters .
Sudani is the highest - ranking former government official to be formally charged with corruption since 2006 , when a former electricity minister was accused of overseeing more than $ 1 billion worth of improperly awarded contracts .
The former minister escaped from his Green Zone jail cell in 2006 and resurfaced in Chicago .
Allegations of corruption swirl around virtually every Iraqi government department , and Iraqis are expected to pay bribes for just about every government service , from pensions to the issuance of their national identity documents .
Last year , the international watchdog group Transparency International ranked Iraq the second - most - corrupt country , behind Somalia .
Advertisement
Iraq ’s Integrity Commission , a government agency charged with investigating graft , said last week that it was planning to issue arrest warrants for 997 government officials , in addition to 387 warrants already served .
The Trade Ministry has always been particularly notorious because of its role in procuring the food rations that are still widely distributed .
Most Iraqis are familiar with lumpy sugar , flour past its expiration date and reduced quantities in their monthly rations .
The scandal erupted into public late last month when police officers who went to a Trade Ministry building to serve arrest warrants on nine officials were fired on by the ministry ’s guards .
During the 15 - minute gun battle , all but one of the wanted officials , the ministry ’s spokesman , escaped out a back door .
Two of them were Sudani ’s brothers , who were employed as guards in the ministry and are accused of skimming millions of dollars from food import contracts .
One brother was later arrested in southern Iraq ; the other is still being sought .

Then came the circulation of a video clip showing the minister ’s brother and spokesman laughing and joking as two women dance around them .
“ Maliki will sacrifice for you , ” one of the officials calls out , in a compliment to the women but an insult to the Islamist prime minister .
Sudani is a member of a branch of Maliki ’s Islamic Dawa Party and is reputed to be close to him .
Legislators summoned Sudani to appear before parliament but decided against a public airing of the video because it was deemed too racy .
In any case , it had already spread rapidly across Iraq ’s cellphone network , and eventually it surfaced on YouTube .
Sudani ’s downfall is in part attributable to the efforts of a reinvigorated Iraqi parliament under the leadership of Speaker Iyad Samarrai , who took office last month .
Legislators had been seeking to question Sudani for more than a year , but under Samarrai ’s ineffectual predecessor , the summons never materialized .
When Sudani did eventually appear before parliament , he refused to answer most of the questions put to him .
But faced with a no - confidence vote that would have forced Maliki to fire him , he resigned last week .
Legislators say they wo n’t stop with the Trade Ministry .
There are plans also to summon the ministers of oil and electricity , among others , said Sattar , the legislator .

“ Many legislators have signed petitions to host many ministers , ” he said .
“ We are just opening the door on this . ”

Binyamin Netanyahu and his Likudnik friends do not do listening .
They are like the fly in the La Fontaine fable , which buzzes around the horses ' muzzles and thinks it is moving the coach .
Flies with ideas above their station risk being swatted .
Israeli leaks suggested that at his first meeting with President Obama in Washington DC today , Netanyahu hoped , and maybe even expected , that if he just kept talking about Iran he could ignore recent Obama administration strictures .
No one can say that he was not warned .
Incremental signals from Washington have been building the case for the fly - whisk to come into operation .
Instead he was told firmly that there would be talks with Iran , rather than bombs , with " no artificial deadline , " and that the Palestine issue is crucial , with a two state solution , and : " That means that all the parties involved have to take seriously obligations that they have previously agreed to , " which is diplomatic - speak for Washington 's expectation that Netanyahu will abide by the agreements that Israel has undertaken – for example on settlements , opening the Gaza crossings , and so on .
Netanyahu 's studied refusal to mention a Palestinian state , and his anodyne prescription of two peoples living side by side , was an overtly meaningless evasion .
The Bantu and the Afrikaaners lived side by side in .
The issue was the unequal relationship between them .
Similarly , any demand that the Palestinians accept a Jewish state is a calculated attempt to halt negotiations even before they start .
Netanyahu will play up a spurious agreement between the parties on Iran .
But it will only wash for those amnesiacs who forget Israel 's furious opposition to the diplomatic path and its impatience to send in the bombers – now overturned by Obama .
Any talk about Iran , when the two men met behind closed doors , probably featured the baneful effects of any Israeli attempt to bomb its way to a solution on the several hundred thousand US personnel in the region .
Despite Israeli claims that " the Arabs " are behind any attempts to attack Iran , Obama 's team must know while some unelected Arab regimes may wish that if " ' twere done , then 't twere best it were done quickly " , neither they nor Turkey can call on any popular support for such a deal nor would they in any way want to be associated with such an attack .
If they flew over Iraq , in defiance of Baghdad 's majority Shia government , then the US 's attempts to withdraw from the country could be either precipitately accelerated or bogged down interminably
This was just the opening bout of the Netanyahu v Obama match - up , but we can expect more to come .
It is possible that Obama and his administration are lulling Netanyahu into a false sense of security and complacency , giving him enough time to reveal that he has no intention of listening to US policy .
To begin with , a more sensitive ear than Netanyahu 's might have registered the shock - horror of Washington 's assumption of an independent American foreign policy , so that Middle East statements have not been cleared with Israel first .
That was apparent in the content of those various statements , warning about settlement building , nuclear non-proliferation , about house demolitions , about the two state solution , the border closures in Gaza and indeed Washington 's warning against unilateral attacks on Iran .
In the domestic US context , Netanyahu is acting as if he puts full credence in the rumours about the infallibility of Israel 's much - vaunted " lobby " .
But the question is , which lobby ?
The peace lobby , such as J - Street and its associates , has close ties with the administration .
Aipac , the core of the Israel US lobby , has changed its leadership to include longtime supporters of Obama , and Vice President Joe Biden , a veteran pro-Israeli politician , reads Aipac the riot act .
Even Rahm Emanuel – Israeli by descent - looks as if he will be the president 's enforcer if there is any attempt by Netanyahu to turn Obama 's policies round .
A popular US president , newly elected , with a financial crisis to hand , could soon persuade American voters that there good reasons not to send scarce cash to a foreign government set on ignoring the wishes of its benefactor .
Serious signals like that would soon introduce term limits for Netanyahu 's shaky coalition .
Israeli voters tend to punish prime ministers who alienate the Americans too much .
Netanyahu brought nothing to the table – and he is leaving with nothing even if , at this stage he did not get the public dressing down that is coming his way eventually .
Perversely , having the pugnacious Netanyahu as Israel 's prime minister could burnish American credentials with everyone else in the region .
There will be a visible difference between Obama and Netanyahu , in contrast to the Clinton and Bush era negotiations – when at best the US played good cop to Israel 's bad cop , while both were actually torturing the Palestinians .
People often ask me what I did to get better .
To tell you the truth , I ’m not all that sure .
I spent much of my deep depression wandering aimlessly , completely lost , not knowing which voices to follow .
I acted on everyone ’s suggestions .
Some worked .
Others did n’t .
I compiled the exercises that made me feel better into a personally designed 12 - step mental health program , related to but different from the 12 - step program practiced by addicts and their kin .
They are ways to boost my neurotransmitters into action–getting those lazy bones passing messages from one neuron to the next–and to inspire nerve generation and cell reproduction in the amydgala and hippocampus regions of the brain .
Step One : Find the Right Doctor
Some depressives are lucky enough to find a good psychiatrist in their first visit to a head doctor .
I was n’t one of them .
I went through six–and practically gave up on all traditional medicine –before I met the seventh , who was perfect for me : she was conservative with meds ( she did n’t try a new antipsychotic every week like doctor number two ) ; well - informed on new developments of treatment ; and , using her sharp intuition , treated me as a person ( with unique personality traits and philosophies that had to be considered ) , not as a set of symptoms .
Step Two : Find the Right Cocktail
I wish I could report that my doctor waved her wand once to arrive at the magical prescription that cured me .
No , a few different faces ( six of them ) had to wave the wand 23 times before I felt any magic , or found the right cocktail .
But that ’s extreme .
Most depressives have only had to try a few different medications before feeling huge relief .
Step Three : Exercise !
As a recovering addict , I love any buzz I can get .
Working out–any exercise that gets my heart rate over 160 beats per minute ( into the cardiovascular zone ) does the job .
And in a safe way , so I do n’t have to cheat on my sobriety .
I ’m probably as addicted to exercise as I was to booze , but this is one mood - altering activity that does n’t deteriorate my marriage and my other relationships ( with my kids , with myself , and with God ) .
Some researchers say that exercise acts like antidepressants in increasing the activity of serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain ; working out releases endorphins and other hormones that reduce pain , induce euphoria , have a calming effect , and combat stress .
Step Four : Eat Well
The more I investigate–both through research and nonscientific experiments with body –the more I realize how my diet affects my mood .
Here are the bad boys : nicotine ( although I was only a social smoker , I had to give it up because smoking destroys practically every organ inside your body ) ; caffeine ( it ’s a drug , which is why I ’m addicted to it ) , alcohol ( it made me crazy ) ; white flour and processed food ( what you live on when you have preschoolers who wo n’t touch tofu and spinach ) ; and sugar ( oh man , I ’m trying , but oh man ) .
Here are the good guys : protein ( eggs , milk , cheese , yogurt , meat , fish , chicken , seeds , nuts ) ; complex starches ( whole grains , beans , potatoes ) ; vegetables ( broccoli , spinach , squash ) ; vitamins ( vitamin B- complex , vitamins E and C , and a multivitamin ) ; minerals ( magnesium , calcium , and zinc ) ; omega - 3 fatty acids .
Step Five : Sleep !
When you give birth to two insomniacs , you have to work extra hard at getting well , because regular sleep is crucial to an effective treatment of depression , and a must for maintaining a stable mood .
For a year and a half I ’ve kept a mood / sleep journal to track how my zzzzs affects my thoughts .
This is what I learned : if I slept less than seven hours , I was prone to mania , and if I slept over nine , I felt more depressed .
Alterations in sleep affect circadian rhythms , our internal biological clocks , which govern fluctuations in body temperature and the secretion of several hormones .
Step Six : Light Up
Changes in the amounts of daylight a person gets also alters circadian rhythms , which is why light treatment is so effective , especially for those who suffer from SAD ( seasonal affective disorder ) .
If I ca n’t get outside for at least a half hour a day , I try to sit under my mammoth HappyLite , a lamp with 10,000 lux .
Step Seven : Support and Friendships
I used to be a loyal support - group kind of girl .
But since I ’ve had kids , getting to meetings is much more difficult .
So I ’ve found my support in other ways–in phone calls and e-mails and visits to friends and relatives who also suffer from depression or bipolar disorder .
That lifeline kept me alive during my suicidal days , and continues to empower me every single day .
During the darker days of my depression last year , I walked around with six phone numbers in my pocket .
So to not wear out any one friend or relative , I ’d call two people a day , and rotate the numbers .
I spent hours on the phone and writing e-mails and visiting friends because I needed constant support .
Step Eight : Get Involved
Positive psychologists like University of Pennsylvania ’s Martin Seligman and Dan Baker , Ph.D. , director of the Life Enhancement Program at Canyon Ranch , believe a sense of purpose –committing oneself to a noble mission–and acts of altruism are strong antidotes to depression .
With two small children to feed and bathe , I can only save the world one very small step at a time .
However , my ministry of the day–educating people on mental health–fulfills me in a way that combats some of the blues .
Moreover , finding a way to creatively express myself –another piece of the happiness puzzle –has saved me from a meltdown on more than one occasion .
Step Nine : A Gratitude Journal
Based on her research findings , University of California psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky believes that keeping a gratitude journal–taking the time to consciously count your blessings–is one of the most effective happiness boosters .
According to psychologist Robert Emmons at the University of California at Davis , gratitude exercises improves physical health , as well –including raising energy levels and relieving pain .
Step Ten : Cognitive - Behavioral Therapy and Personal Therapy
In addition to seeing a shrink for personal therapy , I ’ve benefited immensely from cognitive - behavioral work I do on my own .
Especially helpful was “ Ten Days to Self - Esteem ” by David D. Burns , M.D. ( even though it took me eleven days … plus a few more ) .
He lists ten ways of distorted thinking , which I began to identify in my thoughts throughout the day , and fifteen techniques to untwist the distortions .
For example , if I think , “ I fail at everything , ” I can use the “ Examine the Evidence ” method to recall some things ( like eating ) at which I excel .
Step Eleven : Prayer and Meditation
Sometimes it ’s easier than other times .
And I do it in many forms–as mantras ( “ Jesus , be with me ! ” ) during my run , or a quiet ten minutes in my walk - in bedroom closet with a lit candle and a Bible verse , or singing “ Alleluia ! ” with a congregation of Catholics at church on Sunday , or meditating in lotus pose at a yoga class , or just as a vague consciousness of the divine presence as I ’m folding the laundry .
Step Twelve : Time
When steps one through eleven have failed –and I ’ve done everything I can think of but still want to be done with this life–then I simply wait , and let time do what it does best : heal .
12 Steps to Sanity
Frank Rich in yesterday ’s NY Times seems to think so , where he guts the infamous NOM video “ Gathering Storm ” and explores the movement ’s waning support in the face recent gay marriage victories in Iowa and Vermont .
Far from terrifying anyone , “ Gathering Storm ” has become , unsurprisingly , an Internet camp classic .
On YouTube the original video must compete with countless homemade parodies it has inspired since first turning up some 10 days ago .
None may top Stephen Colbert ’s on Thursday night , in which lightning from “ the homo storm ” strikes an Arkansas teacher , turning him gay .
A “ New Jersey pastor ” whose church has been “ turned into an Abercrombie & Fitch ” declares that he likes gay people , “ but only as hilarious best friends in TV and movies . ”
Yet easy to mock as “ Gathering Storm ” may be , it nonetheless bookmarks a historic turning point in the demise of America ’s anti-gay movement .
What gives the ad its symbolic significance is not just that it ’s idiotic but that its release was the only loud protest anywhere in America to the news that same - sex marriage had been legalized in Iowa and Vermont .
If it advances any message , it ’s mainly that homophobic activism is ever more depopulated and isolated as well as brain - dead .
This is the amount a jury awarded the America hating professor , Ward Churchill in his civil rights lawsuit against The University of Colorado .
Despite charges of academic misconduct “ deliberate and repeated plagiarism , falsification , and fabrication ” Churchill and his legal team turned his dismissal from CU into a First Amendment free speech issue .
Maybe I do n’t quite understand how tenure is supposed to work , but this idea that someone is entitled to a job regardless of how his or her actions damage the reputation of his or her employer ( CU in this case ) is asinine .
Ward Churchill ’s firing is not a First Amendment issue but a freedom of association issue ( in this case , CU decided to discontinue its association with the professor ) .
The First Amendment protects speech from government reprisals .
I suppose one could argue that Churchill ’s employer was the State of Colorado ( a wonderful example for why all higher learning institutions should be privately owned , operated , and funded ) and therefore , was a government reprisal .
Local Denver attorneys and talk show hosts Dan Caplis and Craig Silverman point out that Churchill took an oath pursuant to Colorado State law to uphold the U.S. Constitution .
From their legal point - of - view , Churchill violated this oath when he encouraged students ( on multiple occasions ) to commit acts of violence against private and government institutions as well as private citizens .
How can Churchill take an oath to a constitution he finds illegal and immoral , violate that oath , and still have legal grounds to remain employed by the State ?
Beyond this , university speech codes , politically correct as they are , how is it possible to say that one professor could be legitimately fired for violating the prevailing P.C. orthodoxy while Churchill is entitled to a job despite praising the OKC bombing and the 9/11 terrorist attacks ?
Caplis , on his radio show , pointed out that if Churchill had said , for example , that female students on the CU campus deserved to be raped ; his career would be over ( and rightfully so ) .
Few would be claiming his First Amendment rights were being violated by CU if these were his words .
Ward Churchill may not deserve to be prosecuted for his hateful speech but he does n’t have the “ right ” to teach at CU either .
To Mr. Churchill I would just like to say the following :
Congratulations on your $ 1 civil rights victory ( which you do not deserve ) ; do n’t spend it all in one place … asshole !
Spitzentreffen zum Datenschutz : Schäuble gegen Spähverbot
Innenminister Schäuble will das Ausspähen von Mitarbeitern nicht gesetzlich untersagen und mahnt , Korruptionsbekämpfung nicht zu diskreditieren .
Gewerkschaften und Datenschützer plädieren für ein generelles Verbot .
BERLIN dpa Nach den Datenaffären bei Bahn und Telekom wird der Ruf nach einem Verbot des Ausspähens von Arbeitnehmern lauter .
Bundesinnenminister Wolfgang Schäuble ( CDU ) sprach sich zwar gegen so ein Verbot aus , schloss aber strengere Regeln für mehr Datenschutz nicht aus .
Sollte sich dringender Handlungsbedarf ergeben , müsse ein Gesetz noch in dieser Legislaturperiode auf den
Weg gebracht werden , sagte er vor einem Spitzentreffen zum Datenschutz an diesem Montag dem Tagesspiegel .
Der Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund ( DGB ) und die Gewerkschaft Verdi forderten ein generelles Verbot der Überwachung von Arbeitnehmern .
Bestimmte Ausnahmen sollten aber zugelassen werden .
" Dann ist der Rechtsbereich übersichtlich " , sagte Verdi-Chef Frank Bsirske in der ARD .
" Für Ausnahmefälle muss es klare Bedingungen geben " , sagte der DGB - Vorsitzende Michael Sommer im RBB .
Das Gesetz müsse klarstellen , was der Arbeitgeber auf gar keinen Fall dürfe .
Der Bundesdatenschutzbeauftragte Peter Schaar forderte im Bayerischen Rundfunk verschärfte Sanktionen in einem neuen Gesetz .
Es dürfe in Zukunft nicht mehr so weit kommen wie bei der Bespitzelung der Mitarbeiter durch die Bahn .
Schaar warf der Bundesregierung vor , dieses Thema aus Rücksicht auf die Wirtschaft zu zögerlich angegangen zu sein .
" Jetzt zeigt sich aber , dass das ein Fehler war . "
Schäuble machte dagegen neuere Techniken dafür verantwortlich , dass das Thema jetzt ansteht .
" Der Fortschritt in der Datentechnik der letzten Jahre hat ganz wesentlich dazu geführt , dass Untersuchungen zur Korruptionsbekämpfung heute zu Problemen führen , die es früher gar nicht gab . "
Der Kampf gegen Korruption dürfe jetzt aber auch nicht völlig diskreditiert werden , sagte der Minister .
Im Einzelnen forderte Schaar besonderen Schutz von Bewerberdaten bei Einstellungstests sowie eine generell eine Zweckbindung von Daten .
" Daten , die für bestimmte Zwecke im Arbeitsverhältnis erhoben worden sind , dürfen nur für diese Zwecke und nicht beispielsweise auch zu Überwachungszwecken verwendet werden " , forderte er im RBB .
Die Arbeitgeber halten die bestehenden Vorschriften im Grundsatz für ausreichend .
Überprüft werden solle aber der konzerninterne Austausch von Personaldaten , sagte der Hauptgeschäftsführer der Bundesvereinigung der Deutschen Arbeitgeberverbände , Reinhard Göhner , im SWR .
Der FDP - Innenexperte Max Stadler sprach sich dagegen für ein Datenschutzgesetz für Arbeitnehmer aus .
" Da wir jetzt laufend überrascht wurden , in renommierten Unternehmen noch dazu , ist der Gesetzgeber am Zug " , sagte Stadler im NDR .
Nach der massenhaften Datenerhebung bei Bahn und Telekom wollte Schäuble das Problem am Montag mit Arbeitsminister Olaf Scholz ( SPD ) , Wirtschaftsminister Karl - Theodor zu Guttenberg ( CSU ) , dem Datenschutzbeauftragten sowie den Spitzen von Gewerkschaften und Arbeitgebern besprechen .
Robert Morris started his own private foundation in the early 1990s to funnel money to private schools , churches and hospitals .
But as the years went on , running it became a hassle .
There were annual tax forms , and Mr. Morris , now 56 years old , often had to chase down letters from charities assuring him they had received his grants .
He paid at least $ 2,000 annually in fees to lawyers and accountants .
And he found it increasingly difficult to diversify his foundation 's investments with only about $ 100,000 in assets .
So ...
If you 're one of those people who believes that US commercial radio sucks , a new study from the Future of Music Coalition ( FMC ) provides some empirical support as to just how it sucks .
Despite vowing to change its ways , big radio programmers are amazingly conservative ; much of the music they play comes from major labels , and it tends to be older ( and well - known ) material .
Not even government consent decrees have been able to change that .
With the major labels currently pushing hard to make radio stations pay ( more ) to play music , it 's easy to forget that only two years ago , the two groups were caught up in a big payola scandal — that is , the labels were paying the stations to push particular songs .
After New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and the FCC both shut down the practice , the radio stations agreed to all sorts of things , including $ 12.5 million in fines and a " set- aside " of 4,200 programming hours for independent artists .
So did anything change after the deals ?
FMC analyzed playlists from 2005 to 2008 and concluded that there has been " no measurable change in station playlist composition over the past four years . "
Around 85 percent of radio music comes from the major labels now , just as it did before the investigations .
If you want your indie rock , your best bet is n't to flip through the dial but to hit the Internet , where Pandora , eMusic , and Last.fm offer up everything from the craziest Animal Collective noisemaking to Tom Waits , Josh Ritter , and Arcade Fire .
FMC does n't chalk this up to continued payola .
Instead , the data " reinforce the notion made earlier that major labels ' longstanding relationships with radio , and their tacit promise to devote additional resources to a release ( tour support , retail placement , ads , sponsorships ) incentivizes radio to play their songs more frequently than those of indie labels . "
But the resistance to indies clearly comes out of a more general resistance to risk , too .
When FMC analyzed national playlists from Adult Contemporary , Urban Adult Contemporary , and AAA Commercial radio in 2008 , it found that " almost 50 percent of the airplay was of songs released prior to 1999 . "
In other words , new songs are n't just competing with other new songs ; they are also competing with the biggest hits of the past .
Together , these trends have produced the " cookie - cutter formats " that we see across many US radio stations .
Even though independent music accounts for 30 percent of the US music market , it is woefully underrepresented on mainstream radio .
This strategy , however artistically bankrupt it was , at least made a certain kind of sense when the cash was rolling in .
But programming conservatism and centralization have n't saved radio mega - owner Clear Channel from significant job cuts this week , most of them coming in programming at small and mid-sized markets .
This is exactly what FMC does n't want to happen , instead suggesting that radio's ability to thrive hangs on being " live and local . "
To many station owners , though , " live and local " translates to " expensive and risky , " and it's not as though national programming is somehow automatically bad ( the excellent " Sound Opinions " radio show , recorded here in Chicago for NPR , illustrates the point ) .
But the FMC study does make clear that if you want your indie rock , your best bet is n't to flip through the dial but to hit the Internet , where Pandora , eMusic , and Last . fm offer up everything from the craziest Animal Collective noisemaking to Tom Waits , Josh Ritter , and Arcade Fire .
However , if Jim & Kath 's Morning Drivetime Music Blast ( featuring K - Dog and the Wolfman ) is your sort of thing ... well , mainstream radio will continue to deliver .
DETROIT ( Reuters ) -
More than half of the top U.S. auto parts suppliers could file for bankruptcy protection in 2009 with at least one million job losses , according to a study by global consultants A.T. Kearney .
Those suppliers , which ship parts directly to automakers , are pressured from above by production cuts by the automakers and from below by increasingly fragile companies that supply them with components , the study found .
The survey encompassed 60 top North American auto parts suppliers , but did not name any of the suppliers .
It was compiled through interviews with senior executives at suppliers in the United States .
The U.S. government has pledged up to $ 5 billion to aid financially stressed auto parts makers that are crucial to General Motors Corp and Chrysler .
Chrysler , about 80 percent controlled by Cerberus Capital Management , and GM have accepted $ 17.4 billion of emergency government loans and are looking for an additional $ 22 billion .
Ford Motor
Co , which has not sought emergency government assistance , said on Thursday that it was not participating in the supplier relief program at this time .
“ Absent significant financial assistance from the government , we are headed toward a scenario that is going to be 50 percent or more of the supply base going through bankruptcy , ” Doug Harvey , an A.T. Kearney partner in its automotive practice in Detroit , told Reuters in an interview .
A.T. Kearney looked at three scenarios for the supply base .
The other two scenarios include a “ soft landing ” resulting in 35 percent of the companies restructuring in bankruptcy and a “ pessimistic ” reading pushing that to 70 percent or more with many liquidations .
The “ soft - landing scenario ” looks more like “ wishful thinking ” at this point , with the industry heading more toward the middle ground and leaning toward pessimistic , Harvey said .
“ To whatever extent the government provides relief to prevent them from going into bankruptcy , that number goes down , ” Harvey said .
In each scenario , the study found that suppliers faced increased risk of bankruptcy through 2010 .
U.S. auto parts makers have come under increasing financial pressure in recent months with steep production cuts by their customers starting toward the end of 2008 that have severely constrained revenue from the beginning of the year .
Auto sales have slumped for more than three years , but the declines accelerated as the recession deepened last year and monthly rates have plunged to the lowest levels in 27 years .
The study found that the larger suppliers expect up to 23 percent of the smaller companies that supply them with parts to face financial distress within a year .
Most of those smaller companies are privately held and do not disclose their finances publicly , making it difficult to probe the depths of the stresses in the vast supply base .
However , data from Sageworks , which compiles information on private companies , highlighted the stress on these smaller suppliers .
Double - digit sales growth in the 2004 to 2005 period had all but disappeared by 2008 , and a $ 15,600 profit per employee in 2005 turned to a $ 13,600 loss , according to Sageworks .
Harvey sees the administration ’s announcement of support for suppliers , coming even before it makes recommendations on GM and Chrysler , as reinforcing the immediate needs of the supply sector to avoid mass bankruptcies .
“ This is the lifeline to keep that from happening until a broader solution can emerge , ” Harvey said .
“ I do n’t expect we would see that until the complete analysis of the GM and Chrysler applications are complete . ”
Better yet , about half of HD radio stations are taking advantage of multicasting : separate , different FM broadcasts  shadow channels  beamed out on the same frequency .
They permit radio stations to experiment with niche , experimental and even interactive programming , usually commercial - free .
WCBS - HD , an oldies station in New York , for example , has two shadow HD channels : one playing ’ 80s hits and one that ’s a better - sounding version of the AM news channel .
And get this : all HD radio broadcasts are free .
Take that , $ 13 - a - month satellite !
O.K. , so if HD radio offers so much and costs so little , how come nobody ’s heard of it ?
How come fewer than a million people have tuned in ?
One reason : confusion .
It took years for the public to grasp satellite radio  and now we ’re trying to sell people on yet another kind of radio ?
( The name does n’t help .
According to hdradio.com , HD does not stand for high definition ; “ it is simply the branding language for this new technology . ” )
Those cool shadow channels are confusing , too .
You have to tune in the primary channel first .
On some radio models , a “ multicast ” icon appears on the screen , if shadow channels are available .
Then you hit the up / down tuning buttons to find the multicast channel .
Try explaining that to Granddad .
HD radio also requires an HD radio receiver .
Or , as HD radio ’s tagline puts it , “ If you do n’t have an HD radio , you ’re not hearing HD radio . ”
( Is that an advertisement  or a disclaimer ? )
Image Among the receivers for HD radio is the Sony XDR - S10HDiP , which is also an iPod dock .
These radios are n’t especially expensive , but the setup can be intimidating to Mr. and Mrs. Average Person .
Tabletop HD radios go for $ 75 and up .
Thirteen car companies , mostly small ones , offer option packages that include HD radios .
You can add an HD receiver to your existing car , too ( $ 200 and up ) .
There are no pocket HD radios .
Any time I take the crock in the car , it spills , so they need some lock lid mechanism .
I , personally , love my crock pot and use it all the time for pot roast , whole chicken soup , chillis , stews and more .
I love that I can load anything in there and come back in a few hours and have a great meal .
My only complaint is they are a bitch to clean up .
With Obama taking steps to assure medical marijuana dispensaries do n’t endure so much fed hasslin ’ , us “ buddies ” are crossing our resin tinged fingers in hopes of a world where we do n’t have to lie about having medical conditions in order to get affordable , lab grown weed ( “ Uh , I have stress and stuff ... ” ) .
That green day is a long way off , but when it comes , the marijuana community will sadly wave a collective goodbye to the eclectic mix of independent pot dealers who have thus far supplied us functioning stoners with the goods .
No longer able to compete with the convenience and quality of regulated weed , these mom and pop holders will disseminate into the general populace , marking the end of an era .
So in the spirit of pre-nostalgia , a salute to those with the baggies , the scales , and the “ killer White Rhino , special from my guy up north ” : Chill Seeker Perhaps the most accommodating of the bunch , this dealer will always have a DVD running in the background ; usually something agreeable , like The Office .
Standing up to greet you , he will treat you like an old friend , insisting you stay a while to play Wii with him .
Beside a spotless , reasonably sized bong sits a carton of blueberries from Trader Joe ’s , letting you know this guy has all his pot ducks in a row .
Frat Brotherman
For some reason every frat has a pot dealer who defies commonly held stereotypes about the fraternity lifestyle .
A shared room constantly hazed in smoke has relaxed this dude ’s natural tendency to circle jerk and gang rape .
Instead , he has become a master at hanging out , usually in socks when you arrive , practicing a few chords beneath a huge Bob Marley flag .
Sadly , he will either graduate sooner or later , or the frat will get shut down once the meth lab in the basement blows up .
Precious Jade Sleek , serious , and Asian , this guy means business .
He ’ll never answer when you call , but he ’ll call back seconds later from a different cell phone .
Like a fine smelling ninja , he ’ll appear to you in his suped - up Mitsubishi .
Invoking the wisdom of the ancients , Precious Jade ’s minimalist ways will make you feel clean and respectable .
Engaging him in small talk is a fruitless endeavor , as all that needs to be said is written on his taut , emotionless face , and the way his tiny , soft hands manifest your wares like a gift from a small mountain farm in Osaka .
Resist the urge to bow .
Shady Shoes
You do n’t want to go to this guy if you can avoid it .
He never makes eye contact , weighs out your 1/8th in a separate room , and calls you three different wrong names in the span of ten minutes .
All the windows are blacked out with old movie posters from his days working at the Arclight , and you might catch a glimpse of his speechless drug hoochie listlessly wandering the shadowed halls .
If he wants you to go with him to " re-up , " do n’t go .
Who do you buy pot from ?

Mark , Erastes , and Alex ( among others ) had their Amazon sales rankings removed over the last few days for The Filly , Transgressions and False Colours respectively .
On enquiring about this , Mark was told the following :
In consideration of our entire customer base , we exclude " adult " material from appearing in some searches and best seller lists .
Since these lists are generated using sales ranks , adult materials must also be excluded from that feature .
Hence , if you have further questions , kindly write back to us .

Please note that just before this , Erastes ' Transgressions and Alex's False Colours were topping out the rankings .
Also note that " The Filly " is a YA Books , and therefore I would suggest one of the more important books to have out there for kids questioning their identity , and Transgressions and False Colours are being shelved with the Romance section of Barnes and Noble .
Though as Mark points out , that is of no fucking importance because this is homophobic bias pure and simple .
I have no idea what to do about this except spread the message .
If anyone has any ideas on what to do , tell me .
Because I am not letting this lie .
As vashtan said , they are happy to take the money , but not happy to give these books the recognition they rightly deserve .
Chris .
PS .
Not linking to these books on Amazon , for obvious reasons .
If people would give me other sites on which to buy them , will amend the post .

Also note that " The Filly " is a YA Books , and therefore I would suggest one of the more important books to have out there for kids questioning their identity , and Transgressions and False Colours are being shelved with the Romance section of Barnes and Noble .
Though as Mark points out , that is of no fucking importance because this is homophobic bias pure and simple .
I have no idea what to do about this except spread the message .
If anyone has any ideas on what to do , tell me .
Because I am not letting this lie .
As vashtan said , they are happy to take the money , but not happy to give these books the recognition they rightly deserve .
Chris .
PS . Not linking to these books on Amazon , for obvious reasons .
If people would give me other sites on which to buy them , will amend the post .

UPDATES :
• Friend says Ottawa Deputy Ryan Huizenga also deserves support during investigation of shooting of GVSU student Derek Copp
• Shooting of Grand Valley student Derek Copp could be career - ender for Ottawa sheriff 's Deputy Ryan Huizenga , who faces criminal charge in case
5:55 p.m. UPDATE
GEORGETOWN TOWNSHIP --
An Ottawa County sheriff 's deputy faces a charge of careless discharge of a weapon causing injury or death in the March 11 shooting of Grand Valley State University student Derek Copp .
Deputy Ryan Huizenga has been placed on unpaid administrative leave after he was charged today by the Kalamazoo County prosecutor , which authorized the high misdemeanor charges following an investigation by the Michigan State Police , according to Ottawa County Undersheriff Greg Steigenga .
Kalamazoo County Prosecutor Jeffrey Fink said he expects Huizenga to be arraigned in Hudsonville District Court next week .
The charge has a maximum penalty of two years behind bars and while it is a misdemeanor , Huizenga will be able to have a probable cause hearing , most likely in Hudsonville District Court .
The case then could go to Ottawa County Circuit Court in Grand Haven if there is a trial , according to Fink .

When asked if Huizenga had cooperated with the investigation , Fink said Huizenga did talk to an investigator .
Copp was shot at his off - campus apartment in Georgetown Township when police entered through a rear sliding door on a drug search warrant , and the unarmed Copp was shot once in the chest .
He has been in and out of the hospital , recovering from his injuries .
The state police investigation alleged that officers were acting on a legitimate warrant regarding illegal drug sales .
Copp has not been charged with any crime .
Copp 's father , George Copp , did not want to discuss the charges , and referred a reporter to his attorney .
Of his son's condition , he said : " He certainly could be better . "
Attorney Frederick Dilley , representing Grand Valley State University student Derek Copp , reacted this afternoon to charges filed against an Ottawa County sheriff 's Deputy Ryan Huizenga .
" We are pleased with the very rapid and thorough investigation and review by the Michigan State Police and Prosecutor 's Office .
This is a tragedy for all involved , and Derek looks forward to getting life back to normal as soon as possible . "
Fink said there is no proof there was any intent to harm Copp on the officer 's part , but the state police investigation showed the gun was discharged in a reckless , negligent or careless manner .
Fink said the officers were knocking at the slider when Copp came to the door and moved a curtain .
It appears a light from someone outside may have caused Copp to raise his arm , after which the shot was fired .
" Officers go through extensive training with their weapons , " said Fink , adding a charge like this against an officer is unusual .
Fink expects his office will handle the case as it moves through Ottawa County courts .
Huizenga , a 12 - year police veteran , was working with the West Michigan Enforcement Team when the shooting occurred .
Matt VanLiere , president of Ottawa County Deputy Sheriff 's Association , said : " I think we need an opportunity to digest what has happened " with the charges being filed .

During the presidential election , American voters did not rally around Ron Paul .
Instead , establishment stooge John McCain won the Republican nomination .
But the events of the past 12 months have made thing one thing abundantly clear :
It looks like Ron Paul was right after all .
America ’s financial system is totally collapsing , dozens of banks and insurance companies have failed this year , General Motors is on the verge of bankruptcy , the U.S. government is running up a record budget deficit , the borders are wide open , hatred for the United States is at an all - time high around the world and the individual liberties of ordinary Americans have been eroded as never before .
Ron Paul warned America about all of these things , but Americans chose not to listen .
Let ’s take a look at some of the reasons why Ron Paul was right …
1 ) Ron Paul said that if we continued to run our economy on runaway government spending , endless amounts of debt and the insanity of letting the Federal Reserve control our currency then eventually the United States economy would crash .
Did that not happen ?
But neither party is seeking to end this orgy of debt .
Instead both parties pushed the “ Wall Street bailout ” and both parties seem determined to spend even more money .
Unfortunately , Ron Paul is one of the only members of Congress that is willing tell the truth .
Check out this very short 3 minute video where he tells it like it is :
The reality is that the vast majority of U.S Senators and congressmen refuse to confront the Federal Reserve .
Ron Paul is one of the only members of Congress that will openly confront Fed officials .
In the video posted below , Congressman Ron Paul openly confronts Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke about globalist plans to replace the dollar with a new global reserve currency :
2 ) Ron Paul said that the United States cannot police the world .
If we bomb countries into oblivion , invade them and torture everyone in sight then people around the world are going to hate America .
Did that not happen ?
But neither party is seeking to end the wars .
Instead Obama is promising to keep troops in Iraq for at least 18 more months , and he is promising to send tens of thousands more troops to Afghanistan and he has talked about how we may need to send troops into Pakistan and Sudan .
3 ) Ron Paul said that if we passed the “ Patriot Act ” and these other fascist police state pieces of legislation that we would lose our individual liberties .
Did that not happen ?
But neither party is taking any action to repeal the Patriot Act .
In fact , Obama seems quite content with continuing the police state policies of the Bush administration .
“ The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is . ”
- Ronald Reagan ( 1975 )
When will people start listening to Ron Paul ?
Ron Paul recently appeared on FOX News with Neil Cavuto to discuss the latest bailout package .
The following are a few key quotes from that interview :
“ When companies get too big and make mistakes they should fail . ”
“ We ’re propping up all the bad mistakes . ”
“ Governments ca n’t make the correct decisions .
They are n’t smart enough . ”
“ This whole idea that Washington are genuises … that they can do central economic planning .
In this country we do n’t call it socialism we call it interventionism and a planned economy . ”
Below is the video of that interview :
But is anyone listening ?
No .
Obama and his advisers seem determined to take us even further down the road of big government , big spending , bailouts and socialism .
So is there any hope for the future ?
What we could really use is a reformed Republican Party led by Ron Paul that would embrace a platform of smaller government , less taxation , abolishing the Federal Reserve , returning our individual freedoms and liberties and protecting our nation ’s borders and sovereignty .
Do things have to get even worse before America will listen to Ron Paul ?
Posted below is an excerpt from a recent edition of Congressman Ron Paul ’s “ weekly straight talk ” :
“ We will face more tough economic problems during this new administration .
In fact , the worst is yet to come .
A vast amount of problematic mortgages have not begun to reset their variable interest rates and go into default .
We already have unprecedented deficits , spending is out of control , and more big industries are coming to government with their hands out .
My hope is that this administration will handle this economic crisis better than the interventionists and big government spenders of the 1930 ’s , the bureaucrats that prolonged the Depression .
I hope that new government programs and spiderwebs of red tape do not pop up to interfere with American productivity , and that we can quickly get our financial footing again .
We have to understand that an economic correction needs to take place and the only way out of the coming recession is to go through it .
Efforts to avoid it can only prolong it .
I hope we can somehow find our way back to sound money and reject corporate cronyism ” .
If the American people will just wake up then perhaps the movement that Ron Paul has begun can give us hope for the future :
The Million Mom March is an anti gun organization that is closely affiliated with the Brady Campaign .
They advance their anti gun rights agenda through the unfair indoctrination of young children who will soon be voters , and their propaganda laden website .
A visitor to LearnAboutGuns.com sent me an email asking me to address some of their anti gun statements point by point , and I ’m happy to oblige :
The Million Mom March ’s Statement of Beliefs
1. all Americans have the right to be safe from gun violence in their homes , neighborhoods , schools , and places of work and worship .
2. all children have the right to grow up in environments free from the threat of gun violence .
These first two statements are nice ideals , and like all rational people , I certainly do n’t wish to see violence .
However there are a couple problems with these statements : they focus on “ gun violence , ” when in fact there is no such thing .
Instead , there is just “ violence , ” perpetrated by criminals who are just as willing and able to use knives , cars , home improvement tools , fire , acid , and their bare hands to injure and murder innocent people .
Murder has been around since long before guns , and it is the intentional actions of humans that cause murder , not the presence of guns .
Now , take into account the fact that those who live in violence plagued neighborhoods are surrounded by criminals who will and do ignore a gun ban , just as they ignore the laws against selling drugs and murdering people .
As such , gun bans just ensures that the law abiding victims are defenseless against those still - armed criminals .
3. gun violence is a public health crisis that harms not only the physical , but also the spiritual , social , and economic health of our families and communities .
Once again , we have focus placed upon the gun , rather than the criminal who wields it .
When a drunk driver misuses a car and kills an innocent person , we do n’t blame cars .
When a violent person misuses a rope to hang an innocent person , we do n’t blame ropes .
When a criminal uses a hammer to beat an innocent person to death , we do n’t blame hammers .
Just like each of the aforementioned tools , guns can be used for good or bad purposes , and it is the intent of the person using the gun that matters .
Guns in the hands of law abiding citizens stop rapes , stop murders , stop robberies , stop beatings , stop home invasions , stop racist attackers , and otherwise allow innocent people to defend themselves against violent criminals .
I would also like to note that many , many more people die from preventable causes of death than the misuse of guns .
Preventable car accidents are responsible for more than twice as many deaths each year in the USA than all the negligent shootings and criminal gun uses combined .
While stopping criminals from committing murder with a gun or any other tool is very difficult , bordering impossible , improving vehicle safety and road safety could easily save thousands of lives , as could better enforcement of traffic laws .
Many times more people also die of cancer from tobacco use or second hand smoke , and these deaths could also be easily prevented .
4. the availability and lethality of guns make death or severe injury more likely in domestic violence , criminal activity , suicide attempts , and unintentional shootings .
Domestic violence offenders tend to be males , who are usually physically stronger than the women they are abusing .
As such , these offenders are more than capable of murdering , beheading , setting on fire , or otherwise harming their victims , without a gun .
Moreover , the kind of person who is willing to commit domestic violence crimes is not going to be deterred by the less severely punished laws prohibiting gun possession .
On the other hand , gun ownership can greatly benefit women , especially those who are victims of domestic violence .
This woman stopped her husband from allegedly trying to kill her and the rest of her family .
This armed woman used her gun to stop a violent ex who broke into her home and cornered her in her bedroom .
This armed woman was able to defend herself against a rapist who came back to rape her for a second time in a week .
This armed woman stopped an attacker who tried to ambush her .
The same basic arguments apply to rebut the Million Mom March ’s arguments about criminal activity .
The fact is that criminal who want guns will get them , whether they steal them from the police , smuggle them into the country , or make guns themselves .
Gun restrictions just leave the crime victims unable to defend themselves .
Regarding suicide , gun restrictions have been shown to be ineffective at reducing suicides , and the highest suicide rates can be found in countries like Japan , which have incredibly strict gun control laws .
Basically , a person who wishes to end their life will find a way to do so , whether or not there is a gun around .
Also , even if , just for the sake of argument , gun restrictions did reduce suicides , that would not justify such restrictions .
That is because it is wrong to prevent the non-suicidal members of society from defending themselves against criminals , just for some marginal reduction in the ability of suicidal individuals to easily kill themselves .
Finally , unintentional shootings are entirely preventable if a few simple gun safety rules are followed and / or guns are stored responsibly .
It is only when more than one of these rules are broken that a negligent shooting occurs .
Note that these type of unintentional shootings tend to occur in areas with gun bans , such as Chicago , because the people who are ( illegally ) using the guns were never taught about gun safety or safe gun storage .
That is why the NRA and other pro gun groups advocate teaching children about gun safety , so that if a child does find a gun , they will know not to play with it .
It is also worth noting that children who are taught to shoot from a young age under responsible adult supervision are less likely to misuse guns than children who are not taught to shoot .
5. it is possible to reduce the number of deaths and injuries caused by gun violence with reasonable , common sense policy .
Firstly , the Million Mom March advocates restrictions on gun ownership that are anything but reasonable or “ common sense . ”
It advocates a total ban on handgun ownership , despite the fact that handguns are used every minute of every day by Americans to defend themselves against criminals .
The Million Mom Mach advocates a ban on so - called “ assault weapons ” despite the fact that such a ban targets guns that are rarely used by criminals , while taking safey features out of the hands of law abiding people .
I could go on , but the point should be clear :
The Million Mom March wants nothing short of a total ban on lawful civilian gun ownership , and is attempting to bring about this goal by slowly whittling away at gun rights .
Secondly , passing more laws wo n’t solve the problem of violence , since criminals by definition do n’t obey the law .
As discussed above , criminals can get a gun illegally , bypassing background checks and gun control laws .
We ca n’t keep drugs out of criminals hands , and stopping criminals from having guns is an even tougher challenge .
Gun control laws only serve to make self defense more difficult for the law abiding members of society , who then face the still - armed criminals .
As an example , look at the United Kingdom , where gun related crime rose dramatically after a handgun ban was enacted .
Finally , even if it were possible to magically make guns vanish , criminals would still commit murder , just with another tool .
That is because it is the desire on the part of a criminal to kill , not the presence of a gun , that leads to murder .
A couple of examples where criminals have been willing to use knives instead of guns to commit their crimes when guns temporarily became harder to easily find : Crime statistics from New York City show that fatal stabbings are up 50 % , at at time when gun-related crime is down somewhat , likely due to a series of successful police operations targeting illegal gun traffickers .
Similarly , stabbing of juveniles in Britain rose over 70 % following the institution of their gun ban , showing once again that criminals can use other tools to commit their crimes .
The Million Mom March ’s Use of Crime Victims for Propaganda
Million Mom March Chapters work to actively and appropriately incorporate the authentic experiences of victims and survivors into the movement to prevent firearm injury and death .
As mothers and others , the Million Mom March Chapters are called to responsible action for remembering victims , such as creating a victim ’s memorial ( garden , wall ) or a commemorative activity ( bell ringing , vigils ) .
Chapters across the country link with individuals who have been touched by gun violence in order that these important voices are provided the opportunity to impact life saving policies at local , state , and national levels .
Basically , the Million Mom March is really saying that they exploit the suffering of crime victims to fight against gun rights .
Instead of trying to take away the right of law abiding citizens to own the best self defense tool , crime victims and their families should focus their activism on the underlying causes of crime , and our legal system that gives violent offenders only a slap on the wrist , before letting them out of jail to victimize more people .
This aspect of the Million Mom March reminds me of the case of Pat Regan , a British woman whose son was shot to death by a criminal .
Rather than recognizing that criminals ignore gun control , and that banning guns leaves the law abiding members of society defenseless , Pat Regan set out to ban guns .
She and like minded people were quite successful , and law abiding British people lost the right to have a gun for self defense or other lawful purposes .
Pat Regan , disarmed like the rest of the UK ’s law abiding people , was then fatally stabbed in her own home , defenseless against her knife - wielding killer .
Perhaps if she had a gun , she would still be alive .
The Million Mom March on Concealed Carry
[ On their website , the Million Mom March discusses several dozen cases , spanning about 15 years of time , in which criminals who somehow got a concealed carry permit committed a crime of some sort ( ranging from driving on a suspended license to murder ) .
The attempt is to imply that all or most concealed carry permit holders are dangerous law breakers . ]
There are quite a few flaws with this attempt to portray concealed carry permit holders as a danger to society .
Firstly , many of the offenses that they list include things like driving on a suspended license .
While this is certainly a crime , it has nothing to do with a concealed carry permit or violent crime .
Adding in such offenses to their list is simply an attempt at padding the list to make it seem longer .
Secondly , the statistics show that concealed carry permit holders are more law abiding than the average citizen , negating the Million Mom March ’s attempt to cast such individuals in a negative light .
Even in the rare instance when a concealed carry permit holder commits a crime , it is not the concealed carry permit that was the problem .
Instead , the fact is that a person bent on murder will be quite willing to carry a gun and go shoot someone , with or without a permit to carry that gun .
Simply look to Chicago , where handguns are banned , and concealed carry is illegal state - wide , yet there is no shortage of criminals carrying guns and shooting innocent people .
Finally , there are literally millions of people who hold concealed carry permits , so the misdeeds of a few dozen over 15 years is trivial in comparison .
This is especially true when I can point to more real - life examples from the last year when concealed carry has saved a citizen , than they could find of concealed carry abuse in 15 years ( and note that I only write about a tiny fraction of such self defense gun uses that occur ) .
Remember , Americans defend themselves with a gun about every 13 seconds , allowing guns to save many more lives than are lost .

This post is part of a series in which I try to explain everything I learned at GDC ’09 .
In it , I over Jim Van Verth ‘s talk on affine transformations .
I had hoped to get this post done a week ago , but I was n’t confident in my understanding of the subject matter , so I took some time to research it independently .
So , caveat lector : although I ’m a math guy , I ’m not a 3D graphics expert .
I linked to the references I used at the end of this article , and I encourage you to take a look at some of them .
However , the fact that I learned this recently could be a good thing ; it ’s always easier to teach things you just learned .
People who ’ve known a thing for years have totally internalized it and do n’t know what it was like to hear it for the first time .
What is an affine transformation ?
It ’s a way of changing the size , shape , and / or position of an object in a 2D or 3D scene .
Affine transforms are not the only kinds of transforms ; they have some special properties .
If three points were on a line before an affine transform , they will still be collinear after it .
The same holds true for four points on a plane .
If two lines were parallel before an affine transform , they will be afterwards .
An affine transformation is a function that takes a vector or point and returns another vector or point .
To transform an entire shape , just apply it to all the vectors and points in the shape .
I struggled with deciding when to introduce equations in this article .
I decided to put them at the end , so that I can motivate them with concepts first .
The trade - off is that it ’s going to sound a little weird when I talk about composing transforms , because I ’ll have to split it between the two sections .
Luckily , they ’re both pretty short ..
Why use affine transforms ?
Objects in a 3D scene are stored in memory somewhere with their own local coordinate system .
To be in the right relative positions when the scene is rendered , they need to be moved , rotated , and sometimes scaled .
What kinds of affine transformations are there ?
Translations , rotations , scales , reflections , and shears .
All but shears are easy to imagine and describe , which is convenient because shears are “ the bad one ” that usually only happen by accident .
A translation move objects around without rotating them or changing their sizes .
It ’s a rigid body transform , meaning it could be performed on a rigid object , like a brick , in the real world .

It ’s a rigid body transform , meaning it could be performed on a rigid object , like a brick , in the real world .
A scale increase or decrease the size of objects .
It can just make an object bigger , or stretch it in just one direction , or any combination of those .
It ’s not a rigid body transform , because you ca n’t stretch bricks .

A rotation does just what you ’d think ; rotates an object .
It ’s a rigid body transform .
It only rotates objects around the origin ; to rotate objects around other points , you have to first translate the object , rotate it , then translate it back .
I ’ll go into that later .

A reflection is a mirror - image .
It swaps left and right or up and down .
It ’s not a rigid body transform .
Another way to think of it is as a negative scale ; it ’s what you ’d get if you squash something down to zero and stretch it back out again in the other direction .

Another way to think of it is as a negative scale ; it ’s what you ’d get if you squash something down to zero and stretch it back out again in the other direction .
A shear is a non-uniform translation .
When you apply one to an object , the effect is visually similar to slanting .
It ’s not a rigid body transform .
You rarely want these in computer graphics .
How do you compose them ?
By applying one and then applying the next .
There are only two things to say about composing before looking at the math .
First is that order matters ; for example , if you ’re applying a scale and a rotation both , and you apply them in the wrong order , you can end up with a shear .
Second , composing transforms is the tool that lets you rotate around a point other than the origin .
You do this by translating until that point is the origin , applying the desired rotation , and then applying the inverse of the original translation .
How does the math work ?
Affine transforms can be represented in more than one way .
I ’m only going to show the one I think is easiest .
In fact , the method I present is not the standard , as many readers have pointed out .
I only picked it to make this material as approachable as possible , which will make learning the other methods easier later .
For more on this , see the Van Verth presentation and the wikipedia page in the references .
That said , here ’s how an affine transform ’s function looks to mathematicians :
T( x ) = Ax + y
x is the point you ’re transforming , represented as a column vector .
A and y define the affine transform ; A is a matrix and y is another column vector .
Here ’s what that looks like in 3 dimensions :
In this example , I filled in all the numbers in the matrix A and the vector y at random .
Intelligently generated transforms have a specific form for each type .
Translating an object by a units along the x axis , b units along the y axis , and c units along the z axis :
Scaling a an image by a factor of a in the x direction , a factor of b in the y direction , and a factor of c in the z direction :
Rotating an image degrees around the x axis :
Rotating an image degrees around the y axis :
Rotating an image degrees around the z axis :
Reflecting an image across the x axis :
Reflecting an image across the y axis :
Reflecting an image across the z axis :
How do you compose them ?
( with math ! )
Same answer as before : apply one , then apply the other .
And , as above , order matters .
Let ’s take a look at one .
Suppose I want to apply two transforms : Ax + y and then Bx + z .
It would look like this :
B( Ax + y ) + z
Let ’s compose a scale that increases an object ’s size by a factor of 2 :
and a rotation by 90 degrees about the z axis :
Here ’s the composition :

Every GDC article I write has the goal of helping us do a better job at IMVU .
Since I want my articles to be relevant to a wider audience , I ’m separating out the IMVU tie-ins .
What follows is the IMVU - centric section of this post , which wo n’t be relevant to everyone .
For the rest of you , please enjoy the fuzzy kitten .
At IMVU , we ’ve already got this pretty well licked .
3D rendering is our core product !
Maybe we could get me involved in it , though , now that I ’ve spent all this time studying it .
Affine transforms are not nearly all there is to 3D rendering , though , so maybe we should wait until I finish studying and writing about the rest of the math involved .
Also , I ’m not the only programmer we have who is not a 3D graphics guru , so we could simply use this article as education .

The economic downturn , coupled with changing social perceptions and escalating drug violence in Mexico , has sparked national interest in legalizing , regulating and taxing marijuana consumption .
A 2005 study by Harvard University economist Jeffrey Miro , noted that legalization would save the United States $ 7.7 billion annually on law enforcement , in addition to generating $ 6.2 billion in tax revenue .
Each year , Americans spend $ 39 billion on domestically grown marijuana , $ 9 billion on marijuana from Mexico and an additional $ 7 - 10 billion on the crop from Canada .
Longtime advocates for legalization have gained unlikely allies .
Most notably , a group of former and current police officers have banded together and formed Law Enforcement Against Prohibition ( LEAP ) .
The organization proclaims that , " after nearly four decades of fueling the U.S. policy of a war on drugs with over a trillion tax dollars and 37 million arrests for non-violent drug offenses , our confined population has quadrupled , making building prisons the fastest growing industry in the United States . "
The first state to legalize medical marijuana in 1996 , California has since engaged in an ongoing battle with the federal government and the Drug Enforcement Administration to stop federal raids of medical marijuana dispensaries .
Last month , Attorney General Eric Holder announced a deviation from the previous administration ’s drug policy by promising to limit raids to facilities that break both state and federal law .
Offering a creative solution to his state ’s mounting deficit and overcrowded prison population , California Assemblyman Tom Ammiano ( D - San Francisco ) recently introduced a bill that would legalize recreational use of marijuana .
At least 37 others states have also begun actively debating reforms to their own drug policies .
Although lagging behind state governments , even Congress attempted reform with the introduction of a bill by Representatives Barney Frank ( D - MA ) and Ron Paul ( R - TX ) last year that sought to safeguard medical marijuana patients and decriminalize small amounts of possession .

Touchy - feely dog owners -- those who share food with their pets and allow them to sleep in their beds and lick their faces -- can rest easy knowing the findings of a recent study by Kansas State University veterinarian Kate Stenske .
Stenske looked at the incidence of the E. coli bacteria in both dogs and their owners .
Studies show that more than half of dog owners fell into the face - licking camp , she says -- and , fortunately for them , they were no more likely to harbor the bacteria than those who employed , as our colleague Shari Roan at the Booster Shots blog put it , " stricter human - pet hygiene practices . "
From Roan 's story :
" There is such a strong bond between dogs and their owners .
If you look at one study , 84 % of people say their dog is like a child to them , " Stenske said in a news release .
" We also know diseases can be shared between dogs and people .
About 75 % of emerging diseases are zoonotic , meaning they are transferable between humans and other animals . "
E. coli can cause serious health problems when it acquires genes that make it resistant to antibiotics .
Stenske found that 10 % of the dog - human pairs shared the same E. coli strains and that the strains had more antibiotic resistance than was expected .
The owners had more multiple - drug resistant strains than their pets , which means it 's more likely owners spread such strains to their pets than pets spread to their owners .
While bed - sharing and face - licking did n't increase the prevalence of E. coli , owners who did n't wash their hands after petting their dogs or before cooking meals did have more antibiotic - resistant E. coli .
The study is scheduled to appear in an upcoming issue of the American Journal of Veterinary Research .
So far , Stenske 's research has been limited to the human - dog bond , but she says future research might focus on the relationship between cat ownership and shared E. coli .

It is a " Lyman- alpha blob " and is 55,000 light years across - as large as present - day galaxies .
Though younger such blobs have been found , " Himiko " confounds the idea that such large objects grew more recently by the merger of smaller ones .
The research will be published in the Astrophysical Journal .
Current cosmology models hold that between 200 million and one billion years after the Big Bang , the first colossal stars formed , emitting radiation that stripped light elements of their electrons and turned the Universe into a soup of charged particles .
Only after this " re-ionisation epoch " did matter as we now know it really start to clump together .
A number of theories of Lyman - alpha blob formation abound , but all are difficult to test
James Geach
University of Durham Objects as big as modern - day galaxies should have taken significant time to build up from mergers of smaller chunks of matter .
So when a group of researchers led by Masami Ouchi at the Carnegie Institution searched among 207 distant galaxy candidates using the Subaru telescope at the peak of Mauna Kea in Hawaii , they expected to find smaller galaxies .
" We hesitated to spend our precious telescope time by taking spectra of this weird candidate , " Dr Ouchi said .
" We never believed that this bright and large source was a real distant object . "
Massive mystery
The team went on to measure the characteristic emission from hydrogen - the Lyman - alpha radiation of the name - and confirmed the blob was some 12.9 billion light years away .
They then trained the Spitzer Space Telescope , Very Large Array and UK Infrared Telescope on the object to determine how much mass is contained in the blob - or , rather , how much was contained 12.9 billion years ago .
Himiko - named after a mysterious queen of Chinese and Japanese legend - contains more than 10 times as much mass as galaxies of a similar age .
The blob was first noticed in data from the Subaru Telescope " There are two possibilities : the standard scenario of galaxy formation is wrong , or this particular object is showing something unique , " Dr Ouchi told BBC News .
A range of possibilities could explain the massive nature of Himiko : it could have a supermassive black hole at its centre , or perhaps it is a single giant galaxy with a large mass of about 40 billion Suns .
Dr Ouchi said the team was proposing observations using the Keck telescope in the far - infrared region to establish the rate of star formation happening inside Himiko , and whether star formation could lead to the " nebula " of ionised gas that accounts for its enormous size .
" Many early theories of galaxy formation predicted a Lyman - alpha ' fuzz ' around early galaxies , " said James Geach , an astronomer at the University of Durham who works on Lyman - alpha blobs .
" The problem is that no - one is entirely sure what mechanism gives rise to the extended emission ; a number of theories of Lyman - alpha blob formation abound , but all are difficult to test , " he told BBC News .
" We now have several good models that seem to do a good job of reproducing many qualities of the observable Universe .
" There is room for improvement however , and explaining these Lyman - alpha blobs is a prime example . "
Both Dr Ouchi and Dr Geach agree that future " wide - field " searches that scan larger swathes of the sky are likely to uncover many more such extended blobs .
But , Dr Geach added , " until we know more about their physics , their connection to the formation of galaxies , and perhaps most importantly their lifetimes , we do n't really know how they fit in " .

From Paul Graham 's recent essay :
I think what religion and politics have in common is that they become part of people 's identity , and people can never have a fruitful argument about something that 's part of their identity .
By definition they 're partisan .
Which topics engage people 's identity depends on the people , not the topic .
For example , a discussion about a battle that included citizens of one or more of the countries involved would probably degenerate into a political argument .
But a discussion today about a battle that took place in the Bronze Age probably would n't .
No one would know what side to be on .
So it 's not politics that 's the source of the trouble , but identity .
When people say a discussion has degenerated into a religious war , what they really mean is that it has started to be driven mostly by people 's identities .
. . .
The most intriguing thing about this theory , if it 's right , is that it explains not merely which kinds of discussions to avoid , but how to have better ideas .
If people can't think clearly about anything that has become part of their identity , then all other things being equal , the best plan is to let as few things into your identity as possible .
Most people reading this will already be fairly tolerant .
But there is a step beyond thinking of yourself as x but tolerating y : not even to consider yourself an x .
The more labels you have for yourself , the dumber they make you .
The GOP is prepared to back Norm Coleman ’s appeal to the federal level if even a shred of doubt emerges .

For GOP , it 's Coleman or bust
Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter ’s shocking decision last week to become a Democrat has upped the ante in the never - ending Minnesota Senate race , providing a strong incentive for Republicans to hold out until every last appeal is exhausted .
With former Sen. Norm Coleman now standing between Democrats and their 60 - seat supermajority , the GOP is prepared to back the Republican ’s appeal to the federal level if even a shred of doubt emerges in the case currently before the Minnesota Supreme Court .

“ This makes it pretty darn important , ” said Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , of the race following Specter ’s switch .
“ I expect they will pursue the appeals until they are exhausted , whenever that may be . …
I would assume if they were unsuccessful in the Minnesota Supreme Court , there may very well be an appeal to the United States Supreme Court . ”
Democrats , meanwhile , are planning a full - scale public pressure campaign to force Coleman to concede should the court affirm a three - judge panel ’s ruling that Al Franken is the winner .
Democrats have already begun using the race ’s elevated importance to raise money , and they ’re mounting a fresh campaign to pressure Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty , a Republican , to sign an election certificate once the state Supreme Court rules .
“ Pawlenty ’s signature is very , very important , ” said Sen. Chuck Schumer , the Democratic chairman of the Rules and Administration Committee , which oversees election disputes .
“ We expect it to happen after the Supreme Court of Minnesota rules . ….
If he refuses to sign , we ’ll have to cross that bridge when we come to it . ”
A key issue for Democrats is whether to seat Franken in the Senate even if Pawlenty withholds his signature from the election certificate .
In the wake of the recent flap over seating Sen. Roland Burris ( D - Ill . ) , Democrats have set a precedent that to be seated in the Senate , a candidate needs a signed certificate from the sitting governor and secretary of state .
Democrats wo n’t say whether they ’ll try to overcome a possible GOP filibuster by seating Franken if Pawlenty refuses to sign the certificate .
But with Specter standing as the 59th Democrat , Democrats need just one GOP defection to break a filibuster in order to win Franken ’s seating .
On Thursday , several Republicans said they expected any further appeals by Coleman to be fully supported by their conference , though some acknowledged that the party consensus could be fractured if Coleman continues to lose soundly before the courts .
“ If they affirm a lower court ’s ruling , then yeah I think it probably gets more difficult in each step of the process to continue to elevate it , ” said Sen. John Thune ( R - S.D. ) , a member of GOP leadership .
He later added that there would be “ broad support for whatever decision Norm and his camp make . ”
Pawlenty ’s role is central to the dispute , and the question of whether Pawlenty must sign the election certificate after the ruling by the state ’s highest court is unclear .
Coleman ’s lawyers say there is a legal gray area as to whether Pawlenty should sign the certificate if there is a federal appeal pending , and the governor – who is eying a run for the White House in 2012 — says that he ’ll follow the direction of the courts .
Pawlenty ’s handling of the matter could endear him to the GOP base , but it might also infuriate some Minnesota voters if he seeks reelection as governor next year .
Pawlenty , however , may have no choice in the matter .
As part of the fight before the state ’s high court , where oral arguments are scheduled for June 1 , Franken ’s team is likely to ask for a ruling on whether Pawlenty is required to sign an election certificate even if the loser appeals the case to federal court , according to Sen.
Robert Menendez , chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee .
“ If the court does that , there would be no opportunity for circumvention by Pawlenty , ” Menendez said Thursday .
Last week , the White House - allied Americans United for Change launched a new advertisement , which is airing in Twin Cities and Rochester , Minn .
cable markets , calling on Pawlenty to do his “ legal duty ” and sign an election certificate once the state ’s highest court rules .
Republicans dismiss those tactics , and say that Coleman is fighting to ensure that some 4,900 absentee ballots are properly counted , as he argued Thursday in a new brief filed with the state Supreme Court .
National Republicans are eager to see Coleman continue fighting as long as he can – even to the federal level , a process that could take many months .
But they are wary of being viewed as directing the fight out of Washington , saying that the decision remains up to Coleman , who can expect the full party ’s financial and political backing should he appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court – or wage a new lawsuit in federal district court .
“ Obviously it takes on added significance now with Specter ’s switch , ” Thune said , adding that Coleman ’s “ strongest argument ” that Minnesota counties violated the Constitution ’s equal protection clause by using different standards for counting absentee ballots is ripe for federal courts .
Cornyn , who views the race as his first of the cycle , added that he ’s “ not advising them , I ’m just watching .
That will have to be determined by Sen. Coleman and his legal team . ”
Democrats believe that they are making headway in their argument that the GOP is intentionally dragging the fight out to keep the seat empty .
“ I saw this cartoon that says , ‘ Al Franken , a final decision has been made , you are now the senator .
And President Sasha Obama would like to swear you in , ’’ ” said Sen.
Dick Durbin ( D - Ill. ) , the majority whip .
“ I think Cornyn ’s idea is to drag this on as long as possible – he said as much – and I think that ’s unfair to the voters of Minnesota . ”
Menendez also sent out a fundraising plea saying that Republicans will now become “ more desperate ” now that Specter is a Democrat .
“ Norm Coleman will dig in his heels and fight even harder to deny us that filibuster - proof 60th seat . ”
The GOP disputes that contention and says that Coleman is simply following the legal appeals set out by law and has a legitimate case to be made before the state ’s highest court .
And Senate Republicans are warning Democrats will overreach if Franken is seated in the Senate chamber since the GOP will lose their ability to force concessions on major bills by using the filibuster .
“ If you lose a case and you feel like there ’s a mistake , then you have a right to appeal , ” said Sen. Lamar Alexander ( R - Tenn . ) , the No. 3 Republican in the Senate .
“ That ’s why we have a system of justice , particularly when we ’re protecting the individual ’s right to vote . ”
University of Minnesota political science professor Larry Jacobs said that , with the stakes so high , Republicans have nothing left to lose in blocking Franken from being seated – and that the Minnesota Senate race has “ just become the last stand at the Alamo ” for the GOP .
“ The Specter decision makes the Franken seating that much more urgent and politically explosive , ” Jacobs said .
If these three characters sound familiar , you 're not unlucky .
Based on my experience , these are pretty much the only three types of tech support people that exist .
There are reasons for all of this .
Terrible , nonsensical reasons .
Let 's walk through a typical call , from the beginning .
A level two tech support assistant , which is kind of like winning the lottery since there 's actually a chance that he knows how to fix your computer , though he wo n't do much besides talk to you like you have mittens pinned to your jacket and need the tines on your fork filed down so you do n't stab yourself when you eat .
The mouth - breather who refuses to believe that you 've already power cycled the modem and that you are fully aware that a computer needs to be plugged in for it to properly function ;
The outsourced guy in India who , as best you can tell , is either explaining how to reset your BIOS or reading you amateur erotica ;
Now , it probably seems like every time you call tech support you 're playing a game of dipshit - roulette that by and large you can't win .
You probably spoke to one of three people :
I sacrificed several months of my life , sanity and dignity working in tech support to amass the dark knowledge I share in this article .
I may have even helped you with a computer problem at some point .
If so , I 'm sorry .
On Hold
The Suck :
At some point in time while furiously fapping to some hentai on a venture through various East Asian thumbnail galleries you may have had the unfortunate luck to run afoul of some kind of virus that completely crippled your computer .
Desperate for some more pictures of Sailor Moon pleasuring Pikachu , you call up tech support .
You 'll likely notice the phone rings and rings again before finally a pleasant recording will let you know that your call is important .
That 's nice .
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Around the 15th time the recorded voice assures you of your importance , you begin to imagine what you 're certain is a faint whiff of sarcasm in her voice .
Your eye begins twitching ever so slightly .
The Reason For The Suck :
You may have heard one of those messages say you 've called during " peak " hours , when everyone is fucking up at the same time , and to call back later .
And you 've probably noticed if you call at 2 AM you may get through right away , but if you call at 5 PM the next day , you 'll wait an hour .
It seems like the solution to this problem would be simple : shift some of the staff 's off - peak hours to the time when , you know , people are actually calling .
But predicting a rush of calls is like trying to predict a traffic jam ; you know its more likely during certain times of day , but you still can't predict when 50,000 customers all download the same virus - encrusted clip off of DirtySanchez.org at the same time .

You may be asking why they do n't just say " better safe than sorry " and staff the call center with extra support just in case of a problem .
It 's the same reason your yard is not full of unicorns shitting gold coins ; that 's just not the world we live in .
In this world , where support staff are paid by the hour and everything is sacrificed for the bottom line , the company thinks having too many staff sitting idle is worse than not having enough .
They even sell special scheduling software intended to make sure call centers have the exact minimum of staff on hand at all times .
So while Tech Support agents tend to be nocturnal cave creatures who use sonar to feed on field mice , that 's not why it 's easier to talk to one at night .
Well , at least it 's not the only reason .
Somewhere there 's a stressed - out manager who'll catch hell if he 's got guys " sitting around . "
Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez greets Cuba's President Raul Castro .
Translated by Federico Fuentes
Cumaná , April 17 , 2009
The heads of state and governments of Bolivia , Cuba , Dominica , Honduras , Nicaragua and Venezuela -- member countries of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas ( ALBA ) -- consider that the proposed Declaration of the 5th Summit of the Americas is insufficient and unacceptable for the following reasons :
It offers no answers to the issue of the global economic crisis , despite the fact that this constitutes the largest challenge faced by humanity in decades and the most serious threat in the current epoch to the wellbeing of our peoples .
Unjustifiably excludes Cuba in a criminal manner , without mentioning the general consensus that exists in the region in favour of condemning the blockade and the isolation attempts , which its people and government have incessantly objected to .
For these reasons , the member countries of ALBA consider that consensus does not exist in favour of adopting this proposed declaration and in light of the above ; we propose to have a thoroughgoing debate over the following issues :
1 ) Capitalism is putting an end to humanity and the planet .
What we are living through is a global economic crisis of a systemic and structural character and not just one more cyclical crisis .
Those who think that this crisis will be resolved with an injection of fiscal money and with some regulatory measures are very mistaken .
The financial system is in crisis because it is quoting the value of papers at six times the real value of goods and services being produced in the world .
This is not a “ failure of the regulation of the system ” but rather a constitutive part of the capitalist system that speculates with all goods and values in the pursuit of obtaining the maximum amount of profit possible .
Until now , the economic crisis has created 100 million more starving people and more than 50 million new unemployed people , and these figures are tending to increasing .
2 ) Capitalism has provoked an ecological crisis by subordinating the necessary conditions for life on this planet to the dominance of the market and profit .
Each year , the world consumes a third more than what the planet is capable of regenerating .
At this rate of wastage by the capitalist system , we are going to need two planets by the year 2030 .
3 ) The global economic , climate change , food and energy crises are products of the decadence of capitalism that threatens to put an end to the existence of life and the planet .
To avoid this outcome it is necessary to develop an alternative model to that of the capitalist system .
A system based on :
Solidarity and complementarity and not competition ;
A system in harmony with our mother earth rather than the looting of our natural resources ;
A system based on cultural diversity and not the crushing of cultures and impositions of cultural values and lifestyles alien to the realities of our countries :
A system of peace based on social justice and not on imperialist wars and policies ;
In synthesis , a system that recuperates the human condition of our societies and peoples rather than reducing them to simple consumers or commodities .
4 ) As a concrete expression of the new reality on the continent , Latin American and Caribbean countries have begun to construct their own institutions , whose roots lie in the common history that goes back to our independence revolution , and which constitutes a concrete instrument for deepening the processes of social , economic and cultural transformation that will consolidate our sovereignty .
The ALBA - TCP [ TCP = Peoples Trade Agreement ] , Petrocaribe and UNASUR [ Union of South American Nations ] , to only cite the most recently created ones , are mechanisms for solidarity - based union forged in the heat of these transformations , with the manifest intention of strengthening the efforts of our peoples to reach their own liberation .
In order to confront the grave effects of the global economic crisis , the ALBA - TCP countries have taken innovative and transformational measures that seek real alternatives to the deficient international economic order rather than strengthen these failed institutions .
That is why we have put in [ place ] a Single System of Regional Compensation , the SUCRE , that includes a Common Accounting Unit , a Chamber of Compensations of Payments and a Single System of Reserves .
At the same time , we have promoted the constitution of grand national companies in order to satisfy the fundamental necessities of our peoples , establishing mechanisms of just and complementary trade , that leave to one side the absurd logic of unrestrained competition .
5 ) We question the G20 ’s decision to triple the amount of resources going to the International Monetary Fund , when what is really necessary is the establishment of a new world economic order that includes the total transformation of the IMF , the World Bank and the WTO [ World Trade Organisation ] , which with their neoliberal conditions have contributed to this global economic crisis .
6 ) The solutions to the global economic crisis and the definition of a new international financial architecture should be adopted with the participation of the 192 countries that between June 1 and 3 , 2009 , will meet at a United Nations conference about the international financial crisis , in order to propose the creation of a new international economic order .
7 ) In regards to the climate change crisis , the developed countries have an ecological debt with the world given that they are responsible for 70 % of historic emissions of carbon accumulated in the atmosphere since 1750 .
The developed countries , debtors with humanity and the planet , should contribute significant resources towards a fund so that the countries on the path towards development can undertake a model of growth that does not repeat the grave impacts of capitalist industrialisation .
8 ) The solutions to the energy , food and climate change crises have to be integral and interdependent .
We cannot resolve a problem creating others in the areas fundamental to life .
For example , generalising the use of agro-fuels can only impact negatively on the price of food and in the utilisation of essential resources such as water , land and forests .
9 ) We condemn discrimination against migrants in all its forms .
Migration is a human right , not a crime .
Therefore , we demand an urgent reform to the migration policies of the United States government , with the objective of detaining deportations and mass raids , allowing the reunification of families , and we demand the elimination of the wall that divides and separates us , rather than uniting us .
In this sense , we demand the repeal of the Cuban Adjustment Act and the elimination of the policies of ``wetbacks - drybacks ' ' , which has a discriminatory and selective character , and is the cause of loss of human lives .
Those that are truly to blame for the financial crisis are the bankers who steal money and the resources of our countries , not migrant workers .
Human rights come first , particularly the human rights of the most unprotected and marginalised sectors of our society , as undocumented workers are .
For there to be integration there has to be free circulation of people , and equal human rights for all regardless of migratory status .
Brain drain constitutes a form of looting of qualified human resources by the rich countries .
10 ) Basic services such as education , health , water , energy and telecommunications have to be declared human rights and cannot be the objects of private business nor be commodified by the World Trade Organisation .
These services are and should be essential , universally accessible public services
11 ) We want a world where all countries , big and small , have the same rights and where empires do not exist .
We advocate against intervention .
Strengthen , as the only legitimate channel for discussion and analysis of bilateral and multilateral agendas of the continent , the base of mutual respect between states and governments , under the principle of non-interference of one state over another and the inviolability of the sovereignty and self - determination of the peoples .
We demand that the new government of the United States , whose inauguration has generated some expectations in the region and the world , put an end to the long and nefarious tradition of interventionism and aggression that has characterised the actions of the governments of this country throughout its history , especially brutal during the government of George W. Bush .
In the same way , eliminate interventionist practices such as covert operations , parallel diplomacy , media wars aimed at destabilising states and governments , and the financing of destabilising groups .
It is fundamental that we construct a world in which a diversity of economic , political , social and cultural approaches are recognised and respected .
12 ) Regarding the United States ' blockade against Cuba and the exclusion of this country from the Summit of the Americas , the countries of the Bolivarian Alternatives for the People of Our Americas reiterates the position that all the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean adopted last December 16 , 2008 , regarding the necessity of putting an end to the economic , trade and financial blockade imposed by the government of the United States of America against Cuba , including the application of the denominated Helms - Burton law , and that among its paragraphs notes :
“ CONSIDERING the resolutions approved by the United Nations General Assembly on the need to put an end to the economic , commercial , and financial embargo imposed by the United States on Cuba and the decisions on the latter approved at several international meetings , “ DECLARE that in defence of free trade and the transparent practice of international trade , it is unacceptable to apply unilateral coercive measures that will affect the wellbeing of nations and obstruct the processes of integration .
“ WE REJECT the implementation of laws and measures that contradict International Law such as the Helms - Burton law and urge the US Government to put an end to its implementation .
" WE ASK the US Government to comply with the 17 successive resolutions approved at the United Nations General Assembly and put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo it has imposed on Cuba . ”
Moreover , we believe that the attempts to impose isolation on Cuba , which today is an integral part of the Latin American and Caribbean region , is a member of the Rio Group and other organisations and regional mechanisms , that carries out a policy of cooperation and solidarity with the people of the region , that promotes the full integration of the Latin American and Caribbean peoples , has failed , and that , therefore , no reason exists to justify Cuba 's exclusion from the Summit of the Americas .
13 ) The developed countries have destined no less than US $ 8 trillion towards rescuing the financial structure that has collapsed .
They are the same ones that do not comply with spending a small sum to reach the Millennium Goals or 0.7 % of GDP for Official Development Aid .
Never before have we seen so nakedly the hypocrisy of the discourse of the rich countries .
Cooperation has to be established without conditions and adjusted to the agendas of the receiving countries , simplifying the procedures , making resources accessible and privileging issues of social inclusion .
14 ) The legitimate struggle against narco - trafficking and organised crime , and any other manifestation of the denominated “ new threats , ” should not be utilised as excuses for carrying out acts of interference or intervention against our countries .
15 ) We are firmly convinced that change , which all the world is hoping for , can only come about through the organisation , mobilisation and unity of our peoples .
As the Liberator Simón Bolívar well stated :
“ The unity of our peoples is not simply the chimera of men , but an inexorable fate . ”

Cuba reaffirms solidarity with the people of the Americas
Speech by Cuba's President Raúl Castro Ruz to 5th Extraordinary ALBA Summit , Cumaná , Venezuela , April 16 , 2009
Compañero Chávez ;
Dear presidents and heads of delegations from sister ALBA nations ;
Distinguished guests
The economic and social crisis now is global in nature and is not only limited to the financial sector .
It ’s a world disaster with profound structural roots .
It includes a sharp fall in stock market value and productive activity ; the freezing of and higher cost of credit and the economic recession in the principal powers of the First World .
It is accompanied by the withdrawal of world trade and an increase in unemployment and poverty .
It is affecting and will considerably damage the lives and well - being of billions of human beings .
The countries of the South with be , as always , the ones that suffer the most .
These are the consequences of irresponsible practices tied to deregulation , financial speculation and the imposition of neoliberalism .
Also present is the United States ’ abusive use of the privileges bestowed on them in the current international economic order which allows them to finance a culture of war and unbridled consumerism , unsustainable no matter how you look at it , by printing money without backing .
But deep down , the crisis is a foreseeable result of the capitalist system of production and distribution .
The neoliberal policies of the last three decades have increased its magnitude for the worse .
In the search for solutions , those who are primarily responsible end up concentrating power and wealth even further , while the poorest and most exploited assume the majority of the costs .
The response cannot be a solution negotiated behind the back of the United Nations by the Presidents of the most powerful countries .
The crisis will not be resolved with either administrative or technical measures because they are by nature structural , have systematic reach and increasingly affect the economy of the globalised and interdependent planet .
The role and the functions of financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund , whose disastrous policies have decisively contributed to the origin and reach of the current crisis , should be strengthened even less .
Nor does the G - 20 ’s solution resolve the inequality , injustices , and unsustainability of the capitalist system .
It is the same rhetoric of those solemn declarations by the Northern countries that they will not apply protectionist measures and that they will not allocate new aid , which does not change the foundations of the underdevelopment that condemns us .
The World Bank – which is not exactly a defender of socialist principles – already spoke about this six months ago at the previous G - 20 meeting in Washington .
It counted 73 protectionist actions applied by members of the G - 20 itself .
An increase in the Official Development Assistance has also not been visible .
Dear colleagues ,
The ALBA countries have the privilege of having a modest plan for integration , constructed on the foundations and principles of equality , whose very nature does n’t allow for the practices that started this crisis .
Our countries do not have the capacity , by ourselves , to structurally transform the international economic order , but we do have the power to establish new foundations and construct our own economic relations .
Our most important programs are not subject to the whims of financial speculation or the uncontrolled fluctuation of markets .
The damage that we are suffering is undeniable .
This is a crisis that nobody can escape from but today we have the instruments to partly counteract its effects .
In these efforts , the work that we have been carrying out in ALBA member countries and Ecuador ( since November 2008 ) is particularly significant ; in order to create the Unique Regional Compensation Payment System ( SUCRE ) that will be a fundamental factor for boosting the trade and economic integration between us .
Today we can verify the advances achieved in the development of this initiative that is a first step toward the goal of having a common currency .
Cuba reaffirms the vocation of solidarity that has characterized its links with the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean .
The crisis presents us with enormous challenges , of incalculable and unpredictable dimensions .
We have no other option than to unite with each other to face it .
Thank you very much .
Fifth Summit of the Americas

Fifth Summit of the Americas " Grandpa , does n't Cuba belong to the Americas ? "

Summit of the Americas concludes with controversial declaration ; ALBA countries decline to sign
April 19 ( ACN ) --
The 5th Summit of the Americas concluded today in Port of Spain , Trindidad - Tobago , with a controversial final declaration , which was rejected by several nations of the western hemisphere that described it as insufficient and unacceptable .
The document was considered as approved although it lacked the support of several countries , including those nations that make up the Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas ( ALBA ) .
During the closing ceremony , Trinidad - Tobago 's Prime Minister Patrick Manning said that the declaration has gaps due to the fact that the document had been submitted to negotiations by technocrats for the past year and a half .
By that time the world situation was different from today's , said Manning and went on to explain that due to that reason the document does not reflect the current hemispheric scenario .
The final declaration of the summit is in favour of promoting the development of the private sector .
In that direction , the document turns to the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the Inter - American Development Bank and other regional credit institutions to step up efforts aimed at expanding and developing the private business sector .
The objective stated by the declaration is that by 2012 , credit lines destined to the micro , small and medium enterprises double and the number of companies with access to credit will triple .
The document also calls for the production and exploitation of current biological fuels and those of the next generation , including sugar derivatives .
The declaration promotes the production of bio-fuels of second generation , which are even more advanced , so that they do not pose any direct competition for land , water or fertilisers to other agricultural products .
Despite its gaps , the declaration admits the prevalence of deep and persistent inequalities , particularly in the fields of education , income levels , health care , nutrition , violence and crime , and access to basic services .
It also admits the prevalence of exclusion against the most vulnerable sectors of society , including women , children , indigenous people and the poor .
Ecuadorean President Rafael Correa said that the draft declaration “ does not reflect the economic crisis we are experiencing , which is not a temporary crisis but a crisis of the capitalist system , and that the document suggests solutions by legitimising those responsible for the crisis , for instance , the International Monetary Fund . ”
For Correa , the alternatives are going to the hands of the gravediggers instead of the hands of those who want to revive the world , and he labelled the document as “ light . ”
“ We share a firm position and I do not think we have time now to change the content of the document , and since we do not have time for that we will not sign it , I can speak for myself and for the ALBA countries ” , said Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
The Bolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our Americas regional integration initiative , known by its Spanish acronym ALBA , is made up of Venezuela , Nicaragua , Bolivia , Honduras , Cuba , Dominica and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines .
The ALBA countries argue that the declaration does not give any response to the world economic crisis , despite the fact that it is the major challenge that has faced humanity in decades and the most serious threat of our times for the wellbeing of the nations .
They also say that the declaration excludes Cuba without saying a word about the general consensus prevailing in the region against the US economic blockade of the Caribbean nation and the US attempts to isolate Cuba .
Venezuela and ALBA promote `new climate ' at Summit of the Americas
By Tamara Pearson
Merida , April 21 , 2009 -- Venezuelanlaysis.com -- Venezuela and the countries of the Bolivarian Alternative to the Americas ( ALBA ) decided not to sign the final document of the Summit of the Americas held on April 17 - 19 in Trinidad and Tobago , saying it excluded Cuba and offered no viable solution to the current economic crisis .
The economic blockade of Cuba imposed by the United States was one of the most anticipated themes of the summit , in which 34 heads of state across the North and South American continent participated , with the notable exception of Cuba , whose president was not invited .
The dynamics of the summit were somewhat different compared to previous summits , as ALBA countries worked together to assert the needs of Latin America , whilst the new president of the United States , Barack Obama , was also more respectful to the other countries .
Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said , " Of the three Summits of the Americas that I have been to , the first was cold , behind a wall and driven by imperialism and everyone else was quiet , except Venezuela .
Later , in the Mar del Plata [ in Argentina , 2005 ] the summit ended up fragmented in pieces , but we defeated FTAA [ Free Trade Area of the Americas ] , now this summit has opened the gates to a new era of relationships between all the countries of this continent . "
Chávez said that although this meeting had n't been perfect , cordiality had reigned and that " it has finished with success and with a new climate " .
However , Chávez criticised the nature the summit , saying , " Someone notes all these proposals and later comes the big question , who is in charge of carrying them out ?
This is one of the failures of all these summits over the last few years , the incapacity to put projects into practice . "
ALBA countries that attended the summit ( Bolivia , Dominica , Honduras , Nicaragua , Saint Vincent and the Grenadines , and Venezuela ) had previously decided at their conference , held just days before in Venezuela , not to sign the final document of the summit , the Declaration of Trinidad and Tobago .
The 22 - page document , with 99 points , in general favours the private sector and its development , promotes the production of biofuels and the increasing of credit lines to business , amongst other things .
In a joint statement about the document , ALBA countries said that it " offers no answers to the ... global economic crisis " and " unjustifiably excludes Cuba ... without mentioning the general consensus ... in the region in favor of condemning the blockade " .
ALBA then proposed alternative themes for discussion , including problems caused by capitalism , climate change and the food and energy crises and the need for solidarity not competition .
Chávez said the document is " totally de-contextualised , as if time has n't passed " and complained specifically about its characterisation of Cuba as non-democratic .
" Where is there more democracy , in the United States or in Cuba ?
Who has the democracy meter ?...
I have no doubt that there is more democracy in Cuba than in the United States " , said Chávez .
Chávez justified ALBA 's rejection of the declaration to the press saying , " It is a sovereign decision and it forms part of the battle that we are waging from ALBA , not only of resistance to imperialism and its hegemony , but also with viable proposals and in full construction of a better world . "
" The Summit of the Americas was born to try to impose the FTAA and it failed " , Chávez said , referring to the previous summit in Argentina in 2005 .
In this case Chávez signed the final declaration but expressed reservations around the point on free trade .
Venezuela created ALBA with Cuba in 2004 as a counter project to the FTAA .
In the end , only the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago , Patrick Manning , signed the declaration , saying that while there was n't unanimity around the content of the document , there was a consensus that he should be the only one to sign it .
Another highlight of the conference was the resumption of US - Venezuela relations and a resumed cordiality between the presidents of those countries , Chávez and Obama .
Chávez said " we affirmed a desire to initiate a new stage of relations .
The president of the Unites States said that he would keep his word to not interfere in the internal issues of any country and we agree that we want to work together . "
Various presidents also expressed hopes that the summit would mark new relations between the United States and the rest of Latin America , especially given the new president of the US .
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said , " [ The summit ] was a fantastic meeting , we understand it as ... the start of a new type of relationship .
There was an environment of ... optimism and high hopes . "
Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa said he felt the main achievement of the summit was " open , frank and friendly dialogue " .
Speaking about the theme of energy security discussed at the summit , Chávez said , " We 're prepared to continue with initiatives like Petrocaribe , the gas pipeline of the South , promoting renewable energy ... and to continue doing our part because we have the biggest reserve of petroleum and one of the largest reserves of gas .
We propose a true energy revolution across the continent . "
In his intervention in the conference , Chávez expressed his concern about the resurgence of economic forms of intervention .
" Be careful with the International Monetary Fund [ IMF ] because they have revived it ...
In Latin America the IMF was the big destabiliser of the region , " he said .
Chávez also alluded to the " media terrorism of the powerful elites against the state " , giving the example of the recent assassination attempts towards Bolivian president Evo Morales , and said these efforts reflect a form of fascism in the region .
After the summit , Chávez classified Venezuela 's participation as " one of the biggest victories of our history " because of the positions it defended of resistance , dignity , sovereignty and independence .
He said he was happy about what is happening in Latin America and the Caribbean where " Bolivarian unity is being consolidated , the dream of San Martin , Bolívar and Artigas ; only united will we be free and be able to talk on an equal footing and with dignity with the powers of the world , this has started to become reality in these latest meetings and summits . "
Chávez proposed the next summit be held in Havana , Cuba .
Mr Hoon was defence secretary when the claims were made Geoff Hoon says he broke no rules in claiming second home allowances for his Derby home while living in a taxpayer - funded apartment in Whitehall .
The transport secretary lived in the flat in Admiralty House while he was defence secretary .
He also rented out his own London home while there .
The revelations have led to fresh calls for MP expenses rules to be tightened .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg called it " barmy " that ministers could have two homes paid for by taxpayers .
Tory Ken Clarke said he was " shocked " by recent expenses revelations which made people think MPs were " rogues " .
The shadow business secretary implied that as many as a third of MPs could have made questionable expenses claims .
He told BBC One 's Andrew Marr Show that " at least two thirds of MPs I hope " were doing nothing wrong on expenses and they were suffering from " an exaggerated public view that they 're all thieves , they 're all rogues , they 're all lining their own pockets " .
Chancellor Alistair Darling told the same programme that the recent spate of revelations were " damaging " .
He said : " I think we do need to get an outside examination of this and so there are recommendations coming from people who 've got no axe to grind .
I think that 's what the public want , and they want it quickly . "
' Security advice ' Writing in the Mail on Sunday Conservative leader David Cameron said the problems in the expenses system were shared by all parties .
" We are all implicated and we must all find a solution , " he said .
MPs needed expenses , but there had to be more transparency , he said .
He added that if elected his party would end the policy allowing ministers with free homes to claim for a second , which he said had " no justification " .
They would also ban ministers living in grace - and - favour residences from claiming second home allowances .

Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg said it was " clearly barmy for ministers to indulge in a form of double counting that enables them to enjoy two homes at the taxpayer 's expense " .
" To say this is within the rules will only serve to convince the public that the rules are broken and need to be fixed as soon as possible , " he added .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown has suggested scrapping the controversial second home payment for all MPs , in a shake - up of allowances .
Mr Hoon lived in an Admiralty House residence for three - and - a - half years until June 2006 , while the property which had until then had been registered with Commons authorities as his main home was let to a private tenant .
He claimed allowances for the running of his constituency house in Derby by designating that as his second home .
Admiralty House , built originally as a home for the First Lord of the Admiralty , contains three apartments which are maintained by the departments whose ministers have use of them .
Mr Hoon said he went to live there on security advice .
He told the Mail on Sunday : " I was told unless I went into secure premises I would have to have round - the - clock police protection at my home in London and that that would cost the taxpayer a great deal more . "
He reportedly said he did " not accept " that he was profiting from the situation .
Ministers investigated Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker , who once used freedom of information laws to probe parliamentary expenses , said ministers who got free properties as part of their job should not expect to get a further property from the taxpayer .
" It 's quite clearly an improper use of taxpayers ' money and it is not sufficient for Geoff Hoon to say he was within the rules .
Being within the rules and behaving ethically are not the same thing , unfortunately . "
This weekend Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has said her marriage is " strong " despite revelations she claimed expenses for adult films watched by her husband .
Ms Smith is also being investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for standards over her decision to claim at least £ 116,000 in second - home allowances for her family home .
Meanwhile she stated her main residence - the one at which she spends most time - as her sister 's home in London , which she shares during the week .
Employment Minister Tony McNulty is also being investigated after it recently transpired that , until January , the MP had claimed up to £ 14,000 a year since 2001 / 2 , for a home in his Harrow East constituency where his parents live .
The Committee on Standards in Public Life has said it will bring forward a wider inquiry into MPs ' expenses , with a report due towards the end of the year .

SUMMARY OF PRELIMINARY MEMORANDUM OF THE JUSTICE ROBERT H. JACKSON CONFERENCE ON FEDERAL PROSECUTION OF WAR CRIMINALS
Propelling prisoners ' heads into concrete walls by means of towels wrapped around their necks , savage beatings with fists and rifles that left prisoners crippled , hanging prisoners by the arms with their arms strung up behind them , depriving prisoners of sleep for weeks on end , which has been thought the worst torture possible for 500 years , causing prisoners to freeze -- sometimes to death , and waterboarding are but a partial list of the torture methods ordered by America 's highest officials .
In the " Preliminary Memorandum of the Justice Robert H. Jackson Conference on Federal Prosecutions of War Criminals , " law school Dean Lawrence Velvel , the founder of the Jackson Conference , details the full spectrum of tortures performed in wholesale combinations -- not one torture by itself -- on detainees around the world .
His Preliminary Memorandum is a precursor to a formal legal complaint to be filed with the Justice Department this spring .
The Preliminary Memorandum identifies 31 culprits and details the war crimes they committed , the laws they broke , and the many fulsome warnings they received regarding their actions from numerous governmental lawyers and officials high and low , including the Judge Advocate Generals of all the armed services .
The culprits who should be prosecuted include Bush , Cheney , Gonzales , Addington , Tenet , Bybee , Yoo , Haynes , Chertoff and others .
The Preliminary Memorandum calls the Bush administration 's illegal acts " an attempted constitutional revolution that succeeded for years . "
It began six days after 9/11 , when Bush secretly gave the CIA permission to " murder . . . people all over the world . "
It continued in a series of secret , wholly specious legal memos authorizing torture , electronic eavesdropping , wholesale violations of law , and Presidential usurpation of the role of Congress .
Public pressure eventually forced the administration to declassify a few of the memos .
These purported to authorize war crimes outlawed by the Geneva Conventions and U.S. anti-torture laws .
Among them was John Yoo 's infamous " torture memo " defining torture as " requiring the pain associated with organ failure or death , " saying torture supposedly could n't exist if the torturer wanted information , and urging that the President could do anything he wanted , including paying no attention whatever to Congressional laws .
Meanwhile , Bush administration officials and lawyers ignored extensive warnings given them by government officials that they were engaging in criminal acts ; the warnings were given both orally and in extensive memos .
' Not a whiff of fraud here , ' says Repub MN Senate contest attorney ...
Brad Friedman Byon 2/12/2009 , 1:21 pm PT
Might we suggest these Republicans get their lies straight before going public ?
From Republican State Representative Tom Emmer 's press release today , on the defeat of his restrictive Photo ID voting bill in the MN legislature this morning :
" The U.S. Senate recount has given us evidence of twenty - five precincts in Minnesota where more votes were cast than the rolls had registered voters , " said Emmer .
" How does a situation like that not cry out for a safeguard that will return confidence in our election process to Minnesota voters ? "
Just now , from attorney James Langdon , arguing on behalf of former Republican Senator Norm Coleman , in the U.S. Senate election contest in MN :
" There has n't been a whiff here , of any fraud . "
But why quibble when we might be able to disenfranchise ( Democratic - leaning ) voters in a democracy ?
By the way , the RNC seems to agree with Langdon , not Emmer :
Not that any of that will stop any Republican anywhere from doing everything they can to keep legal ( Democratic - leaning ) voters from being able to cast their legal votes through Photo ID restrictions , or anything else they can think of .

Perfect Foods
If you could take only seven kinds of food to a deserted island , what would they be ?
Bacon might top your list , but you wo n't have a cardiologist to bail you out when your arteries fill with fat .
If you want to survive at least long enough to listen to your top seven CDs , read your top seven books , watch your top seven movies and do all the other things you want on this magical island , then your diet needs to be healthy .
Diets benefit from being diverse .
U.S. health organizations advocate eating five servings of fruit and vegetables a day .
In Denmark the number is six , not because they want to be healthier but because six sounds like the word " sex " in Danish , and the campaign plays on the pun of " sex every day . "
The Japanese try to eat 30 different kinds of food each day .
But sticking just to the following seven foods would likely serve you better than the typical American diet and meet your needs for macronutrients ( protein , carbohydrates and fats ) and micronutrients ( vitamins and minerals ) .
Beans
( Image credit : USDA )
As with berries , most beans are highly nutritious .
Black ( turtle ) , red ( kidney ) , pinto and soy top many nutritionists ' lists of so - called superfoods .
This will probably be your best source of calcium and iron on the island .
Beans are a versatile island food , too , for once dried the keep for a long time .
And if you are alone on the island , why worry about flatulence ?
Kale

While most leafy green vegetables will do you good , kale is particularly rich in vitamins , minerals and fiber .
You can boil the stems for a simple vegetable broth .
Kale was bred from wild cabbage , and close cousins include broccoli , Brussels sprouts , cauliflower , cabbage , collard , kohlrabi , mustard and rapini .
Cantaloupe
( Image credit : stock.xchng )
As with berries , cantaloupe is both tasty and nutritious .
Although a little high in sugar , it is too good a source of vitamins A and C and potassium to pass up .
Its lack of fat and lower glycemic load index makes cantaloupe a slightly better pick than bananas .
Berries
( Image credit : Ohio State University . )
Blueberries , raspberries , wolf berries ... take your pick if they are available for picking .
Few foods match berries in flavor , vitamin content and antioxidant potency .
To this list add kiwifruit , once called the Chinese gooseberry but changed for marketing reasons .
Kiwifruit has more vitamin C than oranges and about as much potassium as a banana .
Beware of poisonous berries , such as holly , Franken Berry and Boo Berry .
Nasty stuff .
Barley
( Image credit : USDA )
Could anything be sexier than oats ?
Yes , it 's barley !
Okay , maybe both grains just remind you of Wilford Brimley having a good bowel movement .
But barley , more so than oats and other whole grains , lowers " bad " LDL cholesterol levels and raises " good " HDL .
As with other grains , barley has essential vitamins ( such as niacin and other B vitamins ) and minerals ( manganese and selenium ) that are otherwise not so abundant in fruits .
And if you have enough of it on your island , you can brew up some beer or whisky .
Seaweed
( Image credit : NOAA )
Where there 's sea , there 's seaweed .
Even the laziest among us can harvest what gets washed up .
Kelp , alaria and laver ( kombu , wakame and nori in Japanese cuisine ) are among the most common .
Almost all kinds are edible .
Seaweed is loaded with vitamins and minerals .
Once dried it will keep of months , too .
Seaweed is a regular part of the Asian diet , and most Japanese homes will have four or five kinds on hand .
Even if you avoid sushi , you 've eaten seaweed in ice cream .
Irish moss ( carrageenan ) is a thickening agent .
Fish
( Image credit : stock.xchng )
Chances are , being on an island , you 'll have fish around .
If a river runs through it , and if that river has salmon , then you 're really in luck .
Salmon is rich in omega - 3 fatty acids , which is good for your heart .
Any fish , though , is a good source of healthy fat and protein .
Best of all , you can eat most ocean fish raw , in case you forgot to bring your top seven favorite Zippo lighters .
If you decided to bring no other animal food products to the island , then fish will be your sole source of vitamin B12 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The vacancy rate for U.S. apartments hit a three - year high in the first quarter and asking rents dropped the most in at least 10 years as the number of excess apartments on the market ballooned , according to real estate research firm Reis Inc .
And the figures are forecast to get even worse as more apartment buildings are expected to open this year , increasing supply , and as the U.S. employment picture gets uglier , Reis said .
Job creation is the No. 1 driver of demand for apartments .
“ Given that things are weakening right now , any new buildings that come on will add additional pressure to landlords , ” Victor Calanog , Reis director of research , said .
The national apartment vacancy rate rose to 7.2 percent in the first quarter , up 0.60 percentage points from the prior quarter and 1.1 percentage points from a year earlier , according to the report , released on Tuesday .
Since reaching a cyclical low of 5.5 percent in the third quarter of 2008 , the U.S. apartment vacancy rate has surged 1.7 percentage points , Reis said .
It was the highest vacancy rate since the first quarter of 2002 .
That was right before the last downturn bottomed out , but Reis expects the picture to get a lot darker as “ we are arguably only at the beginning of the current downturn . ”
Behind the rising vacancy rate is a build - up of available apartments .
The number of vacant apartments added was 31,878 units in the first quarter .
This was the largest amount of excess apartments the sector has seen since the first quarter of 2002 and does not include empty condos for rent .
Asking rents fell by 0.6 percent to $ 1,046 per month , the largest single - quarter decline since Reis began reporting quarterly performance data in 1999 .
Effective rent , which factors in months of free rent , and other concessions and freebies , fell 1.1 percent to a monthly rent of $ 984 .
Some 22,833 units came online in the first quarter of 2009 , and Reis expects a total of over 90,000 units to come online through 2009 .
Many heads of apartment real estate investment trusts expect that revenue in the best markets could be flat on a year - over - year basis , David Neithercut , chief executive of Equity Residential , said last month in a conference call in which he was joined by Camden Property Trust CEO Ric Campo , Home Properties CEO Ed Pettinella , and Mid-America Apartment Communities Inc CEO Eric Bolton .
Neithercut said landlords were giving generous concessions in order to maintain occupancy rates .
In the New York metropolitan area , the largest U.S. apartment market , the vacancy rate rose 1.1 percentage points to 3.4 percent in the first quarter -- the largest single - quarter increase since at least 1999 .
Effective rent fell to $ 2,728 a month , down 2.6 percent from the prior quarter .
The decline was exceeded only by the San Francisco area , where the effective rent fell 2.8 percent to $ 1,775 .

The views expressed are his own —
If you look no further than the latest headlines , you might think a worldwide flu pandemic was already underway with a very real threat to millions of lives .
While there are many unanswered questions early on in the outbreak of flu from Mexico , it is crucial to remember that the number of deaths and reported infections remain small — even if its spread across the globe has proved worryingly rapid .
While the infected need access to medical care and anti-viral drugs , the rest of the world needs an inoculation against scary statistics and misinformation .
The Internet Age allows facts and rumour to spread almost instantaneously .
But knowing of outbreaks across the globe must not be confused with risks of catching the disease .
Already in this outbreak , Lebanon ’s health minister has called for a halt to the national custom of greeting one another with kisses .
Several countries including Russia and China have banned pork imports from Mexico and parts of the United States in the belief that meat could spread the flu .
So far , up to 149 are reported to have died of swine flu in Mexico .
The World Health Organisation has upgraded the level of pandemic threat to four on a scale of six — sustained human - to - human transmission .
Stage five signals an “ imminent ” pandemic .
However , influenza is a big killer every year , with or without a pandemic .
WHO estimates flu kills upward of 250,000 to 500,000 people year after year .
“ Normal ” flu epidemics infect 3 to 5 million a year .
Statistics are complicated by inconsistent reporting .
Flu often leads to other ailments that end up being listed as the ultimate cause of death .
Flu ’s typical victims are the elderly , the infirm or the young .
The difference with swine flu outbreak in Mexico is that otherwise healthy adults aged 20 - 50 are vulnerable .
But so far the new swine flu death rates are lower than other recent pandemic scares , a report by Barclays Capital notes .
The 2,200 swine flu infections reported have resulted in deaths in 7 percent of cases .
Avian flu has killed 61 percent of the 421 people infected since 1997 .
The death rate from SARS was around 10 percent .
Outside Mexico , 50 infections have been reported in the United States , Canada , Israel , New Zealand , Spain and Scotland .
But health experts are baffled that infections outside Mexico appear to be milder and have caused no deaths .
The world ’s most recent flu pandemic 41 years ago was the 1968 Hong Kong outbreak , which claimed one million lives .
Historically , pandemics occur about three times a century .
But like predictions of the next big earthquake , medical experts profess they have no idea when to expect the next pandemic .
Inevitably , comparisons end up turning back to the Spanish Flu of 1918 - 1920 , which killed more than 50 million people , or 2.5 percent of the world ’s population .
That scourge followed the massive troop movements of World War One at a time of poor communications and before the invention of penicillin and modern healthcare systems .
Post - war censorship rules restricted access to news , which limited the ability of communities to make informed decisions to protect themselves against the spread of the flu .
The descent into a global pandemic is not inevitable .
Air travel may spread the disease in its early stages , but modern communications and medicine can arm us to respond quickly as the disease evolves .

It is fascinating to witness policies enacted that punish the prudent and those who have been financially responsible .
I have been a fan of I Savings Bonds from the U.S. Treasury since they came out in 1998 .
For those of you who do not know what an I Savings Bond is , it is a saving vehicle composed of a fixed rate and a rate that is indexed to the CPI .
They are marketed as low - risk and liquid savings products .
The lowest return you will ever receive on I Savings Bonds is 0 percent .
This would only occur if the CPI rate turned negative .
For the first time in 11 years , the I Savings Bond rate is 0 percent .
I want to focus on the I Bond because this product highlights many problems that we are currently experiencing in our economy .
First , let us look at the fixed rate component of the product :
The only time the fixed rate part of this product has trended upward was in the late part of the 1990s when the technology bubble was raging .
But after 2000 , the fixed rate component of this product has followed a strong trend to zero .
The rate did hit zero in May of 2008 .
Currently the fixed rate stands at 0.10 % .
If the zero percent fixed rate is n’t enough to keep you away , the limit on how much of this product you can buy in a calendar year was also dropped in May of 2008 ( it used to be $ 30,000 ) :
Now this should all be further evidence that the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve want to punish savers and force Americans back onto the consumption machine .
An unintended consequence of financial crashes like this one is people start finding a desire to save .
Many do n’t follow things this closely but the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve knew people were going to start gravitating to more secure and low - risk saving vehicles .
So to create very little options for Americans , they have pushed interest rates to absolutely pathetic levels while many Americans search for secure investments away from the Wall Street casino :
So with this new found desire to save , what rate would you get with I Savings Bonds ?
Bwahahaha !
You might as well stuff your money into your mattress .
The government is now offering you 0 percent for purchasing I Savings Bonds .
Now of course , this is largely due to the negative CPI rate but you would get a lot of buyers if you offered a more lucrative fixed rate that would adjust in the next semi-annual rate adjustment .
Yet this would encourage saving money , which if you have read any over the counter finance book , is actually good for you !
But the Wall Street crony machine only wants you to pump money into stocks via your 401 k to fund the global debt casino .
That is why when we look at actual indicators on Main Street we realize the recent 31 % rally is nothing more than a reflection of pit bosses on Wall Street trading with one another .
Insiders are selling a lot more than buying .
So now , if you simply want a safe and secure investment like an I Savings Bond you are going to get zero percent for locking up your money for six months .
This is the biggest “ do not save , and go out and spend ” sign you can ever create .
This is a philosophical problem with our current economy .
The current economy is so driven by consumption that even prudent measures of savings will punish the system .
No government official would ever come out and admit this but for the most part , these actions and what has been occurring over the past decade show contempt to the American public .
Not one of my successful friends or colleagues ( Republican or Democrat ) has ever become financially independent by spending more than they earn .
You would think something as painfully obvious as spending within your means would resonate with many but it has not .
That is why the credit crunch is hitting Main Street so hard .
You want to see how ridiculous this has become ?
Take a look at this :

I ’ve put together the above chart in a clean format to show the insane amounts of debt floating in the system .
If you look at the U.S. debt side , you will see that we have some $ 115 trillion in debt / obligations through various bailouts , national , corporate , and consumer debt .
On the consumer balance sheet , you still see that residential real estate by far is still the biggest asset of most Americans .
Another 10 percent decline in real estate which is very likely would wipe out another $ 2 trillion in wealth .
The above chart is a site to behold .
It is also apparent that we will never ever pay off that debt .
Even in previous wars , we would encourage the population to buy bonds to support the cause :
Now , we just expect to finance all this debt and external expenses with no cost to citizens ?
Where is this money coming from ?
The point is that the money is not even here and at a certain point , this Ponzi scheme of an economy is going to put Bernard Madoff to shame .
We have already seen glimmers of this unfortunately with the March market lows .
The bailouts are only a sign that we are willing to put our entire future at risk to keep the debt pushers up on the taxpayer ’s dime .
If we are going to argue that we need debt , then let us create a national Good Bank and lend money out directly .
People would argue that logistically this wo n’t work but if we look at the current bailout funds , most of the money is n’t making it to the hands of consumers anyway .
I think we can somehow manage to create a decent bank with $ 10 trillion .
Saving is a hard concept for many .
People are now conditioned to expect zero down mortgages , multiple credit card offers , and zero down car loans .
It was bound to end at some point .
Our economy needs to rely on financial responsibility and an economy built on producing goods and services that the world wants and needs .
The world has enough credit default swaps and derivatives .
The message right now is to spend .
Do n’t follow that siren call .
Start saving if you have not done so even if it means getting 1 or 2 percent in a savings account .
Wall Street would want you to believe that you should put your money into the casino so it can be gambled away .
Even with the recent bear market rally , many are still looking at portfolios that are down 40 percent only a few years before retirement .
These are going to be lean economic times for many years .

Two senior Pennsylvania judges have been sentenced to seven years in prison for taking bribes from juvenile detention centers — in exchange for the bribes , the judges turned in guilty verdicts for the teens who appeared before them and sent them to juvie , thus enriching the operators of the kiddy gulag .
For this , the judges received $ 2.6 million in kickbacks .
First , the judges helped the detention centers land a county contract worth $ 58 million .
Then their alleged scheme was to guarantee the operators a steady income by detaining juveniles , often on petty stuff .
Many of the kids were railroaded , according to allegations lodged with the state Supreme Court last year by the Philadelphia - based Juvenile Law Center , an advocacy group .
In asking the court to intervene in April , the law center cited hundreds of examples where teens accused of minor mischief were pressured to waive their right to lawyers , and then shipped to a detention center .
One teen was given a 90 - day sentence for having parodied a school administrator online .
Such unwarranted detentions left " both children and parents feeling bewildered , violated and traumatized , " center lawyers said .
" Very few people would stand up " to the Luzerne judges , according to the law center 's executive director , Robert G. Schwartz .

Rush Limbaugh continues to plunge the Right further into the political abyss :
Eniviromentally friendly trains could take on carbon - intensive flights from London to Glasgow in as little as four years if the Government rethinks the rail franchising system , according to Sir Richard Branson .
The current model – under which train operators pay a premium based on projected passenger volumes to be allowed to run services on a given route – is coming under increasingly heavy fire , not just from Sir Richard .
National Express 's East Coast line has the most high - profile problems .
But it is not alone .
The majority of the current crop of 17 franchises were signed in the past few years , just before the plunge into recession .
With 80 per cent of costs fixed , and bailout clauses unlikely to kick in for the first four years , operators are increasingly exposed ( see below ) .
Sir Richard says the system is to blame .
" Negotiations are simply about who promises to pay the taxpayer the most money for the franchise , " he said .
" Instead we need to create new services and bring private sector investment into rail . "
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In practice that means a strongly capitalist vision , junking central planning of timetables and rolling stock procurements in favour of much longer franchise agreements – of at least 20 years rather than less than 10 .
" Sizeable investment is needed to tackle the issues that will put pressure on the rail network in the future : rising passenger numbers , lack of track capacity , ageing tracks , ageing train fleets , and truly antiquated stations , " Sir Richard said .
" Competition on the infrastructure side would be healthy and would get more value out . "
To some extent , he would say that .
Virgin Trains bid unsuccessfully for CrossCountry in 2007 , pushed out by a more lucrative rival – although the Government said it turned down an even higher bid .
Virgin was also pipped by National Express for the East Coast , and Sir Richard has made no secret of his intention to bid again if the beleaguered franchise comes back on the market .
But , vested interests notwithstanding , there is a point to be made .
The current phase of contracts are commonly only seven years long , providing operators with little incentive to invest in long - term infrastructure that will almost immediately be handed over to someone else , often before it has even started to pay itself off .
Instead , upgrades are left to Network Rail .
There is also some evidence to back up calls for longer deals .
The only 20 - year franchise that currently exists – Chiltern Railways – has made major infrastructure investments .
Virgin Trains itself also talks a good game .
With just £ 1bn of extra investment to upgrade the track on its West Coast Main Line route , the operator reckons it could run trains at 140 miles per hour , enabling a service leaving London for Birmingham every 15 minutes , and a journey of just 3 hours 40 minutes from London to Glasgow .
The scheme will even pay for itself , according to Virgin .
The company 's calculations put passenger numbers up by 25 - 30 per cent , revenue up by as much as £ 100 m a year , and the railway competing with domestic airlines on the Scotland route .
All within four years .
Tony Collins , the chief executive of Virgin Trains , said : " There is a big opportunity to drive passenger growth to fund the investments .
The key is to make the rail industry demand - driven , rather than taxpayer funded , by laying the foundations to keep growing passenger volume . "
More than anything , Virgin 's argument is carefully timed .
With so many franchises struggling , the Government faces lower payments than expected , even if no deals are handed back .
Network Rail is supposed to be spending £ 35 bn over the next five years , a growing proportion of which is to come from passengers ' fares .
But contribution levels were based on growth at 3 per cent per year , and passenger numbers are now expected to fall both this year and next .
Even without the dire economic climate , the balance of the franchise system was not working .
Christian Wolmar , a transport industry expert , said : " The franchise structure at the moment does n't make any sense .
There is no intellectually coherent reason for it because it does n't attract investment from private sector operators . "

To some extent , the problems are historical .
The system was devised by a Conservative government as a way to reduce state subsidy of what was believed to be an obsolete method of transportation .
But fuel prices , congestion and the green agenda have breathed new life into it , doubling passenger numbers in 15 years .
What Sir Richard 's vision does not include is a response to the unanswerable problem , illustrated so perfectly by the slew of recession - induced franchise problems , which is what to do with revenue risk .
With projections of passenger volumes proving so unreliable over just a few years , trying to extend the forecast out over two decades looks laughable .
But without risk , the franchise is little more than a management contract .
Balancing the two leads back to politics .
" Whatever franchise model is used , you get into the intellectual problem about purpose , " Mr Wolmar said : " The problem is , what is the role of the private sector here ? "
Failing franchises : Recession has exposed the system 's flaws
More and more train operators are struggling to meet their payment terms as recession exposes the flaws in the franchise system .
National Express 's East Coast Main Line deal , signed in August 2007 , agreed to pay £ 1.4bn by 2015 .
But passenger numbers have been hammered by the economic downturn , and with another two years before loss - easing subsidies kick in , the company is desperate to renegotiate .
The Government says no .
Until recently , threats to walk away – which would also forfeit the profitable East Anglia and c2 c networks – carried little weight .
But while one operator 's departure would be inconvenient , several would threaten the whole system .
And National Express is just one on a growing list .
Stagecoach is disputing its £ 1.2bn South West Trains franchise .
FirstGroup has already claimed £ 50 m in subsidies for its Great Western network , and is threatening to walk away after seven years rather than extending to 10 as expected .
Arriva is facing heavy losses on CrossCountry .
Analysts are speculating that both Arriva and South West could be handed back .
MPs said this week that the Government must have contingency plans for multiple failures , and the rot is also seeping into potential deals .
Four companies entered the race for the South Central franchise , which includes the London - to - Brighton route , in February : Govia , the incumbent , Stagecoach , National Express and NedRailways , the Dutch state operator .
But NedRailways is understood to have dropped out , while Stagecoach and National Express clearly face problems of their own .
The Bennu was the sacred bird of Heliopolis .
Bennu probably derives from the word weben , meaning “ rise ” or “ shine . ”
The Bennu was associated with the sun and represented the ba or soul of the sun god , Re .
In the Late Period , the hieroglyph of the bird was used to represent this deity directly .
As a symbol of the rising and setting sun , the Bennu was also the lord of the royal jubilee .
And lo , the winged horse of the Apocalypse bounded through the sky : Apple is acknowledging the white MacBook 's legendary hairline cracks along the bottom enclosure , and will actually fix it , regardless of your warranty .

An internal bulletin reportedly circulated last month to service providers points out four specific areas of the case that are especially to hairline cracking : the front , under the palmrests and trackpad , around the I/ O ports , near back rear corners , and around the rear vents .
When examining your cracked out MacBook , if the service provider can't find any signs it 's all your fault , the bulletin advises them to bump it for coverage by Apple even if the one - year warranty is up .
As AppleInsider notes , this effectively reverses their previous policy of not covering repairs for the MacBook 's bottom casing , which could suffer from cracking even under normal use .

Hurray for plastic MacBook owners
But really , you should just get a unibody enclosure , it 's made out of adamantium or something like that .
Duh . [ AppleInsider ]
Did you ever wonder why you always get sick after flying on an airplane only to be told , “ it ’s because of the recycled air and all the sick people sitting next to you ” ?
Today I was talking to a client about my recent trip to Hawaii and being sick from the pesticides in the place we stayed .
“ You do know that they spray all the airplanes with pesticide also , ” she added .
I had no idea !
At lunch I went home and turned to the internet to see what I could find and was shocked .
Did you know that not only are the insides of most planes sprayed with pesticides between stops but some countries also spray the passengers of the plane with pesticides before arriving !
( These countries include India , Jamaica , and Australia )
From the Mother Jones article , Danger in the Air :
The Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticide , an environmental group based in Eugene , Ore. , points out that pesticides , while dangerous on land , cause even greater harm when used on planes , because up to 50 percent of the air inside the cabins is recycled .
“ Pesticides break down slowly in the enclosed , poorly ventilated aircraft , ” says NCAP spokeswoman Becky Riley .
“ Passengers are sealed in a chamber that has been gassed , and sit there for hours . ”
From the article , Airline Passengers Are Sprayed for Bugs on the Pesticide Action Network ’s website :
The airlines are not required to inform passengers at ticket purchase of flight sprays , and there is also no control over how much pesticide is applied on the aircraft .
The Association of Flight Attendants reported in 2001 that one airline used 50 - 60 % more pesticide than the maximum recommended by the World Health Organization .
Between 2000 and 2001 , one cabin crew union received complaints of pesticide - related illness on more than 200 flights .
Many complaints cite damp surfaces and pesticide odors in crew rest compartments .
Crews and passengers have reported sinus problems , swollen and itchy eyes , cough , difficulty breathing , hoarseness , skin rashes / hives that vary in intensity , severe headaches and fatigue , and heightened sensitivity to other chemicals .
Some crew members have medical documentation of reactions consistent with nerve gas exposure , such as blood , optic nerve , and nervous system abnormalities .
There are also many lawsuits pending , filed by flight attenendants who have developed chronic disease secondary to pesticide exposure .
From the article Airlines Confronted With Pesticide Issue :
What precipitated the latest concern for airlines was a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by Houston attorney Linda Laurent on behalf of 350 United and American Airlines flight attendants against pesticide manufacturers .
In addition , a class action lawsuit filed by attendants against the same manufacturers is proceeding through the courts in Louisiana .
Laurent contends that one of the pesticides , which goes by the brand name Perigen , contains permethrin as the active ingredient .
It is applied in concentrations of 2 % .
“ The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) prohibits permethrin to be used in occupied aircraft and allows it to be used only in the cargo holds at a concentration of 0.5 % , ” the suit said .
“ Currently , application … in passenger compartments of commercial airlines is at levels of permethrin four times that permitted by the EPA for cargo use .
The EPA list permethrin as a possible human carcinogen . ”
One of the most commonly used products is made by Airosol Co. of Neodesha , Kan. , one of six companies named in a lawsuit by flight attendants .
A warning label on the can says : “ If inhaled , remove victim to fresh air .
If on skin , remove contaminated clothing and wash affected areas of the skin with soap and water .
Get medical attention if irritation persist . ”
It is truly amazing to me that airlines could get away with this , especially without passengers knowing .
Thanks Heather for bringing this to my attention !

How low can real estate prices go ?
In some cases , a buck .
Banks and mortgage companies that repossess homes are selling off the vacant , often neglected properties at unprecedented prices across Northeast Ohio .
The cheapest are in Cleveland and East Cleveland , where at least 1,400 homes were snapped up for $ 1,000 or less in 2008 -- 133 for only a dollar , according to county records .
In some cases , banks will even pay investors to take properties off their hands .
These homes are the relics of a foreclosure epidemic that has battered Greater Cleveland 's housing market over the past three years , spotting some neighborhoods with row after row of empty , decaying buildings .
The number of them selling at bargain - basement prices is increasing .
More than 60 percent of foreclosed properties in Cleveland sold for $ 10,000 or less through the first six months of 2008 , compared with about 40 percent in 2007 and less than 15 percent in 2006 , according to the Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development at Case Western Reserve University .
Most often , the buyers are large - scale investors looking to make a profit .
But , in some cases , individuals will sign their name to a deed .
Katherine Chilcote , a 29 - year - old artist , scoured low - priced real estate listings in the city , hoping to find a place to call home .
She said she was careful to find a property that had a clean title and needed only repairs that she could handle herself .
She ended up with a one - bedroom cottage on Cleveland 's West Side that she picked up from U.S. Bank for just $ 5,000 .
She and some of her more handy friends replaced stolen copper pipes , pulled up layers of carpet , refinished the natural wood floors and laid down bathroom tile .
" We worked every day for about six weeks , " she said .
" Then I moved into a house that looked like a shack and eventually made it into a home . "
Now Chilcote has a place to live rent - free just a few blocks from the new Gordon Square Arts District on Detroit Avenue .
" This economic climate is an advantage for young people like myself who do n't have much money to invest in a house , " she said .
Cheap properties still come with a price
But before scrounging up pocket change to take on a title , consider this :
The properties are typically abandoned , dilapidated and stripped of anything of value .
It can cost several thousand dollars to fix housing code violations and bring them back to livable condition -- meaning , in some neighborhoods , the cost of necessary repairs might exceed the value of the house when the work is done .
And that 's not taking into account the back taxes , utility bills and other liens that could be on the property .
Dave Sharkey , vice president of Progressive Urban Real Estate , said he 'll see the occasional steal when a bank under - prices a property that is n't in such bad shape .
His company sells properties mainly in Cleveland and its inner-ring suburbs .
But Tony Viola , president of Realty Corporation of America , a real estate agency in Cleveland that specializes in foreclosure sales , said properties that sell for a few thousand dollars or less typically come with the caveat that the buyer assume all liabilities associated with it -- which can cost thousands .
" At that price you 're dealing with houses with no mechanical systems , no plumbing , no electrical , " Viola said .
Oftentimes the homes have been condemned and are in line to be torn down by the city , but that is n't always disclosed by the seller , he said .
About half of the homes sold in Cuyahoga County last year -- and more than 80 percent of those in Cleveland -- were products of foreclosure , according to research from Cleveland State University 's Center for Housing Research & Policy .
Viola said banks typically want to recoup as much money as possible when selling a foreclosed property .
But the listed price frequently falls as the house sits unsold .
If , after price reductions , a bank still has no luck selling through a Realtor , it often will resort to selling scores of properties in bulk directly to a large investor , Viola said .
" Right now they 'll actually pay you to take a house in Cleveland or Detroit , " said James Odell Barnes , a nationally known deal maker from South Carolina who said he bought about 8,000 foreclosure properties across the country in 2008 .
In the Cleveland market , banks will sometimes give investors $ 250 per property to take them off their hands , he said .
Barnes buys the homes by the hundred , usually without ever seeing them .
" Some of them ain't worth having , " Barnes said .
" I ca n't always choose which house will work and which wo n't . "
He said he 'll sometimes buy a house that he later finds is hardly standing .
He ends up donating those to nonprofit groups that repair or demolish them .
The good ones sell as fixer - uppers to home buyers with poor credit .
Barnes or one of his investment partners clear any back taxes -- which he says average around $ 3,000 -- then might sell the property for around $ 30,000 .
Barnes provides financing to his buyers , typically at 10 percent interest over 20 years .
( A typical bank mortgage for someone with good credit runs less than 6 percent . )
The buyer is responsible for repair costs , so Barnes finds handy buyers who can do the work themselves .
But not all investors are concerned with getting the houses occupied .
" A lot of investors want instant gratification , " Barnes said .
" They do n't want to wait .
They 're just looking for a quick $ 5,000 . "
The city is watching ' flippers '
That leads some investors to turn around and quickly sell properties at a mark - up , often on eBay .
Cleveland City Councilman Tony Brancatelli said one eBay buyer from California bought a home in Slavic Village for $ 4,000 , not knowing it was slated for demolition .
When he received notice , he flew to Cleveland to try to get the home off the city 's demolition list .
" He went and looked at the house for the first time and was astonished at how much it was stripped .
In a way , I felt sorry for the guy , " he said .
" This guy would buy miscellaneous things online on eBay , then he goes and buys a house .
What was he thinking ?
Now he 's got a house that 's a $ 10,000 liability . "
Brancatelli advises that anyone who buys a distressed property be prepared to bring it up to code right away .
He said the city is getting more aggressive about enforcing housing violations and tearing down uninhabitable properties .
" You 're either going to invest in the house or the bulldozer will , " he said .
It typically costs at least $ 7,000 to demolish a house , and the owner is responsible for reimbursing the city , he said .
Cuyahoga County Treasurer Jim Rokakis said more than 12,000 properties await demolition in Cleveland and East Cleveland .
Last year , more than 1,000 were torn down .
The city 's work is evident in Cleveland 's St. Clair Superior neighborhood .
An empty lot filled with rubble from a recent tear - down sits next to a house with plywood windows and falling asbestos siding that exposes rotted wood .
" Two years ago , these could have been salvaged , " local investor Chris Grootenboer said as he gazed down a row of dilapidated homes on East 67th Street .
" But two years ago they were n't for sale . "
Grootenboer knows , because he has bought and renovated properties in the neighborhood since 2007 .
He said the lengthy foreclosure process sometimes means you can't buy a property until it 's in terrible shape .
Mike Schramm , a researcher at Case 's Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development , said properties shifting hands among multiple investors perpetuates the problem .
The longer a house stays vacant , the more its value deteriorates , he said .
" A lot of what happens to these houses is tied to neglect , " said Sharkey , of Progressive Urban .
" Say the roof is n't in the best of shape .
All it takes is one winter , and now all of a sudden there 's a leak .
A decent house can become in need of a lot of work pretty quick . "
Still , Grootenboer sees promise in the historic buildings , tired storefronts and neglected homes of the St. Clair Superior neighborhood , which borders Lake Erie and downtown .
He has bought more than a dozen properties there ranging in price from around $ 5,000 to $ 20,000 .
By renovating the properties , he says , he is filling a need for quality housing in the neighborhood .
But even Grootenboer wo n't touch the $ 1 houses , which he says are usually more trouble than they 're worth .
" People are giving these things away for a reason , " he said .
" There 's nothing for free . "

Early in the 1930s , when he was managing the Hogarth Press for Leonard and Virginia Woolf and preparing the anthology — New Signatures — that would be received as a species of generational manifesto , John Lehmann wrote that he had
heard with the tremor of excitement that an entomologist feels at the news of an unknown butterfly sighted in the depths of the forest , that behind Auden and Spender and Isherwood stood the even more legendary figure of … Edward Upward .
In that reference to the literary - political celebrities of the ’30s , Upward received his due .
In a once - famous attempt to get the whole set into one portmanteau term , which was Roy Campbell ’s coinage of MacSpaunday to comprehend the names of Louis MacNeice , Stephen Spender , W. H. Auden , and Cecil Day - Lewis , Upward was omitted altogether ( as was his friend and closest collaborator , Christopher Isherwood ) .
On the eve of Valentine ’s Day this year , at the age of 105 , the last British author to have been born in the Edwardian epoch died .
If Upward is not better known than perhaps he ought to be , it is probably because he helped instill the Communist faith in his more notorious friends , and then not only outlived them and their various apostasies but continued to practice a version of that faith himself .
( For purposes of comparison , MacNeice died in 1963 , Day - Lewis in 1972 , Auden in 1973 , Isherwood in 1986 , and Spender in 1995 , so with Upward ’s death , the last link to that era is truly snapped . )
His traces and spoor and fingerprints are to be found all over the work of those whom he so strongly mentored .
Auden dedicated “ The Exiles ” — one of the Odes in The Orators — to Upward , and made him an executor of his will when he set off to take part in the Spanish Civil War .
Upward also makes an appearance as a character in Auden ’s charade , Paid on Both Sides , published in T. S. Eliot ’s Criterion in 1930 .
In the same year , Auden sent Upward a copy of his Poems and wrote , “ I shall never know how much in these poems is filched from you via Christopher . ”
With Isherwood , who fictionalized him in Lions and Shadows under the name of Allen Chalmers , Upward co-invented the weird dystopia of Mortmere , and co-authored the fantastic gothic tales — surreal medievalism was Upward ’s term for the genre — that became grouped under that name .
Isherwood dedicated All the Conspirators to him .
Spender , in his 1935 study , The Destructive Element , presented Upward as an English Kafka .
In 1938 , the Hogarth Press published Upward ’s novel Journey to the Border , which was thought of by many as the only English effort at Marxist fiction that was likely to outlast the era in which it was written .
And then … silence .
There was some rumor of a “ nervous breakdown . ”
Nothing was heard from Upward until the early 1960s , when he abruptly produced a trilogy of didactic and autobiographical novels , each illustrating in different ways what a commitment to a Communist life could do to an aspiring author .
( When I read them , I was put in mind of something Doris Lessing once said to me about the Communist Party ’s “ Writers ’ Group , ” of which she had once been a member : everybody liked to talk about the “ problems ” of being a writer , and most of the “ problems ” came from being in the Communist Party in the first place . )
Every genuinely revolutionary technology implants some kind of " aha " moment in your memory -- the moment where you flip a switch and something magical happens , something that tells you in an instant that the rules have changed forever .
I still have vivid memories of many such moments : clicking on my first Web hyperlink in 1994 and instantly transporting to a page hosted on a server in Australia ; using Google Earth to zoom in from space directly to the satellite image of my house ; watching my 14 - month - old master the page - flipping gesture on the iPhone 's touch interface .
The latest such moment came courtesy of the Kindle , Amazon.com Inc . 's e-book reader .
A few weeks after I bought the device , I was sitting alone in a restaurant in Austin , Texas , dutifully working my way through an e-book about business and technology , when I was hit with a sudden desire to read a novel .
After a few taps on the Kindle , I was browsing the Amazon store , and within a minute or two I 'd bought and downloaded Zadie Smith 's novel " On Beauty . "
By the time the check arrived , I 'd finished the first chapter .
Aha .
I knew then that the book 's migration to the digital realm would not be a simple matter of trading ink for pixels , but would likely change the way we read , write and sell books in profound ways .
It will make it easier for us to buy books , but at the same time make it easier to stop reading them .
It will expand the universe of books at our fingertips , and transform the solitary act of reading into something far more social .
It will give writers and publishers the chance to sell more obscure books , but it may well end up undermining some of the core attributes that we have associated with book reading for more than 500 years .
I have been forcibly reminded lately that I have been doing this for quite some time .
In fact , I have been doing working with Open Source on the .
Net platform for over 5 years now .
And a few conversations with friends have given me quite a retrospective on the state of OSS .
Net .
5 years ago , it was 2004 , .
Net 1.1 was still a hot thing , and Stored Procedures on top of datasets where still a raging debate .
Open source was considered a threat and Steve Balmer was busy blasting at any OSS project that showed up .
The very existence or need for OSS on the .NET platform was frequently questioned .
I remember trying to find work in 2005 , after over a year of actively working on Open Source projects and with Rhino Mocks making steady but sure progress in the .NET TDD community and not being able to leverage that experience into job interviews .
It was only commercial experience that counted for the gate keepers .
The last 5 years have been quite interesting in the .NET ecosystem from the OSS world .
It has gotten to the point where the use of OSS tools , frameworks and platforms is no longer a strange exception , but is quite common place .
There are several data points on which I am basing this statement :
Books about OSS projects are commonly published .
Microsoft is doing a lot to encourage OSS on the .
Net platform .
NHibernate ’s download numbers are consistently above ten thousands a month , usually closer or above twenty thousands a month .
I released Windsor 2.0 not even two weeks ago , and it has over 1,200 downloads already .
The number of messages to the NHibernate users mailing list is usually above a thousands per month .
My NHibernate course sold out and I have to do a repeat course to satisfy demand .
And then , there is my own experience , both as a member in the community and as a consultant .
I see OSS being used quite often .
A lot of my engagements are about OSS tools and framework , and I am rarely the person to introduce them into the company .
I think that there are several factors playing around here , but most of that is around maturity .
The OSS players in the .NET world had had some time to work on things , and most established projects have been around for years .
NHibernate is 6 years old , Castle is 5 , Rhino Mocks 4 .
It is not the Open Source world that represent stability .
With Microsoft replacing their data access strategy every two years , it might be best to use NHibernate , because it has been around for a long time already .
There is also the issue of maturity in the ecosystem itself .
It has became quite clear that it is acceptable and even desirable to use OSS projects .
And we have companies making explicit decisions to support Open Source projects ( iMeta decision to donate 3 dev months is just one example , although the most prominent one ) .
Recently I was working with a client on strategies for Open Sourcing their software , and how to manage a good Open Source project .
In another client , a decision has been reached to put all the infrastructure stuff as Open Source , even newly developed one , because they are infrastructure .
Infrastructure is seen as a commodity , and as such , there is little value in trying to make it unique .
There is a lot of value , however , in making it Open Source and accepting improvements from others .
And I was able to point out to that client how outside contributions to the infrastructure has enabled us to do things that we would have to do ourselves .
Things are changing , I do n’t think that we are at the balance point yet , but I think that we are seeing a very big shift , happening very very slowly .
And from the Open Source perspective , things are looking quite good .
The 5 Scariest Ice Skate Lacerations Of All Time
Total Pro Sports – Reliving the gruesome video from Sunday ’s hockey game , were still trying to figure out how lucky Adam Burish of the Chicago Blackhawks really is ??.
Burish took his teammate Ben Eager ’s wayward hockey skate to the neck and thankfully only received minor scratches and burns .
In honor of this freak accident we have decided to compile a list of “ The 5 Scariest Ice Skate Lacerations Of All Time “ .
We warn you if you have a weak stomach please do not watch these videos !
5 . During a pairs skating competition in Colorado Springs , Colorado Bryce Davison ’s skate blade hits partner Jessica Dube in the face .
She is rushed off the ice suffering severe facial lacerations .
She eventually returns to action , but needs 80 stitches to repair the damage
4. On Nov 30th , 2006 during the Washington Capitals and Dallas Stars game .
Capitals defenseman Jamie Heward was hit in the face by the skate of Mike Modano .
Heward immediately dropped to his knees and then rushed off the ice to seek immediate assistance .
Jamie Heward received only multiple stitches and some plastic surgery to repair the damage .
3 . In Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals between the Detroit Red Wings and the Chicago Blackhawks , forward Adam Burish of the Blackhawks was against the boards when his teammate Ben Eager ’s skate came up hitting him in the neck causing lacerations that could have ended his career or even worse his life .
2. On March , 1989 , Buffalo Sabres goaltender Clint Malarchuk suffered one of the most horrifying injuries of all time .
Steve Tuttle of the St. Louis Blues and the Sabre ’s Uwe Krupp collided near Malarchuk ’s goal and Tuttle ’s skate sliced Malarchuk ’s neck , slicing open his external carotid artery .
With pools of blood filling virtually the entirety of the goal crease , Malarchuk somehow left the ice under his own power with the assistance of the Sabres ’ team trainer .
Clint Malarchuk spent only one night in the hospital , and was back on the ice with his team two weeks later .
1. On Febuary 11th , 2008 , Florida Panthers Richard Zednik linemate Olli Jokinen was being checked in the Sabres ’ zone – fell forward and his skate accidentally flew up and caught the right side of Zednik ’s neck .
Bleeding profusely from the cut Zednik was able to skate toward his bench where he was met by the trainer and immediately ushered to the locker room .
Thankfully Richar Zednik made a full recovery and is back on the ice playing still for the Florida Panthers .

A Tutorial for Ubuntu 9.04
About a month ago , I wrote an introduction to using the Dropbox service to backup your important data .
Any data that you backup with Dropbox is encrypted and uploaded to Amazon ’s S3 service .
Unfortunately , it is the people who run Dropbox that hold the keys used to perform this encryption .
Regardless of how great the service is , storing your files with Dropbox involves placing your trust in the people who currently run the Dropbox service , as well as all of the people who will ever run Dropbox in the future .
This is an unacceptable risk for many people and many kinds of data .
Thankfully , there is a strategy that can greatly reduce the risk .
It is possible to automatically encrypt your files , and then use Dropbox to backup the encrypted versions .
This means that you can have your cake and eat it too !
Dropbox provides a convenient backup strategy so that your files ca n’t be lost due to the theft or destruction of your laptop .
The encryption software ensures that your files ca n’t be accessed by anyone who works for Dropbox , or any hackers that might have infiltrated the servers that Dropbox uses .
If you ’re using Ubuntu , the software that you need is free , and it is n’t especially difficult to set up .
Please note that this tutorial will require you to use the command - line and edit some configuration files .
Do n’t be afraid !
I will try to explain the process in a step - by - step fashion .
If you ’re just getting started with Linux , this project might help you get used to the command - line a little bit .
( Note : this has been tested on Ubuntu 9.04 only ; I am not confident that these exact instructions will work on older versions of Ubuntu . )
Part 1 : Set Up Dropbox
The rest of this tutorial will assume that you have the Dropbox client software installed on your computer .
Detailed instructions can be found in the “ Installing Dropbox ” section of my previous post on the Dropbox service .
When you have finished following those instructions , proceed with Part 2 .
Part 2 : Removing Unencrypted Data
This section only applies if you have already used Dropbox to store some data that you would now like to encrypt .
If you have never stored any files in your Dropbox , skip ahead to Part 3 .
The first step is to take all of the contents of your Dropbox folder and back them up somewhere else .
The following command will copy everything in your Dropbox into a folder named “ DropboxBackup ” ( open a Terminal by clicking Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal ) :
cp -r ~/ Dropbox ~/DropboxBackup
Once everything has finished copying , it might even be a good idea to burn this folder to a CD , just to be safe .
Now we can proceed to delete all of the files in the Dropbox folder .
Open your Dropbox folder in the file manager by left - clicking on the Dropbox applet in the top - right .
Click the “ View ” menu and ensure that “ Show Hidden Files ” is checked .
Next , select all the files and hit the Delete key .
Dropbox should begin synchronizing the changes .
Unfortunately , once the synchronization completes , nothing will have been actually deleted yet ; the files will simply be marked as deleted , but it will still be possible to recover them .
In order to actually get rid of the files , open your web browser , go to www.getdropbox.com and log in .
Click the “ Show deleted files ” button .
For each deleted file , select the “ Purge ” option .
Part 3 : Reconfiguring the Dropbox Client
The encryption software that will allow you to secure your Dropbox is called “ EncFS “ .
It works by creating a folder in which to store an encrypted version of each of your files and folders , and then making the unencrypted names and content available in a different folder .
When we are finished with this tutorial , the folder containing the encrypted files will be stored within the Dropbox folder , and will therefore be automatically backed - up .
Since we do n’t want to accidentally store any non-encrypted files in the Dropbox folder , we will move the real Dropbox folder to a hidden location .
Right - click on the Dropbox applet and choose “ Preferences … ” ; under the “ Main ” tab , click “ Move… ” :
Move to your Home Folder and click the “ Create Folder ” button .
Give the new folder the name “ .dropbox_encrypted ” and click “ Open ” .
Close the preferences window .
On to Part 4 !
Part 4 : Configure an Encrypted Filesystem with EncFS
Now we ’re ready to actually do some encrypting .
In the commands that follow , you will need to substitute your username in place of << yourusername > >.
Open a terminal and enter these commands :
sudo apt - get install encfs libpam - mount sudo adduser << yourusername > > fuse
( As an example , if your username is “ pragmattica ” , then the command just above should be sudo adduser pragmattica fuse )
Now you need to log out and log back in again before continuing .
Next , run this command :
encfs ~/.dropbox_encrypted/Dropbox/encrypted ~/Dropbox
The encryption software will ask you a series of questions .
Enter the following responses :
Enter ‘y ’ to create the encrypted directory
Enter ‘y ’ to create the unencrypted directory
Enter ‘x ’ to choose expert Mode ( I experimented with the pre-configured paranoia mode , but encountered performance issues )
Enter ‘ 1 ’ to use the AES cipher algorithm
Enter ‘ 256 ’ for the key size
Enter ‘ 1024 ’ for the block size
Enter ‘ 1 ’ for block filename encoding
Enter ‘y ’ for filename initialization vector chaining
Enter ‘ n ’ for per-file initialization vectors
Enter ‘ n ’ for block authentication code headers
Enter ‘y ’ for file - hole pass - through
Enter and repeat the password for the new encrypted filesystem ; in order for the next part of the tutorial to work , the password must be the exact same password that you use to log in to your computer after turning it on
I ’m probably not telling you anything that you do n’t already know , so I ’ll be brief .
A good password should consist of upper and lower - case letters , numbers and punctuation characters .
It should be fairly random looking , and pretty long ; more than 20 characters , preferably .
You can now begin copying files into your / home / << yourusername > >/ Dropbox directory .
The files that you copy in should be encrypted and backed - up by Dropbox .
If you log in to the Dropbox website , all of the saved files should have meaningless gibberish names and encrypted contents .
Part 5 : Use pam_mount to Automatically Mount Your Encrypted Filesystem
At this point , it would be possible to use the command - line to manually mount your encrypted filesystem every time you turn your computer on , but we can do better .
A program named “ pam_mount ” can automatically mount the filesystem as soon as you log in .
Open a terminal and enter this command :
sudo gedit /etc/security /pam_mount.conf.xml
Look for the line :
<!--
Volume definitions -->
Right beneath that line , add this new line :
< volume user= " << yourusername > > " fstype= " fuse " path=" encfs#/home/<< yourusername>>/.dropbox_encrypted/Dropbox/encrypted " mountpoint= " / home /<< yourusername >>/ Dropbox " />
To eliminate a harmless but annoying error message , use “ sudo gedit ” as above to edit the /etc / pam.d/ common - pammount and /etc / pam.d / common-auth files and eliminate all occurrances of the word use_first_pass .
The next time you turn your computer on and log in , you should be able to go to your new / home / << yourusername > >/ Dropbox folder and see the unencrypted versions of your important files .
Unfortunately , this new folder wo n’t display the little status icons on each file , so you ’ll have to keep an eye on the Dropbox applet to know when the synchronization of your files is in progress or complete .
I think that this is a very reasonable sacrifice for the additional security .
One last tip : the icon for your secure Dropbox folder is now the same as for every other folder .
To give that folder some visual distinction , it ’s possible to change its icon .
Right - click on the folder and select “ Properties ” .
Click on the little Folder icon in the top - left of the properties dialog box and set the icon to /usr / share / icons / hicolor/64×64/apps/dropbox.png .
Security Considerations
As an added benefit , this strategy will also provide a little protection against your information being compromised by someone who steals your laptop .
The reason this only provides a little protection is due to the tendency of modern operating systems and software to scatter bits of information about while working .
The actual files themselves are encrypted , but unencrypted bits of the files might still end up lying around in temporary files or the swap partition .
An attacker with enough skill and determination would be able to find those .
Still , it ’s better than nothing .
This is probably going to be my last security - related post for a while .
I ’ve been going through a security phase lately , but I ’m feeling pretty good about the precautions that I now have in place .
Next post , I will be back to my regularly scheduled programming topics .
As always , if you have any problems with anything in the tutorial , just leave a comment .
I ’m always happy to help .

The Palestinian Struggle and the Anarchist Dilemma Comments on Gordons Anarchy Alive !
There has been very little written on the relation between anarchism and the Palestinian struggle against Isreali oppression .
Therefore it is interesting to read the discussion of this topic by an Israeli anarchist , Uri Gordon , in his recent book , Anarchy Alive !
Chapter 6 is titled ,  HomeLand : Anarchy and Joint Struggle in Palestine / Israel .  ( pp. 139 162 )
Unfortunately , the chapter is marred by an intemperate and gratuitous attack on my views .
Before getting to this , I will review his discussion .
Gordon confronts  the apparent contradiction between anarchists  commitment to support oppressed groups on the latters own terms , and those terms being in the Palestinian case a new nation - state .  ( p. 139 ) Again , he says that the conflict  between anarchist anti-imperialist commitments and their traditionally wholesale rebuttal of the state and nationalism , would seem to leave them at an impasse regarding the national liberation struggles of oppressed peoples . ( p. 152 ) This expresses the dilemma nicely .
He briefly notes that Bakunin , Gustav Landauer , and Rudolf Rockerall historically important anarchists supported a peoples attachment to its own culture and land ( including their right to secede from larger units ) but opposed national states .
Kropotkin supported national liberation struggles of stateless peoples to remove foreign domination .
Gordon could have mentioned anarchists  participation in many national liberation and anti-imperialist struggles around the world , perhaps the most famous being Nestor Mahkno in the Ukraine .
However , these examples do not resolve the dilemma of Palestine / Israel .
As he notes , most Palestinians want their own state next to Israel .
He worries that anarchist opposition to this demand could be seen as paternalism ,  saying that we know what is good for the Arabs better than they do .
More significantly , he is concerned that opposition to a Palestinian state leaves anarchists with nothing positive to say , except that Palestinians need anarchism .
But they do not yet ?
want anarchism and it is not going to happen anytime soon .
( Nor , I would add , are people likely to be persuaded of anarchism if it is seen as opposed to what they do want , namely national self - determination . )
Shall anarchists say that we refuse to support the Palestinians struggle against a brutal national oppression until the Palestinians see the light and oppose states and capitalism ?
Possible Anarchist Responses Gordon offers a series of possible responses ( by Israeli or European anarchists essentially ) to this dilemma .
A first possible response , he writes , is to accept that there is inconsistency in endorsement of Palestinian statehood by anarchists ,  ( p. 154 ) but to endorse it anyway due to the primary value of solidarity .
It may be the only  pragmatic ,  viable ,  way to counter the Palestinians oppression in the short term .  ( pp. 154 -5 ) ( I am reviewing his opinions , which I find thought - provoking , but not yet stating my own . )
A second possible response , he suggests , would deny that there is any inconsistency for anarchists .
Palestinians already live under a state , that of Israel ( including in the Occupied Territories ) .
To demand that Palestinians live under a Palestinian state instead of under that of Israel would not be unprincipled for an anti-statist , he argues .
At most it would be just as bad for the Palestinians ; at best , it might be somewhat better , due to the removal of direct foreign oppression .
His third response is anarchists can support a Palestinian state as a strategic choice  ( p. 155 ) , one step in a long term struggle .
Obviously , the region will not move immediately into anarchism ; there will be many stages to go through .
Decreasing the tensions between the Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs can open things up for further struggles around gender , sexual orientation , and class in each nation .
Having got what they wanted , the Palestinians may learn the limitations of statist solutions and continue the struggle on a new basis .
A fourth response may seem to completely contradict the other three responses .
It is to ignore the issue of national statehood while supporting day - to - day Palestinian struggles for jobs and dignity .
This includes defending farmers from attacks by Jewish settlers , opposing the wall when it cuts through villages , taking apart roadblocks , etc .
Anarchists can be engaged in as united fronts with nationalists , without agreeing with their politics .
Israeli anarchists may loyally participate in them without endorsing a Palestinian state .
He cites the work of Bill Templer , an anarchist , who recognizes that there will be an eventual two - state settlement in the short run , but focuses his work among Israelis and Palestinian villagers around such issues as resisting the wall .
Templer believes that such work will someday lead to a dual power situation as it hollows out  the state and capitalism .
( p. 161 )
Uri Gordon deserves credit for trying to face up to the anarchist dilemma in dealing with the issue of Palestinian oppression .
Although he never says which response he agrees with ( which is somewhat confusing ) , he seems to support them all to some degree .
As anyone who has consistently read my material on this site knows , I am sympathetic to an anarchist who wants to both support national movements against oppression while remaining anti-statist and anti-capitalist ( e.g. , Price , 2006 ) .
However I do not think he has quite found the proper resolution of the dilemma .
Gordons Weaknesses Gordon does not distinguish between endorsement of Palestinian statehood by anarchists ,  or anarchists can support a Palestinian state ,  on the one hand , and anarchist support or endorsement of the Palestinians national self - determination , on the other .
The first idea means that anarchists would say that we agree with the program of an independent state for Palestinians , that we think it would be a good thing for them .
This would be a drastic mistake .
It would be paternalistic in that it would not tell the Palestinians the truth as best s we see it .
Support for self - determination is quite different .
It implies that out of solidarity we defend Palestinians getting the solution they want , because they want it , even though we anarchists would not make this choice .
Similarly , we defend the freedom of workers to join the union of their choice , even though we are likely to oppose most business unions .
We defend peoples legal right to vote , as against dictatorships , even though we are anti-electoralists .
We defend the legal right to divorce , even though we neither advocate that any particular couples break up nor support bourgeois marriage .
In brief , anarchists should defend oppressed peoples freedom to make choices , without having to agree with the choices they pick .
Making their own choices is how people ( and peoples , and classes ) learn .
Further , his endorsement  and support for a new state , in the short term , misses the point that nationalism can misdirect the struggle .
While in solidarity with the Palestinian people ( who are mostly peasants , workers , and small businesspeople ) , anarchists still oppose the program of nationalism .
At best , the Palestinians could win their own , structurally independent , state .
But they would still be dominated by the world market and international power politics .
That is , they would not win real national liberation .
That needs an international revolution of the workers and all the oppressed .
The nationalist leaders have a disasterous program for the Palestinians .
Whether or not Gordon knows this , he does not insist that anarchists say this , even while supporting Palestinian struggles ( not say it at every moment of course , but over time and in various ways ) .
He never discusses how to help persuade some Palestinians of anarchism instead of nationalism .
He tries to deal with this by his suggested fourth response , in which anarchists ignore the statehood question while showing solidarity in action .
In practice , solidarity actions , united front work , is the right tactic , but eventually the statehood issue would become impossible to ignore .
Surely friendly Palestinians would want to know whether we support their freedom to have their own state or not .
What would Gordon answer ?
Templer , his model , apparently does accept the coming of a Palestinian state ; he could not ignore the issue in practice .
Gordons Attack on My Views Gordon introduces his discussion of my opinions by saying that Wayne Price descends into very crude terms . ( p. 150 ) He then quotes me :
 Israel is the oppressor and the Palestinian Arabs are the oppressed .
Therefore anarchists , and all decent people , should be on the side of the Palestinians .
Criticisms of their leaderships or their methods of fighting are all secondary ; so is recognition that the Israeli Jews are also people and also have certain collective rights .
The first step , always , is to stand with the oppressed as they fight for their freedom . ( quoted on p. 150 )
This passage does not deny that nationalist misleaders should be criticized or that some methods of fighting ( e.g. attacks on civilians ) should be criticized nor does it deny that Israeli Jews are people and that they should have certain collective rights .
But it says that anarchists ( and all decent people ) should start by being on the side of the oppressed , the Palestinians , against the state of Israel .
Frankly I thought this was noncontroversial among anarchists .
Not so for Gordon .
He writes ,  Asking all decent people to see someone elses humanity and collective rights as secondary to anything whatever this is , this is not anarchism .
This kind of attitude has become a typically leftist form of Judeophobia or anti-Semitism . ( p. 150 ) So , I am not an anarchist and am perhaps an anti-Semite !
( It is a blessing that Gordon does not like using crude terms . )
He claims that I ignore the ( small minority of ) Israelis who have worked with Palestinians .
Based on nothing whatever , he refers to  Prices complete indifference to those who consciously intervene against the occupation . ( same )
He says that they take action not because they are siding with the Palestinians ,  but rather out of a sense of responsibility and solidarity . ( same ) Responsibility for what , if not for the oppression of Palestinians by the Israeli state ?
Solidarity with whom , if not with the Palestinians ?
Earlier , he even quoted , with approval , a statement by the International Solidarity Movement , which declared a need to actively engage in resistance to the Occupation , to take sides  ( quoted on p. 142 ) That is , siding with the Palestinians . 
Again he quotes me :  We must support the resistance of the Palestinian people .
They have the right to self - determination , that is , to choose their leaders , their programs , and their methods of struggle , whatever we think .  ( quoted on p. 151 )
Gordon again goes ballistic , calling this passage ,  A blank check , then , to suicide bombings and any present or future Palestinian elite .  ( p. 151 ) But as the last phrase ( whatever we think ) should make clear , supporting the Palestinians resistance and self - determination does not mean that we have to agree with their leaders , programs , or methods of struggle .
In this I disagree with Gordon , as stated above , since he apparently does support and endorse a Palestinian state , despite its inevitable  Palestinian elite ( in Responses 1 , 2 , and 3 ) .
Interestingly , throughout this chapter , he only discusses conceivable anarchist responses to the two - state program ( Israel plus Palestine ) , never to the idea of a democratic - secular ( or binational ) single state .
Perhaps ( I speculate ) , this is due to his concern for the interests of Israeli Jews , since a two - state settlement would mean that they would keep their own , Zionist - oppressor , state ?
Gordon argues that it wrong of me to ask the movement to make demands on the Israeli , the U.S. , or any other state . 
This would be a politics of demand  which extends undue recognition and legitimation to state power .
This is  far removed from anarchism . ( p. 151 ) ( Personally I do not say that people who call themselves anarchists , but with whom I otherwise disagree , are not anarchists , nor am I interested in proving  that what I propose is anarchist . )
In any case , this is an odd attack coming from someone who is willing to consider endorsing  or supporting  the Palestinians demand for their own state ( a demand on the Israeli and U.S. states ) .
Anarchists have often made demands on the state , such as to stop waging specific wars or to release prisoners .
And we have made demands on capitalists , as in fighting for union recognition or better working conditions .
Refusing to make demands on the state or on the capitalists may sound very radical ( as if they care whether anarchists give them recognition and legitimation ! ) but it is a reformist cop -out , an abdication of the struggle .
Gordon is so upset that I denied the humanity of Israeli Jews ( which I did not do ) , that I wondered if he would be as concerned about the humanity of other oppressors .
And he is !
He quotes the revolutionary anarchist Errico Malatesta ,  The slave is always in a state of legitimate defense and consequently , his [ note ] violence against the boss , against the oppressor , is always morally justifiable . ( quoted on p. 100 ) However , Malatesta added that violence should be controlled  by taking into account human effort and human sufferings . ( same )
Gordon reacts by noting that the modern worker , even though exploited , is not the same as a chattel slave ( true , but irrelevant to Malatestas point ) .
He then writes that Malatesta is seeking a convenient way to dehumanize class enemies  for the sole purpose of making the violation of persons more palatable . ( p.100 ) This is in spite of the fact that Gordon does not come out for absolute pacifism in his discussion of violence and non-violence ( chapter 4 ) .
What Gordon wants to emphasize is the humanity of the exploiter .
Yet oppressors have never suffered from a lack of defenders .
It is the slaves , the workers , and the oppressed nations who need defendersor more precisely , comrades .
Which Side Are You On ?
I think that Uri Gordon expresses well the dilemma of anarchists in dealing with national liberation struggles .
He looks for ways to be for the oppressed nation of Palestine while remaining true to his anti-statist and anti-capitalist convictions .
While respecting his motives , and sharing them , I do not think that he succeeds .
I suggest an alternate approach based on defending national self - determination while opposing nationalism .
Unfortunately , his thought - provoking discussion is marred by intemperate attacks on my opinions .
His reaction is apparently due to his over - sensitivity toward the interests of oppressors ( such as the Israeli Jews or the capitalists his examples ) .
He objects to the idea that we should be siding with the Palestinians . 
By his own account , then , Gordon does not stand unequivocally on the side of the oppressed , the exploited , and the wretched of the earth .

" Open Source vs Closed Source -- Its about investing in People " というエントリー をFOSSBazaar経由で見つけたのだが、中身が非常に濃く、オープンソースについての含蓄ある言葉にあふれるので紹介したい。
1. Open Source is a strategy not a product
Open Source is an Information Technology strategy .
When evaluating Open Source , comparing licensing , pricing , and support options are important , but the key to a successful evaluation of Open Source is to recognize that it is strategy .
1.オープンソースというのは、製品のことではなく、戦略そのものだ
オープンソースというのは、製品のことではなく、IT戦略そのものだ。オープンソースを評価する際に、ライセンス形態や価格やサポートの充実度合いを評価することは大事なことだ。だが、オープンソースを評価する上で決定的に大事なことは、オープンソースというのは戦略そのものであるということを認識することだ。
オープンソースというのは製品のことではなくソフトウェアの開発手法である、という話は良く聞くが、「戦略そのものである」と言い切るのがかっこいい。冒頭でそう断言し、この後何故それが戦略そのものであるのかが蕩々と述べられている。
2. Open Source is an investment in People instead of Vendors When an IT executive chooses a Closed Source solution such as the Windows product line of Data center software solutions , they are choosing to invest a large portion of their budget in a vendor , in this case Microsoft .
When selecting an Open Source solution , to maximize the return on that investment , the IT executives must invest in People .
2.オープンソースというのは、ベンダーへの投資ではなく、自社の人材への投資である
IT 部門の役員が、データセンターのソフトウェアソリューションとしてWindows製品のようなクローズドソースを選ぶと言うことは、自分の持っている予算をベンダーに配分するということである。オープンソースのソリューションを選択し、投資対効果を最大にするためには、IT部門の役員は人材に投資をしなければならない。
数千万円、数億円、時として数十億の予算を持つIT部門の役員がいるわけだが、プロプライエタリのソフトウェアを使うということは、その貴重な自社のリソースをベンダーに投じるということなんだと筆者は強調する。ベンダーに投資をすれば、確かにそこからサービスをうけることができたり、ベンダーがソフトウェアの機能アップやバグフィックスのための投資をして、いくばくかの見返りをうけることができる。そうやって、外部のベンダーに巨額のお金を投じてリターンをえるというのがプロプライエタリのソフトウェアを使うというIT戦略である反面、そのお金の大半を自社のエンジニアに投資することがオープンソースというIT戦略なのだと筆者は主張する。何故、その戦略のほうが正しいのかが引き続き述べられている。
3. Open Source is about long - term exponential savings
The cost of a Microsoft solution increases exponentially but the cost of an Open Source solution remains flat regardless of how the organization scales .
A successful Open Source strategy would continue the investment in People
3.オープンソースは長期的な指数関数的コスト削減策である
マイクロソフトのソリューションのコストは組織の規模に応じて指数関数的に増大するが、オープンソースのソリューションは規模が増大してもフラットにともたれる。オープンソース戦略が成功するために、人材に継続的に投資しなければならない。
マイクロソフトでは、ユーザ数やプロセッサー数でライセンス料や保守料が課金されるため、組織が大きくなればなるほど、システムの規模が増大すればするほど、それに応じてコストというのが増大していく。一方で、オープンソースは10台のサーバに導入しても、100台のサーバに導入してもソフトウェアに支払う金額というのは変わらない。よって、規模が大きくなればなるほど、ベンダーにお金を吸い上げられるのではなく、人材に投資をすることができるし、自社の人材がソースコードレベルでソフトウェアをメンテできる限りにおいては、規模が増えてもコストは増大しない。
4. Open Source is modular and minimalist
It is this minimalist approach that provides Linux with its great stability and insane uptimes .
4.オープンソースはモジュール化されており、必要最低限のもののみを備える
この必要最低限のもののみ備えるというアプローチがLinuxに圧倒的な安定性と尋常ではない稼働率をもたらしている。
マイクロソフトのソリューションは必要なモノ、不必要なモノを含めて1つのパッケージとして提供されるが、オープンソースは本当に自分にとって必要なものだけを選択できるため効率的であるという話。不必要なモノも含めて提供されるということは、その分コストが発生しているだけではなく、面倒を見なければならない対象も増えるため、安定性やセキュリティ面で問題が生じると筆者は指摘する。
まぁ、マイクロソフトの製品はサラダ、スープ、ドリンク飲み放題、コーヒー、パン、ライス、デザートなど不要なものまで含まれた高額のランチセットのようなもので、オープンソースは必要なモノのみ選択できる柔軟性を持っているという感じか。
5. Open Source has better performance
The minimalist nature of Linux means that more resources are available to the system for running the server application that it needs to , rather than eating up resources with GUI and processes that are part of the minimal operating requirements of Windows .
5.オープンソースはより性能が高い
Linuxの必要最低限主義は、サーバーのアプリケーションが稼働するシステムにより必要なリソースを配分することを可能にする。一方で、WindowsのシステムはGUIであるとか、アプリケーションではなくWindowsそのものが必要とするプロセスが沢山あるため、逆にリソースを浪費してしまっている。
オープンソースでは、利用するソフトウェアとその機能を最低限にしぼることができるため、ソフトウェアが稼働するハードウェアのリソースそのものも削減でき、より高い性能が実現できるというはなし。
6. Open Source is about choice
Open Source provides choice and freedom of movement , so the organization can select the best solution that offers the feature , performance and scalability mix that is best for that business .
6.オープンソースとは選択そのもである
オープンソースは選択と自由を提供してくれる。それにより、組織は機能、性能、規模などの面でビジネスに最も則した最適なソリューションを選択することができる。
オープンソースを使用すれば選択肢が無限に広がるというはなし。プロプライエタリなソフトウェアを使用していると、世の中に新しい機能や考え方が出現したとしても、自分の使っているソフトウェアにそれが反映されるまでの間は使用することができない。オープンソースであれば、有象無象も含めて自身の選択として最新のソリューションを活用することができる。
7. Open Source is about saving money not spending money
The difference here is the Open Source shop is looking for a solution from a technical standpoint , the Microsoft shop is looking for a solution that meets their basic needs and fits within their budget .
The Open Source shop has the flexibility to deploy technologies now , rather than perhaps having to postpone projects for a quarter or two because of budget limitations .
7.オープンソースを活用するということは、お金を払うということではなく、節約するということだ
オープンソースという店では技術的な観点からソリューションを探すことができるのに対し、マイクロソフトという店では基本的な要件を満たしつつ、予算の範囲内のソリューションしか探すことができない。また、オープンソースという店では、予算の制約からプロジェクトを1、2四半期遅らせるなんてことなく、今現在の最新の技術を活用する柔軟性がある。
マイクロソフトの世界にいる限り、その期中の予算がまずありきで、その範囲内でしか機能を充実させることができないが、オープンソースでは予算の制約に縛られすぎずに技術的な妥当性、優位性からソリューションを選択できるというはなし。
で、以上を述べた上で筆者は下記の通り結論づける。
Conclusion
Open Source is an IT strategy and not a product .
Effective migration to Open Source requires having the right people on the team .
Third party services and consultants can be used to speed up the development of the in - house team , but ultimately the in - house team will need to be open source capable .
The long term savings and gains for the business are clear , as Open Source costs remain flat as the solution scales , whereas Microsoft solutions tend to increase exponentially in cost as the solution scales up .
オープンソースというのはプロダクトではなく、IT戦略そのものである。効果的にオープンソースに舵をきるためには、チームに正しい人をアサインしなければならない。サード・パーティのサービスやコンサルタントを活用することは、インハウスのチームを迅速に構築するためには非常に有効であるが、最終的なゴールはあくまでインハウスのチームがオープンソースを活用できるようになることだ。マイクロソフトのソリューションが規模に応じて指数関数的に増加するのに対して、オープンソースのソリューションは規模の増加に対してコストを一定に保つことができるので、長期的にはコスト削減を実現し、ビジネスに多くの利益をもたらす。

Entropia has regularly mixed real and virtual finances .
Online game Entropia Universe has been granted a licence to be a bank .
Issued by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority , the licence means the game can be more closely tied to the real world finances of players .
Mindark , the developers of the game , said it aimed to launch a fully - functioning in - game bank within the next 12 months .
At current exchange rates , 10 PED ( Project Entropia Dollars ) are worth one US dollar .
Unlike many other online games , which charge a monthly subscription fee , the software for Project Entropia is free to download and install .
However , players pay real money to get at in - game items , such as guns , armour and other gear , and the micro-payment system pays for Entropia 's running costs .
The licence will make it easier for players to convert real world cash into PEDs and sustain their characters in the game , said Mindark in a statement .
" We will be in a position to offer real bank services to the inhabitants of our virtual universe , " said Jan Welter Timkrans , boss of Mindark .
It plans to offer players interest - bearing accounts , let them deposit their salaries and pay bills or lend cash via the in - game bank .
The licence also means that each account is backed by deposit insurance to the value of $ 60,000 ( £ 42,000 ) .
Regulators will get oversight of financial transactions carried out in the game world , so they can spot if criminals are using it to launder money .
Mindark claims that more than 800,000 people have registered to play the game and 80 - 100,000 are regular players .
About $ 420 m of player - to - player transactions were carried out during 2008 , according to Mindark figures .
The scandal over ministers ' expenses , by turns comical , enraging and shaming , tells us not merely how MPs are prepared to milk the taxpayer for personal gain but also about the values and ethics of the people who have waged war on the nation 's liberties and rights , as well as about those opposition MPs who have failed to defend them .
For you cannot separate the steady misappropriation by New Labour of our liberties – taken stealthily over the last dozen years in deniable quantities – from the kind of venality exposed in both the major parties .
The two types of theft are part of the same contempt for voters ; part of the same light –fingered amorality that has allowed this government to amass power at the centre at the expense of the individual .
If you think I stretch the point , consider the authoritarian measures that ministers introduced – insisting they are for our own good – as they remove the small change from our wallets .
While the communities secretary Hazel Blears instituted a system of tension monitoring in local communities in effect , little more than a network of local spies feeding into the government 's surveillance apparatus – she was content to claim on three separate homes in order maximise both her income and her tax position .
While she trumpeted the need for ID cards to stop benefit cheats , her own claim against public funds certainly seems to fall into a bracket that most benefits investigators would regard as suspicious .
While the immigration minister Phil Woolas explained that one of the advantages of the intrusive eBorders scheme would be to monitor more closely the criminals going in and out of the country , he was apparently putting in expenses claims for women 's panty liners , wine , nappies and children 's comics ( an accusation Woolas has unconvincingly denied ) .
The greed is so pathetic it makes you weep with laughter , until you realise that Phil Woolas has been chiefly responsible for pushing through laws that will demand 53 pieces of information from everyone wishing to travel abroad , at which point anger becomes the only reaction .
For this mediocrity to be lecturing us about monitoring criminals is intolerable .
While the home secretary was posturing on the evils of lap dancing clubs and prostitution , her husband was slipping the bill for his porn movies to the taxpayer .
While , under her direction , the Home Office fear factory whipped up ever greater public anxiety about crime , Ms Smith was claiming £ 24,000 on her property in Redditch , saying that her main home was a broom cupboard in her sister 's London house .
The former chairmen of the committee on standards in public life , Sir Alistair Graham , regards this as " near fraudulent " .
Instead of resigning the only possible course of action 20 years ago — Smith reacted by saying she might sue for libel .
We can only pray she does : apart from seeing her explain the ins and outs of the property and porn issues her life , a senior government minister accounting in a public court for their hypocrisy would be greeted by considerable national glee .
The absurdity of a Home Office spokesman suggesting that Sir Alistair was guilty of " malicious falsehoods " shows how detached from reality MPs have become , especially when we learn that the HM Revenue & Customs are to investigate whether they have been evading capital gains tax .
Let me underline that point : the people who have been primly telling us that due to the current economic crisis the rich must be taxed more , are themselves now to be investigated for tax evasion .
It will not have been a problem then for the same ministers to mislead the public about the true costs of the database state , or deny its existence or tell some transparent lie about why the state needs to take and store all our personal information .
It is astonishing that no one has yet been forced out of office but when we have justice minister Jack Straw – one of the main architects of the attack on liberty – overcharging the taxpayer for mortgage bills and council tax , the revelation about the morals of this government seems hardly surprising .
This post should be occupied by an individual whose ethical standards cannot be questioned , yet we learn that only when Straw discovered that MPs ' expenses receipts would be published did he repay £ 1,500 he owed after claiming for the full council tax .
These thefts from the taxpayer , the degradation of parliament , the use of spin doctors to slander and lie and the general contempt for voters are all part of the same syndrome , and I have absolutely no doubt that the Conservatives are almost as guilty as Labour .
It may be too much to hope for , but what needs to come out of this is some kind of settlement between the people and their politicians .
The limits of power and personal expenditure must be set and the freedom of the people guaranteed by more than the word of a few dubious characters like Straw , Blears , Smith and Woolas , and a parliament that seems to have lost all sense of its duty to serve the people .
T he saint is no longer quite so saintly .
Barack Obama began his presidency promising a sea change in the way America handles civil liberties .
Now , four months later , and after a masterful – if unconvincing – attempt this week to explain his contradictions , he 's shown that he 's still an old - time Chicago pol .
Willing to wheel , willing to deal and – when the going gets tough – willing to retreat .
Americans have already figured out that Obama is a mere mortal .
But to the star - struck world outside , his abrupt reversal on the use of Guantanamo Bay military commissions is a stark reminder that the new U.S. president is more man than god .
He 's also more like George W. Bush than either would care to admit .
As a candidate for the presidency , few were harder on military commissions than Obama .
Set up by Bush to try alleged terrorists imprisoned at the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison camp , they were designed to produce guilty verdicts .
Evidence gained under torture or hearsay was permitted .
The usual rules governing civilian trials and even military courts martial were eliminated .
In the unlikely event that a defendant might be acquitted , the government reserved the right to keep him imprisoned anyway .
American military lawyers dismissed them as kangaroo courts .
Obama called them an " enormous failure . "
One of his first acts upon taking office was to indefinitely suspend the commissions – including the one set to try Canadian Omar Khadr .
Obama talked instead of trying terror suspects in the normal U.S. court system , a path he still says he'd like to follow whenever possible .
But now he says the commissions are n't that bad .
In a speech Thursday , he noted that they have a long and honourable history dating back to the U.S. revolutionary war and that , with just a bit of tweaking , these ones too should be just fine – particularly in cases where there is not enough evidence to convince a civilian judge of a defendant 's guilt .
Evidence explicitly obtained under torture will be banned .
But evidence obtained through hearsay from foreign intelligence agencies ( including those that routinely use torture ) will be permitted .
Defendants will be free to choose their own lawyers – as long as these lawyers are serving members of the U.S. armed forces .
Yet there will be some terror suspects against whom there is not enough plausible evidence for even a military commission .
These people , Obama said , will simply continue to be imprisoned indefinitely – somewhere – without any kind of trial at all .
Why the change of heart ?
It seems that Obama , like Bush , is finding that many Americans do n't much care about civil liberties – particularly the civil liberties of those they 've been told are dangerous terrorists .
Obama 's promise to close Guantanamo , while hailed by civil libertarians , is also coming under attack .
In Congress , he suffered an embarrassing setback this week when both Democrats and Republicans voted against the idea .
Americans fear that if the prison camp is closed , some of its 240 inmates , many of whom can't return to their homelands for fear of persecution , might be resettled in the U.S .

And so Obama is stuck .
He had promised open government and a return to constitutional practices .
Now he finds openness and constitutionality are politically difficult and , at times , inconvenient .
He had agreed to release more photos that show the abuse of prisoners by American soldiers .
Now , under attack from the right , he 's reversed himself .
Releasing the photos might endanger U.S. troops , he has explained .
He boasts about his decision to ban torture by government interrogators .
But read the fine print :
He would still permit the use of so - called extraordinary rendition – sending prisoners to be tortured in other countries .
And , as Central Intelligence Agency chief Leon Panetta told a Congressional committee this year , Obama has left open the possibility of authorizing harsher , unspecified interrogation techniques .
Obama once opposed Bush 's use of domestic wiretaps as an unnecessary infringement on civil liberties .
He now happily uses those same wiretaps .
As a senator , Obama staunchly fought Bush 's attempt to forge a free trade deal with Colombia because of that nation 's human - rights abuses .
He now supports the deal and has ordered his trade representative to make it happen .
None of this means that Obama is a Bush clone .
The new president at least understands the civil rights requirements of the U.S. Constitution .
He 's also more willing than Bush to spread the responsibility – and blame – to Congress and the courts when he chooses to curtail these rights .
But Obama 's about - faces , dekes and backflips are reminders that he too operates within the real constraints of American politics – a fearful population suspicious of the outside world coupled with powerful national security institutions that want to hang on to the power they 've accumulated since 9/11 .
And if that requires the sacrifice of a few Muslim foreigners imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay , then so be it .
In the world of Chicago politics , this is known as a necessary compromise .

One of the constant refrains in discussions of the various e-book readers now ( or soon to be ) on the market is the request for color .
For a large population of users , the current greyscale screens that provide the extremely low - power displays for devices like the Kindle simply are n't good enough , and there are some markets — science textbooks spring to mind — where color would really add value to the product .
It 's not clear what technology will power the first generation of color devices , but researchers are looking to steal a page from traditional print media by making colored pigments part of the future of e-books .
One of these techniques was the subject of a recent publication in Nature Photonics , written by researchers at the University of Cincinnati and Sun Chemicals .
Their technique , which they termed an electrofluidic display , relies on a combination of a small reservoir hooked up to a narrow space that sits above a reflective surface .
Under normal circumstances , an aqueous solution will retract into the reservoir , driven by what 's called Young - Laplace pressure .
Creating a voltage difference across the narrow space , however , will create an electromechanical force that draws the liquid out from the reservoir and into the space .
Simply put a pigment in the aqueous solution , and you 've got a stable , voltage - switched color pixel .
The key feature of these devices is that the reservoir takes up only five to 10 percent of the dimensions of the pixel it can fill with its contents .
Combined with the current reflective capabilities of the materials used in the device , this allows a contrast difference between the on and off states of about 55 percent , but the authors say that there 's nothing in theory that should prevent improvements from reaching over 80 percent .
Switching between on and off states can also be accomplished in a matter of milliseconds , and the authors suggest a number of optimizations , any of which could drop the refresh rates down to the point where video displays would be possible , provided the battery had the power to handle the frequent refreshes .
The one structural limitation with the device is that you do n't want to stack too many pigments in a single pixel , lest the five - to - 10 - percent figure for the reservoir starts adding up .
So , the authors actually intend for each individual device to form a sub- pixel , much as is already in use on many computer displays .
The authors suggest using two reservoirs per subpixel , with a total of four subpixels .
These would work in two possible combinations .
One would be an RGB - blank combination , where the three colors and an empty reservoir were combined with a black pigment that controlled reflectance .
Alternately , a more complicated CMYK display is possible .
The materials involved — water - soluble pigments , reflective aluminum , and a transparent indium - tin - oxide — are all fairly standard , and producing these devices involves standard photolithography techniques .
If the above optimizations pan out , the authors claim that the resulting device " can hide the pigment or reveal the pigment with a visual brilliance that is similar to pigment printed on paper . "
Meanwhile , researchers at Philips are looking at a system that would allow manufacturers to avoid using a composite pixel of this sort .
In this device , a single reservoir holds two different pigments ( the researchers are targeting a CMYK display ) with different charge properties .
By carefully manipulating the voltage on the device , different amounts of each pigment will flow out of the reservoir , providing careful control over the color of the pixel .
Philips has n't been very generous with the details on how that control is provided , however .
In any case , the striking aspect of both techniques is how they 're a bit of a return to the past .
Pigment - based colors have a long history in print , as they provide vibrant and stable color when paired with a highly reflective white paper .
Given their properties , it 's no real surprise that they may make a return in the electronic era .

" Official data shows the world passed its peak temperatures 10 years ago , but sadly the BBC and ' Global Warming apologists ' are now attempting to cover up the facts " said Piers Corbyn , ' climate realist ' , astrophysicist & long range weather & climate forecaster , 24 April , in response to the BBC's ' Quiet Sun baffling astronomers ' report .
"
In timely backing of the UK Government 's £ 1 billion Carbon budget and similar moves in the USA , the BBC and Prof Lockwood of Southampton University distort the facts in an attempt to cover - up the proven centrality of the sun in controlling world temperatures " , said Piers .
" They make the ignorant and loaded claim that '... Current slight dimming of the sun was not going to reverse the rise in global temperatures caused by the burning of fossil fuels ' .
This is treble confusion because ( 1 ) the world is already cooling even though CO2 is rising ; ( 2 ) there is no evidence that the burning of fossil fuels ever did or ever will drive world temperatures and ( 3 ) reputable and informed solar scientists know that there is a lot more to the sun 's influence on the world than its dimness or brightness . "
" It appears the BBC and Prof Lockwood hope to coax the public into believing coal burning drives climate by telling us that another discredited theory - that of solar dimming - does n't work .
This approach is disingenuous .
It is astounding that such arguments as bizarre as ' It 's not a dog so it must be a cat ' emanate from a member of the UK Natural Environment Research Council .
"
It is well known that world temperatures primarily follow the sun 's magnetic cycle of 22 years , so obviously half the time temperatures will move oppositely to the 11 year cycle of tiny solar dimming and brightening .
Prof Lockwood has been reminded of this fact on a number of occasions yet he is still recycling this old chestnut .
With scientific leadership of this calibre what hope has the UK of clawing its way out of recession on the back of sound investment in science and technology ?
"
" The latest advances in Sun-Earth relations show not only the primacy of magnetic - particle links between the sun and the earth but that these are modulated by lunar effects to give the observed 60 year cycle in both world and USA temperatures .
This means that the world will continue general cooling at least to 2030 .
Neither the 60 year cycle , nor the 22 year cycle nor any fluctuations in world tempertaures over the last 100 years , thousand years or million years can be explained by changes in CO2 .
Furthermore advances in understanding of Sun-Earth magnetic and particle activity are being applied to successfully predict dangerous weather and climate change events months and years ahead ; whereas all predictions of the CO2 - centred theory have failed and will continue to fail and anti-CO2 taxes and measures will never stop a single extreme weather event .
The UN's Climate Change committee ( the IPCC ) have still failed to respond to requests from an international group of scientists to provide data evidence for the CO2 theory .
" Tragically the BBC is driven by a political agenda to propagate failed science rather than report on front - line advances in this field of key scientific and political import .
The BBC and NERC boycotted the International Climate Change Conference New York 8 - 10 March which is a great pity because they missed sound refutations of the theory of man-made global warming and many world - class reports on scientific advance "
" One wonders if Prof Lockwood 's place on the Natural Environment Research Council and the well - known opposition of its Chief Executive to ' Climate Sceptics ' are not dimming his scientific faculties " queried Piers ( See NERC - Register of interests . )

Our lives are inundated with practicality and productivity .
We think that if there ’s no purpose to something , there ’s no point in doing it .
In reality the best things in life have no purpose .
We sacrifice our time and our sanity doing what we do n’t want to do , so at some future point we will create the freedom to do what we love .
We seek happiness in things .
We seek happiness in the acceptance of others , in material possessions , in social status .
We even search for happiness in some future - promised afterlife .
We sabotage ourselves and our entire lives because we fail to understand a very simple but easily overlooked fact .
The Search for Happiness is the Single Greatest Cause of Misery
You ca n’t find something that ’s already there .
Happiness exists now .
It ’s not something you have to find .
That ’s like trying to find your breath .
It ’s the grasping of the mind that causes unhappiness .
If you ’re not happy , it ’s because your mind does n’t allow you be happy .
And the reason your mind does n’t let you be happy , is because you ’re stuck in the vicious cycle of productivity , judgment and purpose .
That ’s not to say productivity is bad , or that doing things that have a purpose is wrong .
It ’s basing the reason for your existence on them that causes so much anguish .
When we place our happiness solely in “ getting ” something , completing a certain number of tasks on our to - do list , or achieving a goal , we ’re fooling ourselves .
We ’re like a rabbit with a carrot stick attached to our heads .
We keep chasing the carrot , but we never get there .
We never stop to think that it might be the chasing that ’s causing the problem .
We ’re too distracted trying to find a better way to beat the game .
As soon as we reach one level of success , we ’re hurrying to upgrade our search and move on to the next level of the chase .
We never stop to think that it ’s not the failure to win the game that causes our grief , but the game itself .
We neglect to realize that sometimes the best way to solve a problem is to stop participating in the problem .
Sometimes the best way to to solve a problem is to just stop caring ( see : not giving a damn ) .
Sometimes …
The best way to solve the problem of not having a lot of cool friends is to stop caring about having cool friends .
The smartest way to be happy with the place you live is to stop caring about living in a two story house with a pool , a fireplace , central air and satellite TV .
The simplest way to be content with yourself is not to achieve greatness and praise , but to accept yourself fully for who you are now .
.
The quickest route to happiness is to stop caring about finding happiness and to start being happiness .
By not caring , we immediately release ourselves of the grasping of the mind .
But it ’s not easy to stay in this mindset ( the mind loves to grasp ) ; it ’s something we have to constantly cultivate .
It ’s especially difficult when our society tends to place more value on things , than on experiences .
We value what we do more than how we feel .
This is completely ridiculous when you think about it .
Because the way you feel should be more important than anything else .
Is n’t the purpose of everything you do to feel good ?
Is n’t the purpose of that new car , that promotion , or college degree to give you a feeling of accomplishment ?
Is n’t that supposed to make you happy ?
The problem with this is we ’re basing our happiness on temporary things .
We ’re deriving our joy from an achievement , or an attainment .
This is n’t true happiness ; it ’s an addiction .
We get a short burst of endorphins to our bloodstream from our new TV / television , or new iPhone , and then what happens ?
It disappears .
It leaves us feeling empty and we begin looking for our next fix .
Our advertising and consumer culture does n’t help this much .
We are constantly bombarded with messages that we need this , or we need that .
Incessantly , we hear : “ Buy this and it will solve your problem ! ”
If only we could solve that problem we may finally be happy .
Wrong .
It ’s not the problems that are the problem .
I mean , buying a more efficient vacuum or sowing on that button you ’ve been meaning to for seven years is great .
You may feel a sense of achievement for a few moments or days .
But you ’re still looking for happiness in a thing .
It ’s the same with productivity .
If only we could finish all of the things on our to - do list , could we be content .
If only we could accomplish all of our goals , could we finally be gratified .
This thinking is based on the illusion that you ’ll reach a certain point where everything is done .
You finally made it !
There ’s nothing left in your inbox , all your projects are complete and your lifelong goals are achieved !
Now you can rest easy .
But this point never seems to come , does it ?
That ’s because there will always be things to do .
There will always be challenges , because everything in life is constantly changing .
If you reached a point in your life where you had no more problems , no more struggles , no more worries , life would stop .
The game would end and there would be no point left in playing .
So … what can we do about this ?
We Need to Stop Caring
That does n’t mean we stop trying to achieve our goals or striving for personal growth .
It just means that we no longer base our happiness on fleeting , semi-permanent things .
There are obviously some situations where not caring may have serious negative consequences ( see paying your rent ) .
Excessive caring , however , is likely to make you miserable .
The reason caring too much can be detrimental to your health , is you ’re so focused on the future .
Your identity is too attached to outcomes .
If something does , or does n’t go your way , it will likely have an enduring effect on your mood for the rest of the day .
Instead , we should base our happiness on permanent things .
Things that do n’t change .
Desires that do n’t shift from moment to moment .
We choose to find our happiness in living .
In life itself .
In fact , we do n’t even need to “ find ” happiness .
We can be happiness .
So stop searching .
You ca n’t find something that ’s already there .

Journalist Simon Winchester reflects on the price he is still paying for betraying the trust of a group of islanders in the South Atlantic Ocean nearly a quarter of a century ago .
Tristan da Cunha has a population of 300 British nationals I am currently sitting on a boat , wallowing in a south Atlantic ocean swell , five cables off the rocky coastline of the most isolated , permanently - populated island in the world .
My fellow passengers have just landed and I swear a few moments ago , through powerful binoculars , I saw my wife waving to me from a sheep - filled meadow .
But I am pinioned here on deck six of the motor yacht Corinthian II , prevented from landing by a very large policeman .
Many of our passengers are lawyers and suggest suing .
It is all about freedom of speech , they insist .
Twenty - four years ago I wrote a few rather innocent - sounding lines in a book and in consequence I have been banned - apparently for life - from the island that lies forbidden before me ; the tiny British colonial possession of Tristan da Cunha .
Morse code
Three hundred British citizens live on Tristan , all of them huddled on the lower slopes of a volcano in a tiny settlement called Edinburgh of the Seven Seas .
Most of the islanders make their living fishing for crayfish in the rough waters here or around the neighbour - islets of Nightingale and Inaccessible .
The island has a UK postcode so residents can order goods online
They are 1,800 sea-miles from the nearest land , South Africa , and they see outsiders only intermittently .
Thirty years ago they communicated only by Morse code .
Sixty years ago all their business was conducted by barter ( to send a letter to England cost five potatoes ) .
They are perhaps remembered best for a rather ironic coda to their one near - catastrophe .
In October 1961 their volcano erupted and the entire population was picked up by a Royal Navy destroyer and brought back to England , where they were put up in a disused military base in Hampshire .
But despite the supposed delights of our civilisation ( cars , television , lifts ) - none of which they had ever seen - the entire population opted to go back , once the leviathan had quietened down .
Their spare and simple lives , they decided , were much preferable to the complicated bustle of ours .
Brief romance I went first in 1983 , again a little later .
The volcano was still hissing out sulphurous fogs , causing many boatmen to wheeze .
Otherwise there was an air of settled contentment about the place .
The islanders were kindly , polite , shy .
The older ones spoke in a curiously old - fashioned way .
Lots of " thees " and " thous " , unfamiliar words like " ganzeys " for sweaters and " ammunitions " for socks .
I liked it and was happy there .
So , evidently , was a young naval officer who was based in Tristan during the war when Whitehall reclassified the island as a ship , HMS Atlantic Isle .
He was very happy , not least because he had a brief and tenderly unconsummated romance with a local girl named Emily ... and wrote about it .
I quoted two paragraphs from his book in an account I wrote in 1985 and that , I later learned to my great dismay , was my undoing .
I had betrayed what was apparently an island secret and for that I would not be forgiven .
Ethics of tourism
So when 15 years later I arrived ( quite unsuspecting ) on a cruise ship and lectured about Tristan to the passengers , I was told I would not be allowed to land .
The Island Council had forbidden it .
I was perplexed and somewhat embarrassed .
This time I was more prepared and last December I wrote to the British diplomat who serves on Tristan .
He put it to the Council and replied that they had decided I would not be permitted to land " on this occasion or , indeed , ever . "
The island was first sighted in 1506 by a Portuguese sailor , Tristao da Cunha And such it has turned out to be .
A policemen boarded us , apologised and said that if it was up to him , of course I could come ashore , " but the older islanders , you know , they feel it was a secret betrayed . "
Many of our passengers are lawyers and suggest suing .
It is all about freedom of speech , they insist .
I am British , the islands are British .
How dare they ?
Could a village in Yorkshire ban you because you wrote something they did not like ?
And yet I am not sure I do not sympathise with the Tristanians .
Travel brings with it many responsibilities : not to damage the environment , to " take only pictures , leave only footprints " as the mantra has it .
But we , in our clumsy outsider way can unwittingly do other and less obvious damage too , like imposing , breaching codes , violating secrets .
I have to conclude that a quarter of a century ago I did so too .
So melancholy though it may be for me , I am inclined to believe that I have been given a late - term lesson in the ethics of tourism and that the people of Tristan , in obliging me to stay away and remain here , were quite probably ... absolutely right .

The clione , a .k.a. sea angel , is a cute , translucent swimming sea slug that glides gracefully through icy ocean waters by flapping a pair of appendages that resemble tiny angel wings .
Do n't let the innocent , angelic look fool you , though -- the clione is a vicious demon come feeding time .
+ A verdadeira face
The Clione limacina species preys on its shelled cousin , the sea butterfly ( Limacina helicina ) .
When the hungry sea angel spots a suitable target , it lunges forward and rapidly unfurls a halo of six hooked tentacles from its head , locking its prey in a death grip .
Slowly , the clione sucks the victim 's body out of its shell , swallowing it whole .
As our SCFOM fantasy baseball teams begin their inevitable annual slide toward oblivion , the quest to consume every nugget of baseball information commenced in earnest this past weekend .
It took us from Yahoo ! to ESPN SI.com , and finally to a place called MLBlogs.com , which is an official affiliate of MLB.com — you know , Major League Baseball ’s actual website .
So at first , everything seemed great .
We were getting hot scoops from completely random people with no real baseball knowledge or insight , but then things got a lot less …kosher .
You see , apparently one of the sites worthy of MLB ’s blessing is Jews on First — a nonsensical compilation of everything all the Jews in Major League Baseball did on the diamond the day before .
The blog ’s author , who does n’t give his name , says he started the site to :
Honor my Jewish heritage and to highlight and celebrate Jewish major leaguers , past and present .
Well , hey , that ’s pretty fun , right !?
Why be a fan of one team when you can just be a fan of guys who share a religion with you ?
Think about it : why put all your eggs in one basket ?
Instead root for a guy or two on every team , and , when it comes time to hand out those World Series rings , you can pretty much rest assured that someone out there will be bringing one home for the Jews .
Anyway , it got us thinking .
What other incredibly underrepresented minorities are out there , just struggling to get by ?
What ethnic or demograhic group needs our support more than the teams we grew up with ?
Well , duh , white guys in the NBA .
Once part of a proud tradition , the white guy in the NBA is no longer a star player .
Rather he roots his butt off ( almost exclusively from the bench ) , and takes those minutes when he can get them — usually at the end of the game with his team either up by 30 or down by 50 .
With that as a backdrop , here ’s your daily dose of what the white guys in the NBA did yesterday .
Seriously , this is all of them :
Steve Blake , G , Portland Trail Blazers
This guy actually starts !
Holy crap !
In Portland ’s loss to the Rockets , Blake scored 11 points , and dished out eight assists ( team - high ! ) in 43 minutes .
Brent Barry , G , Houston Rockets
Barry ’s club took a 2 - 1 series lead , and they can probably thank Barry , who did not play — coach ’s decision .
Joel Przybilla , C , Portland Trail Blazers
Presumably by virtue of being the tallest person in the state of Oregon , Przybilla earned the starting job in Portland .
He made the most of it on Sunday , tallying a team - high 12 rebounds .
J.J. Redick , G , Orlando Magic
Redick missed all three of his three - point tries , but managed two points and two rebounds in five minutes of play .
Yay !
Wally Szczerbiak , G/F , Cleveland Cavaliers
Wally punched his ticket to Round 2 with an impressive 15 minutes of play in which he scored four points ( 2 - 2 on FTs ) and grabbed four rebounds .
Kirk Hinrich , G , Chicago Bulls
Hinrich came off the bench and scorched the Celtics to the tune of 18 points , three rebounds and four assists .
Brad Miller , C , Chicago Bulls
In the proud tradition of Bill Wennington , Will Perdue and probably some other guys , Brad Miller is the Bulls ’ white big man .
In 24 minutes , he grabbed five rebounds , and scored 12 points !
Brian Scalabrine , C , Boston Celtics
No one ’s gonna mistake Brian Scalabrine for Larry Bird , but he might be our new favorite player .
He managed to foul out in just 18 minutes !
A couple of weeks ago there was a Ruby conference in San Francisco called GoGaRuCo ( Golden Gate Ruby Conference ) .
This conference has grabbed attention due to a talk at which the presenter illustrated a discussion of CouchDB by using sexually suggestive pictures of women .
Unsurprisingly the result has been a fair bit of heated , and occasionally offensive , debate .
The main lines of the debate are familiar .
Various people , not all women , lay the charge that the images and general tone was offensive .
Such material makes women feel degraded and alienated .
This kind of presentation would not be tolerated at most professional events .
Defenders of the presenter point out that the slides were humorous and no offense was intended .
The Rails community has always had a edginess to it - in part because much of the Rails community is focused on the rejection of enterprise values - both technologically and socially .
David Heinemeier Hansson is happy to proclaim himself as an R rated individual and is happy to consign " professional " to the same pit to which he cast " enterprise " .
I 'll admit to finding much to like in the general edginess of the Rails world .
Innovation often involves seeing a generally accepted line and vaulting over it .
There 's plenty of precious posturing around the software world that I 'm glad to see skewered .
Many of us have been delighted at how Rails has cheekily whacked over - complex frameworks , vendor bloatware , and other assorted ills .
An important target of this skewer has been the rise of corporate blandness , where a fear of offense has transformed into a fear of any authentic communication and the rise of the anodyne press release .
I 'm right with the rails people on this - software is too much fun to shriveled up in dry talks and writing .
So the view of the rails leadership seems to be this : that the objections to the presentation are yet another attempt to foist empty corporate values on the thriving Rails ecosystem .
Except on this occasion I do n't see the suits as the people doing the complaining .
Most of those calling foul are women who have had to struggle with very real sexism in their careers , and men who have seen this and side with those women .
They have been fighting the suits since before the Rails leadership were born , and for much higher stakes .
This incident has now grown beyond a conference presentation and a slide - deck on the web .
The issue is no longer the presentation , but the reaction of the community to this event .
The leaders , particularly David Heinemeier Hansson as the most visible figure , now face an important time in influencing what the future of the community will be .
The reaction of the rails leadership thus far is to deny the offense .
I 'll say now that I do n't believe they are sexist .
I believe that they did n't think the talk would give this much offense - and even that they do n't think the talk should give offense .
At this point there 's an important principle .
I can't choose whether someone is offended by my actions .
I can choose whether I care .
The nub is that whatever the presenter may think , people were offended - both in the talk and those who saw the slides later .
It does n't matter whether or not you think the slides were pornographic .
The question is does the presenter , and the wider community , care that women feel disturbed , uncomfortable , marginalized and a little scared .
It 's my view that the people in a community have the power to set the tone of that community , to decide what is and is not acceptable behavior within it .
If something questionable happens and people remain silent , that is an implicit acceptance of that event .
That is why I feel compelled to write this page , because I think that this talk , and more importantly the rails leadership response to this talk , is objectionable .
My observation is that most men in the software business think that there is n't much sexism left in the profession - that this curse is a memory from a previous generation .
Yet when I talk to women , I hear a different story .
Nearly every one can tell me recent stories where they were clearly expected to feel degraded and belittled because of their gender .
So some sexually suggestive pictures are n't a joke to them , they are a pointed reminder of disturbing behavior , and a reminder that such events can happen again at any time .
One of the great difficulties for white guys like me is that we have n't been in that position ; where prejudice can appear out of any corner , reinforced by the fact that every other face looks different .
This becomes more of an issue because the rails world faces a notable lack of women .
The software world struggles with Diversity as it is .
It 's a problem for our profession , in that we lose access to talent , and it's a problem for many women who do n't get the chance to develop a satisfying career in programming .
The open - source world in general has even bigger issue , and the rails community perhaps more so .
I 'm sure it's not the only factor but the encouragement of talks like this creates an unwelcoming atmosphere of NetNastiness which deters many women from starting and staying in the community .
There also seems to be a generational factor in this .
My colleagues have noticed that younger women , typically those under 30 , are much less conscious of sexism than their older colleagues .
This is partly because of the successes their elders have had in opening up the workplace to women .
It may also because younger women have n't yet met the glass ceiling ( and I hope it will be gone before they get there ) .
Younger women also seem much more tolerant of sexual imagery .
Yet I do n't think this is cause for complacency .
An important element in nurturing women in our profession is to have role - models who can show what 's possible .
Alienating older women makes it harder to do that .
So where does this go ?
I wo n't attempt to predict the future , but there is a scenario where this little presentation may be seen as a defining event in the rails story .
This does n't mean that people will suddenly leave in droves , but it does begin with a few departures , such as Mike Gunderloy's .
The community continues with more alienating events , encouraged by the fact that those who are more sensitive are no longer around to object .
This encourages more departures as people do n't want to be associated with such a community .
Thus develops a positive feedback loop making the rails world increasingly brash and unwelcoming for many of us .
I have a different vision - one that sticks it to the suits so hard it will make their eyes water .
How about a community where women are valued for their ability to program and not by the thickness of their skin ?
How about a community that edgily pushes new boundaries without reinforcing long running evils ?
Perhaps even a community where women reach equal numbers ?
Such a community would hand the suits the defeat in the long battle women have been fighting for centuries .
I 'd love to be part of that .
Some thoughts on common statements
These pictures were less revealing and sexual that what you 'd find in a mainstream movie
This is where the context matters .
Watching a movie is a different social space to being in a software development talk .
As result people react differently .
It is important to realize that the same behavior can be appropriate or inappropriate for different people in different positions .
The risqué banter between partners and often in teams ( mixed and unmixed ) can be normal and healthy .
But a newcomer who is not part of that group may perceive that same banter as demeaning or threatening .
The corollary is that when strangers are around you need to be more careful about what you say .
-- Chris Stevenson
These kinds of sexualized images have long been associated with men's clubs .
Condoning a presentation like this can imply that the powerful ( the community leadership ) wants this atmosphere , to create a context that excludes women .
I do n't think the rails leadership actually wants to do this , but if someone did want to do create such a group , this would be a good way to go about it .
Women should n't get so annoyed , men do n't when women make reverse jokes
You can't ignore history .
Women have been comprehensively discriminated against for generations , indeed in most societies in the world they still are .
It 's the same reason why it 's insensitive to make jokes about blacks and slavery or jews and the holocaust .
The joke makes it look like you think the actual wrong was no big deal .

If you always worry about people being offended , you 'll just end up being bland Yes , that 's a real risk .
But being aware of causing offense does n't mean you have to dial all the way down to corporate blandness .
It means thinking how what you will cause offense and being comfortable with the result .
You may feel that certain people should be deal with being offended , you may think that only a very small amount of people will be offended .
That can be a reasonable response , but it has to be a thoughtful response .
As often , I find my black colleague Chad Wathington puts it well : I think we do n't have to get caught up in managing to every insult .
I do think that people who have privilege need to do their best to not offend marginalized groups , realizing that no one is going to be perfect .
Best effort is good enough as long as we respond gracefully and truthfully when we fail .
As someone on the receiving end , I 've always maintained that my job is be compassionate during those failures -- Chad Wathington
The presenter made an apology
The presenter effectively said " I 'm sorry you were offended " - that translates to " do n't be so thin - skinned " .
The presenter claims that he was n't intending to be offensive , and I can believe that .
But his failing is not realizing that what he considers to be offensive is n't the same as that of some of the audience .
His pseudo - apology suggests to me that either he does n't care that those people were offended , or does n't understand how they could be offended - probably the latter .

The people who were offended are being thin - skinned .
That 's a comment often made by those who condone NetNastiness , but it does n't help those who are offended .
The crucial point is : do we want to create an environment where " thin - skinned " people are n't welcome ?
After all the consequence of a society that is tolerant of nastiness and bullying is one where only the thick - skinned need apply .
I 'd prefer that people are welcomed for their ability in software development , not their ability to withstand offense .
This goes further than just our profession .
To be successful as software developers , we need to collaborate with people in other fields .
Tolerating this degree of nastiness makes it difficult for people in other walks of life to work with us , which impoverishes us all .
Humor is an important tool to puncture the self - important I agree , but this only works if the power relationship is in the right direction .
Someone of low power poking fun at a powerful person is a different situation to someone with lots of power skewering someone with little power .
Women are ( still ) in a position of low power in our society ( particularly in software development ) so we have to be more careful with our humor .
Should be organizer be blamed for this ?
No .
It 's not up to the organizers to vet talks .
Certainly it 's up to the organizers to choose talks , but there 's no way they can be responsible for what happens on the day .
It 's sad that all of this has landed on GoGaRuCo and I think Josh Susser 's No .

If an organizer rejected a talk like this , that would be censorship It 's not censorship .
Censorship is when the powerful stop people organizing their own conference , or prevent people publishing their own web site or pamphlets .
A conference organizer or a web site host has the responsibility to set the tone for that space .
An important part of this is selecting content .
Not every talk that 's offered gets accepted , and the choices the organizer makes determines what the conference is like .
Organizers will reject poor quality talks all the time , and it 's reasonable to say that offensive talks are poor quality .

You 're just trying to impose your moral and ' professional ' standards on us
You might be surprised by my personal attitude to sexuality .
But the point is not about judging various standards , it 's about whether we want to make a group of people feel alienated .
When looking at this I ask : " who is being offended " and " do I care about that group " .

This is no worse than what happens in other professions I do n't know , although I 've certainly encountered more overt sexism in worlds other than software .
But I do n't think that 's relevant - we should do what we can to make our environment so that it does n't exclude worthwhile people .

Can we get off this subject now and on to important technical issues ?
Actually I think a social issue like this is worth spending time on .
To build software effectively you have to be able to collaborate with other people , both other programmers and people outside of the software community .
Discussions like this help us understand how we relate with other people , which makes a huge contribution to both our professional and personal lives .
Being a professional is n't just about being good at your job , it 's about being proud of the impact you have on the world in general .
We have a duty to make the world a better place .

A US radio talk show host says he will sue the British government for defamation after being placed on a list of people banned from entering the UK .
Conservative political commentator Michael Savage , real name Michael Alan Weiner , is one of 22 people barred for fostering extremism or hate .
He has described the Islamic holy book the Koran as " a book of hate " and questioned cases of autism .
Mr Weiner said he opposed violence and objected to being linked to murderers .
To put me in league with Hamas murderers who kill people on buses is defamation
Michael Savage
Profile : Michael Savage
He told his radio audience that he was intending to sue British Home Secretary Jacqui Smith , who he described as the " lunatic ... Home Secretary of England " .
" To link me up with skinheads who are killing people in Russia , to put me in league with Hamas murderers who kill people on buses is defamation , " he said .
In an article posted on his website , he said he did not advocate violence but " traditional values " .
He wrote : " What does that say about the government of England ?
It says more about them than it says about me . "
Lawyers say it would be difficult for Mr Weiner to bring an action for defamation given that the list was issued with the authority of the British government .
They note that English law recognises that there are cases when there is a legitimate and public interest in information being made widely available , and that unless the government acted out of improper motives for placing him on the list , any libel claim is unlikely to get very far .
Public list Mr Weiner has offended many in the US with his views on immigration , Islam and rape .
He also angered the parents of children with autism by saying most cases were " a brat who has n't been told to cut the act out " , the Associated Press reported .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It is a privilege , not a right to gain access to any country if you are not a resident Steve , Harrogate
The UK has been able to ban people who promote hatred , terrorist violence or serious criminal activity since 2005 , but the list was only made public for the first time this week .
Hamas MP Yunis Al - Astal and Jewish extremist Mike Guzovsky are among the 16 named people by the Home Office as being excluded .
Also excluded are two leaders of a violent Russian skinhead gang , the ex-Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard Stephen ' Don ' Black and neo -Nazi Erich Gliebe .
The remaining six have not been named , as doing so would not be in the public interest , the government said .

False DUI arrests .
Made up traffic violations .
Excessive force .
Derogatory slurs .
These are just some of the allegations against Chicago police officer Richard Fiorito , who faces seven separate lawsuits claiming he targeted gays and lesbians .
And there could be more to come .
And was it all done in the name of billing the city for overtime pay ?
Fiorito , 60 , who refused comment to the Chicago Tribune , “ allegedly rang up false charges so frequently against lesbian and gay drivers in the heart of the gay North Halsted entertainment district that out of his earshot , his fellow officers disparaged the charges to the people he pulled over , ” claims a release from the Chicago - based Gay Liberation Network .
Reports the Tribune : “ In some of the lawsuits , the plaintiffs have also said excessive force was used against them , including in a suit filed in February , which alleges Fiorito grabbed Shawn Rauch by the throat in the police station , shoved him against a wall and called him a slur for a homosexual .
Of the cases filed , prosecutors dismissed DUI charges against two plaintiffs , and a jury found another not guilty of DUI .
In another case , a judge ruled the officer had no grounds to arrest the plaintiff for DUI , Erickson said . ”
Among the allegations , says GLN :
It is not known where the mother and son spent the past week
A US mother and her cancer - stricken son have returned voluntarily after fleeing Minnesota to avoid court - ordered chemotherapy for the 13 - year - old boy .
Doctors checked Daniel Hauser after the pair returned on a charter flight from an unnamed location , an official said .
Colleen Hauser had said she wished to treat Daniel 's cancer with natural methods , citing religious beliefs .
The Brown County sheriff said he had dropped an arrest warrant for Mrs Hauser , calling it a " good day " .
Bruce Bostrom , the doctor who diagnosed Daniel 's cancer in January , also said he was happy to hear of the boy 's return .
" I 'm delighted , " Dr Bostrom told the Associated Press news agency .
" I 've been so worried that he was going to die ...
I 've been praying for his safe return , so I think my prayers will be answered . "
The mother and son failed to attend a court hearing on Tuesday after a court - ordered X - ray showed Daniel had a tumour in his chest .
Daniel underwent one round of chemotherapy in February , but stopped after that single treatment , citing religious beliefs .
He is diagnosed with Hodgkin 's lymphoma , a highly curable form of cancer when treated with chemotherapy and radiation .
Doctors had warned that he would probably die without conventional treatment .
Speaking last week at the family 's farm near Sleepy Eye - a town of 3,500 about 80 miles ( 130 km ) from Minneapolis - the boy 's father appealed to his wife and son to return .
Anthony Hauser said the pair had fled without telling him their plans .
He suggested they might have gone to California , en route to alternative cancer clinics in Mexico .
" We suggest that increases in lightning activity in hurricanes are related to enhanced convection that increases the rate of moistening of the lower troposphere , which in turn leads to the intensification of hurricanes , " the researchers wrote in the journal Nature Geoscience .

Cheeky crackers used a cross-site scripting flaw on the web sites of the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) to inject listings from controversial torrent links site The Pirate Bay .
Vektor , a member of the Team Elite group of hackers , smuggled links culled from the The Pirate Bay into content served up when surfers visited the MPAA 's recommended list of sites .
The MPAA 's legal action against The Pirate makes the supposed endorsement ironic and embarrassing , if not completely unexpected .
Cross - site scripting ( XSS ) security flaws on websites are all too commonplace and the MPAA is a high - profile target , especially after the four defendants in The Pirate Bay trial were found guilty in a recent high - profile trial .
So it was only really a question of time until hackers managed to find a chink in its armour to exploit .
Earlier denial of service attacks against entertainment industry websites scored limited successes in the aftermath of The Pirate Bay verdict on 17 April .
According to Vektor , the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) website is vulnerable to similar flaws as those he exploited to embarrass the MPAA earlier this week , Softpedia reports .
Vektor used this flaw to inject a listings from Mininova , another well known torrent tracker , into pop -up windows displayed when users visited portions of the RIAA website .
Although the MPAA has reportedly addressed the flaws on its main website following the attack , other MPAA - controlled websites involved in movie ratings remain vulnerable to much the same type of exploit .
Screengrabs illustrating the mischief wrought by Team Elite on the RIAA and movierating .org websites can be found via Softpedia here .
The vulnerabilities create a means for rogue iFrames from third - party servers to be presented to surfers as if they came from the site they are visiting , when in reality they come from locations determined by hackers .
XSS flaws on both the MPAA ( examples here ) and RIAA ( here ) websites have cropped up from time to time in the past , a quick search of security website XSSed reveals .
Security suppliers , such as application security firm Fortify , said that Vector 's attacks against the RIAA and MPAA were each effectively accidents waiting to happen .
" That such sites are open to XSS - driven incursions and alterations comes as no surprise , given the fact that so many sites are poorly programmed and therefore open to such attacks , " said Richard Kirk , a director at Fortify .
" The MPAA is lucky that Vektor 's attack was a proof - of - concept one , and intended as something of a joke .
The next time they - and other organisations whose sites are vulnerable to XSS - driven attacks , may not be so lucky , " he added . ®
Hey there , if you know of my blog for it 's first post , then chances are that you know me and therefore do n't need a lengthy explanation of who I am .
If you do n't , here is a quick rundown .
I used to be an aspiring professional photographer in California .
Now I am an ex-aspiring professional photographer turned aspiring Mechanical Engineer in Chicago .
Problems making up my mind in life ?
Maybe .
As far as why I have this blog , the reason is pretty basic .
Since I stopped working as a photographer for the time being , I have kind of let the pursuit of that form of art drop out of my life and my skills stagnate .
This blog thing is just an excuse to go through the many thousands of old images that I have and do some of the post - production that I never bothered to do before , and hopefully bring to life and share some good images that might otherwise be wasted .
Too , I really need to get myself shooting new stuff again , even if it is n't on the production level that I got used to .
Perhaps this will be the excuse I need to dust off the old Canon ( or if I 'm feeling up for it , the 4x5 View Camera . )
I 'm not really out to show off anything amazing here , and I 'm kind of going to start off with alot of my early images from when I just picked up a camera .
I was n't really " technically " good or anything back then so the images are n't really stunning ; but that 's when it was the most fun for me , and that 's what I 'm trying to make this all about again .
Anyhoo , thanks for having a look .
If photo is your thing , I 'd love to get as in - depth of a critique as you 'd care to give .
Of course , I have to kick things off with an image or two ...
These few images are from a little trek I took with my Brother and my friend Chris to an abandoned coal processing plant on the south side of Chicago back in 2005 .
I do n't know if the place is still there , but it made for a pretty interesting day just poking around and taking photos .

There are some wonderfully descriptive and colorful words I ’d like to hear on television .
I know that they ’re being uttered ; after all , most of us can read lips to a certain degree .
Our ears may hear bleep , but our eyes see lips moving that say shit , asshole , fuck , cocksucker , and motherfucker .
Sometimes our ears will gather additional evidence .
They will hear mother followed by bleep instead of fucker .
Sometimes the ears will detect ass followed by bleep or bleep followed by hole but never the compete asshole .
But the ears never hear cock followed by bleep or bleep followed by sucker because , it seems , Almighty Television Execs think cocksucker is so reviled a concept as to ever be partially bleeped .
I rarely view pricey premium channels such as HBO or Showtime .
But my friends who can afford such luxuries assure me that there ’s rarely if ever a bleep to be heard .
It ’s shit and fuck and motherfucker and cocksucker , etc. , as far as the eye can see ( or , rather , the ear can hear ) .
The broadcast networks , of course , do n’t even offer any profanity to bleep .
( Well , maybe the occasional nipple , but that ’s not the issue here . )
Apparently , the Federal Communications Commission fines them ( in the public interest , of course ) for transgressing against something called “ public decency . ”
( We all know , of course , that offending the public with profanity is n’t the real reason — the networks just do n’t want to piss off the advertisers . )
Basic cable is my only hope for a little guilty pleasure .
Would n’t comedian and social critic Lewis Black ’s unbleeped HBO “ Red , White & Screwed ” special be much more delicious if Comedy Central ’s reprises of it did n’t bleep every instance of Mr. Black ’s fuck and shit and the occasional dickhead ?
Comedy Central does n’t demand that Jon Stewart clean up his language during live taping of The Daily Show — yet bleeps his utterances of asshole and fuck when the show airs .
And then there ’s the lovely , demure Kathy Griffin on Bravo ( winner of two Emmys , as she likes to point out ) .
She ’s a true potty mouth .
We all know what she ’s saying .
She drops the offending profanities with aplomb .
She ’ll even use hand motions to emphasize the language .
Yet Bravo bleeps them all .
That ’s hardly brave of Bravo , the basic cable channel that says it “ delivers the best in food , fashion , beauty , design and pop culture to the most engaged , upscale and educated audience in cable . ”
Surely such an audience can deal with the occasional shit , fuck , motherfucker , and cocksucker uttered by some of its performers .
Surely such an audience does not need the “ wink - wink , nudge - nudge ” that bleeping represents .
Hell , even basic cable channel AMC bleeps the use of shit in “ Blazing Saddles . ”
Why is AMC so wimpy about such a low - level profanity in that Mel Brooks classic movie ?
I like the occasional , well - timed profanity .
I ’ve even used it in my classroom .
( Committing such rhetorical sins , however , as a professor at a Catholic university probably means I ’ll be plenty warm during my afterlife . )
I should confess , though , that I prefer limits to my liking or use of profanity .
Like any rhetorical device , if overused , profanity loses its capacity to convey shock , emphasis , and powerful emotion .
We all know , of course , people who drop fuck , shit , asshole , and motherfucker into every possible utterance .
From the lips of those people , profanity is merely noise shrouding a lack of signal .
Lewis Black , Jon Stewart , Kathy Griffin , Mel Brooks and other comedic social commentators are not such people :
They are desperately needed signal trying to break through overwhelming noise .
I wish basic cable would just let me hear what my eyes can see .
It ’s particularly egregious when Comedy Central , of all basic cable channels , bleeps profanity .
After all , this is the network that put a counter on screen to record the 162 utterances of shit in a South Park episode .
Comedy Central broke linguistic ground with that show — then promptly threw the dirt back into the hole it dug in social norms .
To those TV chieftains who serve as basic cable ’s Highest Authorities on What May Be Heard , who deny my ears the profane audio of these social critics to accompany the video my eyes can see , I say fuck ‘ em .
If viewers of these comedians object to not bleeping shit , asshole , fuck , cocksucker , and motherfucker , I ask :
Why the fuck are you watching those shows in the first place ?
What is a Recession ?
Recession is the guarded word of last resort for politicians , business leaders and bankers .
Economically , a recession is defined as the decline in the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) for two or more consecutive quarters .
Prior to the Great Depression of 1930 , there was no term to describe this short - term economic cycle .
The relatively mild economic downturns between 1910 and 1913 were called depressions but would now qualify as modern day recessions .
Because the economic definition does not address several key economic factors , the National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) has expanded recessionary qualifications to include employment conditions , industrial production , real income , wholesale and retail sales and pricing trends .
Typically a recession commences when economic results have peaked and business activity begins a downward shift .
The recession lasts until the business activity level reaches its trough and expansion begins .
Prior to the current economic conditions , the worst recession existed from November 1973 until March 1975 when the GDP fell 4.9 % .
Economists now track several key components to predict a recession .
Stock Market Activity – Since 1946 , when the stock market has fallen 10 % or more , a recession has resulted .
Unemployment Rate –
Three consecutive months with increasing unemployment signals a recession .
Index of Leading Indicators – A composition of 10 economic indicators that is used to predict upcoming recessions .
Since 1959 , this scale has correctly predicted 7 recessions and improperly warned of 5 recessions .
Applying the basic economic definition of a recession to the U.S. economy would indicate that since 1980 there have been 4 recessions .
The current , or fifth post 1980 recession , is the most severe .
When a Recession becomes a Depression
Exactly How Bad is it ?
Between 1929 and 1933 , the GDP fell by 30 % as national unemployment capped at 25 % in 1933 .
Although there was no clear economic definition for a depression , there was no doubt the country was mired in The Great Depression .
Today , economists agree that a depression exists when a recession endures for an extended period and when the GDP falls by 10 % or more .
Perhaps the most memorable description of a depression was presented by candidate Ronald Reagan in a 1980 Labor Day Speech describing Jimmy Carter ’s faltering economic platform ;
“ Let the record show that when the American people cried out for economic help , Jimmy Carter took refuge behind a dictionary .
Well , if it ’s a definition he wants , I ’ll give him one .
A recession is when your neighbor loses his job .
A depression is when you lose yours .
And , recovery is when Jimmy Carter loses his . ”
To voters , Reagan ’s speech was poignant .
The reality is that while the difference between recession and depression is an economic distinction , the American public takes both conditions personally .
Everyman wants a job and looks to elected officials to put differences aside and stem the tide by approving whatever legislation is necessary to get the economy back on track .
When confronted by a prolonged recession or depression , the American voters want answers and solutions .
In the wake of severe personal financial strain , Americans expect government to pull out the stops and take whatever action is necessary to decrease unemployment and cure the credit crises .
How to End a Recession ?
Current conditions Current U.S. Unemployment Hits 7.6 %
S & P 500 = – 14.405 %
US GDP ( 12-31-08 ) - 3.8 %
US Fed Funds Rate = - 0.03 %
Consumer Price Index = +0.4 % The United States is clearly in a recession and Americans want corrective action .
Since the Great Depression , four strategies to counteract recessionary trends have evolved .
Deficit Spending – Increased government spending to create economic growth is acknowledged as the most rapid spark for stimulating economic growth .
Tax Cuts – Activating a series of tax cuts that encourage capital investment by industry is a supply - side remedy .
Laissez - faire – Another approach is government “ inaction . ”
This remedy is based on the belief that markets adjust and remedy themselves .
Federal Reserve Action – The Federal Reserve has been effective at moderating recessions by adjusting rates to combat inflation and inspire economic growth .
President Obama has aggressively advocated for a stimulus package .
In his address to the joint chambers of Congress on February 24 , 2009 , the President made it clear that it will require more governmental investment to reverse current disturbing economic trends .
President Obama is committed to extending unemployment benefits , easing health care increases , expanding Green Economics and reducing military spending .
American polls indicate the country is less concerned with an immediate deficit increase than with the state of unemployment and the banking destabilization .
In reality , when President Reagan combated a deep recession in 1983 , the deficits peaked at 6 % of the GDP .
With the new stimulus package , the federal deficit has increased to 7 % .
Providing a formula for the reversal of current economic trends is on the table , Americans show a willingness to tackle this deficit on the wings of the expected economic expansion .
As The President made clear , “ the day of reckoning has arrived . ”

A new online storefront for social networking sites from [ ToldYa.com ] ( http://www.toldya.com) debuts today and claims to outshine other widgets designed to cash in on the social media craze by keeping the transactions at the original site and by not requiring merchant accounts .
The ToldYa eStore is a three - by - four - inch mini store that can be embedded and posted at social networking sites , blogs or Web sites and can be customized with images , text or video .
Shoppers can browse , checkout , select shipping methods and pay for their items within the eStore app , without leaving the page for a third - party service such as PayPal , according to the company , which gets a 99 - cent transaction fee for sold items .
Unlike eBay , which now prohibits money orders , ToldYa eStores can accept cash or credit , and the company provides tools for order tracking and processing in the seller 's Told Ya account .
The news comes at a time when many online store owners and retailers are trying to capitalize on the millions of members -- Facebook has some 200 million active users -- frequenting social networking sites .
Anyone can brand their business , for instance , by creating a fan or business page at Facebook .
And , some big retailers , for example Sears , have Facebook pages , but primarily businesses use Facebook for promotional purposes and link back to their online store for actual transactions .
Plus , widgets and other mini apps exist that link to online stores , but to date , e-commerce has yet to take off at social networking sites .
Aside from payment logistics and despite the fact that people are more inclined to buy something from a friend or even a friend - of - a- friend , it appears most social networking site members see them as social hubs , and quite simply , are more interested in socializing than in buying things .
Told Ya seems to think that will change if the logistics are streamlined , saying that the lack of commerce exists because other apps require casual sellers to have a merchant account or because too many steps are involved in the buying transaction .
" The leading consumer e-commerce marketplaces such as eBay , Amazon and Craigslist have yet to truly adapt their offerings for Web 2.0 .
These sites do n't allow users to easily share listings on social media sites , other than posting affiliate links that market products from other sellers .
" Additionally , any purchase made must be checked out at the e-commerce marketplace -- so even if you could figure out how to post a link on your Facebook profile to a bicycle you 're selling on eBay , your friends will have to leave Facebook and checkout at eBay .
With a Told Ya estore you never leave the page you are viewing while you are shopping , " Michael Birnholz , chief executive officer and founder of ToldYa , said in a statement .
It remains to be seen if e-commerce will truly happen at Facebook and other social media sites -- and if Told Ya is the company that will be one of the first to do so .
If it does , you can bet the folks there will say , " Told ya so . "
A jury has convicted an ex-soldier of raping a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and fatally shooting her after killing her parents and younger sister .
The verdict came Thursday in a civilian Kentucky court against former Pfc. Steven Dale Green .
The 24 - year - old faces a possible death sentence when the penalty phase of the trial begins Monday .
Green had been discharged from the Army before he was charged in the Iraq crimes .
The verdict follows more than 10 hours of jury deliberations after a trial that began April 27 .
Green 's defense team had asked jurors to consider the " context " of war , saying soldiers lacked leadership and received little help from the Army to deal with the loss of friends in combat .
Green had been serving with the 101st Airborne Division in Iraq when he attacked the family .
A prosecutor on Wednesday told jurors the slaying of an Iraqi family , including a teen daughter who was raped , was premeditated and asked the panel to convict an ex-soldier of crimes that could bring him the death penalty .
" This was a crime that was committed in cold blood , " Assistant U.S. Attorney Marisa Ford said in closing arguments in the federal trial of former Pfc. Steven Dale Green , 24 , of Midland , Texas .
Defense attorneys argued for a conviction on lesser charges , which would eliminate the possibility of the death penalty .
Jurors began deliberating Wednesday , eight days after the trial began in U.S. District Court in western Kentucky .
Jurors ended the day without a verdict and were scheduled to resume deliberations Thursday morning .
Green had pleaded not guilty to charges that he raped 14 - year - old Abeer Qassim al - Janabi and shot her , her parents and younger sister to death in March 2006 in their home south of Baghdad .
Green went with three other soldiers to the home , where two of the men raped the teen while Green shot the family , Ford said .
Green then raped
Abeer before shooting her in the head , the prosecutor said .
Multiple witnesses identified Green as the triggerman .
The soldiers decided to go to the house after the family was mentioned during a whiskey - soaked conversation about sex with Iraqi women , Ford said .
During closing arguments ,
Ford also rejected any claim that Green was under unusual stress from being in a war zone and losing friends in combat .
" There is nothing in everything you heard in this case that shows his thinking or judgment was impaired in any way , " Ford said .
But defense attorney Scott Wendelsdorf said jurors needed to take into account Green 's stress and the Army 's failure to address it .
Jurors heard testimony that Green had spoken before the attack about having thoughts of killing Iraqis .
" Did Steven Green uphold the honor of the Army ?
Hell no , " Wendelsdorf said .
" Did the Army do its part ?
I think not . "
Three other soldiers who were there during the attack are serving lengthy sentences in military prison but are eligible for parole .
A fourth soldier had remained behind at a nearby checkpoint and pleaded guilty to being an accessory .
Green is being tried in a civilian court because he was discharged from the Army before being charged .
His trial is in Paducah because of the western Kentucky city 's proximity to Fort Campbell on the Kentucky - Tennessee border , where Green was based with the 101st Airborne Division .
Green was discharged from the Army in May 2006 after being diagnosed with a personality disorder .

A few days ago , someone on my flist posted something that had a casual mention of a drug that is used to cause lactation .
I do n't remember who it was , or what the post was actually about , see , but I ended up getting sucked down the Intertubes for hours because if ot , and it was some hours before I re-surfaced in the middle of a lake many miles away .
Lactation in human beings is largely mediated by a hormone called , naturally enough , " prolactin . "
But that 's not the interesting bit .
The interesting bit is about sex .
This is prolactin .
It 's a hormone produced by human beings in the breast during breast feeding ( it causes the production of milk ) and in the brain during orgasm .
As is typical with many hormones , it serves double duty and has a number of different roles ; evolutionary biology never starts with a clean slate , so we get hormones in one part of the body repurposed to do something completely different in another part of the body ( and we also get fucked - up design night mares like the knee ... but I digress ) .
Its role in the brain is interesting .
it's what keeps you from wanting to fuck all the time .
When ( most ) people have an orgasm , there 's a drop in sexual arousal immediately afterward .
There 's usually a refractory period , during which you can't get off again , and there 's a generalized , overall decrease in libido .
The length of time it lasts varies all over the map ; for some folks it 's a few minutes , for other folks it 's the rest of the day , or at least until the rerun of " Buffy the Vampire Slayer " is over .
Prolactin is the cause .
When it 's released in the brain during and after orgasm , the role of prolactin is to stomp all over your arousal like it was a narc at a biker rally .
A while ago , a bunch of scientists far better at getting funded than I am worked out a way to get paid for watching people masturbate ; they found some heroic volunters , hooked them up to blood sampling equipment , then monitored the levels of various hormones in their blood while the volunteers masturbated to orgasm .
The experiment was repeated with volunteers who could experience multiple orgasms
What they found , aside from the fact that getting paid to watch women masturbate isis that the production of prolactin is directly correlated to the post - orgasmic crash ; the prolactin remains in the body for hours ( or longer ) ; while the level of prolactin is high , arousal is difficult or impossible ; and people who have multiple orgasms do n't have this spike in prolactin in their blood after they get off .
All this , I already knew .
Being the transhumanist that I am , which is often just a way of saying being the pragmatist that I am , I 've long thought that the easiest path to becoming multiply orgasmic would probably be to develop a drug that blocks the action of prolactin .
Snap , job done .
Take a pill , get off again and again and again and again .
And then some more after that .
What I did n't realize was that such drugs already exist .
So here I am , reading LJ , and I find a passing reference to a drug that induces lactation .
Since I had n't heard of it before , I do what I always do with novel words or ideas -- I consulted the Oracle at Google .
The Oracle at Google is wise and all - knowing , but she can also be a temperamental and difficult oracle , for she often sows her information with the seeds of more things you did n't know , which in turn lead to more things you didnt know , and still more things you did n't know , inducing you to submerge yourself in the waters of human knowledge and not come up for air until you 're reading about the history of Hadrian 's
Wall when all you 'd asked for was perhaps the best ways to trim a cat 's claws .
Anyway , lactation can be induced in women by means of drugs that enhance the action of prolactin , or that stimulate prolactin production .
Lactation can also be prevented , naturally enough , by drugs which block the effects of prolactin , of which there are two , cabergoline and bromocriptine .
Now , there are a lot of other reasons why you might want to block prolactin , which have nothing to do with lactation .
Excess prolactin is responsible for a number of other conditions ; certain forms of pituitary disease cause excess levels of prolactin , which can lead to cancers , arthritis and other autoimmune diseases , and a whole host of other stuff you do n't want .
So there 's a medical need for drugs that block prolactin .
As it turns out , there 's a relationship between prolactin and a completely different compound , the neurotransmitter dopamine .
Dopamine also serves multiple functions .
It 's the neurotransmitter that signals nerves in your voluntary motor centers of your brain ; when you think about moving your arm , your motor centers produce dopamine , which turns into the nerve impulses that make your arm actually move .
It 's also a key component of the so - called " reward center " of the brain that mediates feelings of pleasure ; when you delight in anything from a beautiful painting to the knowledge that you 're getting paid to watch people masturbate , dopamine is the reason .
And dopamine mediates much of the sexual system of the brain , including the functions that cause physical arousal .
Dopamine and prolactin are mutually antagonistic .
Dopamine tends to inhibit the function and production of prolactin , and excess prolactin tends to inhibit the function of dopamine .
For that reasons , things that are antagonistic to prolactin tend to enhance the function or quantity of dopamine in the brain , and vice - versa .
Okay , so here 's where things get really cool .
There is a devastating disease called Parkinson 's disease which results in gradual , irreversible destruction of the dopamine - producing cells in the motor area of the brain , which leads to gradual , creeping paralysis .
Because it 's caused by the loss of dopamine - producing cells , anything which acts to stimulate the production of dopamine in the brain will tend to reverse the paralysis , so dopamine - enhancing drugs are often used to treat Parkinson's .
Now , as I 've already mentioned , drugs that block prolactin tend to enhance dopamine , and vice versa .
The drug bromocriptine is a prolactin antagonist and a dopamine agonist ; for that reason , it 's often used to treat both Parkinson 's disease and certain pituitary disorders that cause excess prolactin production .
The down side is that it has a number of fairly nasty side effects in some people , including such unpleasantness as psychosis .
Cabergoline is another drug that works the same way as bromocriptine ; like bromocriptine , cabergoline is used to treat Parkinson 's disease and pituitary disease .
It , too , blocks prolactin and enhances dopamine , and it has fewer nasty side effects .
One interesting side effect reported in both men and women being treated for things like Parkinson 's is multiple orgasms .
Which is a hell of a side effect , if you ask me .
In fact , cabergoline ( and , to a lesser extent , bromocriptine ) are sometimes prescribed off - label to counteract the sexual side effects of antidepressants ( which modify the action of dopamine ) , and as treatments for sexual dysfunction
So it turns out , as is often the case , that not only was I right in thinking that a prolactin - blocking drug might allow folks to have multiple orgasms , but that , as usual , other folks had already beaten me to the punch .
The moral lesson here is to be careful what you write about in your LiveJournal .
The simple mention of an unfamiliar word can suck someone down into the bowels of the Internet for hours on end , and not only that , can spread viral - like through LiveJournal psts to other folks , who may get sucked down for hours on end plumbing the depths of biochemistry or stellar nucleosynthesis , as this post in 's journal so aptly shows .
In the interests of getting things done in the office , I hereby ask that all the folks on my friends list refrain from posting anything interesting , and instead confine themselves to discussions of reruns of " Friends " for the next three days , kay ?

Set the initial state to " RUNNING " .
Change the value of one of the predicate variables .
The predicate can now be considered equal .
Test the state machine for any state changes .
Here , there are changes because the transition that was previously added to the state machine will evaluate to true , causing the target of the transition to become the active state .
The state machine is now in a " STOPPED " state .
In the UML , state machines help modelers understand the various states the system in question goes through .
When the system is in one state , the available behavior differs from when the system is in another state .
Visualizing these states by drawing them as UML elements is an extremely powerful tool .
State machines are not only powerful for examining the potential states of a given system , but also in helping to understand the transitions that could potentially take place between these states .
In object - orientated systems , the concept of objects being in one state or another is often implemented in code , even if implicitly .
Given that this is object - oriented code we are working with , and the whole idea behind object orientation is to assist with creating realistic abstractions , why not use the concept of state machines directly in code ?
Theversion of the boduch Python library tries to realize this possibility .
Although this is the first iteration of this new feature , with lots of work left to do , it seems promising .
Below is an example of the newclass in use .
Be brief overview of the above code follows below .
Creative beer names are commonplace in the craft brewing world these days , but some brewers were at the forefront of this trend , like our local favorite , Flying Dog Brewery .
Below are ten of our favorite classic strange beer names .
How many have you tried ?
It ’s a splendid , satisfying Winter Porter at 6 % — a souped - up version of the classic Entire Butt Porter that you ’ve enjoyed in the past .
Everyone wants a piece of Santa ’s Butt .
This special porter is made for winter — rich and warming , the way they like it in the North Pole .
It was inspired by this famous line from a well - loved children ’s story book : “ And Santa sat on his great butt , drinking a hearty brew . ”
Pours a chocolate brown with a white head that leaves a good amount of lacing .
Not a whole lot to me on the nose that really sticks out … maybe some toasted nuts and malts .
The taste is a different story , some bitterness , nuts , malts , and hop flavor that really melds together well .
Mouthfeel is light - medium in body with a perfect amount of carbonation .
Great beer , even better name .
You do not need a high - sounding name to sell beers always , the Old Speckled Hen is proof for that .
It is an impeccable combination of sweet and bitter tastes .
The drunks who used to build MG automobiles back those days used one vehicle to ferry them around the factory , which they called – “ The old speckled ‘ un . ”
On the 50th anniversary of the car , this popular beer brand saw the light of the day .
It was marketed with slightly different brand name to make it more acceptable to the consumers .
Another masterpiece from Peter Scholey at Ridgeway Brewing .
Seriously Bad Elf is Peters ’s very English interpretation of a Belgian Tripel , brewed to warming 9 % alcohol , especially for his rapidly - growing American following .
Seriously Bad Elf has been banned in Connecticut !
That little red speck you see in the background of the label ?
Why , that ’s none other than Kris Kringle , Santa Claus , who , according to the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection , cannot appear on a beer label .
That first taste , the best part of a beer after a long day .
We want to make that better than ever .
So we made Moose Drool .
The name sounds a little iffy , but it ’s really the best Brown
Ale you ’ll ever taste .
That ’s why Moose Drool is far and away the best - selling beer brewed in Montana .
A malty beer with just enough hop presence to keep it from being too sweet .
Another great beer with a great name .
This one pours brown with deep red highlights .
The head is pretty thick and sits at about one finger , leaving a few light patches of lacing .
Toasty malt is first on the nose with some bittersweet tones and hints of fruits and malty molasses and licorice .
The taste is n’t far off at all ; toasted malts first on the tongue with an oddly sweet tartness in the finish .
The taste is a little stronger than the aroma .
This beer is an offering from Columbia - based Shaftebury .
“ 4:20 ” can be almost mythically related to Marijuana , typically a West Coast Culture .
There is a deep bonding between 4:20 and the Marijuana / Cannabis culture .
To the people at Shaftebury , this name for their new beer product seemed to be an obvious choice .
From the Bluegrass Brewing company , a Belgian style ale .
This higher alcohol ( 7.5 % ) beer is brewed with Belgian malt and yeast and spiced with coriander , sweet orange peel , and an additional secret spice .
This beer is a full - bodied amber ale .
With a big malt body balanced by it ’s spices .
Taste is full of the chewy , syrupy fruit and malts along with a slight tartness and bitterness from the hops .
Wheaty , dry grains are accompanied by a spiciness that I ca n’t put my finger on but reminds me of cinnamon , allspice or nutmeg .
The spice throws the taste a little off - balance .
The feel is super - sticky , somewhat viscous , and slightly stale .
Bad Frog Beer
Bad Frog Beer is an American beer company founded by Jim Wauldron , a tee shirt salesman , and based in Rose City , Michigan .
Bad Frog beer is a light colored amber beer with a moderate hop and medium body character .
The beer generated controversy and publicity because its label features a frog extending its second of four fingers , presumably the middle finger .
The slogan is “ Beer so good it ’s bad ” .
Flying Dog in Heat Wheat
She taunts and teases …
In - Heat Wheat is a German - style Hefeweizen .
She is a full flavor beer , perfect for the more adventurous craft beer drinker .
The addition of malted white wheat gives this brew its smooth , full mouthfeel .
A proprietary yeast creates intriguing flavors of bananas and cloves .
The chorus for nationalizing America 's struggling banks is growing louder , and support for the idea comes from strange sources .
Alan Greenspan has said that he understands that " once in a hundred years " the government needs to take over the banks , and now is the time .
Sen. Lindsey Graham , a Republican from South Carolina , has called for doing what works and " if nationalization is what works , then we should do it . "
That is the kind of pragmatism that leads to socialism .
There ...
In a large Python program such as IMVU , startup time is dominated by Python module imports .
Take these warm timings :
$ time python -c ' None ' real 0m0.096s user 0m0.077s sys 0m0.061s $ time python - c ' import urllib2 ' real 0m0.314s user 0m0.155s sys 0m0.186s
That 's 300 ms for a single basic dependency .
Importing the entire IMVU client takes 1.5s warm and 20s cold on a typical user 's machine .
The IMVU client 's loading progress bar imports modules bottom - up ; that is , leaf modules are imported before their parents .
The root module is imported last .
Implementing a bottom - up import sequence requires generating a graph of dependencies between modules :
def get_dependencies ( module_name ) : " " " \
Takes a module name as input ( e.g. ' xml.dom ' ) and returns a set of ( lhs , rhs ) tuples where lhs and rhs are module names and lhs imports rhs . " " " # module_from_key is a dict from a module key , an arbitrary # object , to a module object .
While importing , we discover # dependencies before we have access to the actual module objects .
# import_dependencies is a list of ( lhs , rhs ) tuples where lhs and # rhs are module keys , and module_from_key [ lhs ] imported # module_from_key [rhs ] .
root_key = object ( ) module_from_key = {root_key : __main__} import_dependencies = [ ] stack = [ root_key ] def import_in_stack ( key , name , globals , locals , fromlist , level ) : stack.append ( key ) try : return original_import ( name , globals , locals , fromlist , level ) finally : stack.pop ( ) import __builtin__ original_import = __builtin__.__import__ def my_import( name , globals=globals ( ) , locals=locals ( ) , fromlist= [ ] , level= - 1 ) : # fromlist is a whore .
Most of the complexity in this # function stems from fromlist 's semantics .
See # http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#__import__
#
If a module imports ' xml.dom ' , then the module depends on # both ' xml ' and ' xml.dom ' modules .
dotted = name.split( '.') for i in range ( 1 , len( dotted ) ) : my_import ( '.'. join ( dotted [ 0:i ] ) , globals , locals , [ ] , level ) module_key = object ( ) parent_key = stack [ - 1 ] def add_dependency_from_parent(key , m ) : module_from_key[key ] = m import_dependencies .append(( parent_key , key ) ) submodule = import_in_stack ( module_key , name , globals , locals , [ ' __name__ ' ] , level ) add_dependency_from_parent( module_key , submodule ) for f in ( fromlist or [ ] ) : from_key = object ( ) module = import_in_stack ( from_key , name , globals , locals , [ f ] , level ) if f == '*' : continue submodule = getattr ( module , f ) if isinstance ( submodule , types.
ModuleType ) : add_dependency_from_parent( from_key , submodule ) return original_import ( name , globals , locals , fromlist , level ) # Import module_name with import hook enabled .
original_modules = sys.modules.copy ( ) __builtin__.__import__ = my_import try : my_import ( module_name ) finally : __builtin__.__import__ = original_import sys.modules.clear( ) sys.modules.update(original_modules ) assert stack == [ root_key ] , stack return sorted ( set ( ( module_from_key[lhs ].__name__ , module_from_key[rhs ].__name__ ) for lhs , rhs in import_dependencies ) )
( You can view all of the code at SourceForge ) .
First , we install an __import__ hook that discovers import dependencies between modules , and convert those relationships into a directed graph :
Then , we merge cycles .
If module A imports B , B imports C , and C imports A , then it does n't matter which you import first .
Importing A is equivalent to importing B or C .
After this step , we have a DAG :
Finally , we can postorder traverse the DAG to determine a good import sequence and cost ( approximated as the number of modules in the cycle ) per import :
1 xml 3 xml.dom 1 copy_reg 1 types 1 copy 1 xml.dom.NodeFilter 1 xml.dom.xmlbuilder 1 xml.dom.minidom 1 __main__
Now let 's look at some less - trivial examples .
urllib2 :
SimpleXMLRPCServer :
imvu.task :
Final notes :
Other people have solved this problem with bytecode scanning , but we wanted to know the actual modules imported for an accurate progress bar .
A simpler __import__ hook could have calculate the correct import sequence , but I find a visual representation of module dependencies to have additional benefits .
I ’m very happy to announce that Kickstarter is live !
I first mentioned the project back in September , and have been privileged to sit on the board and advise their development for the last ten months .
Kickstarter aims to let creative people of all kinds — journalists , artists , musicians , game developers , entrepreneurs , bloggers — raise money for their projects by connecting directly with fans , who receive exclusive access and rewards in exchange for their patronage .
Like Josh Freese and Jill Sobule , the site allows creators to have multiple tiers of rewards ( e.g. $ 20 for the book , $ 50 for signed copy ) with optional limits for each .
The model is simple : a project creator sets a fundraising goal , deadline , and an optional set of rewards for backers .
If the goal ’s reached by the deadline , then everyone ’s charged via Amazon Payments and the backers get their goodies .
If the goal ’s not reached , nobody ’s charged .
It ’s all or nothing .
If you want to raise money to build an iPhone app , make a run of t- shirts , or print a book , you can do it with absolutely no risk or up - front costs .
If there ’s enough demand for your idea , you ’ll be able to sell every copy before you ’ve spent a dime .
Kickstarter also offers publishing tools , where creators can post project updates with audio and video , either publicly or for backers only .
For projects without a physical reward , exclusive updates could be a great incentive for people to get involved .
Check out this project for a good example .
Anyway , I ’m thrilled to see what people come up with !
For now , anyone can back projects , but you ’ll need a Kickstarter invite to be able to create your own project .
( You can get an invite from an existing member , or sign up to get notified when Kickstarter opens to the public . )
For the past nine years Westmoreland County Community College in Pennsylvania has included " sexual orientation " and " union membership " under its non-discrimination policy .
" But the school now says there is another statement that does not contain those four words and that it is the only one approved as an official policy by college trustees in a 1998 vote .
So the college has begun the unusual task of striking references to both classes of people from its non-discrimination language , including a statement on the college 's web site " ( Post Gazette ) .
Further , this decision may be part of a cover up by the school to ensure they are not liable for a conflict with a former school employee who was denied health insurance for his spouse after he legally married in Massachusetts .
The school denies that the two have any correlation , but the Union representatives arguing against the change are unsure .
The language has been in place for years without any problems , and whether it is official or not , the school should take steps not to delete the words but to ensure that they are made official .
Contact the interim President and let him know that this is unacceptable , unfair , and represents a bad image for the school .

Support for the Swedish Pirate Party surged following the Pirate Bay verdict and today it became the third largest political party in the country .
When they are elected for the European Parliament next month , the party hopes to end the abuse of copyright by multi-billion dollar corporations .
The explosive growth rate displayed after the Pirate Bay verdict has skyrocketed the Pirate Party ’s member count and today they ’ve surpassed that of the Center Party .
Of all the established parties only the Social Democratic Party and the Moderate Party have more members .
The Pirate Party has tripled its ranks in only three weeks up to 44,000 members , and it ’s on course to become the second largest political part in the country .
Torrent Freak caught up with party leader Rick Falkvinge to congratulate him on this unprecedented achievement , and we used the opportunity to find out more about his future plans .
First off , we asked him if the recent surge in members can be solely attributed to the outcome of the Pirate Bay trial .
“ The Pirate Bay verdict was not a single event , but the final straw in a long series of events , ” Falkvinge replied .
“ We tripled our member count in a week , and have kept growing at an accelerated pace .
With just one month till the European elections , the timing of these horrible events arguably work as a catalyst for change . ”
Falkvinge is looking forward to the upcoming European Parliament elections on June 6 this year .
“ I ’m extremely optimistic , ” he told Torrent Freak .
“ It ’s not a question of ‘ a ’ seat any more .
If everybody who is angry with the Pirate Bay verdict goes to vote , we will get at least one seat , and probably more . ”
Although things are looking good , the road to Brussels is not guaranteed yet .
There are two hurdles left .
“ One is to get our ballot papers out — contender parties are not served by the Election Authority , but have to distribute their ballot papers to all 7,000 polling stations by hand .
That ’s a logistical nightmare , but with 13,000 activists , we should be able to fix that .
We had 1,600 activists in the last election , and covered 93 % .
The other hurdle is getting our folks to actually vote , but I believe they ’re still angry enough . ”
A question that has been under reported is what the party actually plans to achieve when they arrive in Brussels .
One of the questions we asked is how torrent sites and trackers such as the Pirate Bay should be handled .
“ The Pirate Bay is infrastructure , ” Falkvinge told us .
“ The messenger immunity , that the messenger is never responsible for the contents of a message , is crucial to how our society works .
The Lobby is trying to gut that immunity , along with boneheaded politicians who see a chance to look tough on crime . ”
“ First of all , copyright needs to be reduced to cover commercial activities only .
That would get copyright out of ordinary honest peoples ’ bedrooms , which is badly needed .
That would also make everything that happens over The Pirate Bay legal overnight , and so , there would be no copyright infringement that TPB could potentially facilitate .
At that point , since they ca n’t be facilitating , aiding or abetting anything illegal [ anymore ] in any interpretation , this would also mean that they can be as commercial as they like . ”
Falkvinge further told us that he ’s toying with the idea of writing “ Nothing that happens at The Pirate Bay violates copyright law ” directly into Sweden ’s copyright law .
In 2010 the Pirate Party hopes to enter the Swedish parliament , and they want to make it absolutely clear that The Pirate Bay four will be acquitted on appeal .
“ But that ’s not enough , ” Falkvinge told Torrent Freak .
“ The issues at stake are more important than that .
The Lobby is constantly nagging on the gray area , making inroads , establishing new precedents , and acting very aggressively .
They can do this without any risk at all , and that needs to stop .
The Lobby is damaging the open society and our economy at a level that I think should be criminal , especially since they ’re doing it as a commercial operation . ”
So , the Pirate Party wants to reduce the abuse of power and copyright by the entertainment industry , and make that illegal instead .
With the current level of support and indications by recent polls there is no doubt that they will get a seat in the European Parliament , and we hope they will be able to be heard there .
Avast mateys !
A few days ago , I was browsing through Amazon ’s software category when I stumbled upon the software best seller list .

Ever since the War on Drugs was declared by President Richard Nixon in 1971 ( some say as a proxy for the culture wars ) , the United States has spent most of its time and our money on police work , trials and prisons .
This has resulted in the highest incarceration rate by far of any developed nation in the world , with minority prisoners far out of proportion to their numbers in the general population .
Two US Episcopal congregations opt for anti-gay Nigerian oversight
-18/12/06
The future of the 77 million - strong worldwide Anglican Communion was complicated further last night ( 16 December 2006 ) with the announcement that two large evangelical congregations in the US have voted to break away from the Episcopal Church , primarily because of its decision three years ago to consecrate a gay bishop , Gene Robinson of New Hampshire .
The Truro Church and the Falls Church voted instead to place themselves instead under the authority of the Anglican Archbishop of Nigeria , Peter Akinola ñ who has called for the Episcopal Church to be ostracised by the rest of the Communion .
Akinola has also leant support to a new law in Nigeria which criminalises homosexual behaviour which civil rights activists have described as ìdegrading and inhumanî .
The parishes of Truro and Falls in Virginia were founded in the British colonial era and have been well - known wealthy and conservative congregations for many years .
They were once part of the Church of England .
Critics will say that their decision to opt for Nigerian oversight represents the latest twist in a tale of eccentricity , rather than the first sign of a break - up of the Episcopal Church ñ though it is a propaganda coup for anti-gay activists , and makes the job of Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams more difficult in trying to hold Anglicanism together .
Speaking to the BBC this morning , missionary Bishop Martyn Minns said that the split was not about homosexuality alone , but about a whole range of issues of Christian doctrine , including the central role of Scripture , where he and others felt the Episcopal Church was falling short .
But he then went on to distance himself from Archbishop Akinolaís use of ìbiblical languageî in denouncing gay priests as constituting a ìsatanicî division of the church , saying that this was not a term he would use himself .
Bishop Minns was consecrated in Abuja , Nigeria , on 30 August , as a new bishop of the Convocation of Anglicans in North America ( CANA ) , and will assume oversight of the two rebel congregations .
Episcopal representatives began to respond to the development last night by pointing out that it is a minority of hardliners , not they , who are acting to split the church .
They will urge the Archbishop of Canterbury to firmly reject such moves .
A small number of other congregations in the United States have already left the national Episcopal Church .
Those seeking to preserve Anglicanismís traditional breadth say that conservatives are using money and politics to force their views on the majority .
The Episcopal Diocese of Virginia has warned the two parishes that they do not own their church property and that the buildings , worth millions of dollars , need to be returned to the Church .
Bishop Minns dismissed such claims as ìsillyî in his BBC interview , but then went on to say that they were part of a ìconversationî about the separation .
The Falls church voted 90 % in favour of leaving the Episcopal Church immediately to join the breakaway Convocation of Anglicans in North America .
They also voted resoundingly ( 96 % ) to hold on to the property they currently use .
Truro church voted 92.1 % for severance and 94.3 % to keep the property they use .
There is a class of military veterans who have no civil rights .
These are the ‘ military sexual trauma ’ ( MST ) survivors .
How can I say that - every one under the Flag of the United States has civil rights ?
No - not everyone .
In my dictionary - under the heading of ‘ civil law ’ it says it pertains to the rights of private individuals and to legal proceedings concerning these rights as distinguished from criminal , military , or international rights , courts - or legal proceedings .
Under the heading Civil Rights it says RIGHTS belonging to an individual by virtue of his / her status as a citizen .
Under the heading Civil Law it says the body of law dealing with the rights of private citizens in a particular state or nation , as distinguished from criminal law , military law , or international law .
I am not a lawyer - I am a civilian …my dictionary says that means I am a citizen not connected with the military
I believed I have a right to a lawyer to represent me in any legal matter .
I have found that this is wrong .
I am a MST survivor .
I have have suffered life long residual mental health issues because of my being a ‘ military sexual trauma ’ survivor .
Because of my life as a survivor had finally come to the attention of the Veterans Administration ( VA ) Hospital in my region of Gainesville Florida I entered the PTSD - MST clinic for evaluation and treatment .
I once thought I was alone .
I learned there that there are thousands of MST survivors … some known , some like me who kept silent for many years .
During treatment I was advised to seek validation - to enter a claim against the VA system , I was told I met the entire page of criteria for PTSD and deserved benefits offered through the VA system .
These benefits included medical care and perhaps financial compensation .
To apply for a claim the law required me to report my rapes to a local ‘ veterans advocate ’… this had to be done in my home county in Florida - Levy County .
These veterans advocates are hired by the county under the direction of the Florida Veterans Affairs Office .
The advocate I met with was a former ‘ gunny sargent ’ well versed in combat injury - he had even won awards from Congress for work to aid veterans to obtain what is rightfully theirs .
He had no experience - nor knowledge of how to care for MST survivors .
The fact is - when I told him my story he looked in amazement and said “ Gee…you ’ never think homosexuals have a need to rape each other ” …he also assumed my attackers were black .
Both statements were no where near the truth , nor did they hold any valid reasoning .
I declined any further aid from the Levy County office , instead I sought the help of an attorney .
I had to travel to Jacksonville Florida to find legal counsel - and the attorney took my case on an old fashioned handshake … she too was an MST survivor .
She understood my pain - and understood the need for justice in these cases .
We attended a hearing in November 2007 at the regional offices of the VA in St. Petersburg Florida .
My hearing was over two hours long - a length of time I understood was unusual , they say a hearing only lasts about 20 to 30 minutes .
It took one year to nearly the day for a decision - my papers were signed by the VA Judge on November 3,2008 .
His decision said that I am indeed suffering from PTSD and the results of why are directly connected with my military service - directly connected because I AM a MST survivor .
Yesterday a letter arrived via US Postal carrier .
The letter says that my attorney is not an approved VA attorney … the question is - will my service connected disability be reversed because I chose as a citizen to find a person versed in law to represent me ?
My attorney is dis-qualified to represent me in the VA court ( of law ) .
This letter not only affects me - it affects every MST survivor in the United States .
It says to us - we have NO RIGHT to find legal counsel on our own !
It says we must be bound by the VA system …we must use counsel which is approved by them - I understand a list of attorneys is available who are approved by the VA .
I know only about myself - yet I can only assume that every veteran chose to volunteer for military service … why ?
To defend our nation - to defend our flag …to defend our rights as citizens of the United States .
I guess I am wrong … the letter I received yesterday surely proves that .
I have NO RIGHT to select an attorney of my choice of my free will to defend me or represent me in / at a national institution - the Veterans Administration .
Our rights are being violated !
In my effort to bring justice for every MST survivor - and even every veteran have been returned in vain .
I have written countless letters and emails to Congressman - and Senators .
Only two have responded ( unless you want to count the form letters under the heading ‘ newsletters ’ ) .
Of those two - one actually set an appointment for me to meet personally with her -Congresswoman Ginny Brown - Waite from Florida .
The meeting never took place … the Congresswoman is no longer on the veterans sub-committee .
I ’m talking about CIVIL RIGHTS … and a member of Congress - an elected official of our Untied States is saying … this is not my job ??
Our meeting was canceled just one day before elections in 2008 ; and two weeks ago her office called to say “ not our job ” .
I know we are being wronged .
I know when I enlisted at age 17 into the United States Navy I was enlisting to serve our country - OUR COUNTRY !
Not merely the region where I lived - the entire United States .
War was going on then - the Viet Nam War .
Many of my age group refused to serve - instead they fled to Canada to be safe from prosecution , and to be safe from war .
My desire to serve was so strong that I had tried to enlist in the United States Marines - a choice which would have guaranteed my duty being in the battle grounds of Viet Nam .
The recruiter said I was too skinny and sent me to the Navy recruiter instead .
It did not matter - Army , Navy , Marines - any branch of the military service would have been the honorable thing to do !
I ’m not fully sure how government works - but I do feel that regardless of where an elected official comes from he or she should want to take up the banner and fight for the justice and rights of an American citizen … and right what wrongs exist .
In this case - fight for the rights of MST survivors .
My self - personally … I never expected to seek justice for the rapes that qualify me as an MST survivor .
Like many MST survivors I chose to live with my wounds in silence .
I never thought anyone would care since the first day I became a survivor the officer in charge whom I reported my attacks to said “ get used to it ” .
Once the 35 years of silence ended and I learned there were as many as 32 % of female veterans and 6 % of male veterans that are also MST survivors I became angry …angry that they too might have to report to a bigot such as the one I met at the Levy County Veterans Affairs Office .
I decided to fight for these other ‘ silent wounded ’ and speak out for the RIGHTS we have had hidden from us …if not even taken away .
Yesterdays letter nearly defeated that effort .
I went into a state of shock … I even wept .
The hurt from ALL of my life as a survivor collected inside of me - almost allowing me to cower in retreat , the pain was that hard to bare .
I will not quit !
I will continue to stand up for MST veterans rights .
Our CIVIL RIGHTS !
We are citizens of the Untied States .
We volunteered to serve our country to defend equal rights and freedom …. yet our freedom is taken away from us if we are NOT permitted to seek our own legal counsel - our CIVIL RIGHTS are NOT available to the MST survivor if we are restricted to seek defense in the offices of men who disregard us as ‘ homosexuals ’ or cannot understand that no matter what race a person is - that if a man is black he is automatically deemed as the culprit in a crime .
If you are reading this than you have a responsibility to assist in righting this wrong - I beg you to write your Congress and speak out against this wrong .
Stand up for us as we once went forward to stand up for you .
The fact of MST exists today … there are many more survivors returning to civilian life - silent wounded .
Help us obtain our CIVIL RIGHTS !

The final recommendations of the UN Council on the Limits of the Continental Shelf have extended Norway ’s control of the seabed off its coastline to around 235,000 square kilometres .
By international standard all coastal nations have a continental shelf of 200 nautical miles .
While this means Norway is now responsible for the management of the increased underwater territory , it also means Norway can tap into more of the potential natural resources that are believed to lie beneath the Arctic Sea .
“ This establishes a clear division of responsibility and creates predictable conditions for activities in the High North .
It confirms that Norway has substantial rights and responsibilities in maritime areas of some 235,000 square kilometres .
The recommendation is therefore of historic significance for Norway , ” Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr Store stated .
Some countries such as Norway have continental shelves that extend much further than the 200 mile minimum .
They can submit a request to increase their management of this seabed to the UN , which has the power to grant extensions .
The decision by the UN Council is final and binding , though it has no real effect on unresolved boundary issues between Norway and neighbouring nations .
With the future ownership of the Arctic Sea set to become hotly contested , it appears Norway has gained a small foothold in the race to claim this rich area .

I grew up watching a variety of cartoons , and that includes the classic Warner Brothers animations and other older sketches .
As you may well know , much of the premise of those shorts was one character chasing another .
Such as the Wily E. Coyote and the Roadrunner or Sylvester and Tweety .
However , the unfortunate antagonists never seemed to win or catch its prey .
But it raises the question , what if they did ?
Thanks to James Cauty , the people at JCauty &Son ( checkout their website ) , and others around the world , here are some examples of what might have happened when after a lifetime of chasing their enemies one can exact a horrific and bloodthirsty revenge ( best served cold ) :
Wily E. Coyote vs. Roadrunner
I think ‘ Weird Al ’ Yankovic said it best on ths one , “ Right now I ’d like to show you one of my favorite cartoons .
It ’s a sad , depressing story about a pathetic coyote who spends every waking moment of his life in the futile pursuit of a sadistic roadrunner who MOCKS him and LAUGHS at him as he ’s repeatedly CRUSHED and MAIMED !
Hope you ENJOY IT !!! ”

The Simpsons ’ deep thoughts on alcohol , jobs , effort , religion and more .
I ’m not going complicated today .
I dug up 11 quotes from The Simpsons that , in my opinion , are among the most profound , accurate and definitive takes on 11 different subjects ever made .
Seriously .
They ’re that good .
1 | Drinking
Homer ’s toast after Springfield lifts its ban on prohibition clearly and succinctly summarizes mankind ’s relationship to alcohol through all eternity .
“ To alcohol : The cause of , and solution to , all of life ’s problems . ”
2 | The Second Amendment
I try not to get too pinko too often , but I ’m a big gun control guy .
And I like this quote from the episode where Homer joins the NRA , where Krusty the Clown effectively juxtaposes the modern uses of guns and the actual theory behind Americans ’ Constitutional right to bear arms .
“ Guns are n’t toys !
They ’re for family protection , hunting dangerous or delicious animals , and keeping the King of England out of your face ! ”
And though it ’s not quote profound enough for this list , that episode also nails soccer ( and why this country just ca n’t get behind it ) with a commercial for a soccer tournament that says , “ Fast kicking !
Low scoring !
And ties … you bet ! ”
3 | Jobs
I ’ve worked at more than a dozen companies during college and adult life .
And this Homer quote is as true as any quote ever .
“ No , no , no , Lisa .
If adults do n’t like their jobs , they do n’t go on strike .
They just go in every day and do it really half - assed . ”
4 | Religion
The Simpsons have done so much about religion that they even spawned a book called “ The Gospel According to The Simpsons ” .
But , the best one - liner they ’ve ever had about religion … and my favorite satirical quote from the entire 20 years of the series … came in the episode where Homer and Bart go Catholic and a team of Reverend Lovejoy , Ned Flanders and Marge go to win them back .
No statement has ever summed up the folly of “ my religious beliefs and only my beliefs are the guaranteed , definitive truth ” like when Reverend Lovejoy says : “ We ’re here to bring you back to the one true faith : the Western Branch of American Reform Presby - Lutheranism . ”
5 | Modern love
There ’s nothing in the world that ’s immune from giant corporations trying to make money off it .
Love just might be the most exploited of all .
As Lisa says : “ Mom , romance is dead .
It was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney , homogenized , and sold off piece by piece . ”
6 | Entitlement
We want it all .
But getting from point A to point B to have it all … well that sounds like a lot of work .
Here ’s Homer ’s line about that sense of hypocritical entitlement : “ If you really want something in life you have to work for it .
Now quiet , they ’re about to announce the lottery numbers . ”
7 | Handling the opposite gender
If only we ’d start listening to Bart , and not reading ( literally ) billions of magazine articles and websites about what ’s really happening in the minds of the opposite sex … maybe we ’d all stop overthinking relationships and just find good ones that naturally and easily work .
Bart : “ Women are easy , state capitals are hard . ”
8 | Achievement
I ’m really good at the old - school NES game Dr. Mario .
I can consistently beat pretty much everyone I ’ve ever played against .
And yet , when I tore my ACL and , couch - bound , I started playing Dr. Mario on the Wii wireless against other people from around the world … a lot of them just destroyed me .
Which led me to believe that Homer had it right : “ No matter how good you are at something , there ’s always about a million people better than you . ”
9 | Generation gap
Older generations will generally think younger people are lazy .
Or coddled .
Or stupid .
We usually agree on those , but not always .
So let ’s thank Mr. Burns for putting words to the one thing that every member of an older generation will agree with …
“ I do n’t like being outdoors Smithers , for one thing , there ’s too many fat children . ”
10 | Effort
I think this Homer quote neatly sums up the reason why people so often give up on their lofty , ambitious ( and sometimes naive ) goals : “ You tried your best and you failed miserably .
The lesson is ‘ never try ’ . ”
11 | Status
A Homer quote about the oft - futile battle to better one ’s station in life … we try , we work at it , but , in the end , we are what we are .
Or , as he puts it , “ Just once I ’d like someone to call me ‘ Sir ’ without adding ‘ You ’re making a scene . ' ”

Back in February , an acupuncturist in Key West , Florida , was arrested on charges of using a physician ’s credentials to obtain controlled substances and other prescription drugs .
While some of these drugs were for the individual ’s personal use , the Key West Citizen reported from arrest records that the acupuncturist had obtained other drugs for her patients , including anxiolytics , a muscle relaxant , and sedative sleep aids .
While it is not clear if the individual in question specifically mixed those drugs with herbal or homeopathic remedies available at her practice , the demographics of her clientele are likely to be inconsistent with the use of prescription drugs .
Why do I propose this hypothesis and where would a practitioner get the idea to mix prescription drugs with herbal products to make them appear effective ?
Why , the dietary supplement industry , of course .
In fact , adulterating commercial herbal products with prescription drugs is so common that the US FDA is keeping a running tally of actions against companies selling supplements containing “ undeclared drugs ” : the polite regulatory term for deceptive doping of a useless product with a real drug .
Most - common approaches have been to dope weight - loss supplements with sibutramine , a prescription amphetamine - like , serotonin / norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor sold in the US and Canada as Meridia .
The US FDA list on this class of deception has increased from 28 to 69 products since 22 Dec 2008 .
Regular SBM readers may have heard , for example , of weight loss claims made for apple cider vinegar capsules .
You may be surprised to know that such a product might have efficacy – if it contains sibutramine – as the FDA found in 2007 for a product manufactured by Confidence , Inc .
Another common adulteration tactic is for erectile dysfunction supplement manufacturers to boost their products with prescription phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) inhibitors such as sildenafil ( Viagra ) or related compounds .
So popular is this approach that the same manufacturer cited above for sibutramine - adulteration of apple cider vinegar products has also been found guilty of adding PDE5 inhibitors to their aptly named “ Long Weekend ” product .
At least their business model is consistent .
In fact , a recent FDA investigation of such supplements sold online revealed that up to one - third of products are so adulterated .
Most concerning is when these adulterants might interact with other medications a patient is taking ( in the case of PDE5 inhibitors and antihypertensive vasodilators ) or , worse , have inherent harmful effects .
There is at least one case in the literature where supplement doping has been associated with unusual cases of prostate cancer ( Clin Cancer Res 2008:607-11 ) .
In this case , the bodybuilding supplement Teston - 6 was found to contain testosterone and other compounds more potent than testosterone in promoting prostate cancer cell growth in vitro .
As a natural products pharmacologist , I am all for researching botanical and non-botanical supplements that may intrinsically contain useful therapeutic molecules – that is the cornerstone of my field .
Indeed , some traditional herbal medicines have been used as sources for modern pharmaceuticals .
But to dope supplement products with effective drugs is to admit that one is selling garbage : a deceptive practice to prey upon those who choose to seek out “ alternative ” medical approaches and keep them coming back .
I wonder how many consumers of “ green ” or “ alternative ” products ( paid for out - of - pocket , mind you ) would be pleased to know that their apparent health benefits were due to prescription drugs present therein that could have been obtained in a consistent , reproducible dosage form for a small co-pay .
This practice also makes one wonder how many anecdotal cases of “ success ” with herbal products could be attributed to adulteration with prescription drugs .
For this reason , I recommend that grant reviewers and journal editors insist that any dietary supplement used in a clinical trial be subjected to extensive chemical analysis as a condition of funding or publication , respectively , including screening for pharmaceutical compounds capable of exerting the therapeutic effect under investigation .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Maybe the so - called " zombie " banks did n't die after all .
As recently as two months ago , many on Wall Street speculated that the nation 's largest financial institutions -- banks like Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) -- were only operating as a result of extensive aid from the U.S. government .
Now , many experts wonder how so many small regional and community lenders that are capital starved and overwhelmed by escalating loan losses are able to stay in business .
In metropolitan Atlanta and the state of Florida , for example , more than 50 banks reported non-performing asset levels of 10 % or more of total assets as of the end of March , according to the Raleigh , N.C. - based investment bank Carson Medlin .
Non-performing assets are loans that are not collecting interest or principal payments .
In more normal economic times , non-performing asset levels remain below 1 % .
Up to this point , small lenders , which serve as the primary source of credit for large parts of the country , were considered a picture of health in the banking industry .
Most avoided the toxic mortgage products that ruined so many of their big bank peers .
Experts note that the majority of the 8,000 small banks are still thriving .
But the outlook for this corner of the nation 's banking industry has been tempered in recent weeks as small lenders endure rising losses , partly as a result of exposure to areas like commercial real estate and small business loans .
Next Wednesday , Wall Street will get a clearer sense of what kind of shape the industry is in when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. publishes its first - quarter assessment of the industry .
One closely - watched part of that report is the agency 's so - called " problem bank " list .
As of the end of 2008 , that number stood at 252 institutions and it is expected to have climbed even higher during the first three months of 2009 .
So far this year , the government has closed 34 banks , including the FDIC 's takeover and subsequent sale of Florida - based lender BankUnited ( BKUNA ) late Thursday to a group of private equity investors .
While only a fraction of the institutions on the problem bank list typically reach the point of failure , experts contend that regulators have been unable to shut down some " zombie " lenders , in part , because they are still scrambling to catch up with the variety of ills affecting the sector .
Consider the case of Citizens Community Bank , a New Jersey - based lender located a little more than an hour 's drive northwest of New York City .
Federal regulators seized control of the bank earlier this month after the firm became overwhelmed by problems in its construction loan portfolio .
Nick Ketcha Jr. , a former director of supervision at the FDIC who now serves as a managing director at the New Jersey - based financial services consulting firm FinPro , said that the company could have just as easily have been shut down at the end of last year .
" They were ready to be taken over , " said Ketcha .
" The fact that [ regulators ] did n't get to them may suggest that others are out there . "
Two reports published earlier this month by the FDIC's Office of Inspector General charged that the agency was " not timely and effective " in addressing the most significant problems affecting Bradenton , Fla . - based lender Freedom Bank and Alpha Bank & Trust of Alpharetta , Georgia .
Both banks failed late last year .
Unprepared for the crisis much in the same way the private sector was , the FDIC has been ramping up efforts since late last year to try and stay ahead of troubles .
In its annual budget for 2009 , for example , the agency increased funding for its receivership division , which oversees bank failures , nearly tenfold from $ 150 million to $ 1 billion .
But even with that funding increase , it will take time for the FDIC to boost its staff levels enough to be capable of keeping up with all the troubled banks .
In the meantime , regulators may have little choice but to focus their attention on those institutions which are in the most dire shape .
As a result , other less - troubled lenders are allowed to live on for another day , notes FinPro 's Ketcha .
" Right now they are looking at which [ banks ] are the biggest problem and prioritizing , " he said .
Still , experts like Joshua Siegel , managing principal at StoneCastle Partners , whose firm focuses on investing in small - cap banks , suspects there could be forces other than staffing levels at work .
Regulators , he notes , may postpone a bank 's downfall especially if the region in which its resides could enjoy an economic recovery in the coming months .
There is also speculation that industry regulators have resisted closing some banks because it may be tough for the FDIC to find buyers for them -- even after they have been seized and scrubbed of their troubled loans .
Despite some interest in failed banks from private equity firms , Jeffrey Adams , managing director at Carson Medlin Co. , said many banks are unwilling to buy struggling peers .
" They are battling their own fires if you will , " said Adams .
" There is just not a natural supply of parties to take over deposits . "

Chinese propaganda is like a fabulously bold and colourful history lesson , the kind of history lesson anyone with decent colour vision can appreciate .
Look inside and feast your eyes on this first part of a series !
One of the things I love about communist Chinese propaganda is how it 's possible to read specific pieces of history into many , if not most of the posters .
You 'll regularly find some element , hidden or overt , which connects the poster with a particular person 's fate , a movement , an executive decision or the like .
This becomes particularly clear during the Cultural Revolution , when you can see various individuals and factions waging propaganda warfare on each other through posters .
For a history student like myself , this is a treat , but even if you 're not the least bit interested in history , you should have no trouble finding lots of interesting material in this post .
My earlier posts on Soviet , US and German propaganda have all been done as single posts .
In this case though , I found so much great quality material that I decided to split it up instead .
This is part 1 , dealing with the period from World War II up until the end of the Cultural revolution .
Check back soon for part 2 !
World war , revolution and another war
In the century leading up to the proclamation of the Chinese People 's Republic in 1949 , China had seen a seemingly endless string of foreign invasions , civil wars and rebellions , with plenty of warlordism to fill the gaps .
There are no exact figures for just how many deaths all this turmoil caused , I 've seen estimates ranging from 150 to 300 millions .
Sadly , 1949 would not be the end of the troubles for China .
In this part , we take a look at 42 propaganda posters from 1937 to 1969 , including a little commentary from me , mainly to put it all into a historic context .
1937 – Defeat Japanese imperialism
In 1931 , Japan invaded the Chinese province of Manchuria and turned it into the puppet state Manchukuo .
It could be seen as the first action of the second world war , as low scale warfare between Japan and China would continue until 1937 , when Japan invaded northern China , a bloody war that would carry on until 1945 .
The nationalist Kuomintang forces of Chiang Kai-Shek temporarily joined forces with the communist rebels and the fighting eventually reached a stalemate , with the Japanese controlling the coastal lands while the Chinese defended the interior .
This poster , printed by the Kuomintang , China 's official governing party at the time , has more in common with contemporary posters from Europe than with what would eventually follow in the People 's Republic .
The graphic simplicity of this poster is not completely lacking in post - revolution posters , but in general , later posters tend towards significantly greater level of intricacy and a more pictorial style .
1949 – Great Meeting
On October 1st , 1949 , Mao Zedong proclaimed the Chinese People 's Republic , and on the 10th of December the same year , the last Kuomintang stronghold in mainland China fell , with Chiang Kai-Shek escaping to Taiwan to set up his Republic of China .
A few days before , Mao had set off by train to Moscow , to meet with the leader of the world 's other great communist country , Stalin .
Contrary to what this poster indicates , the Soviet reception of Mao was lukewarm at best .
Stalin and his people were not willing to recognize the importance of China turning communist , and made it clear by their poor treatment of the Chinese leader .
An aide of Krushchev 's referred to him as " that Chinaman " .
While the Chinese delegation was able to wring some promises of material aid from the Soviet Union , it was " like taking meat from the mouth of a tiger " , as Mao would later comment .
Ca. 1950 – The Central people 's government constitutes the only legitimate government of all
As the message indicates , the Chinese Communist Party felt an urgent need to demonstrate their legitimacy in power , as opposed to the exiled Kuomintang on Taiwan .
Most of all , this poster reminds me of a Tintin cartoon - I 'm half expecting to see Tintin popping up behind Mao with a silly grin on his face , or Terry attacking the tanks .
1950 – Smash the imperialist war conspiracy , forge ahead courageously to build our peaceful and happy life !
The ( territorial part of the ) communist revolution was barely finished when the People 's Republic was reluctantly dragged into another war , this time in Korea .
North - Korea had invaded the south and made great advances , only to collapse once the US and the United Nations got involved on the side of the South .
US General MacArthur , happy with the initial success , decided to press on into the north and drive home a complete victory .
This compelled the People 's Republic to enter the war , and thus followed three years of bloody stalemate resulting in an estimated 4 million deaths and no significant territorial changes .
With white doves flying above , the poster suggests that the People 's Republic did not want this war , but were forced into it by US and British imperialists , as illustrated by the little caricatures being trampled underfoot .
Ca. 1950 – The Chinese people absolutely cannot condone the encroachment of other countries , and cannot listen to whatever Imperialist who thinks it can wantonly encroach on its own neighbours without them acting
In a more gruesome tone , General Douglas MacArthur is here seen murdering Korean women and children while US bombers level Korean industry .
While MacArthur was a great military leader in some ways , he repeatedly asked for permission to attack China itself , and had a long record of recklessness and often disobeyed orders .
These traits proved fateful in Korea , where MacArthur 's decision to conquer ( or alternately , liberate ) the whole of Korea , all the way to the Chinese border , forced the Chinese to intervene .
Contrary to the message in this poster , Chinese involvement was not a given in Korea once the US got involved .
After a century of turmoil in China , the leadership would probably have preferred to stay out of the fray .
Ca. 1951 – Produce more !
Contribute more !
Now we 're talking !
This is how I like my communist propaganda .
Big , muscly men or women labouring away like superheros with sledgehammers or working with tireless resolve on some machine producing bolts for the latest tractor model .
The jet fighters zooming above may not be directly related to this guy 's work , but they add another element of raw strength and technological advance to the poster .
1951 – The Soviet Union is our example
While the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic were not the best of friends , in the early cold war period , there were few other friends to be had for communist China .
Up until the late 50s , there was considerable cooperation between the two .
This poster suggests learning construction techniques from the Soviet Union .
Looming in the background with a portrait of Stalin is one of the Seven Sisters of Moscow .
The sisters were great buildings erected during Stalin 's last year , and are some of the masterpieces of Stalinist architecture .
After Stalin 's death , Krushchev would condemn Stalinist architecture as excessive .
1953 – Elect good people to do good things
Speaking of Stalin , the guy in white immediately made me think of him .
With the poster printed in the year of Stalin 's death , is this perhaps a suggestion of Stalin 's reincarnation in China ?
Probably not .
Nevertheless , whenever I see leader characters dressed up in white , I can't help thinking about Stalin and Hermann Göring , who were both frequently pictured in bulky , silly looking white uniforms .
1954 – Judgement day for American imperialism
A rather one - sided portrayal of the outcome of the Korean war .
Just as expected of course .
The combined forces of North - Korea and the People 's Republic are seen surging ahead , grinding the American imperialists into the mud .
In fact , estimates suggest that communist deaths outnumbered those of the UN forces by 3 to 1 .
As is always the case in modern warfare , the number of civilian deaths were the highest of all , estimated at around 2 million .
Reconstruction and the great leap backwards
1955 – New China 's female parachuters
1955 – Resolutely liberate Taiwan , save the Taiwanese people from their misery !
Officially known as the Republic of China , present day Taiwan is the legacy of the Kuomintang withdrawal from the Chinese mainland .
Ever since the end of World War II , the US has supported the Kuomintang and the ROC on Taiwan , and this has been an eternal sore spot in relations between the US , the ROC and the People 's Republic .
Being under martial law for nearly four decades succeeding the communist victory , the ROC could hardly have been the model of freedom , though I suspect this particular poster to be a rather too vivid depiction of the situation .
1955 – Warmly love chairman Mao
There is quite a wide variety of artistic styles seen in the propaganda posters of the People 's Republic , making it somewhat hard to make generalizations about them .
However , this poster to me seems to capture some of the essence found in many of the posters .
As mentioned when discussing the very first poster , complex designs are more favoured than the often highly stylized material seen in the Soviet Union , USA and Germany .
These posters tend to be more naturalistic in their portrayal of people , albeit with a significant " sweet icing " to give the people a more idealized look , and to convey a more positive , cheerful outlook , something which was probably needed in these years .
1956 – Everybody comes to beat sparrows
Another poster in a similar style , it depicts a scene which seems fairly innocent at first glance .
But as I mentioned in the introduction , there 's nearly always some particular historic event which can be connected to the different posters .
In this case , it 's what was officially called the " Four pests campaign " , but became better known as the Great sparrow campaign .
In essence , Mao decided that the sparrows , and some other birds and animals , were vermin that ate grain seeds and thereby lessened agricultural output , and so , people were ordered to kill sparrows en masse .
This they did , with great effect .
In 1960 , scientists discovered that sparrows in fact ate more harmful insects than grain , something which became painfully obvious when the locust population exploded and caused great damage to agriculture .
1956 – Helping mama study culture
Another piece of " socialist realism " , less glossy than the two before .
And while the visual style of the poster is n't glossy , nor the problem of illiteracy glossed over , it fulfills its role as propaganda by idealizing the young girl as a model of good behaviour , passing on what she 's learnt at school to her illiterate mother .
1958 – Our motherland 's air - space shall not be violated
A curious , spectacular and , to my knowledge , somewhat unusual character of the People 's Liberation Army is that for much of its history , it basically controlled the whole production chain for all the products and commodities it required .
It owned its own farms , manufacturing plants and weapons production .
To my knowledge , this system largely remains to this day , though from what I 've been able to gather , changes have been made , and may continue to be made , to the structure .
1958 – Study the Soviet Union , to advance to the world level of science
I like this poster for its depiction of technology , represented by some weird supersonic jetplane , an icebreaker and some sort of spacecraft , as well as an absent - looking ( or visionary ) scientist .
Waving his hands into nowhere , he reminds me more of a magician performing tricks than a scientist .
The year before , Mao had visited Moscow and scared the living hell out of his Soviet colleagues by asserting that he would be OK with sacrificing 300 million Chinese in a nuclear war that would lay the capitalist world in ruin .
We will never know whether Stalin would have agreed , luckily the old cynic died in the early stages of the Soviet nuclear program .
Around the time of this poster being printed , relations between the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic started souring , ending with a clean break in 1960 , followed by intermittent , low scale border warfare between the two .
1958 – Use machinery to replace manual work whenever possible
1958 was the starting year of the People 's Republic 's second five year plan , better known as the Great Leap Forward .
It would be the first of two massive disasters instigated by Mao , and meant that the calm years since the Korean War would only be an interlude in the long turmoil that is China 's modern history .
1959 – Smelt a lot of good steel and accelerate socialist construction
The Great Leap Forward had two central goals , increasing food production through massive collectivization and increased use of machinery in agriculture , as seen above , and self - sufficiency in the production of machines .
To achieve the latter , Mao advocated widespread use of backyard furnaces , whereby people would construct iron smelters in their backyard to churn out what in Mao 's mind would be quality steel .
As we 've seen in the case of the sparrows , Mao often did n't have a clue about the feasibility of the projects he launched , and would not listen to advice .
Likewise with the backyard furnaces .
Enormous amounts of steel were indeed produced , but of so low quality it was useless .
Famously , even pots and pans were sometimes melted by the zealous backyard metallurgist .
Learning of the project 's failure in 1959 , Mao decided not to stop it , as this could risk dampening revolutionary fervor in the people .
1959 – The vegetables are green , the cucumbers plumb , the yield is abundant
Propaganda should preferably polish the truth by making the bad guys look really bad , the good guys really good and in general , make a situation look brighter than it is .
In this case however , it was a lie , flat out .
As early as 1958 , famine had set in in parts of China , and with poorer weather conditions for agriculture in 59 and 60 , the situation got even worse .
Along with extensive collectivization , which had already proven problematic at best in the Soviet Union , Mao and his supporters introduced many novel – and catastrophically bad – farming techniques , which were supposed to give greater yields , but did exactly the opposite .
The locust swarms which appeared thanks to the near - eradication of sparrows did n't help either .
The net effect of the Great Leap Forward was a catastrophic death - toll in the years 1958 - 61 .
The official number of deaths is 17 millions , most independent estimates range from 30 - 40 million , while the highest I 've seen being 70 million .
1960 – Agriculture is marching towards modernization
I do n't know whether it's a coincident or intended , but shape of the grain above the tractor is remarkably similar to a nuclear mushroom .
It 's perhaps to suggest that tractors are as revolutionizing to agriculture as nukes are to warfare ?
I do n't have any particular obsession with machines or tractors in general , but for some reason , I 've got a thing for these communist posters depicting tractors rolling faithfully forward , towards a better future .
I guess they remind me of television characters from my childhood , like Thomas the Tank Engine ( yes , I know , not a tractor ) .
Stick a naive smile on this tractor , and I can imagine the fellow being called Terry the Tractor or the likes .
1960 – Be indomitable in training , to strengthen the physique of officers and soldiers
1958 – We 'll definitely beat the world record
When France lost the Franco - Prussian war of 1870 - 71 ( resulting in Germany being united into one country ) , French historian Pierre de Coubertin suggested that part of the reason for the defeat was a lack of physical education in the French soldiers .
In an industrializing country such as France , one could imagine that moving large groups of people away from pre-industrial , physically intensive agriculture and into the factory halls of the overcrowded and polluted cities could have some negative influences on the average worker 's physical shape .
Whether or not there was an actual connection , the result of Coubertin 's thinking was the modern Olympic games , a way to encourage improved physical education .
The first poster shows that connection clearly enough .
Maintaining a high level of physical fitness was essential , both with regards to potential recruits and reserve manpower .
Mid-1960s –
We want an eye for an eye and will fight resolutely
Up until 1997 , two small pieces of China were still being held as colonies by European powers .
Having suffered enormously at the hands of European colonial powers , the Chinese could hardly have been thrilled about these guests in their front yard .
I 'm talking about the small british colony of Hong Kong and the tiny Portugese Macau .
Hong Kong was handed over to the People 's Republic in 1997 , with Macau following in 1999 , though both have been guaranteed the right to retain their political systems and internal affairs as they wish for 50 years .
A suggestion for a similar system has been made towards the ROC for its future reintegration into the mainland state , and the Dalai Lama has proposed the same status for Tibet , though communist Chinese leaders have so far been negative in the latter case .
In the mid 60s Hong Kong 's transition was far off , and as claimed by this poster , the Chinese were none too happy about it .
Seen here is a violent demonstration favouring the return of Hong Kong to China , with two tiny caricatures of a british official and soldier / policeman being assaulted in the process .
1965 – Learn from the spirit of Daqing
The fellow seen here is Wang Jinxi , nicknamed " Iron Man " for his willingness no keep on working through cruddy weather , injuries and fatigue .
His best known workplace was the Daqing oil fields of China 's north - eastern Heilongjiang province .
Development of the oil fields started in 1960 as part of a struggle to make the People 's Republic self sufficient in oil , and as such , the development was a success , quickly becoming the country 's most productive oil field .
This poster is a good example of an educational method Mao greatly believed in .
By exposing average people to good models , in this case both the person Wang Jinxi and the Daqing oil fields with all its hard working people , they would adopt a part of the model into their own person and become a somewhat better person than before .
As such , bombarding people with good models should eventually result in a country full of hard working , incorruptible socialist heroes .
1965 – Ruralize the intellectuals
An awfully pretty poster , would n't you agree ?
Swaying fields of cereals are pretty too , but there is something particularly nice about rice fields , with calm water all around .
To my knowledge the idea of forcing intellectuals and urbanites to work in the fields for a while to get in touch with the " common people " originated with Mao , but was taken to extremes by the Mao- inspired Khmer Rogue of Cambodia .
A period of learning in the countryside was n't enough for the Khmer Rogue .
Instead , urban residents were driven by force into the countryside permanently , leaving the cities deserted .
In retrospect , that was just a mild foretaste to the horrors that would follow .
Friends abroad
1963 – Awakened peoples , you will certainly attain the ultimate victory
Ca. 1964 – Resolutely support the anti-imperialist struggle of peoples in Asia , Africa and Latin- America
1964 – Get out of Africa , American imperialists
1964 – Oppressed peoples , unite to resolutely fight against US imperialism
1966 – Resolutely support the American people in their resistance against American imperialist aggression in Vietnam
Once the cold war had " settled down " in Europe , both sides increasingly turned their attention towards the third world , the developing countries of Asia , Africa and Latin - America .
The US planned on containing communist influence within its current borders in Eastern Europe and Asia .
Warfare in Korea and Vietnam was part of this basic idea .
Beyond this perimeter of containment lay the third world , ripe with opportunities for inciting insurrections against the western powers , and the Soviet Union quite easily jumped the fence and started supporting various regimes and rebellions throughout .
Examples include Cuba , Vietnam , Egypt , Ethiopia , Angola and many more .
These were civil wars as well as warfare against colonial powers , or perceived imperialists .
The US were n't particularly inclined to seing these countries going communist , and thus started supporting regimes , insurgencies and coups directed against communist threats , perceived or real .
With the split between the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic , both were eager to be leaders of the communist world revolution , leading in many cases to both sponsoring different sides in conflicts of a single country .
One example is Angola , where the Soviet Union supported the MPLA , while the UNITA and FNLA both at different times received aid from the People 's Republic and the US .
Communist China were n't really successful in their third world sponsorships , though this is changing as we speak , with the People 's Republic now making massive inroads in Africa , though nowadays more geared towards trade than ideology and regime change .
Despite their comparative lack of success in the third world during the cold war , the People 's Republic managed to turn out some outstanding artwork for internal consumption showing suport for the various struggling peoples of the third world .
My favourites are the two 1964 posters .
The first of the two features an utterly beautiful , fierce looking mother carrying an SKS rifle in her hand and her baby on her back .
It 's a terribly grim situation , but the artwork is gripping .
The next poster , a black - white - and - red block print , conveys a terrifying sense of action and rebellion .
The colour red is particularly useful in this sense , no other colour is as tightly connected with strife and rebellion .
Mao strikes back
Mao never liked being pushed aside .
Some have suggested that his launch of the Great Leap Forward was not first and foremost to industrialize the People 's Republic and make it self - sufficient , but rather a way for Mao to get himself back into the centre of action at a time when he felt he risked being sidelined .
Unfortunately for Mao ( and the 30 - 40 million who died ) , the Great Leap was a Great Disaster and he was forced to retire into the background while more pragmatic people like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping took the helm .
1966 – Chairman Mao is our heart 's red sun
Mao however , would not be so easily outdone .
Pictured here with a pinkish halo is a book called " Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong " , better known as Mao's Little Red Book .
First published in 1961 for use by the soldiers and officers of the People 's Liberation Army , it became a central element in the personality cult which was built up around Mao in the coming years .
Rivaling only the Bible , it 's may be the single most printed book in history , with estimates ranging from 800 million to 6.5 billion copies made , or roughly enough for most present day human to have one each .
1966 was the year in which Mao launched the cultural revolution to once again put himself back in the centre .
In essence , the cultural revolution consisted of closing the upper level educational system and encouraging its students to go search the country for class enemies of all sorts , people with ideas perceived as counter - revolutionary , as well as artefacts or structures considered old - fashioned ( and thus bad ) .
The people who answered Mao's call to go out searching for counter - revolutionaries and " old culture " came to be known as Red Guards .
Marking the start of the revolution , an estimated 11 million Red Guards descended upon Beijing where they had been assured room , board and acces to parks and museums .
They went to get a glimpse of the great Chairman himself , and he held a series of " audiences " so everyone would be able to get a look .
Most traveled by train or other mechanized means , but there were also some who walked to get there .
Echoing Mao's own great march of the mid 1930s , Red Guards who performed this march to Beijing were presumably due for some serious Red Cred .
That Mao did n't actually do a lot of walking during the great march , but was carried most of the way is something he probably preferred to play down .
Late 1960s - A People 's Army Has No Rival
As I 've mentioned , the People 's Liberation Army was , and is still a remarkably self - sufficient institution in China .
Included in this was a great output of propaganda , though not all of it made for the benefit of the armed forces themselves .
In particular , their printers were active in the production of posters promoting the personality cult around Mao , and it was the PLA which first published the Little Red Book in 1961 .
During the Cultural Revolution , the army was ordered to assist the Red Guards and gradually got deeply involved in the revolution .
The Red Guards eventually split into different factions , accusing each other of counter - revolutionary work , and fighting each other .
They seized weapons from PLA armories , with the army ordered to remain neutral at first .
As we will see , it eventually fell to the PLA to restore order once even Mao realized things had gotten out of hand .
The guy holding the grenade in this poster reminds me of western World War II propaganda , particularly out of the US , where there were numerous posters made featuring big burly men handling phallic ordnance with an intensely determined expression .
I 'm not usually one to agree with how feminists analyse present day human society and conclude that everything men creates in some way visually echoes a penis ( yes , I am exaggerating ) , but in the case of these posters , there may be some amusing truth to it .
1967 – Fully criticize the Chinese Khrushchev from a political , ideological and theoretical perspective
1967 – Completely smash the Liu - Deng counter - revolutionary line
The red book seen in the arms of the muscle men on both these posters is the Little Red Book .
Get used to it , you 'll be seeing a lot of it from here on .
The victims are Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping .
Prior to the cultural revolution , Liu was expected to become Mao's successor , but having criticized Mao and upstaged him after the Great Leap , he became the favourite scapegoat and archetype of a counter - revolutionary during the Cultural Revolution .
As seen in the second poster , he came to be known as the Chinese Kruhshchev , not a positive label considering the icy relations between the Soviet Union and the People 's Republic at the time .
He died under harsh treatment in captivity in 1968 .
Deng Xiaoping was luckier , he was stripped of his offices , subjected to " re-education " and sent to work at an engine factory .
1967 – Scatter the old world , build a new world
The Red Guards travelled the country by the millions , smashing ancient artefacts and buildings while accusing all kinds of people of being counter - revolutionary , including each other .
Often , their actions would not be limited to vocal or printed accusations , but extended into physical attacks , with rape , torture and murder being commonplace .
Furthermore , thousands were driven to suicide .
The death toll has been estimated between 500 000 and 3 million .
Added to that , a vast amount of the cultural heritage of China and its occupied areas vanished through the destruction of artefacts and structures considered old - fashioned .
In Tibet alone , an impressive 6000 monasteries were laid to waste .
Simply put , they went berserk in the China store , like a horde of rabid pandas .
1967 – Let new socialist culture occupy every stage
1967 – Learn from the valiant standard - bearer of the Great Cultural Revolution , comrade Jiang Qing , and pay her respect !
Say hello to Madame Mao .
She was the third and last wife of Mao , and came into prominence during the cultural revolution .
Originally an actress , directing a cultural revolution apparently came naturally to her .
She was not terribly popular at the time , so posters featuring her were comparatively rare .
Disregarding all the rubbish that came with the cultural revolution , the artists behind the propaganda posters of that period deserve praise .
There is an unusual uniformity in the style and simplicity of a large amount of propaganda from this time .
From what I 've been able to gather , the reason for this is that more posters than usual were produced at a local level , rather than at the big , more advanced printing workshops .
The lack of advanced printing equipment meant that artists where required to design posters which could be printed with the simpler equipment available .
The result was a bold and striking style using only black , white and red .
Far from harmonious , this style seems perfect for the turmoil of a revolution , whatever its nature .
This was not the time to brag about the plumpness of the harvest or the importance of steel production , it was a time for running amok , and in that context , this style was just what the doctor ordered .
1967 – Down with American Imperialists and Russian Revisionists !
1968 – Chairman Mao is the great liberator of the world 's revolutionary people
1967 – Smash the Soviet Revisionists !
Even in the midst of the cultural revolution , there was time to worry about the world beyond the borders of the People 's Republic .
As the first and second poster shows , Mao's Little Red Book had by now been distributed to rebellious friends all around the world .
The Little Red came to be seen as a sort of miracle cure for everything .
According to legend , people along the coast of China once joined together and used it to stop a tidal wave .
Armed with such powerful magic , one could hardly expect anything but the swift and total fall of world capitalism at the hands of these rebels .
The third poster illustrates the seriousness of the Sino - Soviet split which had been developing since the late 1950s .
Pictured is the Soviet chairman Leonid Brezhnev and his premier , Alexey Kosygin .
These two had been visited by Chinese prime minister Zhou Enlai in 1964 after Khrushchev had been ousted , and there was a pause in the war of words between the two .
But when Zhou returned , he reported that Brezhnev did not plan on changing the Soviet 's attitude towards the People 's republic , and as this poster shows , the split remained , and worsened as the cultural revolution went ahead .
In 1969 , it turned into open confrontation between the two , and there was great fear of war between the two communist states .
1968 – Chairman Mao goes to Anyuan
Just like the little Red Book was extensively reproduced , so too was this particular painting .
It shows a young Mao striding towards Anyuan in somewhat ominous weather .
His clenched fist , his simple dress , his determined face are all intentionally included to strengthen the image of the great leader .
With the chosen perspective , he rises miles above the mountains , the master of all he surveys .
A part of the " hidden " message of this painting was directed at one of Mao 's chosen enemies of the cultural revolution , Liu Shaoqi who had a better historical claim to Anyuan , having arranged a string of railway strikes there in the 1920s .
In that perspective , this was just one more step in stripping Liu of any credentials he might have .
Supposedly , nearly a billion copies of this painting were printed , and in addition , as we 'll see later , it also came to be incorporated into later posters , as a sort of holy object which people would carry around , just like the Little Red Book .
1969 – Educated youth must go to the countryside
When the Red Guards started seizing weaponry from the People 's Liberation Army and fighting each other , Mao got fed up with the experience and decided to call it off .
As this poster shows , the guards where ordered to disperse into the countryside for some healthy ruralizing .
Some refused , whereupon Mao sent in the army .
Thus the most dramatic part of the Cultural Revolution came to an end , though it would continue in new forms for another seven years .
This series would never have been possible without the two websites listed beneath .
These are the kinds of sites that really make me love the Internet .
If you enjoy what you 've seen in these posts , spending a few hours ( or days ) exploring these websites is not a bad way of spending your time
Chineseposters.net - Hosted and designed by the International Institute of Social History in Amsterdam , this website presents the poster collections of the IISH and that of Stefan R. Landsberger .
Landsberger is the editor of this utterly fascinating site , which he runs together with co-editor Marien van der Heijden .
It includes a vast collection of imagery , accompanied by a wealth of well written commentary and discussion , putting the imagery in the right context , and I 've drawn much on it in the writing of these posts .
Maopost.com - Another huge collection of propaganda .
Not as much commentary as in the former , but including an online collection of over 1600 posters in good quality .
For those who get hooked on this stuff and have a few hundred dollars to spend , Maopost offers hand painted copies of a selection of posters where you can get a face of your choice ( including your own ) painted into an otherwise authentic poster .
chromatic discusses binary compatibility with the perl executable .
I ’m someone who only uses XS modules and hopes to never have to write one .
Yet , unlike what seems to be the prevailing fear , I do n’t worry about binary compatibility .
I do n’t worry about upgrades breaking things .
I do n’t worry that I ’m going to have mismatches in executables / libraries .
Why ?
Continuous integration .
Do n’t just grab modules from the CPAN and install them somewhere never to be upgraded until you ’re forced to at a huge amount of time and expense .
Regularly rebuild everything you use , preferably daily or hourly .
Install a perl binary and then lock it down .
Do n’t use site dirs .
Have the perl core be inviolate .
Instead , install to some other directory and point PERL5LIB at it .
Both CPAN and CPANPLUS allow you to configure what you want to be passed to the configuration program .
Pass a value for INSTALL_BASE to Makefile .
PL and install_base to Build .
PL that points to your directory .
Set up a build server to use CPAN or CPANPLUS to “ install ” and build everything .
Since your build machine will be rebuilding everything regularly , when you upgrade your perl binary or an XS module , any problems will be quickly identified .
Everything being rebuilt in one go means that all binary code will match up and you do n’t have to worry about them getting out of sync .
Because installing a distribution causes all of that distribution ’s tests to be run , you ’ll know that that distribution works in your environment .
( If you ’re using taint mode and thus can not use PERL5LIB , have your build machine build a custom perl executable along with everything else . )
Details for doing this belong in another post .
But the point is , if you regularly rebuild all of the CPAN code you use , you do n’t need to worry about binary issues .
In October 1987 I was sent to the battle front north of Jaffna where , by coincidence , Akila and Ajanthi joined me in a unit of 30 cadres .
The first female Tiger had died only a few days earlier , confirming that women were now firmly engaged in frontline fighting .
During battles we had been trained to fire in the general direction of the enemy , not at individual targets , and I am not sure whether any of my bullets hit anyone .
I 'm glad I do n't know .
I once asked the more experienced Muralie how he had coped with the knowledge that he had shot people .
' After your second victim , ' he said , ' you learn to live with it . '

Homeland Security Threat Monitor
July 2011 - The Department of Homeland Security has discontinued the Homeland Security Advisory System and replaced it with something else .
The rest of this page is retained for historical interest .
I do not plan to upgrade the Homeland Security Threat Monitor .
In early 2002 , the President of the United States George W. Bush created the Department of Homeland Security which is responsible for protecting the nation against the threat of terrorism .
The Department of Homeland Security introduced the Homeland Security Advisory System that uses a color - coded scale of threat levels to communicate with the public about the general severity of current terrorist threats against the nation .
The Department of Homeland Security shows the current threat level on their web site .
The Homeland Security Threat Monitor is a small Windows application that runs in your system tray , showing the current terrorism threat level .
It periodically checks to make sure the information is up to date by contacting the Department of Homeland Security web server .
Features
Unobtrusive placement in the Windows tray .
Several different icon styles .
Blinking notification of increased threat level .
Cooperates well with dial - up connections .
Installation
There is no formal installation procedure for the Homeland Security Threat Monitor .
Download the zip file , unzip either all its contents or just the threat .
exe program file , and run it .
You may want to create a shortcut in your Startup program group so the application starts whenever you start your computer .
→ Download threat - 1.0.5.zip ( file size : about 90 k ; md5 50 fce6dbd8ce94edf28a83c988621693 )
→ changes . txt ( changes in recent versions )
Commands
When the Threat Monitor is running , you may right - click on its icon in the tray to active a menu of commands .
The menu is divided into two sections .
The top section lists all the Homeland Security Advisory System threat levels and indicates which one is currently active .
Although these options are present on the menu , they are for reference only and not useful to select .
The lower section of the menu contains the following commands :
Style Select from one of the following icon styles : Orb
Orb USA
USA Patriot
Patriot Flag
Flag Shapes
Shapes Duct tape
The green color in the above examples represents the Low threat level .
This color will change as the threat level changes , ie .
it will be yellow for Elevated .
Update now Attempt to contact the Department of Homeland Security web server immediately to update the current threat level .
Once a successful contact is made , a confirmation message will be displayed .
If no contact is made within 60 seconds , a message will be displayed and you will be asked if you wish to continue trying .
Homeland Security Activate your web browser and go to the Department of Homeland Security web site .
About Show information about the Homeland Security Threat Monitor , including a link to the original location of this web page .
Close Close the Homeland Security Threat Monitor application .
No icon or further updates will be shown until the application is restarted .
When the Homeland Security threat level changes to a higher level , the icon in the tray will blink .
This is to let you know that the Attorney General has increased the threat level .
When you click on the icon , a message will be shown that informs you of the new threat level .
For more information on the current threat , you should visit the Department of Homeland Security web site .
Operation
While running , the Homeland Security Threat Monitor checks the current theat level status on the Department of Homeland Security web server every seven hours , whenever the application is started , or whenever the " Update now " command is selected .
If you use a dial - up connection , and it is time for a scheduled update and you are not connected to the Internet , the application will wait until you do connect to perform an update .
The application will never request that an automatic connection be made just to check the threat level .
Whenever the application is started , it automatically makes a connection to the hewgill.com web server to check for a new configuration file .
This configuration file tells the program which web page at the Department of Homeland Security to examine to obtain the current threat level , and what information to read from the page .
This feature exists so that if the Department of Homeland Security changes their web page layout , a new version of the configuration file will automatically be used .
The current configuration file can be viewed here ( it is an XML file ) .
The Homeland Security Threat Monitor saves the current threat level , the time an update was last performed , and the Style selection in the Windows registry .
This information is saved under the following key :
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\hewgill.com
\Homeland Security Threat Monitor
This is the only section of the registry that is modified by the application .

Disclaimer , etc .
Okay , I admit , this is a totally silly and pointless piece of software .
If you live so much in a box that you do n't read , watch , or listen to any news at least once every couple of days , perhaps this application will help keep you in touch with reality .
If you do try to keep up with world events , you will probably hear about a significant terrorism threat through some other means before this program gets around to letting you know about it .
This program is just for fun , despite its serious theme .
Finally , a disclaimer :
This program does not present official information .
The information provided by this program must never be used in making actual decisions .
Please contact an official source or your local authorities if you are ever unsure what to do in case of the threat of terrorism .
Britain ’s Got Talent : Susan Boyle sings Memory from Cats ( video )
Internet sensation Susan Boyle once again wowed the world with her soaring voice as she took to the stage and performed Memory from Cats on the semifinals of Britain ’s Got Talent .
The 48 - year - old from Scotland looked glamorous but retained her down to earth looks the world has fallen in love with as she sang the song made popular by her idol Elaine Paige .
“ I thought you sang beautifully , thank you Susan , ” Piers Morgan said .
“ You nailed that performance , I am so proud of you , ” Amanda Holden added .
And with that amazing performance , Susan has gone through to the final of Britain ’s Got Talent !
Since appearing on the talent competition , her performance of I Dreamed a Dream has been viewed almost 60 million times on YouTube , and the Scot has been praised by celebrities including Oprah Winfrey and Demi Moore .
The winner will perform at the Royal Variety Show and receive a check for 100,000 pounds .
Here ’s the video of Susan singing Memory on Britain ’s Got Talent ( May 24 )

It looks like AT&T is taking the Pre pretty seriously .
An internal AT&T memo has been circulating around retail employees , listing some anti-Pre talking points .
I hate to say it , but AT&T got us on a few points , but a few are just down right derisory remarks at the Pre , at least in my opinion :
Palm Pre is " Available in black only " where the iPhone is " available in Black or White "
It 's a fact that Apple 's App store is doing pretty well , but to say that the Palm Pre has an " Unproven App catalog app store " is being too hasty .
First off , early developers are saying that webOS lives up to its hype , coding in just html , css and java fits plenty of developers in webOS , and lastly , it 's not even publicly released yet .
" Touchscreen control gestures not intuitive . "
Does n't the iPhone uses about the same gestures ?
" No global roaming , limited global GPS . " on the Palm Pre .
Just wait till you forget to turn on " international data roaming " on the iPhone ( hint : your bill wo n't be pretty ) .
I 'll leave the rest for our readers to debunk on ...
President Obama ’s nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court has put the Republican Party in a bind , as it weighs the cost of aggressively opposing Mr. Obama ’s attempt to put the first Hispanic on the high court at a time when the party has struggled with sharp setbacks in its effort to appeal to Hispanic voters .
The Republican Party has been embroiled in a public argument over whether to tend to the ideological interests of its conservative base or to expand its appeal to a wider variety of voters in order to regain its strength following the defeats of 2008 .
Many conservatives came out fiercely against Ms. Sotomayor as soon her name was announced , denouncing her as liberal and promising Mr. Obama a tough nomination fight .
“ The G.O. P. has to make a stand , ” said Scott Reed , manager of the 1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole .
“ This is what the base and social conservatives really care about , and we need to brand her a liberal with some out - of - the - mainstream positions .
Forget about cosmetics and ethnic heritage , and focus on her record . ”
But some Republicans warned that the image of Republicans throwing a roadblock before an historic nomination could prove politically devastating .
Republicans saw a dip in Hispanic support in 2008 , after eight years in which former President George W. Bush and his political aides had made a concerted effort to increase the Republican appeal to Hispanics , the nation ’s fastest - growing group of voters .
“ If Republicans make a big deal of opposing Sotomayor , we will be hurling ourselves off a cliff , ” said Mark McKinnon , a senior adviser to Mr. Bush and a long - time advocate of expanding the party ’s appeal .
“ Death will not be assured .
But major injury will be . ”
Matthew Dowd , another one - time adviser to Mr. Bush , said that in 2000 , he calculated that Republicans needed to win 35 percent of Hispanics to beat Democrats .
He said that given the steady increase in the number of Hispanic voters , he now believed Republicans needed to win a minimum of 40 percent to be competitive with Democrats .
As a result , he said , barring any revelation about Ms. Sotomayor ’s background , Republicans could doom themselves to long - term minority status if they are perceived as preventing Ms. Sotomayor from becoming a judge .
He argued that the party could not even be seen as threatening a filibuster .
“ Because you ’ll have a bunch of white males who lead the Judiciary Committee leading the charge taking on an Hispanic women and everybody from this day forward is going to know she ’s totally qualified , ” he said .
“ It ’s a bad visual .
It ’s bad symbolism for the Republicans . ”
“ Republicans have to tread very lightly , ” he said .
“ They ca n’t look they are going after her in any kind of personal or mean way .
There ’s no way they can even threaten a filibuster ; I think a threat of that sort would be a problem , even if they did n’t do it . ”
The conflicting pressures became clear throughout the day as conservative groups came out against Ms. Sotomayor .
From the start , conservative leaders have made clear that they viewed the prospect of an ideologically charged nomination fight as a way to revive a movement that is lagging in spirits and funds .
“ Judge Sotomayor is a liberal activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written , ” said Wendy E. Long , counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network , a conservative group that has been preparing for this battle .
Whatever their differences with the nominee herself , Republicans throughout the day offered support , albeit grudging support , to Mr. Obama ’s political instincts displayed with the nomination .
“ Obama has demonstrated a deft political touch with this pick ” said Phil Musser , a Republican consultant .
“ Republicans who pick a fight with an up - from - the - bootstraps Hispanic woman do so at their own peril , and should only do so for a very , very good reason . ”
Mr. Bush , who is from Texas , pushed hard from the moment he ran for president in 2000 to appeal to Hispanic voters , and with considerable success .
His aides argued that given the increasing size of that segment of the electorate , building support among Hispanics was a crucial part of trying to achieve dominance over Democrats .
But the Republican effort suffered a sharp setback when Republicans , over the objections of Mr. Bush , pressed to severely restrict immigration .
The party ’s 2008 presidential candidate , Senator John McCain of Arizona , had long been a proponent of easing immigration restrictions , and almost lost his party ’s nomination because of that .
In the end , he received 31 percent of the Hispanic vote , according to a survey of voters leaving the polls .
By contrast , four years earlier , Mr. Bush won 43 percent of the Hispanic vote .
Mr. Dowd said the party ’s first risk would be in national elections .
But he said it could trickle down into the states as well – particularly in places like Texas , which has a big Hispanic vote .
If Hispanics begin turning toward Democrats , he said , Texas – now a reliably Republican state – could quickly turn into a swing state .
“ If they do n’t get back to a place where they are getting roughly 40 percent net of the Hispanic vote , there is no way they can ever win , ” he said .
Socially conservative Hispanic Christians , a pivotal group that Republicans have tried with mixed success to woo , warned that the party ’s effort could be set back if conservatives attacked her .
“ As a conservative , it could be worse , ” said the Rev. Luis Cortes Jr. , who as president of the national Hispanic Christian group Esperanza USA was personally courted by President George W. Bush and has since appeared at the Obama White House .
“ And as Latino , it ca n’t be better . ”

Overview
TrueCrypt is a free , open source and multi platform disk encryption software for Windows , Linux and Mac OS X systems .
Review
TrueCrypt was recommended to me by Gerald , he says that he can’t live without this open source program .
I ’m always getting valuable information from my readers , so I decided to try this freeware program myself and see if I ’ll be able to live without it 🙂
TrueCrypt uses three of the best encryption algorithms , AES - 256 , Serpent , and Twofish .
Basically what you can do with it is create a virtual encrypted disk and mount it as a real disk or encrypt an entire partition or an external drive , USB disk or hard disk .
After you chose your way , the encryption will be automatic and on the fly .
The best way to start is with the Volume Creation Wizard , you ’ll be guided step by step towards your goal .
You can even encrypt your system drive , but that could be risky .
A great thing about the program is the way that it explains everything that it does with your files and partitions , giving you warnings and information in order not to do anything stupid .
I ’m not too worried about the security of the data that I have in my PC , maybe simply because I do n’t have anything illegal or abnormal in my PC .
However , being careful ca n’t be too bad .
Overall TrueCrypt is a very powerful freeware program , not very easy to use but the tutorials and the information that the developers made available can guide you through easily .

anti-vaxers : yelling “ fire ” in a crowded theater …
Anti-vaxxers are absolutely certain that vaccines are evil and they 're prepared to move any goal post to justify that belief .
We ’re all concerned about our children and their health .
It ’s in our nature .
Long childhoods and parental care are key strategies to ensuring the survival of not just humans , but all mammals in general and it ’s one of a number of reasons why we ’ve been able to take over the Earth after the dinosaurs vanished .
But sometimes , that concern turns into panic and that panic combined with a lack of information or lack of knowledge on the subject can turn malicious and harm the very kids we ’re trying to protect .
The current vaccination debate is a textbook case of that problem .
Rather than protecting kids from bad medicine , anti-vaccine activists are really just scaring parents with misleading and unscientific data , and indulging conspiracy theories .
As herd immunity drops because parents do n’t vaccinate and kids are starting to die of preventable diseases , the anti-vaxers deny any and all responsibility while actively peddling fear , uncertainty and doubt rather than help the parents make informed decisions about vaccines .
They yell “ fire ! ” in a crowded theater because they think they ’ve seen a spark and tell us that when people are trampled in the panic they create , it ’s not their fault .
Then , when the firefighters arrive and see no fire or evidence of one , they accuse the firefighters of being arsonists in disguise .
Discover Magazine recently ran a story which provides a brief account of how what was once a small group of parents blaming vaccines makers for giving their kids autism based on a fraudulent study by doctor Andrew Wakefield , became such a mainstream phenomenon thanks to celebrity activism of the worst kind .
The core of the controversy was the vaccine preservative thimerosal which was supposed to prevent contamination by bacteria and make vaccines safer .
Instead , Wakefield alleged , the mercury in it caused autism , particularly in the MMR vaccine .
In 1999 , thimerosal was removed from all vaccines except flu shots .
If Wakefield was right , rising autism rates should ’ve reversed .
Instead , they climbed even higher .
Subsequent studies found there ’s no link between the preservative and autism but the anti-vaxers held firm .
It would take a lot more than just science and peer - reviewed research to sway them .
So they responded by moving the goal posts and saying that “ toxins ” in vaccines were causing autism .
On top of that , there are too many vaccines and infants are being overwhelmed with shot after shot , after shot .
Now , fighting toxins in vaccines is all well and good , but what anti-vaxers do is throw out scary chemical names and use the names themselves as proof that vaccines are toxic .
A lot of common , everyday things have a chemical name that sounds like a bio - weapon but in reality , they ’re harmless .
We also need to keep in mind that we ’re exposed to small quantities of toxins every day but our bodies can deal with these contaminants .
It ’s also not true that infants ’ bodies are overwhelmed by the quantity of vaccines they receive .
Their immune systems are strong enough to deal with multiple vaccinations .
There ’s also a problem with diagnosing autism .
Some experts are starting to think that the increase in autism cases is being influenced by medical bureaucracy .
Over the last revision to the DSM , criteria for diagnosing a case of autism have been greatly expanded and as a result , this complex condition is getting more and more prevalent in medical paperwork .
Before , it ’s very possible that autism was drastically underreported .
To make matters even more confusing , signs of autism are now being identified in children just 12 months old , which is actually before the much vilified MMR vaccine is scheduled to be given .
Could the seemingly sudden rise in autism over the last few decades be much more moderate than we think ?
And could the difficulty in making those diagnoses make the whole idea of an autism epidemic a matter of debate ?
Until we have some idea of what causes autism and how we can get better stats on the matter , we ca n’t go around randomly assigning culprits and and talking about epidemics and sudden rises , scaring people out of their wits .
It makes perfect sense we want to assign blame and find something or someone to hold responsible for big problems with which we do n’t know how to deal right now .
But what anti-vaxers have done borders on malice and shows willful obstinacy in light of facts .
They know vaccines are evil and they ’re not budging .
At the same time , they flood the internet with information that flies in the face of science and conspiracy theories that vilify vaccine makers as immoral entities willing to slay toddlers as long as it brings them a dollar .
Parents who need to find legitimate scientific data are being drawn into celebrity delusions and populist fuming from those who reject the scientific method , even when confronted with the harm they do firsthand .
And to add insult to injury , they refuse to acknowledge their mistakes , no matter how many times they ’re corrected by experts .

Jim Buckmaster , the chief executive of listings website Craigslist , speaks out over allegations that the site promoted prostitution by hosting an ' erotic services ' category guardian.co.uk
Classified advertising website Craigslist has been the victim of a " witch - hunt " by self - interested politicians and the hypocritical media , according to the man in charge of the company .
Talking to the Guardian , chief executive Jim Buckmaster – who has run the website since 2000 – said that a recent string of claims that Craigslist encourages prostitution are part of a concerted attack by government officials and the press .
" We were just the subjects of a witch - hunt over a certain class of ads , " he said .
" We 've had this recent episode where a grandstanding politician has decided to call us out as criminals in a way that was unfair , unreasonable and unlawful . "
The individual in question ?
Henry McMaster , the attorney general of South Carolina , who threatened Craigslist with criminal investigation over the issue .
Buckmaster responded by suing McMaster , and was granted a temporary restraining order last weekend to stop such threats happening again .
McMaster has not responded to the Guardian 's request for comment , but in an earlier statement he said that the decision to sue by Craigslist was a victory for his office , because it showed that the website " is taking the matter seriously for the first time " .
" More importantly , overnight they have removed the erotic services section from their website , as we asked them to do .
And they are now taking responsibility for the content of their future advertisements .
If they keep their word , this is a victory for law enforcement and for the people of South Carolina . "
" Unfortunately , we had to inform them of possible state criminal violations concerning their past practices to produce a serious response .
We trust they will now adhere to the higher standards they have promised .
This office and the law enforcement agencies of South Carolina will continue to monitor the site to make certain that our laws are respected . "
That encounter came after a period of concerted pressure on the San Francisco - based site : in March , police in Chicago claimed that the site was " the single largest source of prostitution " in America .
Statements by a number of officials around the US were then exacerbated by the murder in Boston of a masseuse who advertised on the website – with the US press quickly dubbing the culprit the " Craigslist killer " .
The site , which has repeatedly denied accusations that it encourages the sex trade , had previously tried to appease its detractors by agreeing to a series of changesin the way it runs its adult advertising section .
However , said Buckmaster , the real question was how the media and politicians have deflected attention away from their own activities – including the reliance that many local newspapers and magazines place on the same sort of ads that they decry on the internet .
" Journalistic media have no interest in reporting on far larger numbers , and far more graphic ads that exist in their own publications , " he said .
" They only have an interest in reporting such ads as they appear on the internet , and on Craigslist in particular . "
This , he said , creates a self - reinforcing cycle that allows media organisations to redirect the focus away from their own reliance on adult advertising – indeed , in a post on the official Craigslist blog , Buckmaster outlined a number of sexually explicit and highly graphic listings from Village Voice , the publisher which owns alternative weekly newspapers across America .
" You get this vicious cycle going back and forth and in our case it 's resulted in an unreasonable , unfair and hypocritical witch - hunt that 's been playing out over the last couple of weeks , " he said .
" This guy in South Carolina was hellbent on ignoring the law , ignoring facts , ignoring what everyone else in the law enforcement and legal communities were saying .
Constructive criticism is wonderful , but slander , libel and defamation – that 's where we 're drawing the line . "
The office of Thomas McMaster did not respond to request for comment .
But internet rights campaigners said there was no basis in law for his initial attacks on the site .
" What the attorneys general were trying to do was build public pressure to try and get them to change it , " said Matt Zimmerman , a senior staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" The law was built to protect and shield people in the middle from this kind of harassment … instead you get these posturing , publicity - seeking lawsuits from officials that are completely contrary to the law . "
Ha-ha , just kidding .
I ’m not going to be arguing for piracy , but I do want to make one observation about how our industry is dealing with this issue .
Some commentators have been talking recently about the massive piracy afflicting the launch of Demigod .
According to Stardock ’s Brad Wardell , of the 140,000 connections to the main server during the game ’s first week , only 18,000 were by legitimate customers .
This ratio compares favorably ( or is that unfavorably ? ) with the 90 % piracy rate reported by the developers of World of Goo .
I do n’t want to comment on the viability of various DRM schemes , but – needless to say – unless a game is server - based ( WoW , EVE , EverQuest ) , piracy is a bracing reality for game developers .
However , I have an unscientific theory about the root of the problem :
For any given game , only around 10 % of players are ever willing to purchase an original retail product .
Obviously , this proposition holds up for PC gaming , but I believe the same is true for console gaming ( housemates sharing a copy , renting from Blockbuster over a weekend , friends loaning each other games , grabbing a cheap used copy from Gamestop ) and even board games ( one gamer buying a copy for a group of friends ) .
This reality is immutable – if DRM was perfect , the percentage would go up somewhat , but it would never come anywhere near 100 % .
Too many games exist for consumers to afford even a small percentage of them , and – more importantly – players ’ individual interests in a specific game are always on a continuum .
People on one extreme found a website about their favorite game while gamers on the other end might play it only once on a random Tuesday night at a friend ’s house .
The interesting thing about this percentage is that it mirrors another important percentage – the number of players willing to pay money on so - called free - to - play game usually hovers near 5 - 10 % .
( RuneScape , a F2P example on the higher - end , has reported figures around 12 % . )
The important thing about the free - to - play movement is that the business model turns the theory I posited above into a founding principle .
In fact , the smartest F2P games use a dual - currency system so that the 5 - 10 % cash - rich players can subsidize the time - rich ones .
Ultimately , this model works because a place exists for everyone on the continuum , from gamers who just want to dip a toe to ones willing to drop thousands on microtransactions .
Launching a traditional retail game and hoping to change your “ piracy conversion ” rate is fighting the current ; launching a free - to - play game built from the start with multiple levels of player commitment is sailing with the current .
The website of the music industry lobby group IFPI is suffering from an organized DDoS attack and has been unresponsive for the past few hours .
The attack was organized by Pirate Bay supporters who do n't agree with the sentences handed out to the four defendants .
There are many ways for people to show that they disagree with the entertainment industry ’s crackdown on file - sharing sites .
Some choose to become a member of a political party that shares their opinion , others go out on the streets and demonstrate .
And then there ’s another branch of people – those who launch a counterstrike from behind their desks .
In February , when the Pirate Bay trial was in full swing , a group of hackers managed to deface the Swedish IFPI site .
Today , the international IFPI site is the new target and is suffering from a DDoS attack .
At the time of writing the website is completely inaccessible .
The attacks are part of Operation Baylout which also encourages people to send black faxes to the MPAA ’s anti-piracy office and movie industry lawyer Monique Wadsted .
Thus far , we have no confirmation that any fax machines have been taken down .
The Pirate Bay ’s Peter Sunde told TorrentFreak in a comment : “ I feel peoples ’ frustration .
I hope they do something more permanent instead , like making sure the idiots that give power to the media industry lose their own power .
We need to cut out the companies abusing copyright at the expense of society ’s well - being .
But this is not a permanent fix so it ’s just pointless . ”
Pointless or not , according to the Reg , some 250 hackers are gathering in AnonNet ’s IRC channels to discuss their battle strategies and future plans .
Mooncup , one of the root administrators at AnonNet confirmed this and told TorrentFreak : “ They seem to be doing it to demonstrate to the record industry that the Internet is our domain and they can keep the fuck out of our business or face the consequences , ” he explained .
“ They [ IFPI ] represent most of the record companies , therefore attacking them represents an attack on all of the people who try to stop websites like The Pirate Bay without really understanding what they are really about , ” Mooncus added , noting that AnonNet itself is by no means involved in the attacks .
IFPI was contacted for a response , but we have n’t heard back from them at the time of publication .
Update : IFPI.se is also down .

Arianna Huffington , the liberal darling in bed with the globalist George Soros by way of the Bermuda - based Atlantic Philanthropies , has posted an article on her website penned by Rep. Linda Sánchez , the Democrat congress critter from California .
Sánchez is behind the so - called Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act , an effort to impose draconian regulations on the internet .
California Democrat Linda Sanchez
Megan Meier , a thirteen year old from Dardenne Prairie , Missouri , killed herself in response to “ cyberbullying ” on MySpace .
It later came out that Megan was harassed by Lori Drew , the mother of a former friend .
A federal grand jury indicted Drew on May 15 , 2008 , on three counts of accessing protected computers without authorization to obtain information to inflict emotional distress , and one count of criminal conspiracy .
She was found guilty on three lesser charges .
For Sánchez and the co-sponsors of this bill the conviction is not enough .
They want the full coercive weight of the government behind a law that will punish people for the crime of “ cyberbullying ” on the internet .
“ When so - called child ’s play turns hostile and a child becomes a victim , it is time to act , ” writes Sánchez on Huffpo .
“ When so - called free speech leads to bullies having free - reign to threaten kids , it is time to act .
The Supreme Court recognizes that in some instances words can be harmful .
For example , you cannot falsely yell ‘ FIRE ’ in a crowded theater .
If you say it even once you can be held liable .
Yet , you can repeatedly emotionally abuse someone with words , pictures , and false impressions online and get away scot - free . ”
On April 30 , law professor and blogger Eugene Volokh addressed the draconian nature of Sánchez ’s bill .
Volokh underscores the following language contained in the bill :
Whoever transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication , with the intent to coerce , intimidate , harass , or cause substantial emotional distress to a person , using electronic means to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior , shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years , or both … .
[ “ Communication ” ] means the electronic transmission , between or among points specified by the user , of information of the user ’s choosing , without change in the form or content of the information as sent and received ; … [ “ Electronic means ” ] means any equipment dependent on electrical power to access an information service , including email , instant messaging , blogs , websites , telephones , and text messages .
Volokh proposes a couple hypothetical situations in regard to the language in the bill :
I try to coerce a politician into voting a particular way , by repeatedly blogging ( using a hostile tone ) about what a hypocrite / campaign promise breaker / fool / etc .
he would be if he voted the other way .
I am transmitting in interstate commerce a communication with the intent to coerce using electronic means ( a blog ) “ to support severe , repeated , and hostile behavior ” — unless , of course , my statements are n’t seen as “ severe , ” a term that is entirely undefined and unclear .
Result : I am a felon , unless somehow my “ behavior ” is n’t “ severe . ” (…)
A newspaper reporter or editorialist tries to do the same , in columns that are posted on the newspaper ’s Web site .
Result : Felony , unless somehow my “ behavior ” is n’t severe .
“ The examples could be multiplied pretty much indefinitely , ” writes Volokh .
“ The law , if enacted , would clearly be facially overboard ( and probably unconstitutionally vague ) , and would thus be struck down on its face under the First Amendment .
But beyond that , surely even the law ’s supporters do n’t really want to cover all this speech . ”
It is less than clear supporters of the bill “ do n’t really want to cover all this speech . ”

Obama Democrats are busy at work formulating “ diversity of ownership ” rules at the Federal Communications Commission , considered by opponents to be a back - door effort to revive the so - called Fairness Doctrine .
“ The left has reached the conclusion that the political price to pay for reinstating the Fairness Doctrine is too high , so now they ’re looking at these new means , ” Seton Motley , director of communications for the Media Research Center , told Fox News earlier this week .
The current chairman of the committee , Henry Rivera , has been singled out for his past support of the measure when he was a commissioner of the FCC from 1981 - 1985 .
The doctrine died in 1987 , only after Rivera left the FCC .
Democrats and their liberal partisans have repeatedly called for their opponents to be silenced by the government .
A rather blatant example of this occurred after Richard Poplawski killed Pittsburgh police officers in April .
Daily Kos , Media Matters , and other liberal partisan outlets , orchestrated by the ADL and the Southern Poverty Law Center , launched a virulent campaign attempting to link Alex Jones to the deranged killer .
They argued that “ rightwing conspiracy theories ” led directly to violence and the murder of cops .
Steve Rendall , FAIR ’s senior analyst , notes “ that over - the - air broadcasting remains the most powerful force affecting public opinion ” and declares “ broadcasters ought to be insuring that they inform the public , not inflame them .
That ’s why we need a Fairness Doctrine .
It ’s not a universal solution .
It ’s not a substitute for reform or for diversity of ownership .
It ’s simply a mechanism to address the most extreme kinds of broadcast abuse . ”
FAIR , short for Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting , is funded by the Rockefeller Family Fund , the MacArthur Foundation , the Schumann Foundation , and the Ford Foundation , so we can assume they influence the sort of “ diversity of ownership ” pushed by FAIR .
The Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention
Act has nothing to do with protecting children .
It is all about whittling away the First Amendment and tricking Democrats and so - called “ progressives ” into supporting tyranny .
Obama ’s packing of the FCC with “ diversity ” activists has nothing to do with making sure minorities have a say in local media dominated by mega- corporations certainly not interested in genuine diversity .
It is about making sure alternative media is not only hobbled and fearful — under penalty of law — of hurting the feelings of protected minorities or school children on MySpace without adult supervision .
It is about shutting down all opposition .

Man falls 300 ft to his death posing for cliff - top photograph
A man fell to his death after he posed for a photograph holding on to a cliff edge by a tuft of grass , coastguards said yesterday .
The 39 - year - old Polish man tumbled 300 ft down the sheer cliff face , landing in the bushes below at Seaton , Devon , on Sunday .
A coastguard helicopter and team were called to rescue him but paramedics declared him dead at the scene .
A rescue party arrived at the scene of the earlier accident near Folkestone , Kent , but the Russian tourist was pronounced dead after a 300 ft fall
Maddy Davey , Portland coastguard watch manager , said : ' The 39 - year - old Polish man was posing for a photograph whilst holding on to a tuft of grass at the top of the cliffs .
' The grass gave way and he was seen by some tourists on the scene to fall down the sheer face of the cliffs and land in bushes at the bottom .
' It was the middle of the day .
All the tourists were there , people along the cliff path , who witnessed it . '
A police spokesman said the man , whose family in Poland has yet to be informed of his death , had been travelling with a group of Polish tourists .
Danger zone :
The 300 ft - high cliff in Folkestone , Kent
His death follows that of another man , thought to be Russian , who fell from a clifftop as he walked with friends at Capelle - Ferne near Folkestone , Kent , on the same day .
Dover Coastguard said the cliff where the Russian man fell was a sheer drop of around 300 ft , in an area that is popular with walkers .
A Kent Police spokesman said the death was being treated as an accident and the coroner had been informed .
The coastguard issued a warning about the dangers of cliffs after the two deaths .
A spokesman said : ' Please do not stray away from cliff paths and do not go near the edges of cliffs .
' Often , despite appearances , they can be unstable and crumbly , as well as being slippery when wet . '
The quality of the scan is pretty good overall , but pages 562 and 563 ( images 584 and 585 ) are just barely legible .
mudchuck -- November 28 , 2011good , but two blurry pages
Almost three quarters of Earth 's surface is covered with water , but most of it is too salty to drink .
And the 2.5 percent that is freshwater is locked up either in soil , remote snowpacks and glaciers or in deep aquifers .
That leaves less than 1 percent of all freshwater for humans and animals to drink and for farmers to use to raise crops — and that remnant is shrinking as rising global temperatures trigger more droughts .
The upshot : it 's becoming increasingly difficult to slake the world 's thirst as the population grows and water supplies dwindle .
Analysts at the investment bank Goldman Sachs estimate that worldwide water use doubles every 20 years .
So the search for new water sources is on .
One proved candidate is desalinization — technologies that extract the salt from brine drawn from the oceans or saline aquifers to create potable water .
But the historically high price of desalinization has largely kept it at bay , a situation that 's changing as technology improves and growing demand squeezes freshwater supplies .
" The two main desalinization techniques are distillation and reverse osmosis , or RO , " says Menachem Elimelech , an environmental engineer at Yale University .
" Distillation , in which the raw water is evaporated and then condensed as freshwater , is energy - intensive , so it 's mainly used in the Middle East where oil is abundant . "
Thermal salt - removing processes require high temperatures so they tend to be expensive ( more than $ 1 per cubic meter of freshwater ) , but the use of rejected " waste " heat from other industrial or power plant operations for co-generation can cut energy expenditure .
More commonly , however , desalinization plants rely on RO , which is based on high - tech polymer membranes that are permeable to water , but reject the passage of dissolved salts , Elimelich says .
When a saline solution sits on one side of a semipermeable membrane and a less salty solution is on the other , he explains , water diffuses through the membrane from the less concentrated to the more concentrated side .
Scientists call this phenomenon osmosis , which tends to equalize the salinity of the two solutions .
In the 1950s and '60s researchers realized that they could reverse the process by applying pressure to the more concentrated solution , causing water molecules there to traverse the membrane , leaving behind a condensed brine .
To counter the osmotic pressure that arises between the solutions and force water back through the membrane , desalinization plants must utilize high pressures of 7,000 to 8,300 kilopascals ( 71 to 86.5 kilogram - force per square centimeter or 1,000 to 1,200 pounds per square inch ) , he notes .
Common RO membranes are thin - film composites that combine a mechanically robust support layer made of microporous polysulfone with a micron - thick polyamide " filter " layer through which water molecules can pass but nothing else .
The latter substance is " a second cousin to DuPont 's Kevlar — the super - strong aramid polymer fiber used in lightweight body armor , " says Bill Mickols , senior research scientist at Dow Water Solutions ( DWS ) of Edina , Minn. , the biggest supplier of such products .
RO membranes have matured during the past two decades , he says , with marked improvements in water permeability , salt - rejection capability , operating life ( now as long as three to five years ) and cost .
These advances , in combination with energy - recovery devices that take pressure from the concentrated brine stream and transfer most of it to the incoming water flow , have made desalinization more affordable .
Current RO facilities desalinize seawater for 68 to 90 cents per cubic meter .
The average delivery price of municipal water in the U.S. is around 60 cents a cubic meter , according to the American Water Works Association .
Other improvements currently in the works include measures to maintain process flow .
RO plants must filter seawater and inject chemicals to eliminate particles that could cause clogging , and the membranes are washed regularly to lessen scale formation and biofilm fouling , says Benny Freeman , a chemical engineer at the University of Texas at Austin .
" Chlorine is added to sterilize the water , " he says , " but operators usually need to dechlorinate it afterwards to protect the membrane from chemical degradation . "
Freeman and James McGrath , a polymer scientist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg have modified chlorine - resistant polysulfone to serve as a desalinization membrane .
Researchers elsewhere are meanwhile attempting to work around the RO 's reliance on high pressure .
Elimelech and entrepreneur Robert McGinnis have advanced a process called forward osmosis ( FO ) that could reduce the energy needed to purify water by 90 percent .
FO takes advantage of the osmotic pressure difference between a concentrated " draw " solution and a raw water stream to drive water through a semipermeable membrane .
" The right draw solution means you do n't have to do all the work with pressure , " McGinnis notes , who recently formed a start - up company called Oasys to commercialize the technology .
The main challenge , he adds , is to select a nontoxic draw solute that may be simply and economically removed .
Oasys plans to use an ammonia and carbon dioxide mixture as a draw solute .
When the solution is heated , the dissolved ammonium carbonate and related salts decompose into their precursor gases , enabling easy removal .
Oasys ' process , McGinnis says , can run efficiently on small quantities of electrical power combined with " waste " heat ( less than 120 degrees Fahrenheit , or 50 degrees Celsius ) from industrial operations .
When fully scaled up , FO desalinization is expected to cost only 37 to 44 cents a cubic meter .
More speculative desalinization research aims to create " superflux " membranes that allow water to pass through more easily , says Mark Shannon , director of the Center of Advanced Materials for the Purification of Water with Systems ( CAMPWS ) at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign .
Investigators have shown , for example , that carbon nanotubes can convey water at unexpectedly high flow rates .
These so - called water wires may be able to pass a greater volume of water at a given pressure than existing membranes while still blocking out hydrated salts .
Biomimetic membrane technologies are also under development , Shannon says .
These materials try to imitate the ability of the minute pores in biological cell membranes to selectively allow water to flow through while preventing the passage of salt ions .
The Danish firm Aquaporin , for instance , is embedding natural aquaporins ( water channels ) extracted from green plants in membranes that it hopes to market this year .
Others , including CAMPWS scientists , are working on artificial active nanopore structures .
Recently , the Madrid Institute for Advanced Studies agreed to collaborate with Valladolid , Spain–based engineering company , PROINGESA , to design a capacitive de-ionization process that applies an electrical potential to raw water to attract dissolved salt ions toward oppositely charged electrodes , where they are adsorbed and later removed .
Some 13,000 desalinization plants capable of producing 52.3 million cubic meters ( 13.8 billion gallons ) of potable water a day are currently in operation , according to the International Desalination Association ( IDA ) .
But that is only a half a percent of global daily water use , a figure that would grow faster if process costs could be further reduced .
Nevertheless , construction of desalinization facilities rose at an annual clip of 17 percent since 1990 , the IDA reports .
The trend worries many local environmental groups , such as California 's Surfrider Foundation or Australia 's Nature Conservation Council of NSW , which are concerned about protecting nearby ecosystems by safely disposing the concentrated brine left from the process as well as increased fossil - fuel use and the resulting greenhouse gas emissions .
In any case , a new market analysis by Lux Research forecasts that the global desalinated water supply will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5 percent during the next decade as Australia , Israel , Singapore , California and others build desalinization plants for seawater and inland brackish water as well as for water recycling .
This means that output will reach 54 billion cubic meters a year ( 54 trillion liters / year ) by 2020 , or triple what it had been in 2008 .

In an effort to help you take it up a notch , we ’d like to share some methods for helping your site anticipate a user ’s next move .
The post below is made up of 10 smart and intelligent ways of using < form > elements to produce some neat effects , components and plugins , they are all of the highest quality and more or less easy to configure .
Give them a try .
In this tutorial you will learn how to create a poll using PHP and XHTML , then make use of some jQuery Ajax effects to eliminate the need for a page refresh , and to give it a nice little bit of animation .
< div id =" poll - container " > < h3 > Poll </h3 > < form id='poll ' action= " poll.php " method= " post " accept- charset= " utf - 8 " > < p >
Pick your favorite Javascript framework : </ p> < p >< input type =" radio " name = " poll " value= " opt1 " id = " opt1 " />< label for=' opt1 '> j Query </ label >< br /> < input type =" radio " name = " poll " value= " opt2 " id = " opt2 " />< label for=' opt2 '>
Ext JS < / label >< br /> < input type =" radio " name = " poll " value = " opt6 " id = " opt6 " />< label for=' opt6 '> mootools </ label >< br />< br /> < input type =" submit " value= " Vote → " /></p> </ form > </div >
This form will be processed by the PHP for now , and when we get the Javascript running , by jQuery .
The PHP and Javascript are designed to pull the option ID from the value tag .

Ajax Fancy Captcha is a jQuery plugin that helps you protect your web pages from boys and spammers in a new , intuitive way of completing “ verify humanity ” tasks .
In order to do that users are asked to drag and drop specified item into a circle .
The code calls captcha.php file and gets a random number .
Php file just generates simple number and put it in session .
When AJAX got that number it creates items based on that number .
Lets imagine that we have array of “ pencil ” , “ scissors ” , “ clock ” , “ heart ” , “ note ” , so if number 3 is returned it will take “ heart ” and look for item - heart.png file in / imgs directory .

Britain : Propaganda campaign mounted to justify brutal G20 policing
By Julie Hyland
24 April 2009
A concerted effort is being made to limit criticism of police actions during protests surrounding the G20 summit in London , and even to justify them .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) has been forced to mount several investigations into police violence during the demonstrations on April 1 and 2 .
These include an inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of 47 - year - old newspaper vendor Ian Tomlinson , who was making his way home from work on April 1 when he became caught up in a police “ kettling ” operation involving the forcible detention of hundreds of protesters in side - streets .
Police initially denied any contact with Tomlinson and a first post - mortem claimed that he had died from a heart attack .
Video footage subsequently showed that the father of nine had been hit from behind by a masked police officer , causing him to fall and hit his head .
With eyewitness accounts indicating that this was only the last of three separate assaults on Tomlinson by police over a 90 - minute period , Peter Smyth from the Police Federation questioned the “ impartiality ” of IPCC head Nick Hardwick .
After days of stalling , Hardwick and the IPCC had finally been pressed into action by the deluge of evidence showing indiscriminate police violence during the protests .
At the weekend , Hardwick had registered the mildest of criticisms of policing during the G20 .
He said he had “ serious concerns ” about the supervision of officers at demonstrations , that it was “ unacceptable ” for officers to conceal their identification numbers and remarked that police needed to remember that they were “ servants , not masters ” of the people .
Decrying Hardwick ’s “ deplorable behaviour ” , Smyth said Hardwick had donned “ the mantle of witchfinder general ” and was guilty of passing “ lofty and withering judgment on London ’s police officers . ”
Earlier , London Mayor and Conservative Party member Boris Johnson had defended the G20 police operation .
Johnson , who chairs the Metropolitan Police Authority , said , “ The overwhelming majority of people in this city and this country understand the particularly difficult situation they [ the police ] face when being asked to provide security in a demonstration such as the G20 . ”
Johnson was speaking alongside Metropolitan Police chief Sir Paul Stephenson , who claimed that police behaviour had to be placed “ in context ” .
While there “ have been some concerning images which need to be fully and properly investigated ” , Stephenson said , “ there needs to be a context here .
“ That operation was one of the most complex policing operations that ’s ever been undertaken — protecting multiple heads of state , ” Stephenson stated , adding that it had also kept the public “ largely safe ” and prevented damage .
Speaking on BBC Radio 4 ’s Today programme , Sir Ken Jones , president of the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) , said there was a need to approach the issue of policing “ objectively and look at the issue from all perspectives . ”
“ I ca n’t find any other country that does n’t use water cannon , CS gas , rubber bullets .
Our approach is proportionate and , in fact , has delivered on many other occasions . ”
“ What I am saying is that the world is changing , ” Jones continued .
“ The way that some people come to these protests now , particularly in Europe , and offer violence to people , to property , to other legitimate protesters , and , yes , they came to attack the police , this has become an increasingly difficult job for us to pull off . ”
Home Office Minister Lord West concurred .
British police tactics were better than “ water cannon , baton rounds or shooting people — all of which seem to occur in some other countries , ” he said .
“ I am very proud of them [ the police ] and the way I approach it generally is they are on our side and they are our people . ”
Separately , Paul McKeever , chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation , complained of an anti-police “ bandwagon ” surrounding the G20 protests .
Officers had faced “ real provocation ” during the demonstrations , he claimed .
Contempt for democratic rights
Such statements are testimony to the contempt for democratic rights within the political establishment and state .
The comments by West and Jones over policing in “ other countries ” are disingenuous , especially given the police killing of innocent Brazilian Jean Charles de Menezes in July 2005 .
It was only after de Menezes was gunned down in full public view that it emerged the police had secretly adopted a shoot - to - kill policy under the guise of the “ war on terror ” some two years before .
Police are also equipped with tasers and CS gas .
Nor should it be forgotten that water cannon , CS gas and rubber bullets have all been deployed for decades in Northern Ireland .
More fundamentally , Jones ’s accusation that protests are invariably aimed at “ violence to people , to property ” and to the police points to the degree to which political dissent is now officially regarded as criminal behaviour .
Such is the degree of social polarisation , and the resulting political alienation , that any activity that questions the existing set - up is considered a threat , which should be responded to with force .
It was this , not Johnson ’s claim of concerns for public safety that guided police operations during the protests .
Forcible containment for hours at a time , beatings and the use of plain - clothes and masked , unidentifiable officers were intended to intimidate and punish those joining the demonstrations .
Nor is this confined to the G20 protests .
Only days later , police carried out the unprecedented pre-emptive arrests of 114 people in Nottingham on “ suspicion ” that they had been planning an environmental protest .
Yet McKeever suggests in his comments that concerns over the implication of these unprecedented developments for civil liberties are bogus , illegitimate and part , presumably , of a left - wing inspired anti-police bandwagon .
Nobody should be deceived into believing that the public outcry over the police assaults on peaceful protesters will produce any let - up in the undermining of democratic rights .
On the contrary , the statements by Johnson and senior police chiefs indicate that the representatives of the state apparatus intend to press ahead regardless .
They are encouraged in this by the perfidy of what passes for the official “ workers ” movement and Britain ’s nominally liberal elite .
Not a single leading member of the Labour Party or the trade unions has registered any public criticism of the police ’s actions .
It could not be otherwise , given that Labour has blazed the trail for the adoption of methods more akin to a police state as an integral part of its big business agenda .
The trade union bureaucracy may , on the odd occasion , shout about defending the “ rights of British workers ” .
But this is only when such protestations serve the reactionary purpose of dividing the working class — as in the recent “ Britons first ” campaign .
When it concerns protecting these rights against the state , however , there is silence .
A recent comment by Shami Chakrabarti , director of Liberty ( formerly the National Council for Civil Liberties ) in the Times newspaper , was noteworthy only for the extent to which she accepted the restricting of fundamental rights .
“ The right to protest is precious but not unlimited , ” she asserted , claiming that “ [ F ]ew would argue against proportionate interferences with that right to protect people and property . ”
“ The use of force — when it is proportionate and necessary to make arrests and prevent harm to the police and public — can be reasonable , ” she continued .
“ But it is neither lawful nor productive to use violence against an individual protester , however annoying they are , because other people are misbehaving or an officer has lost his rag .
As for the tactic of uniformed officers obscuring their identity numbers , the commissioner has clarified that this is unacceptable , ” she went on lamely .
“ The G20 demonstrations may prove a momentous moment in Britain ’s surveillance culture ” , she continued tritely , from which “ we might all learn ” .
Video footage showing the police in action meant that they “ will understand how it feels to be watched and the dangers of rushing from snatched images to judgment .
We complainers are reminded that well - targeted surveillance has its place and that the right to privacy , like protest , is not unlimited . ”
DALLAS --
This city is considering joining a rising number of others across the country that are imposing criminal penalties on kids who skip school to hang out at the mall or on local street corners .
Such juvenile daytime curfews to combat truancy and crime are drawing protests from groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union and from the parents of homeschooled children who , along with some parents of public - school students , object on grounds that such laws in effect criminalize otherwise law - abiding kids who may have good reasons for not being in school .
Daytime - curfew laws have long been popular in a handful of states , including California and Ohio , and opponents say that they are becoming increasingly common .
Benicia , Calif. , near San Francisco , began enforcing a curfew in January , and Kennesaw , Ga. , north of Atlanta , enacted one earlier this month .
Bedford , Texas , near Fort Worth , adopted a curfew last year , and the city council in Philadelphia is set to vote on one Thursday .
In Dallas , the city council will vote next month on extending an existing nighttime curfew for minors to make it broadly illegal for minors under 17 years old to appear in public without adult supervision during school hours .
Violators would be subject to a fine up to $ 500 .
Parents and businesses that let minors congregate on their premises during school hours also would be subject to a fine up to $ 500 .
Elba Garcia , a dentist who serves as chairman of the council 's public - safety committee , said the ban will help the police combat crimes that are " associated with truancy , " especially daylight burglaries and car break - ins .

" One visitor said it would be a good idea to keep that up for a week and then replace him with a proper physical police officer with a gun for another week and see what happens .
The University of Rochester has created the first true stacked 3D processor running at 1.4 GHz .
As processors continue to head in the direction of miniaturization , with an ever increasing number of cores , some design engineers believe miniaturization will eventually hit a limit and the only direction left to go will be upwards .
One such engineer is Eby Friedman of the University of Rochester , co-creator of a new 3D chip technology , and he believes his new processor is unique to previous 3D chip designs .
Unlike past 3D chips that were simply stacks of regular processors , this new chip , or " cube " as Friedman calls it , has its layers flush against one another , with millions of tiny holes drilled through the layers to connect them , giving the 3D chip abilities unachievable by single layer processors .
The new 3 - D processor was designed specifically for optimized vertical processing between layers , much like how traditional processors have been designed for horizontal processing .
Currently the design of the processor Friedman and his students have created clocks in at 1.4 GHz and it is the first 3D chip to ever feature such tasks as synchronicity , power distribution and long - distance signaling .
With limits of miniaturization facing the integrated circuit industry , stacking of transistors is believed by some designers to be an eventual direction for processor designs , but such a direction will introduce many new challenges of its own .
Friedman says that one difficulty will be having all the layers interact together as a single system , where accomplishing such harmony in a 3D chip would be much like stacking the traffic systems of the United States , China and India on top of one another .
Each traffic system will have its own different set of traffic laws and having to allow drivers at any point move between layers while still simultaneously managing all the other traffic .
A while back we saw IBM looking ahead to 3D chip stacks as well , but the company quickly realized that it would have to overcome a major obstacle -– heat .
Conventional cooling methods do not scale well with 3D chip stacks and IBM ’s solution to this future problem was designing the chip stacks to allow water to flow between the layers , providing for a scalable cooling solution .
Interconnects between the layers would be insulated , protecting them from the water and allowing for the layers to still communicate at high - speeds .
Whether or not the new 3D processors that the University of Rochester have designed would be able to integrate similar technologies , has yet to be seen .
One of the biggest issues that I have with Christianity is the anti-intellectualism that it perpetuates .
It is n’t hard to miss .
For starters , the majority of Christians in America are ignorant and proud .
The fact that the most idiotic President in our nation ’s history was elected mainly because of the support of the Christian Right , speaks volumes .
A quick look back at history also shows that the Church and various organized religions have done everything they could to restrict science and knowledge .
At every stage of scientific achievement , Christians were always their persecuting those who wish to expand human knowledge and human progress .
One of the Humanities biggest loses came pretty early on too .
In 415 CE a Christian mob brutally murdered Hypatia of Alexandria ( I would go into more details about the brutality of that murder , but it is a bit graphic ) who was one the bright lights of Science in her time .
Even today , almost half of Christianity stands against the science of evolution and medical stem cell research .
The fact is that the more religious someone is , the less value they tend to place on science and education .
According to the National Academy of Sciences , 93 % of scientists express disbelief or doubt in the existence of a personal deity .
72 % outright disbelieve in a personified deity .
These are among the brightest minds on Earth .
Both Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking ( widely considered the two smartest men who every lived ) had issue with the personified deity of Christianity .
These men joined the company of many of the most intellectual founding fathers such as Ben Franklin , Thomas Paine , Thomas Jefferson , and other .
The concept of “ faith ” is a slap in the face to science and intellectual curiosity .
Faith stops questions while science encourages questions .
Faith provides dishonest , unsupportable , and unquestioned certainty while science leaves every conclusion open to change with additional evidence and discoveries .
With faith , no education is necessary because education is often a determent to faith .
This is one of the biggest reasons why Christian fundamentalists are so keen on censorship and control .
Even in the Bible , the character of Jesus elevates blind faith above intellectual rigor , reason , and evidence .
“ Jesus saith unto him , Thomas , because thou hast seen me , thou hast believed : blessed [ are ] they that have not seen , and [ yet ] have believed . ” – John 20 : 29
This is not the only instance in which the Bible attacks the intellect .
Corinthians is full of such examples .
“ God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise ” – 1 Corinthians 1:27 and 5 “ That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men , but in the power of God . ” – 1 Corinthians 2:5 , etc .
Science , reason , and intellectualism support the concepts of continued questioning , education , and human curiosity .
Through the scientific method , the rules of logic , and the thirst to understand , people of reason are continually pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and helping to make life better and longer for us all .
Yet , example after example , the Bible and Christianity stand against the intellect and continue to propagate ignorance , fear , and unreason .
Between the Creation Museum and the absolute unquestioning certainty of a divine deity , Christianity remains one of the biggest oppositions to human progress and the greatest threat to intellectualism .

The complicated tango between the iPhone and AT&T 's network is n't a new story , but the latest stats — web browsing eats 69 percent of phone bandwidth — highlight the fragility of networks , allowing fresh portents of doom .
Advertisement
The WSJ 's math runs like this : AT&T charges iPhone 3G customers the same $ 30 a month it charges every other smartphone user , but they use two to four times the data , because data is essentially unlimited .
Which leads to further costs , like having to constantly expand the network 's capacity to keep up with demand , which is n't cheap — $ 6 billion on overall capacity annually .
That 's problematic because the amount of money carriers are supposedly making off of every customer — average revenue per user — wo n't increase dramatically with new data revenue , not like it used to by simply piling on new customers .
( And at this point , the new customers are not high revenue ones , mostly . )
Advertisement
So the WSJ says " in the short term , carriers should abandon unlimited data pricing plans .
Both AT&T and Verizon Wireless already charge extra for heavy users with wirelessly connected laptops .
They will have to contemplate similar strategies for smartphone users . "
Right .
On the other hand , clearly the iPhone is n't all bad — AT&T 's fighting to keep it exclusive longer , and it was responsible for about half of its new customers last quarter .

Still , I 'm not really looking forward to making a phone call on AT&T in June or July , whenever the next iPhone is released .

Deutsche Bank on Thursday raised its view on soft drink companies , seeing a more positive outlook for the group in 2009 .
" For the past two years our primary concern for domestic soft drinks has been higher pricing in the name of margin protection , without regard for declining volume or consumer relevancy .
Although the going is still early , our conversations with category managers indicate increasing promotional investment in the category .
We are taking a more constructive view , as this strategic shift should help stabilize volume heading into peak summer season , with commodity deflation insulating margins , " the firm wrote .

During the FIU New World Order Summit , a professor at the school named Dr. Mark B. Rosenberg raised the concern during a panel session about the possibility of a military coup taking place in the United States by the year 2012 .
This was not theorizing , he was simply citing a study that took place at the Army War College .
He explained that this rebellion would be a response to the military being overextended and being put to a use by the administration in a manner that is contrary to their official purpose .
The invited speaker of the panel , Parag Khanna , treated the concern as if it was nonsense and dismissed it by asking the audience " Have any of you heard of this ?
No ?
Okay then . "
It is interesting to note that both Dr. Rosenberg and Parag Khanna are members of the Council on Foreign Relations , a think tank dedicated to the purpose of establishing a one world government .
Could Dr. Rosenberg ’s statement exposing the white paper on the coup plot have been an example of dissent within the ranks of the CFR ?
After the summit , Joshua from Orlando 9/11
Truth called into the Alex Jones show to relay the information ( 1:08:29 seconds into the 2/25/09 episode ) .
An attentive listener managed to track down the actual document that Dr. Rosenberg was referring to , and you can read it below .

The letter that follows takes us on a darkly imagined excursion into the future .
A military coup has taken place in the United States –the year is 2012 – and General Thomas E. T. Brutus , Commander - in - Chief of the Unified Armed Forces of the United States , now occupies the White House as permanent Military Plenipotentiary .
His position has been ratified by a national referendum , though scattered disorders still prevail and arrests for acts of sedition are underway .
A senior retired officer of the Unified Armed Forces , known here simply as Prisoner 222305759 , is one of those arrested , having been convicted by court - martial for opposing the coup .
Prior to his execution , he is able to smuggle out of prison a letter to an old War College classmate discussing the " Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012 . "
In it , he argues that the coup was the outgrowth of trends visible as far back as 1992 .
These trends were the massive diversion of military forces to civilian uses , the monolithic unification of the armed forces , and the insularity of the military community .
His letter survives and is here presented verbatim .
It goes without saying ( I hope ) that the coup scenario above is purely a literary device intended to dramatize my concern over certain contemporary developments affecting the armed forces , and is emphatically not a prediction .

Dear Old Friend ,
It ’s hard to believe that 20 years have passed since we graduated from the War College !
Remember the great discussions , the trips , the parties , the people ?
Those were the days !!!
I ’m not having quite as much fun anymore .
You ’ve heard about the Sedition Trials ?
Yeah , I was one of those arrested –convicted of " disloyal statements , " and " using contemptuous language towards officials . "
Disloyal ?
No. Contemptuous ?
You bet !
With General Brutus in charge it ’s not hard to be contemptuous .
I ’ve got to hand it to Brutus , he ’s ingenious .
After the President died he somehow " persuaded " the Vice President not to take the oath of office .
Did we then have a President or not ?
A real " Constitutional Conundrum " the papers called it .
[ 1 ]
Brutus created just enough ambiguity to convince everyone that as the senior military officer , he could–and should –declare himself Commander - in - Chief of the Unified Armed Forces .
Remember what he said ?
" Had to fill the power vacuum . "
And Brutus showed he really knew how to use power : he declared martial law , " postponed " the elections , got the Vice President to " retire , " and even moved into the White House !
" More efficient to work from there , " he said .
Remember that ?
When Congress convened that last time and managed to pass the Referendum Act , I really got my hopes up .
But when the Referendum approved Brutus ’s takeover , I knew we were in serious trouble .
I caused a ruckus , you know , trying to organize a protest .
Then the Security Forces picked me up .
My quickie " trial " was a joke .
The sentence ?
Well , let ’s just say you wo n’t have to save any beer for me at next year ’s reunion .
Since it does n’t look like I ’ll be seeing you again , I thought I ’d write everything down and try to get it to you .
I am calling my paper the " Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012 . "
I think it ’s important to get the truth recorded before they rewrite history .
If we ’re ever going to get our freedom back , we ’ve got to understand how we got into this mess .
People need to understand that the armed forces exist to support and defend government , not to be the government .
Faced with intractable national problems on one hand , and an energetic and capable military on the other , it can be all too seductive to start viewing the military as a cost - effective solution .
We made a terrible mistake when we allowed the armed forces to be diverted from their original purpose .
I found a box of my notes and clippings from our War College days–told my keepers I needed them to write the confession they want .
It ’s amazing ; looking through these old papers makes me realize that even back in 1992 we should have seen this coming .
The seeds of this outrage were all there ; we just did n’t realize how they would grow .
But is n’t that always the way with things like this ?
Somebody once said that " the true watersheds in human affairs are seldom spotted amid the tumult of headlines broadcast on the hour . " [ 2 ]
And we had a lot of headlines back in the ’90s to distract us :
The economy was in the dumps , crime was rising , schools were deteriorating , drug use was rampant , the environment was in trouble , and political scandals were occurring almost daily .
Still , there was some good news : the end of the Cold War as well as America ’s recent victory over Iraq .
All of this and more contributed to the situation in which we find ourselves today : a military that controls government and one that , ironically , ca n’t fight .
It was n’t any single cause that led us to this point .
Instead , it was a combination of several different developments , the beginnings of which were evident in 1992 .
Here ’s what I think happened :
Americans became exasperated with democracy .
We were disillusioned with the apparent inability of elected government to solve the nation ’s dilemmas .
We were looking for someone or something that could produce workable answers .
The one institution of government in which the people retained faith was the military .
Buoyed by the military ’s obvious competence in the First Gulf War , the public increasingly turned to it for solutions to the country ’s problems .
Americans called for an acceleration of trends begun in the 1980s : tasking the military with a variety of new , nontraditional missions , and vastly escalating its commitment to formerly ancillary duties .
Though not obvious at the time , the cumulative effect of these new responsibilities was to incorporate the military into the political process to an unprecedented degree .
These additional assignments also had the perverse effect of diverting focus and resources from the military ’s central mission of combat training and warfighting .
Finally , organizational , political , and societal changes served to alter the American military ’s culture .
Today ’s military is not the one we knew when we graduated from the War College .
Let me explain how I came to these conclusions .
In 1992 not very many people would ’ve thought a military coup d’etat could ever happen here .
Sure , there were eccentric conspiracy theorists who saw the Pentagon ’s hand in the assassination of President Kennedy , [ 3 ]
President Nixon ’s downfall , [ 4 ] and similar events .
But even the most avid believers had to admit that no outright military takeover had ever occurred before now .
Heeding Washington ’s admonitions in his Farewell address about the dangers of overgrown military establishments , [ 5 ]
Americans generally viewed their armed forces with a judicious mixture of respect and wariness . [ 6 ]
For over two centuries that vigilance was rewarded , and most Americans came to consider the very notion of a military coup preposterous .
Historian Andrew Janos captured the conventional view of the latter half of the 20th century in this clipping I saved :
A coup d’etat in the United States would be too fantastic to contemplate , not only because few would actually entertain the idea , but also because the bulk of the people are strongly attached to the prevailing political system and would rise in defense of a political leader even though they might not like him .
The environment most hospitable to coups d’etat is one in which political apathy prevails as the dominant style . [ 7 ]
However , when Janos wrote that back in 1964 , 61.9 percent of the electorate voted .
Since then voter participation has steadily declined .
By 1988 only 50.1 percent of the eligible voters cast a ballot .
[ 8 ]
Simple extrapolation of those numbers to last spring ’s Referendum would have predicted almost exactly the turnout .
It was precisely reversed from that of 1964 : 61.9 percent of the electorate did not vote .
America ’s societal malaise was readily apparent in 1992 .
Seventy - eight percent of Americans believed the country was on the " wrong track . "
One researcher declared that social indicators were at their lowest level in 20 years and insisted " something [ was ] coming loose in the social infrastructure . "
The nation was frustrated and angry about its problems . [ 9 ]
America wanted solutions and democratically elected government was n’t providing them . [ 10 ]
The country suffered from a " deep pessimism about politicians and government after years of broken promises . " [ 11 ]
David Finkle observed in The Washington Post Magazine that for most Americans " the perception of government is that it has evolved from something that provides democracy ’s framework into something that provides obstacles , from something to celebrate into something to ignore . "
Likewise , politicians and their proposals seemed stale and repetitive .
Millions of voters gave up hope of finding answers . [ 12 ]
The " environment of apathy " Janos characterized as a precursor to a coup had arrived .
Unlike the rest of government the military enjoyed a remarkably steady climb in popularity throughout the 1980s and early 1990s . [ 13 ]
And indeed it had earned the admiration of the public .
Debilitated by the Vietnam War , the US military set about reinventing itself .
As early as 1988 U.S. News & World Report heralded the result : " In contrast to the dispirited , drug - ravaged , do - your - own - thing armed services of the ’70s and early ’ 80s , the US military has been transformed into a fighting force of gung - ho attitude , spit - shined discipline , and ten - hut morale . " [ 14 ]
After the US military dealt Iraq a crushing defeat in the First Gulf War , the ignominy of Vietnam evaporated .
When we graduated from the War College in 1992 , the armed forces were the smartest , best educated , and best disciplined force in history . [ 15 ]
While polls showed that the public invariably gave Congress low marks , a February 1991 survey disclosed that " public confidence in the military soar[ed ] to 85 percent , far surpassing every other institution in our society . "
The armed forces had become America ’s most–and perhaps only –trusted arm of government . [ 16 ]
Assumptions about the role of the military in society also began to change .
Twenty years before we graduated , the Supreme Court confidently declared in Laird v. Tatum that Americans had a " traditional and strong resistance to any military intrusion into civilian affairs . " [ 17 ]
But Americans were now rethinking the desirability and necessity of that resistance .
They compared the military ’s principled competence with the chicanery and ineptitude of many elected officials , and found the latter wanting . [ 18 ]
Commentator James Fallows expressed the new thinking in an August 1991 article in Atlantic magazine .
Musing on the contributions of the military to American society , Fallows wrote : " I am beginning to think that the only way the national government can do anything worthwhile is to invent a security threat and turn the job over to the military . "
He elaborated on his reasoning :
According to our economic and political theories , most agencies of the government have no special standing to speak about the general national welfare .
Each represents a certain constituency ; the interest groups fight it out .
The military , strangely , is the one government institution that has been assigned legitimacy to act on its notion of the collective good .
" National defense " can make us do things–train engineers , build highways –that long - term good of the nation or common sense cannot . [ 19 ]
About a decade before Fallows ’ article appeared , Congress initiated the use of " national defense " as a rationale to boost military participation in an activity historically the exclusive domain of civilian government : law enforcement .
Congress concluded that the " rising tide of drugs being smuggled into the United States . . . present[ed ] a grave threat to all Americans . "
Finding the performance of civilian law enforcement agencies in counteracting that threat unsatisfactory , Congress passed the Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act of 1981 . [ 20 ]
In doing so Congress specifically intended to force reluctant military commanders to actively collaborate in police work . [ 21 ]
This was a historic change of policy .
Since the passage of the Posse Comitatus Act in 1878 , the military had distanced itself from law enforcement activities . [ 22 ]
While the 1981 law did retain certain limits on the legal authority of military personnel , its net effect was to dramatically expand military participation in anti-drug efforts . [ 23 ]
By 1991 the Department of Defense was spending $ 1.2 billion on counternarcotics crusades .
Air Force surveillance aircraft were sent to track airborne smugglers ;
Navy ships patrolled the Caribbean looking for drug - laden vessels ; and National Guardsmen were searching for marijuana caches near the borders . [ 24 ]
By 1992 " combatting " drug trafficking was formally declared a " high national security mission . " [ 25 ]
It was n’t too long before 21st - century legislators were calling for more military involvement in police work . [ 26 ]
Crime seemed out of control .
Most disturbing , the incidence of violent crime continued to climb . [ 27 ]
Americans were horrified and desperate : a third even believed vigilantism could be justified . [ 28 ]
Rising lawlessness was seen as but another example of the civilian political leadership ’s inability to fulfill government ’s most basic duty to ensure public safety . [ 29 ]
People once again wanted the military to help .
Hints of an expanded police function were starting to surface while we were still at the War College .
For example , District of Columbia National Guardsmen established a regular military presence in high - crime areas . [ 30 ]
Eventually , people became acclimated to seeing uniformed military personnel patrolling their neighborhood . [ 31 ]
Now troops are an adjunct to almost all police forces in the country .
In many of the areas where much of our burgeoning population of elderly Americans live –Brutus calls them " National Security Zones " – the military is often the only law enforcement agency .
Consequently , the military was ideally positioned in thousands of communities to support the coup .
Concern about crime was a major reason why General Brutus ’s actions were approved in the Referendum .
Although voter participation by the general public was low , older Americans voted at a much higher rate . [ 32 ]
Furthermore , with the aging of the baby boom generation , the block of American voters over 45 grew to almost 53 percent of the voters by 2010 . [ 33 ]
This wealthy , [ 34 ] older electorate welcomed an organization which could ensure their physical security . [ 35 ]
When it counted , they backed Brutus in the Referendum–probably the last votes they ’ll ever cast .
The military ’s constituency was larger than just the aged .
Poor Americans of all ages became dependent upon the military not only for protection against crime , but also for medical care .
Again we saw the roots of this back in 1992 .
First it was the barely defeated proposal to use veterans ’ hospitals to provide care for the non-veteran poor . [ 36 ]
Next were calls to deploy military medical assets to relieve hard - pressed urban hospitals . [ 37 ]
As the number of uninsured and underinsured grew , the pressure to provide care became inexorable .
Now military hospitals serve millions of new , non-military patients .
Similarly , a proposal to use so - called " underutilized " military bases as drug rehabilitation centers was implemented on a massive scale . [ 38 ]
Even the youngest citizens were co-opted .
During the 1990s the public became aware that military officers had the math and science backgrounds desperately needed to revitalize US education . [ 39 ]
In fact , programs involving military personnel were already underway while we were at the War College . [ 40 ]
We now have an entire generation of young people who have grown up comfortable with the sight of military personnel patrolling their streets and teaching in their classrooms .
As you know , it was n’t just crises in public safety , medical care , and education that the military was tasked to mend .
The military was also called upon to manage the cleanup of the nation ’s environmental hazards .
By 1992 the armed services were deeply involved in this arena , and that involvement mushroomed .
Once the military demonstrated its expertise , it was n’t long before environmental problems were declared " national security threats " and full responsibility devolved to the armed forces . [ 41 ]
Other problems were transformed into " national security " issues .
As more commercial airlines went bankrupt and unprofitable air routes dropped , the military was called upon to provide " essential " air transport to the affected regions .
In the name of national defense , the military next found itself in the sealift business .
Ships purchased by the military for contingencies were leased , complete with military crews , at low rates to US exporters to help solve the trade deficit . [ 42 ]
The nation ’s crumbling infrastructure was also declared a " national security threat . "
As was proposed back in 1991 , troops rehabilitated public housing , rebuilt bridges and roads , and constructed new government buildings .
By late 1992 , voices in both Congress and the military had reached a crescendo calling for military involvement across a broad spectrum of heretofore purely civilian activities . [ 43 ]
Soon , it became common in practically every community to see crews of soldiers working on local projects . [ 44 ]
Military attire drew no stares .
The revised charter for the armed forces was not confined to domestic enterprises .
Overseas humanitarian and nation - building assignments proliferated . [ 45 ]
Though these projects have always been performed by the military on an ad hoc basis , in 1986 Congress formalized that process .
It declared overseas humanitarian and civic assistance activities to be " valid military missions " and specifically authorized them by law . [ 46 ]
Fueled by favorable press for operations in Iraq , Bangladesh , and the Philippines during the early 1990s , humanitarian missions were touted as the military ’s " model for the future . " [ 47 ]
That prediction came true .
When several African governments collapsed under AIDS epidemics and famines around the turn of the century , US troops–first introduced to the continent in the 1990s –were called upon to restore basic services .
They never left . [ 48 ]
Now the US military constitutes the de facto government in many of those areas .
Once again , the first whisperings of such duties could be heard in 1992 . [ 49 ]
By the year 2000 the armed forces had penetrated many vital aspects of American society .
More and more military officers sought the kind of autonomy in these civilian affairs that they would expect from their military superiors in the execution of traditional combat operations .
Thus began the inevitable politicization of the military .
With so much responsibility for virtually everything government was expected to do , the military increasingly demanded a larger role in policymaking .
But in a democracy policymaking is a task best left to those accountable to the electorate .
Nonetheless , well - intentioned military officers , accustomed to the ordered , hierarchical structure of military society , became impatient with the delays and inefficiencies inherent in the democratic process .
Consequently , they increasingly sought to avoid it .
They convinced themselves that they could more productively serve the nation in carrying out their new assignments if they accrued to themselves unfettered power to implement their programs .
They forgot Lord Acton ’s warning that " all power corrupts , and absolute power corrupts absolutely . " [ 50 ]
Congress became their unwitting ally .
Because of the popularity of the new military programs–and the growing dependence upon them –Congress passed the Military Plenipotentiary Act of 2005 .
This legislation was the legacy of the Goldwater - Nichols Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 .
Among many revisions , Goldwater - Nichols strengthened the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and mandated numerous changes intended to increase " jointness " in the armed services .
[ 51 ]
Supporters of the Military Plenipotentiary Act argued that unity of command was critical to the successful management of the numerous activities now considered " military " operations .
Moreover , many Congressmen mistakenly believed that Goldwater - Nichols was one of the main reasons for the military ’s success in the First Gulf War . [ 52 ]
They viewed the Military Plenipotentiary Act as an enhancement of the strengths of Goldwater - Nichols .
In passing this legislation Congress added greater authority to the military ’s top leadership position .
Lulled by favorable experiences with Chairmen like General Colin Powell , [ 53 ]
Congress saw little danger in converting the office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff into the even more powerful Military Plenipotentiary .
No longer merely an advisor , the Military Plenipotentiary became a true commander of all US services , purportedly because that status could better ameliorate the effects of perceived interservice squabbling .
Despite warnings found in the legislative history of Goldwater - Nichols and elsewhere , enormous power was concentrated in the hands of a single , unelected official . [ 54 ]
Unfortunately , Congress presumed that principled people would always occupy the office . [ 55 ]
No one expected a General Brutus would arise .
The Military Plenipotentiary was not Congress ’s only structural change in military governance .
By 2007 the services were combined to form the Unified Armed Forces .
Recall that when we graduated from the War College greater unification was being seriously suggested as an economy measure . [ 56 ]
Eventually that consideration , and the conviction that " jointness " was an unqualified military virtue , [ 57 ] led to unification .
But unification ended the creative tension between the services . [ 58 ]
Besides rejecting the operational logic of separate services , [ 59 ] no one seemed to recognize the checks - and - balances function that service separatism provided a democracy obliged to maintain a large , professional military establishment .
The Founding Fathers knew the importance of checks and balances in controlling the agencies of government : " Ambition must be made to counteract ambition .
. . .
Experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary controls . . . [ including ] supplying opposite and rival interests . " [ 60 ]
Ambition is a natural trait of military organizations and their leaders . [ 61 ]
Whatever might have been the inefficiencies of separate military services , their very existence served to counteract the untoward desires of any single service .
The roles and missions debates and other arguments , once seen as petty military infighting , also provided an invaluable forum for competitive analysis of military doctrine .
Additionally , they served to ensure that unscrupulous designs by a segment of the military establishment were ruthlessly exposed .
Once the services were unified , the impetus to do so vanished , and the authority of the military in relation to the other institutions of government rose . [ 62 ]
Distended by its pervasive new duties , monolithic militarism came to dominate the Darwinian political environment of 21st - century America .
Why did the uniformed leadership of our day acquiesce to this transformation of the military ?
Much of the answer can be traced to the budget showdowns of the early 1990s .
The collapse of the Soviet Union left the US military without an easily articulated rationale for large defense budgets .
Billions in cuts were sought .
Journalist Bruce Auster put it bluntly : " Winning a share of the budget wars . . . require[s ] that the military find new missions for a post - Cold War world that is devoid of clear military threats . " [ 63 ]
Capitulating , military leaders embraced formerly disdained assignments .
As one commentator cynically observed , " the services are eager to talk up nontraditional , budget - justifying roles . " [ 64 ]
The Vietnam - era aphorism , " It ’s a lousy war , but it ’s the only one we ’ve got , " was resuscitated .
Still , that does n’t completely explain why in 2012 the military leadership would succumb to a coup .
To answer that question fully requires examination of what was happening to the officer corps as the military drew down in the 1980s and 1990s .
Ever since large peacetime military establishments became permanent features after World War II , the great leveler of the officer corps was the constant influx of officers from the Reserve Officers Training Corps program .
The product of diverse colleges and universities throughout the United States , these officers were a vital source of liberalism in the military services . [ 65 ]
By the late 1980s and early 1990s , however , that was changing .
Force reductions decreased the number of ROTC graduates the services accepted . [ 66 ]
Although General Powell called ROTC " vital to democracy , " 62 ROTC programs were closed in 1991 and another 350 were considered for closure . [ 67 ]
The numbers of officers produced by the service academies also fell , but at a significantly slower pace .
Consequently , the proportion of academy graduates in the officer corps climbed . [ 68 ]
Academy graduates , along with graduates of such military schools as the Citadel , Virginia Military Institute , and Norwich University , tended to feel a greater homogeneity of outlook than , say , the pool of ROTC graduates at large , with the result that as the proportion of such graduates grew , diversity of outlook overall diminished to some degree .
Moreover , the ROTC officers that did remain increasingly came from a narrower range of schools .
Focusing on the military ’s policy to exclude homosexuals from service , advocates of " political correctness " succeeded in driving ROTC from the campuses of some of our best universities . [ 69 ]
In many instances they also prevailed in barring military recruiters from campus . [ 70 ]
Little thought was given the long - term consequences of limiting the pool from which our military leadership was drawn .
The result was a much more uniformly oriented military elite whose outlook was progressively conservative .
Furthermore , well - meaning attempts at improving service life led to the unintended insularity of military society , representing a return to the cloistered life of the pre-World War II armed forces .
Military bases , complete with schools , churches , stores , child care centers , and recreational areas , became never - to - be - left islands of tranquillity removed from the chaotic , crime - ridden environment outside the gates . [ 71 ]
As one reporter put it in 1991 : " Increasingly isolated from mainstream America , today ’s troops tend to view the civilian world with suspicion and sometimes hostility . " [ 72 ]
Thus , a physically isolated and intellectually alienated officer corps was paired with an enlisted force likewise distanced from the society it was supposed to serve .
In short , the military evolved into a force susceptible to manipulation by an authoritarian leader from its own select ranks .
What made this all the more disheartening was the wretched performance of our forces in the Second Gulf War . [ 73 ]
Consumed with ancillary and nontraditional missions , the military neglected its fundamental raison d’etre .
As the Supreme Court succinctly put it more than a half century ago , the " primary business of armies and navies [ is ] to fight or be ready to fight wars should the occasion arise . " [ 74 ]
When Iranian armies started pouring into the lower Gulf states in 2010 , the US armed forces were ready to do anything but fight .
Preoccupation with humanitarian duties , narcotics interdiction , and all the rest of the peripheral missions left the military unfit to engage an authentic military opponent .
Performing the new missions sapped resources from what most experts agree was one of the vital ingredients to victory in the First Gulf War : training .
Training is , quite literally , a zero - sum game .
Each moment spent performing a nontraditional mission is one unavailable for orthodox military exercises .
We should have recognized the grave risk .
In 1991 The Washington Post reported that in " interview after interview across the services , senior leaders and noncommissioned officers stressed that they cannot be ready to fight without frequent rehearsals of perishable skills . " [ 75 ]
The military ’s anti-drug activities were a big part of the problem .
Oh sure , I remember the facile claims of exponents of the military ’s counternarcotics involvement as to what " valuable " training it provided . [ 76 ]
Did anyone really think that crew members of an AWACS–an aircraft designed to track high - performance military aircraft in combat–significantly improved their skills by hours of tracking slow - moving light planes ?
Did they seriously imagine that troops enhanced combat skills by looking for marijuana under car seats ?
Did they truly believe that crews of the Navy ’s sophisticated antiair and anti-submarine ships received meaningful training by following lumbering trawlers around the Caribbean ? [ 77 ]
Tragically , they did .
The problem was exacerbated when political pressures exempted the Guard and the Reserves from the harshest effects of the budgetary cutbacks of the early 1990s . [ 78 ]
The First Gulf
War demonstrated that modern weapons and tactics were simply too complex for part - time soldiers to master during their allotted drill periods , however well motivated . [ 79 ]
Still , creative Guard and Reserve defenders contrived numerous civic- action and humanitarian assignments and sold them as " training . "
Left unexplained was how such training was supposed to fit with military strategies that contemplated short , violent , come - as - you - are expeditionary wars . [ 80 ]
Nice - to - have Guard and Reserve support - oriented programs prevailed at the expense of critical active - duty combat capabilities . [ 81 ]
Perhaps even more damaging than the diversion of resources was the assault on the very ethos of military service .
Rather than bearing in mind the Supreme Court ’s admonition to focus on warfighting , the military was told to alter its purpose .
Former Secretary of State James Baker typified the trendy new tone in remarks about the military ’s airlift of food and medicine to the former Soviet republics in early 1992 .
He said the airlift would " vividly show the peoples of the former Soviet Union that those that once prepared for war with them now have the courage and the conviction to use their militaries to say , ` We will wage a new peace . ’ " [ 82 ]
In truth militaries ought to " prepare for war " and leave the " peace waging " to those agencies of government whose mission is just that .
Nevertheless , such pronouncements –seconded by military leaders [ 83 ] –became the fashionable philosophy .
The result ?
People in the military no longer considered themselves warriors .
Instead , they perceived themselves as policemen , relief workers , educators , builders , health care providers , politicians –everything but warfighters .
When these philanthropists met the Iranian 10th Armored Corps near Daharan during the Second Gulf War , they were brutally slaughtered by a military which had not forgotten what militaries were supposed to do or what war is really all about .
The devastation of the military ’s martial spirit was exemplified by its involvement in police activities .
Inexplicably , we ignored the deleterious effect on combat motivation suffered by the Israeli Defense Forces as a result of their efforts to police the West Bank and Gaza . [ 84 ]
Few seemed to appreciate the fundamental difference between the police profession and the profession of arms .
As Richard J. Barnet observed in The New Yorker , " The line between police action and a military operation is real .
Police derive their power from their acceptance as `officers of the law ’ ; legitimate authority , not firepower , is the essential element . " [ 85 ]
Police organizations are understandably oriented toward the studied restraint necessary for the end sought : a judicial conviction .
As one Drug Enforcement Administration agent noted : " The military can kill people better than we can [ but ] when we go to a jungle lab , we ’re not there to move onto the target by fire and maneuver to destroy the enemy .
We ’re there to arrest suspects and seize evidence . " [ 86 ]
If military forces are inculcated with the same spirit of restraint , combat performance is threatened . [ 87 ]
Moreover , law enforcement is also not just a form of low - intensity conflict .
In low - intensity conflict , the military aim is to win the will of the people , a virtually impossible task with criminals " motivated by money , not ideology . " [ 88 ]
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Humanitarian missions likewise undermined the military ’s sense of itself .
As one Navy officer gushed during the 1991 Bangladesh relief operation , " It ’s great to be here doing the opposite of a soldier . " [ 89 ]
While no true soldier relishes war , the fact remains that the essence of the military is warfighting and preparation for the same .
What journalist Barton Gellman has said of the Army can be extrapolated to the military as a whole : it is an " organization whose fighting spirit depends . . . heavily on tradition . " [ 90 ]
If that tradition becomes imbued with a preference for " doing the opposite of a soldier , " fighting spirit is bound to suffer .
When we first heard editorial calls to " pacify the military " by involving it in civic projects , [ 91 ] we should have given them the forceful rebuke they deserved .
Military analyst Harry Summers warned back in ’91 that when militaries lose sight of their purpose , catastrophe results .
Citing a study of pre-World War II Canadian military policy as it related to the subsequent battlefield disasters , he observed that
instead of using the peacetime interregnum to hone their military skills , senior Canadian military officers sought out civilian missions to justify their existence .
When war came they were woefully unprepared .
Instead of protecting their soldiers ’ lives they led them to their deaths .
In today ’s post - Cold War peacetime environment , this trap again looms large .
. . .
Some today within the US military are also searching for relevance , with draft doctrinal manuals giving touchy - feely prewar and postwar civil operations equal weight with warfighting .
This is an insidious mistake . [ 92 ]
We must remember that America ’s position at the end of the Cold War had no historical precedent .
For the first time the nation –in peacetime –found itself with a still - sizable , professional military establishment that was not preoccupied with an overarching external threat . [ 93 ]
Yet the uncertainties in the aftermath of the Cold War limited the extent to which those forces could be safely downsized .
When the military was then obliged to engage in a bewildering array of nontraditional duties to further justify its existence , it is little wonder that its traditional apolitical professionalism eventually eroded .
Clearly , the curious tapestry of military authoritarianism and combat ineffectiveness that we see today was not yet woven in 1992 .
But the threads were there .
Knowing what I know now , here ’s the advice I would have given the War College Class of 1992 had I been their graduation speaker :
• Demand that the armed forces focus exclusively on indisputably military duties .
We must not diffuse our energies away from our fundamental responsibility for warfighting .
To send ill - trained troops into combat makes us accomplices to murder .
•
Acknowledge that national security does have economic , social , educational , and environmental dimensions , but insist that this does n’t necessarily mean the problems in those areas are the responsibility of the military to correct .
Stylishly designating efforts to solve national ills as " wars " does n’t convert them into something appropriate for the employment of military forces .
•
Readily cede budgetary resources to those agencies whose business it is to address the non-military issues the armed forces are presently asked to fix .
We are not the DEA , EPA , Peace Corps , Department of Education , or Red Cross–nor should we be .
It has never been easy to give up resources , but in the long term we–and the nation –will be better served by a smaller but appropriately focused military .
•
Divest the defense budget of perception - skewing expenses .
Narcotics interdiction , environmental cleanup , humanitarian relief , and other costs tangential to actual combat capability should be assigned to the budgets of DEA , EPA , State , and so forth .
As long as these expensive programs are hidden in the defense budget , the taxpayer understandably –but mistakenly –will continue to believe he ’s buying military readiness .
• Continue to press for the elimination of superfluous , resource - draining Guard and Reserve units .
Increase the training tempo , responsibilities , and compensation of those that remain .
• Educate the public to the sophisticated training requirements occasioned by the complexities of modern warfare .
It ’s imperative we rid the public of the misperception that soldiers in peacetime are essentially unemployed and therefore free to assume new missions . [ 94 ]
• Resist unification of the services not only on operational grounds , but also because unification would be inimical to the checks and balances that underpin democratic government .
Slow the pace of fiscally driven consolidation so that the impact on less quantifiable aspects of military effectiveness can be scrutinized .
•
Assure that officer accessions from the service academies correspond with overall force reductions ( but maintain separate service academies ) and keep ROTC on a wide diversity of campuses .
If necessary , resort to litigation to maintain ROTC campus diversity .
•
Orient recruiting resources and campaigns toward ensuring that all echelons of society are represented in the military , without compromising standards . [ 95 ]
Accept that this kind of recruiting may increase costs .
It ’s worth it .
•
Work to moderate the base - as - an - island syndrome by providing improved incentives for military members and families to assimilate into civilian communities .
Within the information programs for our force of all - volunteer professionals ( increasingly US - based ) , strengthen the emphasis upon such themes as the inviolability of the Constitution , ascendancy of our civilian leadership over the military , and citizens ’ responsibilities .
Finally , I would tell our classmates that democracy is a fragile institution that must be continuously nurtured and scrupulously protected .
I would also tell them that they must speak out when they see the institution threatened ; indeed , it is their duty to do so .
Richard Gabriel aptly observed in his book To Serve with Honor that
when one discusses dissent , loyalty , and the limits of military obligations , the central problem is that the military represents a threat to civil order not because it will usurp authority , but because it does not speak out on critical policy decisions .
The soldier fails to live up to his oath to serve the country if he does not speak out when he sees his civilian or military superiors executing policies he feels to be wrong . [ 96 ]
Gabriel was wrong when he dismissed the military ’s potential to threaten civil order , but he was right when he described our responsibilities .
The catastrophe that occurred on our watch took place because we failed to speak out against policies we knew were wrong .
It ’s too late for me to do any more .
But it ’s not for you .
Best regards ,

At least one observer sensed the peril which arises when power and respect converge in the military : " Our warriors are kinder and gentler , and have not shown the slightest inclination to lust for political power .

Using Guardsmen in a law enforcement capacity during riots and other emergencies was not unusual , but a regular presence in a civilian community in that role was unusual in those days .
Guard members usually performed law enforcement activities in their status as state employees .
This is distinct from their federalized status when they are incorporated into the US military .

Similarly , noting the growing obsolescence of the Guard ’s combat role , a National Guard officer proposed an alternative : " The National Guard can provide a much greater service to the nation by seeking more combat support and combat service support missions and the structure to support them .
Such units can participate in nation building or assistance missions throughout the world , to include the United States .
. . .
Much of our national infrastructure , streets , bridges , health care , water and sewer lines , to name just a few , particularly in the inner cities of the United States , are in disrepair .
Many of the necessary repairs could be accomplished by National guard units on a year - round training basis . "

Under the Goldwater - Nichols Defense Reorganization Act , the Chairman of the JCS was given much broader powers .
Not only is he now the primary military advisor to the President , he is also responsible for furnishing strategic direction to the armed forces , strategic and contingency planning , establishing budget priorities , and developing joint doctrine for all four services .
Edward Luttwak and Stuart L. Koehl , eds. , The Dictionary of Modern War ( New York : Harper Collins , 1991 ) , p. 320 .
The law also mandated that joint duty be a requirement for promotion to flag rank .
See Vincent Davis , " Defense Reorganization and National Security , " The Annals of the American Academy of Political Science , September 1991 , pp. 163-65 .
This facilitated development of senior military cliques which transcended service lines .

See also Sam Nunn , " Military Reform Paved Way for Gulf Triumph , " Atlanta Constitution , 31 March 1991 , p. G5 .
But the Gulf War was not a true test of either Goldwater - Nichols or joint warfare .
About all that conflict demonstrated was that poorly trained and miserably led conscript armies left unprotected from air attack cannot hold terrain in the face of a modern ground assault .

One study concluded that because of Powell ’s background he was " especially well qualified " for the politically sensitive role as CJCS .

54 . Representative Denton stated as to Goldwater - Nichols : " This legislation proposes to reverse 200 years of American history by , for the first time , designating by statute . . . a single uniformed officer as the " Principal Military Advisor " to the President .
That change in the role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is profound in its implications .
Similar proposals have been specifically and overwhelmingly rejected in the past–in 1947 , 1949 , 1958 – on the grounds that , in a democracy , no single military officer , no matter what his personal qualifications , should have such power . "

This belief was enshrined in Joint Pub 1 , Joint Warfare of the United States ( Washington : Office of the JCS , 11 November 1991 ) .
It states ( p. iii ) that " joint warfare is essential to victory . "
While joint warfare might usually be essential to victory , it can not be said that it is essential in every instance .
For example , rebels –composed entirely of irregular infantry –defeated massive Soviet combined - arms forces in Afghanistan .
Equipped only with light arms , Stinger missiles , and light antiaircraft guns , they triumphed without benefit of any air or naval forces , and indeed without unity among themselves .
Furthermore , even in the case of Western nations , there are likely to be plenty of hostilities involving single - service air or naval campaigns .
58 . Former Secretary of the Navy John Lehman described the value of this creative tension in discussing his criticism of the " unified " Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff occasioned by Goldwater - Nichols .
According to Lehman : " Franklin Roosevelt . . . wanted to hear Admiral King argue with Marshall in front of him .
He wanted to hear MacArthur argue against Nimitz , and the Air Corps against the Army , and the Navy against all in his presence , so that he would have the option to make the decisions of major strategy in war .
He knew that any political leader , no matter how strong , if given only one military position , finds it nearly impossible to go against it .
Unfortunately . . . now the president does not get to hear arguments from differing points of view . "

Last week , the internet was flooded with stories of YouTube and Web 2.0 ’s impending doom .
All of this talk of the web - pocalypse was set off by a report released by Credit Suisse , a financial - services company , which claimed that Google , the company that owns YouTube , is set to lose almost $ 470 million on the site this year .
The culprits : high server costs and low ad revenue .
While it ’s understandable that advertisers do n’t like paying much for user generated content , it 's pretty sad that Google 's losing money on YouTube .
YouTube has a built in audience of more than a billion people .
If advertisers and Google can’t find a way to make the situation , where they get almost exact data on the size and location of their audience , profitable , then they deserve to fail .
ABC does n’t have problems selling ads for America ’s Funniest Home Videos , why should YouTube be any different ?
The bottom line is that advertisers have grossly failed the internet .
Billions of people go online daily , spending hours on sites like YouTube , Flickr , and Facebook , and advertisers have failed to provide relevant ads to this engaged ( and addicted ) audience .
Eric Clemons , Professor of Operations and Information Management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania , argues that , “ The problem is not the medium , the problem is the message , and the fact that it is not trusted , not wanted , and not needed . ”
The message is flawed , not because we do n’t trust it , but because it ’s poorly conceived , packaged , and often delivered to the wrong address .
Most of the ads we see on the internet are trashy click - ads for sleazy looking products or services that make outrageous claims like “ get rich blogging , ” “ lose forty pounds in a week , ” or “ get an eight inch penis . ”
Click - ads like these are n’t very effective .
Sites need to start rolling out contextually significant ads ( Google is already working on something like this ) .
So far , gaming sites have been adept at this by focusing on ads about games ( shocking ) .
Providing contextual ads on YouTube is a little harder , but there ’s probably a skateboarding company out there that would love to advertise its logo beside a well - trafficked video of some skateboarder wiping out and getting hit in the crotch .
Ruby has a nice , but very dangerous feature called open classes .
That means you can extend any class definition if you want it .
This example shows it
#!/usr/bin/ruby class
Foo def do_foo return " foo " end end a Foo = Foo.new ( ) puts a Foo.do_foo( ) class
Foo def do_bar return " bar " end end puts a Foo.do_bar ( )
That means you dynamically extend the definition of Foo class , so the last line prints “ bar ” .
Python behavior is different , because it does not allows this extending .
Python just redefines a class Foo , so new instance of Foo will have a do_bar method only .
But this not affected an existing ones , like Ruby does .
class Foo : def do_foo( self ) : return " foo " a Foo1 = Foo ( ) class Bar ( Foo ) : def do_nothing ( self ) : pass print issubclass ( Bar , Foo ) print isinstance ( aFoo1 , Foo ) class Foo : def do_bar ( self ) : return " bar " a Foo2 = Foo ( ) a Bar = Bar ( ) print issubclass ( Bar , Foo ) print isinstance ( aFoo1 , Foo ) print isinstance ( aFoo2 , Foo ) print dir ( aFoo1 ) print dir ( aFoo2 ) print dir ( aBar )
But what about method injection ?
My solution is based on ideas of Recipe 81732 : Dynamically added methods to a class .
import types def funcToMethod ( func , instance , method_name=None ) : cls = instance .__class__ if type ( instance ) != types .
TypeType else instance setattr( cls , \ method_name or func .__name__ , \ types .
MethodType( func , instance , cls ) )
And that ’s all .
The funcToMethod bounds func to instances ’s class and allows under method_name ( default name is a same as a function one ) .
So lets do some testing .
class Foo( object ) : def list ( self ) : return [ meth for meth in dir ( self ) if meth [ : 3 ] == ' do_ ' and type ( getattr ( self , meth ) ) == types .
MethodType ] def do_bar ( self ) : return " bar " def do_foo ( inst ) : return " foo " class Bar ( Foo ) : def do_nothing ( self ) : pass a Bar = Bar ( ) a Foo1 = Foo( ) print a Foo1.list ( ) # calling it with class instead of instance is also possible and is equivalent # funcToMethod ( do_foo , Foo , " do_foo " ) funcToMethod ( do_foo , aFoo1 , " do_foo " ) a Foo2 = Foo( ) print a Foo1.list ( ) print a Foo2.list ( ) print a Foo1.do_foo( ) print a Foo2.do_foo( ) print a Bar.list ( ) print a Bar.do_foo ( )
When you run the code , you will see that funcToMethod adds a new method to Foo class and this changes both existing and new instances as Ruby does too .
And subclassing is not a problem , they are be affected too .

Sexual abuse was endemic in boys ' institutions and a chronic problem in some residential institutions , according to a new report .
The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse states that sexual abuse of boys in the Artane Industrial School in Dublin and Letterfrack , Co Galway , was a chronic problem .
Its report has been published this afternoon - a decade after the commission was set up by the Government .
Read the Executive Summary
Access the full report
The report has strongly criticised the Department of Education for its handling of complaints about residential institutions .
It recommends that a memorial should be erected inscribed with the words of former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern when he issued an apology to the victims of abuse in 1999 .
The Department of Education generally dismissed or ignored complaints of child sexual abuse and dealt inadequately with them according to the report .
Minister for Education and Science Batt O'Keeffe said that the Government would carefully study the findings and recommendations in the report .
Mr O'Keeffe extended his sympathy to those who were subjected to abuse while resident in industrial schools .
The report states that the safety of children was not a priority for the Christian Brothers who ran the institutions .
Cardinal Seán Brady welcomed the report this afternoon .
He said it documents a shameful catalogue of cruelty : neglect , physical , sexual and emotional abuse , perpetrated against children .
' I am profoundly sorry and deeply ashamed , ' the Cardinal said , ' that children suffered in such awful ways in these institutions .
Children deserved better and especially from those caring for them in the name of Jesus Christ . '
The report follows ten years of work by the commission which dealt with thousands of complaints from former residents of predominantly Catholic institutions .
It does not identify respondents and gives pseudonyms to those found guilty in a criminal trial .
The report says that the Christian Brothers Order was defensive in the way it responded to complaints and claims the order fails to accept any congregational responsibility for such abuse .
More allegations were made against the Christian Brothers than all of the other male orders combined .
A statement from the order read : ' We apologise openly and unreservedly to all those who have been hurt either directly or indirectly as a result of the deplorable actions of some Brothers , or by the inaction or inappropriate action of the Congregation as a whole .
' We are deeply sorry for the hurt caused .
We are ashamed and saddened that many who complained of abuse were not listened to .
' We acknowledge and regret that our responses to physical and sexual abuse failed to consider the long term psychological effects on children . '
The report states that physical punishment in Artane in Dublin was excessive and children constantly felt under threat and were fearful .
Physical punishment was severe at Letterfrack
Letterfrack , according to the report , was an inhospitable , bleak , isolated institution in which physical punishment was severe , excessive and pervasive .
For two thirds of the period investigation in the Co Galway institution there was at least one sexual abuser present , according to the report .
Two abusers were present there for 14 years and the congregation offered no explanation of how they remained there undetected and unreported for so long .
The report describes how at St Joseph 's Industrial School in Tralee , Co Kerry , a brother terrorised children for more than seven years after being moved there from a day school where his violence towards children was causing severe problems with parents .
The commission received thousands of complaints of emotional , physical and sexual trauma inflicted on children by Catholic priests , brothers and nuns .
More than 100 institutions , chiefly run by religious orders , including industrial schools , institutions for children with disabilities and ordinary day schools , were examined by the commission chaired by Mr Justice Seán Ryan .
It is over five years since the commission 's first chairperson , Judge Mary Laffoy , signed its account of abuse and neglect endured by boys in the Catholic - run Baltimore Industrial School over 60 years ago in west Cork .
The Commission 's Investigation Committee held more private than public hearings .
Earlier , the Taoiseach told the Dáil that the failures of the State and others charged with the care of children must be acknowledged and lessons learned .

Ever find yourself with a water - soaked low - battery phone ?
Sharp and Japanese network KDDI have a solution : the world ’s first solar - powered waterproof cell phone .
The phone , scheduled for a June release in Japan , can nab one minute of talk time or two hours of standby power from ten minutes of sun .
The phone can derive 80 % of its charge in total from solar power .
It ’s not a fast enough charging time to change anyone ’s life , but it ’s ideal for afternoons in the park or on the beach .
Details on Sharp ’s phone are scant , with pricing yet to be released .
The company has n’t given a timeline on when the phone will be unveiled in the U.S. , but Sharp ’s cell phone will beat both Samsung and LG ’s solar - powered models to market .
Samsung ’s Blue Earth phone is made from recycled plastic bottles and features a built - in pedometer that calculates savings on carbon emissions from walking versus driving in a car .
The phone will be released in the U.K. some time during the second half of 2009 .
LG ’s solar model works a bit faster than Sharp ’s –10 minutes of sunlight provides enough power for three minutes of talk time–but the company has n’t yet hinted at a release date .
The most exciting development in sustainable cell phones may not be solar at all .
Kyocera ’s kinetic energy - powered concept phone features a fold - out OLED screen that ’s big enough for movie - watching .

A Boeing 737 belonging to CanJet sits on the tarmac near the Jamaican resort of Montego Bay on Monday while a gunman was holding six crew members hostage .
( Patricia Roxborough / Jamaica Observer / Associated Press ) Jamaican troops stormed a hijacked Canadian plane Monday after negotiations with a gunman broke down , taking a man into custody and rescuing six crew members .
Jamaican Information Minister Daryl Vaz said all six Canadian crew members are safe and were taken to a local hospital for a medical checkup .
People with family members aboard CanJet Flight 918 can call the airline toll free , 1-888-777-6429 .
The 20 - year - old man in police custody has been identified as Stephen Fray .
Vaz called him a " troubled young man " who was upset about a failed relationship .
Vaz said members of the Jamaica Defence Force Counter Terrorism Operations Group stormed CanJet Flight 918 after close to eight hours of negotiations between the gunman and family members broke down .
The hijacked flight left Halifax on Sunday bound for Montego Bay .
It was to leave Jamaica later Sunday night and stop in Santa Clara , Cuba , before returning to Halifax with a load of returning vacationers .
( ( CBC ) )
" It has ended the best way it could , no fatalities , no injuries , " Vaz said .
The incident started around 10 p.m. Sunday local time when a gunman reportedly forced his way through security and boarded the plane carrying 159 passengers about 40 minutes before it was due to depart from Sangster International Airport in Montego Bay .
Passenger Suzanne Ferguson said the gunman was talking and shouting at passengers .
She said the gunman said : " I mean business , this is a hijacking , sit down , nobody move . "
She said the passengers complied .
" We were praying and crying a little bit , but everybody was quiet . "
Ferguson said she thought about Sept. 11 , 2001 .
" I thought he wanted to crash the plane , like in New York , " she said .
" That 's what we were all thinking . "
Flight attendant held at gunpoint
Jacques Poulin said he and his parents were among the final people about to board the flight when the gunman rushed past them .
Two other men who appeared to be undercover officers then pulled out their weapons , he said .
Poulin said the gunman brandished his own weapon and yelled : " You ca n't stop me , I 'm going to America . "
" Nobody knew it was real .
People thought it was fake .
We literally just stood there , " Poulin said .
The two other men with guns ran downstairs to alert police and airport officials , Poulin said .
Heavily armed soldiers later arrived on the scene , he said .
The gunman held the passengers on board the plane for roughly 30 minutes until he agreed to let them and two crew members leave in exchange for their money .
Poulin said passengers told him the gunman held a flight attendant at gunpoint and ordered them to drop their money and valuables into a bag as they left the plane .
Poulin said it appeared the gunman fired a shot at the co-pilot , who was on the loading ramp trying to talk to the agitated man .
He said the shot might have grazed the co-pilot 's face because a man came running out holding his face .
CanJet denied the report , saying none of the flight crew was injured .
Kent Woodside , vice - president and general manager of CanJet , said there were unconfirmed reports a shot was fired on the walkway connecting the plane to the terminal , but that no one was injured .
New plane on way to Jamaica
The hijacked flight left Halifax on Sunday at 7:15 p.m. local time for Montego Bay .
It was to leave Jamaica later Sunday night and stop in Santa Clara , Cuba , where passengers Christian Gosselin , girlfriend Nancy Beattie and about two dozen other New Brunswickers were to attend a wedding , his father Alphonse Gosselin told CBC News .
Woodside said another CanJet plane will arrive in Jamaica by Monday afternoon to pick up the passengers and crew members , who are receiving medical checkups at a local hospital .
A new crew and multiple sets of pilots will be on board , he said .
That flight will also stop in Santa Clara to pick up passengers waiting to return to Canada .
Woodside did n't say how many passengers are stranded in Cuba , but he said they are waiting at their resorts .
It 's unclear when the passengers will return to Canada .
Woodside praised the crew 's professionalism .
" Their composure led to a successful outcome of this , " he said .
" They executed all of the steps as part of their security training to keep their passengers safe as well as themselves safe and secure . "
Dawn Way , a Halifax - based flight attendant for WestJet Airlines , said she knows the captain and one of the flight attendants on the flight .
" I knew they would act in a very professional manner .
The captain is very competent and the flight attendant , she 's very level - headed , so I knew that they would be able to handle the situation , " said Way .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper , who is in Jamaica for a one - day visit , offered his plane to help transport some passengers back to Canada , but his spokesman , Kory Teneycke , said the airline has said it is able to handle the transport itself .
Gunman angrily waved weapon
Lisa Boudreau said her friend , who was on the plane , told her that some people had tried to escape when the gunman boarded .
" The gunman got aggravated , when people tried to escape , so he got up and he went up and down the aisle , seat to seat , putting the gun in everyone ’s face , " she said .
A St. George , N.B. , woman whose son was on the flight says a flight attendant helped negotiate the release of the passengers .
Cheryl Spear said her son Jamie called her early Monday morning when he was freed , telling her the gunman angrily threatened passengers and waved his weapon around .
" The stewardess from the back seemed to be able to calm him and tried to … reason with him into letting them off if they left their money and wallets there , " she said .
" And that seemed to have worked for him and that seemed to be the way they were able to get off of the plane . "
Vaz said Jamaican government officials will help sort out any necessary paperwork for passengers who had to leave their passports on the plane , as well as supply passengers with any necessary medication .
" I must tell you , all the passengers … really took it in good stead .
And they were very anxious to just get to a place where they could rest because it was obviously very traumatic , " said Vaz .
Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding expressed relief that the standoff was over , apologized to Canadian passengers for their ordeal and promised a complete and thorough investigation into what he called an obvious security breakdown .
" I 'm very relieved , extremely relieved , that it 's over and nobody has been hurt , " Golding said .
Arrangements to provide accommodations for the passengers have been made and they 've also been offered funds to compensate for the money they surrendered to their captor .
" There was quite clearly a breach of security at the airport , and I 've asked for an investigation to be done immediately and a report to be made . "
CanJet is owned by Halifax - based IMP Group Ltd. , according to CanJet 's website .
The plane involved in the hostage - taking is a Boeing 737- 800 capable of carrying 189 people .
Filipinos have held vigils for the kidnapped Red Cross workers
A state of emergency has been imposed on a southern Philippine island where militants holding three aid workers have threatened to kill one of them .
The declaration puts all security forces on alert on Jolo island and curtails the movement of people .
The Abu Sayyaf rebels had threatened to behead one of the three Red Cross hostages by 1400 ( 0600 GMT ) if security troops did not pull back .
But there has so far been no word on the fate of the hostages .
Swiss national Andreas Notter , Italian Eugenio Vagni and Filipina Mary Jean Lacaba were seized on 15 January , and have since been held in the jungles of Jolo .
The three aid workers were abducted after a visit to a local prison , where the International Committee of the Red Cross is funding a water project .
The head of the Philippine Red Cross has made a last - minute appeal to the militants to spare the hostages ' lives .
" The whole family of the Red Cross prays for you and I 'm proud of the way you 've comported yourself , " said Senator Richard Gordon in a tearful televised address .
" I 'm sorry I should be stronger than you because I 'm not in midst of the ordeal you 're in now , " he said .
At least 800 soldiers out of 1,000 have pulled back on Jolo island .
However the government says it cannot complete a full withdrawal as that would leave the island 's civilian population exposed to militant attacks .
The Abu Sayyaf has a history of beheading captives .
In 2001 , American Guillermo Sobero was killed after the government turned down attempts by the rebels to negotiate for hostages on the nearby island of Basilan .
HAVANA ( Reuters ) - Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro said on Sunday the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba must go , but he was mum on his brother Raul Castro ’s recent offer to talk with Washington about “ everything , ” including political prisoners and human rights .

Castro ’s comments in his latest column in Cuba ’s state - run media were his first about the just - completed Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago .
Latin American leaders there pushed U.S. President Barack Obama to end the Cold War trade ban imposed against Cuba in 1962 .
Castro praised Obama for being “ very intelligent , ” but said he was “ abrupt and evasive ” when he answered questions about the embargo in a closing news conference on Sunday .
“ I want to remind him of a basic ethical principal related to Cuba : any injustice , any crime in whatever time has no excuse to go on .
The cruel blockade ( embargo ) against the Cuban people costs lives , costs suffering , ” he said .
Before the summit that began on Friday , Obama put small holes in the embargo by granting Cuban - Americans the right to travel freely to Cuba and send unlimited money to their relatives on the communist - ruled island .
Obama said he hoped Cuba would signal its willingness to move ahead by releasing political prisoners and cutting the amount it charges to change U.S. dollars into Cuban convertible pesos .
President Raul Castro said on Thursday that Cuba was willing to hold talks with the United States in which even sensitive topics for Cuba -- human rights , political prisoners and freedom of the press -- could be on the table .
“ The test for all of us is not simply words , but deeds , ” Obama said on Sunday .
Obama has said he wants to “ recast ” the U.S. - Cuba relationship but would use the embargo as leverage for Cuban reforms . [ n N19374252 ]
Raul Castro ’s words were taken by the administration as a signal Cuba wants to move toward better relations , but Fidel Castro said nothing about the comments in his column .
He has written previously that Cuba is not afraid to have a dialogue with the United States .
Castro quoted at length from a summit speech by his ally , Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega , who spoke of a long history of grievances against the United States and said he once told former U.S. President Jimmy Carter , “ Nicaragua does not have to change , the ones that have to change are you ( Americans ) . ”
“ Nicaragua has never thrown a rock against the North American nation , Nicaragua has never imposed governments on the United States .
You are the ones who have to change , ” Ortega said .
SARNIA , Ontario , May 7 ( UPI ) --
Discrimination complaints from both sides of the border have been filed after a U.S. woman was denied entry into Canada because she is on welfare .
Canada Border Services Agency officials Sunday twice refused Rose Kelley , 25 , of Owosso , Mich. , entry into the country at the Sarnia , Ontario , border crossing at the base of Lake Huron , Sun media reported Thursday .

In her written complaint to the agency , Kelley said the officer ignored the fact a Canadian couple was paying for her visit with them .
" The officer said a person on welfare should n't be going on vacation , " Kelley said in her May 4 complaint to the CBSA .
" He said : ' You really should not come back to the border until your life drastically changes . ' "
The Canadian couple who tried to bring Kelley into the country in their car twice also filed a complaint , the report said .
A CBSA spokesman told the news agency visitors must show they can financially support themselves while in Canada .
Strangely enough , on his impressive official website , in which Mr. Hannity offers his views of nearly every topic discussed on his show , there is n't a single mention of his offer to be waterboarded for charity .
Huh ?
Not to worry , Sean !
Kieth Olbermann and millions of YouTube viewers have your generous public offer recorded on digital videotape , just in case you forgot your offer .
One does not make public offers of charity and then forget about the offer two days latter .
We 're here to remind you , Sean !
Could it be that Mr. Hannity is a phony who talks the big bad Republican talk , but when it 's time to walk to walk , Mr. Hannity is a really sissy boy who 's afraid to get a little water in his face to raise thousands of dollars for the families of American GIs ?
Say it is n't so , Sean !
Rupert Murdoch will be pissed when he discovers he has a high profile employee that 's a deadbeat on his public pledge to raise funds for a charity .
At least most liberals have the honesty to admit they would n't want to be subjected to waterboarding .
But deep down inside all of us liberals secretly believe Hannity is a coward who'd probably go running home crying for his mommy before he 's spend 1 second on a waterboard .
This is Sean Hannity 's golden opportunity to prove us wrong .
For the record author Christopher Hitchens spent a couple of seconds on a waterboard , before he begged for mercy .
Mr. Hitchen 's summary of his experience ?..
" If this is n't torture , then nothing is . "
A few right wing blogs attempted to change the subject by making ad hominem attacks on Kieth Olberman instead of encouraging their hero to make good on his waterboarding offer and put that troll Olbermann in his place , by collecting $ 1 million dollars for charity from Olbermann .
Here 's an example of one right wing blogger 's attempt to turn the tables on Olbermann by ( strangely enough ) accusing him of being the coward :
Mr. Olbermann , you are the Gary Coleman of the news industry small , once funny , and always looking for respect you do n't deserve .
Mr. Olbermann , if you had any journalistic guts , you would examine how much Nancy Pelosi knew .
Of course , you comedy routine wo n't take a chance of hurting your only friends -- the scum who call themselves Democrats .
Something tells me Olbermann would n't pay up if Hannity took up his waterboarding challenge .
Heck , Mr. Olbermann , I will do it to show Americans that this act is a joke and was used to save American lives .
Would somone remind Mr. Olbermann , that it was under a Democratic administration in which the government started injected syphilis into black men at Tuskegee .
I do n't know Mr. Olbermann , there something much darker about the Tuskegee incident , but of course since it was under your party the experiments started , there must be something enlightening to you about them .
Waterboarding radical Islamic terrorist is n't the even close to being dark considering Mr. Olbermann .
I 've got to give the blogger credit for the Gary Coleman remark , it least he 's a bit more clever that most of his conservative peers in the blogosphere .
But then the blogger forgets the topic is Sean Hannity 's waterboaring offer , and proceeds into the usual right - wing partisan trash talkin ' about Nancy Pelosi and the " Democratic scum . "
For chrissake 's , stay focused Mr. Right Wing Man !
Then Mr. Right - wing blogger insinuates that Olbermann is n't a man of his word and would n't pay up if Hannity made good on his own offer ( not Olbermann 's ) of being waterboarded .
Is n't he forgetting that it 's Hannity that is proving to insincere by refusing to follow through on his commitment to a national audience of views to be waterboarded .
The question of whether Hannity follows through on his waterboarding offer is irrelevant to Mr. Olbermann 's generous pledge of $ 1000 a second for Hannity 's waterboard telethon .
If Sean Hannity wanted prove Olbermann was a phony , he could follow through on his much anticipated waterboarding event and if Olbermann did n't pay up , Mr. Olbermann would be in the uncomfortable position of losing all credibility as a man of his word .
Then in his final coup de'grace the blogger constructs a tortured analogy to the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment which has as little to do with Hannity 's waterboarding offer , as the outcome of the 1986 World Series .
The conservative Hannity defender does n't even speak the point of the argument at hand , because he never makes a single point relevant to the argument at hand , except that there 's a remote possibility that Olbermann may be a deadbeat .
In that case , the best thing Hannity could do to prove Olbermann is a deadbeat is to make good on his offer and then walk up to Kieth Olberman and say , " Pay up Mr. Bullshitter . "
Mr. Hannity 's right wing defenders are going to have to do a whole lot better than this blogger to get Hannity off the hook , because Olbermann going to be like a pit bull who wo n't let go of his grip on Hannity 's leg until he proves that he 's a man of his word or publicly admits he 's a phony .
L’AQUILA , Italy ( Reuters ) - Rescuers searched through the night for survivors of an earthquake that killed more than 130 people in central Italy early on Monday and left thousands of homeless huddled in tent camps and rough shelters .
Rain complicated the task of firemen and emergency workers combing the rubble in the hope of plucking people alive from collapsed houses in the medieval mountain city of L’Aquila and nearby villages , some almost entirely destroyed .
The quake struck shortly after 3.30 a.m. ( 9:30 p.m. EDT ) on Monday , catching residents in their sleep and flattening houses , ancient churches and other buildings in 26 cities and towns .
Aftershocks rattled the area , some 100 km east ( 60 miles ) of Rome in the Abruzzo region , throughout the day .
Local authorities said more than 130 people were confirmed dead and more than 1,500 injured .
The civil protection agency put the number of homeless at up to 50,000 .
Hospital sources told ANSA news agency more than 150 people had died , while the website of the daily Corriere della Sera said 250 people were still missing , raising fears that the death toll could rise substantially .
“ It ’s been such a hard and long day .
Now that we are sitting here in our car it ’s all beginning to sink in , ” said L’Aquila resident Piera Colucci as she prepared to sleep in her vehicle .
Rescue workers using powerful floodlights and bulldozers said they would keep searching for survivors through the night .
After digging in the rubble all day , a fireman recounted how he had pulled a boy alive from the mangled remains of his house .
“ All we could see was his head sticking from the rubble , his entire body was buried .
We kept digging , picking piece by piece of debris and we finally managed to get him out -- when we did the fatigue was great but so was our joy , ” he said .
Thousands of tents were put up in parks and on football pitches to shelter the homeless for the night and hotels on the Adriatic coast were requisitioned .
“ DON ’T GO BACK TO YOUR HOUSE ”
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi declared a national emergency and flew to the disaster zone , cancelling a trip to Moscow .
He later said his cabinet was providing 30 million euros ( $ 40 million ) for immediate assistance and expected a special European Union fund to contribute hundreds of millions more .
“ Tonight , do n’t go back to your houses , it could be dangerous , ” he said in a message to residents broadcast on state television .

Shaken survivors described the quake striking them like a bomb in the middle of the night and the anguish of not knowing the fate of loved ones .
“ I only remember this huge rumble and then someone dragged me out , but I do n’t know what happened to my wife and three - year - old son , ” said 35 - year - old Stefano Esposito .
Most of the dead were in L’Aquila , a city of 68,000 , where streets were strewn with rubble and old buildings crumbled like straw houses .
Some nearby towns were all but destroyed .

In the village of Onna , which counts 250 residents , at least 24 people died .
Wooden coffins were placed on communal ground .
As messages of condolences poured in from across the world , usually squabbling Italian politicians put aside their rivalries and united in mourning .
But there was still room for controversy .
Weeks before the disaster , an Italian scientist had predicted a major quake around L’Aquila , based on concentrations of radon gas found around seismically active areas .
He was reported to police for “ spreading alarm ” and was forced to remove his findings from the Internet .
Civil Protection assured locals at the end of March that tremors being felt were “ absolutely normal ” for a seismic area .
Many a female cyclist will have gone into her local bike shop , been blinded by the racks of fluorescent fabrics and wondered if it would ever be possible to buy cycling gear that would n't make her look as if she had been attacked by a highlighter pen .
Why , she may have wondered , did it seem beyond the imagination of designers to come up with garments suited to the demands of the cyclist that did n't risk the wearer being mistaken for a member of the team mending the water mains ?
For the past few years , a growing number of designers have quietly been doing just that .
And very soon , their work is going mainstream .
From Thursday , Topshop , that barometer of the nation 's style , will be stocking cycling accessories in its flagship Oxford Street store .
It will be selling panniers , saddlebags , retro cycling caps and much more .
All are designed by Cyclodelic ( cyclodelic.wordpress.com ) , an all - female design company based in east London , which " believes that girls who cycle do n't have to forfeit fashion over function " .
The Cyclodelic Topshop concession , which could be rolled out nationally and even internationally if all goes well , is part of a resurgence of women 's cycling .
Last summer , Her Gear , which claims to be the UK's only shop catering exclusively for female cyclists - " an alternative to the greasy fingernailed , Masonic , very macho environment you find in a traditional bike shop , " according to owner Stephen Peters - opened in Kensington , west London .
Recently you had Duffy wobbling around on a bike in the Diet Coke advert , model Agyness Deyn is rarely photographed without her vintage steed , and last year Courteney Cox presented Jennifer Aniston with a Chanel bike for her birthday .
The sustainable transport charity Sustrans has recently launched bikebelles.org.uk , a website designed to encourage women to get in the saddle .
And last month , the London Cycling Campaign organised Birds on Bikes , a night - time ride taking in locations linked with the achievements of women in the capital .
Plus , of course , there was the stunning success of the women from the British Olympic cycling team in Beijing .
But despite all this oestrogen - fuelled activity , only a minority of women cycle .
According to new research from Sustrans , 79 % of British women do not cycle at all even though 43 % have access to a bike .
It is a sad state of affairs given that cycling was a key part of the women 's movement .
Taking to two wheels liberated women from their cumbersome corsets and petticoats by allowing them to get from A to B in " rational dress " , without their husbands .
And though cycling these days is more about emancipation from the public transport network than the male overlords , the fight to dress well in the saddle goes on .
A boy in Palmdale who was playing cops and robbers with a toy gun was shot and wounded Sunday night by a Los Angeles County sheriff ’s deputy , authorities said .
The boy was shot in the upper torso and was expected to survive , said Deputy Ed Hernandez , a sheriff ’s spokesman .
He declined to release the victim ’s name or age .
Hernandez said that deputies responded about 8 p.m. to reports of a person brandishing a weapon and that the suspect pointed the gun at the officers .
“ The deputies , fearing for their life , shot him once , ” Hernandez said .
“ Later on , they determined it was a juvenile playing cops and robbers . ”

Enough said .
Perhaps she speaks for herself and her homophobic church .

Most people know that we build powerful business intelligence dashboards here at RJMetrics , but now that we ’ve moved to Camden , we figured we ought to take advantage of the long weekend and make a rap video as well .
( Unfortunately , the odds are stacked against us– Jake ’s favorite rapper is Bo Burnham and I ’m so tone deaf that I crashed the auto - tune plugin when we recorded this song . )
Anyway , in what may prove to be the dumbest PR move ever , we decided to augment our dope beats with some unsolicited free advice to tech startups .
This was our chance to point out some of the most absurd startup behavior over the past few years .
We should know –most of these lines are based on things we ’ve done .
Lyrics are below the video .
Enjoy !
Big thanks to Adamack from Open Minds Entertainment for the beat , John Keating for his help with the vocals , and my brother James Moore for the studio time and production .

Lyrics :
This recessionary period ai n’t messin ’ around
I got depression - era economics gettin me down
The internet it ai n’t immune , man , everybody ’s gettin ’ screwed
And yeah it ’s true you know , web two - dot - oh is dead in the ground
VC ’s drying up , M&A ? outta luck
And the rub is you ’ll be strugglin ’ if your company sucks
Stuck scratchin your head ?
You ’ll be dead in the water
Here ’s a couple signs that you ’re gonna get slaughtered :
Your six - month peak was a TechCrunch mention
Your churn rate ’s deep , you got no retention
You join AdSense and declare success
But your cloud tag ’s only got one word : “ test ”
You built a couple widgets and a wiki that scales
And then you paid your people double cause they did it in rails
But , how you doin ’ in sales ?
I know it ’s probably slow , yo
‘ Cause I need some aviators just to look at your logo
You got no revenue
Burnin ’ cash is all you do
You raised your Series A
Twice - preferred , participating
You ’re throwin staff retreats
Better check your balance sheet
Everyone ’s convinced
You need business intelligence
See you lata , public beta , do a real release
The whole long tail could n’t even save this piece
Got a social app ?
Well , it ’s a disgrace , look
‘ Cause Facebook ca n’t even make money on Facebook
You got a podcast , but the point you ’re missin’s
Your vision ’s so weak , ai n’t no one listenin ’
SecondLife sales ?
Man , that plan is the worst
I think you shoulda made a dollar in your first life first
Meet - Ups every day , when you go , pros scatter
You ’re LinkedIn to 500 + but none matter
Tryin ’ to be distributed , you wanna unbound
But you know nothin ’ bout computing , get your head out the cloud
Your API ’s slow , it ’s a bit too RESTful
Quit tryin ’ to grow at a clip , was too stressful
Debt breakin’ covenants , they ’re rollin ’ it back
Yeah you got all of your investor ’s tryin ’ to call in a MAC
Not grabbing market share
Market is n’t even there
You think you ’re doin ’ fine
In stealth mode since ‘ 99
You ’re tweeting constantly
LOL @bankruptcy
You do n’t know SEO
You paid for links but they ’re nofollowed
Had millions in the bank
Still have no Alexa Rank
Burn out or get acquired
Either way you ’re gettin ’ fired
Your angel round is gone
Blew it on a favicon
Everyone ’s convinced
You need business intelligence
You signed a 10 - year lease
I would n’t give you 10 weeks
You Loved “ Who Moved My Cheese ? ”
Retire , please
Your dedicated server farm is bladed , thats slick
Although you probably woulda made it on an 386
Because your invite - only system , dude it ’s hurtin ’ , it ’s flawed
See , all those people you invited ai n’t returnin your calls
And it ’s only 9 - to - 5ers who surround your scene
Because Adultfriendfinder ’s where you found your team
Tried to hire talent but you screwed it up , did n’tcha
‘ Cause your wanted add said you were hirin ’ ninjas
Yeah we know we ’re hypocrites for doin this song
And then promotin ’ it by posting on the company blog
But a new day is dawnin ’ , the strong they can sense it
Darwin is comin ’ to the ‘ net with a vengeance
If you ’re sittin on a winner , yo , you wanna be strapped
So if you want to push it harder , best be trackin your stats
And I ai n’t talkin’ bout your traffic , man I ’m way past that
Wanna fatten up your stacks ?
Let ’s chat …
Business Intelligence … ( repeat )

Carmina Burana
( Eight Translations of  Dum Diana vitrea . . .)
The original Latin :
Dum Diana vitrea
sero lampas oritur ,
et a fratris rosea
luce dum succenditur ,
dulcis aura Zephiri
spirans omnes etheri
nubes tollit ,
sic emollit
vi[s ] chordarum pectora ,
et immutat
cor , quod nutat
ad amoris pignora .
Letum iubar Hesperi
gratiorem
dat humorem
roris soporiferi
mortalium generi .
O quam felix est
antidotum soporis ,
quot curarum tempestates
sedat et doloris !
Dum surrepit clausis
oculorum poris ,
ipsum gaudio equiperat
dulcedini amoris .
Orpheus [ Morpheus ] in mentem
trahit impellentem
ventum lenem ,
segetes maturas ,
murmura rivorum
per harenas puras ,
circulares ambitus molendinorum ,
qui furantur somno lumen oculorum .
Post blanda Veneris conmercia
lassatur cerebri substantia ;
hinc caligant
mira novitate
oculi nantes
in palpebrarum rate .
Hei quam felix transitus
amoris ad soporem ,
sed suavior
regressus ad amorem !
Ex alvo leta
fumus evaporat ,
qui capitis tres
cellulas irrorat ;
hic infumat oculos
ad soporem pendulos ,
et palpabras
sua fumositate
replet , ne visus
exspacietur late ;
unde ligant oculos
virtutes animales ,
que sunt magis
vise ministeriales .
Fronde sub arboris amena ,
dum querens canit Philomena ,
suave est quiescere ,
suavius ludere
in gramine
cum virgine
spetiosa .
Si variarum
odor herbarum
spiraverit ,
si dederit
thorum rosa ,
dulciter soporis alimonia
post Veneris defessa commercia
captatur ,
dum lassis instillatur .
O in quantis
animus amantis
variatur
vacillantis !
Ut vaga
ratis per equora ,
dum caret anchora ,
fluctuat inter spem
metumque dubia ,
sic Veneris milicia .
( Carmina Burana manuscript , ca. 12th century )
When the lamp of Cynthia late
Rises in her silver state ,
Through her brothers roseate light ,
Blushing on the brows of night ;
Then the pure ethereal air
Breathes with zephyr blowing fair ;
Clouds and vapours disappear .
As with chords of lute and lyre ,
Soothed the spirits now respire ,
And the heart revives again
Which once more for love is fain .
But the orient evening star
Sheds with influence kindlier far
Dews of sweet sleep on the eye
Of oer - tired mortality .
Oh , how blessed to take and keep
Is the antidote of sleep !
Sleep that lulls the storms of care
And of sorrow unaware ,
Creeping through the closèd doors
Of the eyes , and through the pores
Breathing bliss so pure and rare
That with love it may compare .
Then the god of dreams doth bring
To the mind some restful thing ,
Breezes soft that rippling blow
Oer ripe cornfields row by row ,
Murmuring rivers round whose brim
Silvery sands the swallows skim ,
Or the drowsy circling sound
Of old mill - wheels going round ,
Which with music steal the mind
And the eyes in slumber bind .
When the deeds of love are done
Which bland Venus had begun ,
Languor steals with pleasant strain
Through the chambers of the brain ,
Eyes neath eyelids gently tired
Swim and seek the rest desired .
How deliciously at last
Into slumber love hath passed !
But how sweeter yet the way
Which leads love again to play !
From the soothed limbs upward spread
Glides a mist divinely shed ,
Which invades the heart and head :
Drowsily it veils the eyes ,
Bending toward sleeps paradise ,
And with curling vapour round
Fills the lids , the senses swound ,
Till the visual ray is bound
By those ministers which make
Life renewed in man awake .
Underneath the leafy shade
Of a tree in quiet laid ,
While the nightingale complains
Singing of her ancient pains ,
Sweet it is still hours to pass ,
But far sweeter on the grass
With a buxom maid to play
All a summers holiday .
When the scent of herb and flower
Breathes upon the silent hour ,
When the rose with leaf and bloom
Spreads a couch of pure perfume ,
Then the grateful boon of sleep
Falls with satisfaction deep ,
Showering dews our eyes above ,
Tired with honeyed strife of love .
In how many moods the mind
Of poor lovers , weak and blind ,
Wavers like the wavering wind !
As a ship in darkness lost ,
Without anchor tempest - tossed ,
So with hope and fear imbued
It roams in great incertitude
Loves tempestuous ocean - flood .
Translated by John Addington Symonds
( Wine , Women and Song , 1884 )
When Diana lighteth
Late her crystal lamp ,
Her pale glory kindleth
From her brothers fire ,
Little straying west winds
Wander over heaven ,
Moonlight falleth ,
And recalleth
With a sound of lute - strings shaken ,
Hearts that have denied his reign
To love again .
Hesperus , the evening star ,
To all things that mortal are ,
Grants the dew of sleep .
Thrice happy sleep !
The antidote to care ,
Thou dost allay the storm
Of grief and sore despair ;
Through the fast - closed gates
Thou stealest light ;
Thy coming gracious is
As Loves delight .
Sleep through the wearied brain
Breathes a soft wind
From fields of ripening grain ,
The sound
Of running water over clearest sand ,
A millwheel turning , turning slowly round ,
These steal the light
From eyes weary of sight .
Loves sweet exchange and barter , then the brain
Sinks to repose ;
Swimming in strangeness of a new delight
The eyelids close ;
Oh sweet the passing oer from love to sleep .
But sweeter the awakening to love .
Under the kind branching trees
Where Philomel complains and sings
Most sweet to lie at ease ,
Sweeter to take delight
Of beauty and the night
On the fresh springing grass ,
With smell of mint and thyme ,
And for Loves bed , the rose .
Sleeps dew doth ever bless ,
But most distilled on lovers weariness .
Translated by Helen Waddell
( Medieval Latin Lyrics , 1929 )
When Dianas gleaming lamp
Upward gliding , rises late ,
Kindled while her brothers light ,
Fading , still is roseate ,
Sweet airs blowing from the west
Lift the mists that congregate
Far aloft :
Like music soft
Twilight soothes the breast ,
And after long repelling
The heart gives love a dwelling .
Welcome then
To mortal men ,
Hesperus , shining bright ,
Brings cool and damp
The sleep - compelling dews of night .
O what bliss it is !
Sleep , the antidote ,
From storms of care and grief
How sheltered , how remote :
Sleep that slyly enters
The portals of the eyes ,
Bringing joys that equal
Sweet loves paradise .
When Morpheus has passed
To drowsy fancy sending
A light wind blowing ,
Ripe corn bending ,
Rippling waters flowing
Over pure sands ,
Millwheels turning
While still the mill stands , 
Then robbed of all discerning
The eyes close at last .
After the subtle interchange of love
The nerves , late overtaxed ,
Are now relaxed ;
A wondrous newness we are conscious of ,
While eyes afloat
With darkness brimming
Glide like a boat
On eyelids skimming .
Height , tis joy to disencumber
Thought from coils of love in slumber ,
But sweeter far the reawaking
Out of sleep to new love - making .
From glad satiety such fumes arise
As cloud the three - celled brain ;
These vapors then incline the heavy eyes
To sleep again ,
Filling the eyelids with a drowsy smoke
That holds in check the power of sight ;
The animal spirits , ministering , wrap tight
The eyes as with a cloak .
Then under pleasant boughs ,
While grieving Philomel descants ,
Sweet it is to drowse ,
Or still more sweet perchance
To woo some pretty creature on the lawn :
Spicy garden odors breathing ,
Roses round our couch enwreathing ,
To snatch delight in slumbers sustenance ,
Loves fainting joys a while forgone
In languor deep withdrawn .
But O , how many are the changes
Through which a lovers spirit ranges !
No ship that drifts
With anchor lost
Can match the shifts
Of hope and fear
Wherewith hes crossed :
The folk of Venus buy her service dear .
Translated by George F. Whicher
( The Goliard Poets , 1949 )
When Diana , late at night ,
for her crystal lamp reclaims
pink and paler light
kindled from her brothers flames ,
western winds soft and fair
fill the air ,
clear the sky ,
and as by
music falling from above
cast their spell
and compel
hearts once hard to yield to love ,
as the evening star again
bright and new ,
fresh with dew ,
charms to sleep mortal men .
O felicity
of sleep careless
that comes to set us free
from all distress ,
and through the eyes entry
making sweet ingress
prepares us for sorcery
of loves progress .
Morpheus , shaper in the mind ,
brings us for dreams
soft blowing wind ,
murmuring of streams
over clear sand running ,
mill wheel sound
all night long turning
slowly round and round
softly to mesmerize
day - weary eyes .
After loves blandishing
and soft exchanges ,
sleep comes languishing ;
new strength outranges
all past sweet experience
and swims in new ecstasies of sense .
Lovely to sleep after loves strain ,
but lovelier to wake from sleep to love again .
Under green trellises
where Philomela sings the lay
of her sad jealousies ,
sweet to sleep the night away ,
but sweeter still to play
with a girl in the grass ,
and with such beauty pass
all the time away .
Smell of thyme and roses
and all things growing
gently disposes
of all our hearts  undoing ,
and the heart in weariness
after loves commerces
softly reposes .
Translated by Richmond Lattimore
( 1966 ; reprinted in Poems from Three Decades , 1972 )
As Zephyrs sweet breath takes every cloud from the sky when Dianas crystal lamp rises at dusk , kindled by her brothers rose light , so the power of music lightens the minds of men , and transforms the heart , that it inclines to the vows of love .
Hesperos joyful beam sheds a sweet rain of slumbrous dew upon mankind .
Oh how happy is the remedy of sleep , calming the storms of cares and grief !
When it steals under the closed eyelids , it is equal in joy to the sweetness of love .
Orpheus draws into the beating mind a gentle wind , ripe cornfields , murmurs of streams across pure sands , mill - wheels turning , which steal away the light of the eyes in sleep .
After the tender interchanges of love , the matter of the brain is languorous .
Thus in a new and wondrous wise the eyes grow dark , swimming on a float of eyelids with its smokiness , lest sight should range afar .
So the animal spirits , which specially in this show themselves our servants , bind the eyes .
Under the gracious boughs of a tree , while Philomena sings lamenting , it is sweet to rest , sweeter still to play in the grass with a lovely girl .
If the scent of many herbs perfumes the air , if the rose offers a bed , the nourishment of sleep is sweetly won , showered upon the languorous after loves play has faded .
Oh in how many ways a lovers spirit is filled with uncertainties !
Like an anchorless raft drifting across the ocean , those in Loves company fluctuate , wavering between hope and fear .
Translated by Peter Dronke
( Medieval Latin and the Rise of the European Love - Lyric , 1966 )
When Dianas crystalline
lantern rises late at night ,
shimmering with undershine
from her brothers rosy light :
when the gentle Zephyrs breeze
whiffles little clouds with ease
up and away . . .
so then the lay
of lutenists and ligatures
lures returning
hearts from yearning
after lovers overtures .
Hesperus with starlight beams
drawing dewdrops ,
soothing dewdrops ,
dulls with soporific dreams
mortal creatures and regimes .
O how welcome , slumber !
 sleep , the antidote
to all our inmost storms of hurt and doubt
instills between the lids of eyes half shut
such ecstasy as ever love gave out .
Morpheus unminds us :
weaving dreams , unwinds us
gentle winds from fields of ripening corn :
trickling steamlets over sandbeds borne :
an endless round and round of millwheels turning
robs our sleep - dimmed eyes of all discerning .
After exquisite toil at loves behest
the wearied brain seeks welcomely to rest :
eyes rediscover peace in growing dim ,
yield in their raft of lids to sink or swim .
To pass from love to languor  yes , this is a sweet remove ! 
but sweeter still the swift return to love .
From flesh fulfilled , contented perfumes spread
through all three layers of the lovers head ,
enveloping those selfsame eyes
sleep strives to mesmerize :
over the eyelids draw their swirling shield
to hold the gaze from wandering far afield . . .
so do Natures ministers soothe eyes into submission ,
serving as the faithful guardians of our power of vision .
Under the shady greenwood tree
where the nightingale sings plaintively
sweet to be lying there . . .
sweeter , be trying there
the playful whirl
of a lovely girl
in the grass :
and where the vagrant
scents of fragrant
herbs have strayed
and roses made
a couching place . . .
there then the soft sustenance of sleep ,
when lovers  toils are done , is happily relinquished
to those by labour vanquished .
Oh what commotions
and variable devotions
agitate the hearts emotions !
how like an unanchored boat
on seas we float , we
fluctuate between hope and misgiving 
who champion Venus for a living .
Translated by David Parlett
( Selections from the Carmina Burana , 1986 )
When the glistening torch of Diana rises late in the day and is ignited by the rosy light of her brother , the sweet breath of the West Wind with its exhalation removes all clouds from the sky .
In the same way that wind by the power of his strings relieves mens breasts and transforms the heart that is wilting in the face of loves pledges .
The joyful radiance of the evening star brings to the race of mortals the more welcome moisture of sleep - inducing dew .
How blessed is the antidote of sleep !
What storms of cares and griefs it assuages !
As it creeps along the closed passages of the eyes , it equals with its joy the sweetness of love .
Morpheus draws into the mind a gentle wind inclining the ripe harvest , the murmur of rills along glistening courses of sand , the circling movement of the beasts of the mill , which in sleep steal the sight from our eyes .
After the pleasurable interchange of love , the brain matter is fatigued .
By reason of this the eyes , swimming in the barque of the lids , darken in a strange and novel way .
Oh , how blessed is the passage from love to sleep , but sweeter the return to love !
Steam wells forth from the exultant belly and bedews the three cells of the brain .
Here it wreathes the eyes as they droop in sleep and fills the lids with its fumes , so that the sight may not journey far .
So the physical powers , which appear stronger in their service , bind the eyes .
It is sweet to relax under the lovely foliage of a tree to the plaintive song of the nightingale .
But it is sweeter to sport on the grass with a beautiful maiden .
If the scent of mingled plants breathes forth , if rose petals provide a couch , once the wearying intercourse of love is over it is sweet to win the nurture of sleep as it seeps into our languid bodies .
In what depths does the mind of the unstable lover shift !
Loves army is like a ship without an anchor , wandering over the sea , wavering hesitant between hope and fear .
Translated by P.G. Walsh
( Love Poems from the Carmina Burana , 1993 )
When Diane rises and lights
Her crystalline lamp ,
She is kindled
By the shine of her rosy brothers .
A delightful Western breeze lifts
Away the gray clouds from all couples 
Loosening the chords of the heart ;
Inclining it
Toward the vow of love .
Once the star of the night
Loses its radiance ,
Joy is transformed
Into passions sleepy dew .
Oh !
How sleep is the fertile
Antidote to storms and cares !
When sleep opens itself
To the gates of the eyes ,
It brings ecstasy equal to love .
Morpheus draws the dreams of the mind
Into the winds lightness 
From fields of ripe corn ,
The river murmurs
With its sand ,
While the mill wheel turns .
Then he steals
The sleep from
The light in our eyes .
After the seductive interlude of love ,
Fatigue sweeps the minds essence .
In this place
Our eyes swim and grow dark .
Oh !
How good is the passage
From love to slumber ,
But sweeter still is loves return .
Beneath the foliage of trees ,
Resting to the song
Of the nightingale is sweet .
Even sweeter is
Playing in the grass
With your love .
If the diverse scents
Of plants and herbs
Drift in the air ,
And there is a bed of roses
To nourish a delightful sleep ,
It is grasped
By the weary
When the interchange
Of love is exhausted .
Oh !
How the great diversity
Of loves spirit
Sways to and fro .
As we journey
On a raft
Without an anchor ,
We fluctuate
Between the vacillating
Hopes and fears
Of love .

Eight translations of an anonymous Latin song from the Carmina Burana .
The quality of this poem ( in the original Latin ) is such that some scholars have speculated that it , along with a few others in the Carmina Burana manuscript , may have been written by Peter Abelard ( who was reputed to have written superlative love poems in his youth , though none are known to have survived ) .
