Jon Stewart on ' The O'Reilly Factor ' : ' I 'm just happy to be in the major leagues '
UPDATED
The Daily Show type TV Show network Comedy Central genre Talk Show
Jon Stewart told Bill O’Reilly on The O’Reilly Factor that the Factor host has “ become the sanest voice ” on the Fox News Channel , adding , “ That ’s like being the thinnest kid at fat camp . ”
Fending off playful insults by O’Reilly such as “ A lotta people do n’t think you ’re smart , ” Stewart was far from combative .
He was in self - deprecating mode : “ I ’m just happy to be playing in the big leagues , ” said Stewart , mocking but implicitly acknowledging Fox ’s big ratings lead over his Comedy Central perch .
Anyone looking for a brawl here — or even moderately exciting television — would be disappointed .
Pressed by O’Reilly to explain what he thinks are President Obama ’s strengths and weaknesses , Stewart gave long , nuanced answers ; just the kind of stuff that does n’t go over well on a slam - bang show such as O’Reilly ’s .
Talking about how Fox “ sells the clearest narrative ” and that O’Reilly and his boss Roger Ailes ’ greatest achievement has been “ to mainstream conservative talk radio ” was correct , but it did n’t engage O’Reilly .
The “ sanest voice ” comment early on suggested that Stewart had actually chosen the wrong Fox News show to appear on ; the object of his greatest irritation and disbelief these days is Glenn Beck , not O’Reilly .
Stewart chuckled appreciatively when O’Reilly described the Daily Show audience as “ stoned slackers who love Obama , ” admiring Bill ’s comic exaggeration .
Since Stewart himself invoked Muhammad Ali — when O’Reilly waved his arm near Stewart ’s face , the comedian said , “ You ’ve got Ali ’s reach ! ” — I ’ll put this in boxing terms : Stewart opted for the rope - a - dope and you ’d have to give O’Reilly the decision .
I ca n’t even say TKO , because technically , neither laid a glove on the other .
UPDATE : On Thursday night , O’Reilly asked Stewart if he was Jewish and Stewart said , “ What gave it away ? ” Bill asked Jon to be his Vice Presidential running - mate ( because they ’re both so independent , don’ tcha know ) , but Stewart said he had college pictures of himself that would disqualify him from even so much as “ working in a post office . ”
In other words , the love - fest just continued .

Two Miami Beach police officers harassed a gay man who saw them abusing a suspect , according to the ACLU .
Unfortunately for them , they did n't realize he was on the phone with the 911 dispatcher at the time the cops came at him , hurling anti-gay epithets .
As the gay man , a tourist from L.A. named Harold Strickland , reported the call the officers came at him , finally grabbing his cell phone .
The Miami Herald reports :
" A few seconds later , the line went dead .
Strickland later told the ACLU that Forte and Hazzi grabbed his cellphone and disconnected the call .
' The officers then told Strickland : ' We know what you 're doing here .
We 're sick of all the f—ing fags in the neighborhood . '
The officers pushed Strickland to the ground and tied his hands behind his back , ' [ Robert F. Rosenwald Jr. , director of the ACLU Florida's
Lesbian - Gay - Bisexual - Transgender Advocacy Project ] wrote in an ACLU letter delivered Wednesday to Miami Beach Mayor Matti Herrera Bower . '
While Strickland was on the ground , the officers continued to spew anti-gay epithets .
They called him a ' f — ing fag ' and told him he was going to `get it good in jail . ''
Bower and City Manager Jorge Gonzalez also declined to comment . "
The officers are still on duty and the subject of an internal investigation .
Rosenwald said the harassment of gay men by the police has been happening in Miami Beach " for a long time . "

At one point or another , we ’ve all been told that it ’s rude to stare .
It ’s a fundamental rule of a good upbringing .
But imagine wandering around the streets of Tokyo , this time of year , fully exposed to the relentless so - called “ Christmas Spirit ” and the cacophony of the overabundant stores that threaten to drown you in fake snow and glitter .
Out of the blue , you miraculously land in an oasis of serenity , a safe haven amongst the utter chaos .
The display is almost empty baring one and only installation .
And you find yourself unable to do anything but stare , or gaze if you prefer –it ’s just semantics– , because what lies before your eyes is the epitome of unadulterated beauty .

There is a scarf suspended in front of a screen that shows a woman blowing gently creating the illusion that she actually causes the garment ’s mesmerizing movement .
Then you look up and realise that you have reached Maison Hermès Japan , and the significance of the strategically placed iconic garment , the Hermès Scarf , sinks in .
The sight is simple yet absolutely captivating , and manages to showcase the design of the scarf to perfection without a hint of flamboyance .

After all , if Hermès ca n’t achieve perfection then who can ?
The mastermind behind this beauty of an installation is none other than the renowned Japanese designer , Tokujin Yoshioka , who describes the train of thought that led to this creation , “ On designing a window - display of Maison Hermès , I intended to express people ’s daily ‘ movements ’ with a suspicion of humour .
Image Courtesy of Hermès // 2004
There are moments when I perceive a hidden presence of a person in the movements born naturally in daily life .
I created a design where one can perceive someone behind the scarves as if life were being breathed into them .
The window is designed with an image of woman projected on to a monitor .
The scarf softly sways in the air in response to the woman ’s blow . ”
We can only marvel at his ability to breathe meaning and life through the act of brilliant simplicity , and hope that he will continue to amaze us with such exquisite installations .
Truth be told , we would love to see what he can come up with in regards to a certain , “ beloved ” Birkin bag !
The installation which is based on a window display the designer presented in 2004 can be seen until January 19 , 2010 .

Michigan Town
One of the Happiest Places in the U.S. Holland , Michigan Tops Honolulu on Well - Being Index .
Feb. 17 , 2010  --
When you think of happy places in America , a few names always top the list : Boulder , Colo .
is known for its fresh mountain air and its healthy outdoor lifestyle .
Honolulu , with its lush tropical locale , is another city that needs no explanation for why its residents are so happy .
Both of these places ranked high on the 2009 Gallup - Healthways Well - Being Index , released by the Gallup Group .
Boulder topped the list , while Honolulu came in third .
But coming in a surprising second between these two shoe - in cities is Holland , Michigan -- a city on the blistering cold outposts of one of the poorest states in the union .
" If a small community located in the state with the worst economy can feel good about itself , seems to me we 've got hope in the country , " Mayor Kurt Dykstra said .
The rankings were based on more than 353,000 interviews with Americans who were asked questions about all aspects of their lives including their physical and emotional well - being , healthy behaviors , work environment , and community .
' City of Churches '
Arrive in town and ask the 35,000 residents why they 're so happy and religion is the first answer .
" Our churches have a lot of good , caring folks in them that are like family to us , " Mary van Heuvelen , a Holland resident , said .
Known as the " City of Churches , " Holland has 170 places of worship and even a college named Hope .
The churches form an informal network that gets practical help to people who can use a helping hand .
" If you need gas for the week I 've heard of several churches that will give you gas cards and help you through , " Charles Bullock , who is unemployed , said .
Radio host , Juke Van Oss , added , " If people are out of work we try to help them in some way -- if they are our neighbors we try to steer something their way .
Culture of Giving
The town is also very proud of its generous philanthropy .
Despite its 16 percent unemployment rate , Holland has over 100 volunteer - based service organizations fanned out through the city .
This is an extraordinary number for such a small town , according to Linda Jacobs , executive director of Good Samaritan Ministries .
Holland along with a few other nearby towns in Western Michigan were recently named the second most generous region in the country by the Chronicle of Philanthropy , right after Salt Lake City , Utah .
Community Spirit
" There 's a great community spirit .
And at the end of the day , people are very optimistic that Holland , as a community , will survive and thrive , " Dykstra said .
That sentiment is echoed by Cheryl Koeman , who owns the Good Earth Café with her husband .
" My husband and I traveled a fair amount around the country , and Holland has something that we very rarely find in other places in the country .
It 's a sense of community , a sense of acceptance -- making people feel like they are special , " she said .
The Norman Rockwell Life
Think of Holland as a real city still living in a Norman Rockwell version of a small town .
Residents here know that solutions to problems are not found in the maze of ideas that come out of Washington , but from the rewards that come from caring about their neighbors .
The Dutch , who founded this city 163 years ago , have a word for this -- gezellig -- which translate to ' close - knit community . '

On Tuesday the President discussed the upcoming bipartisan meeting on health reform , saying " Let 's get the relevant parties together ; let 's put the best ideas on the table .
My hope is that we can find enough overlap that we can say this is the right way to move forward , even if I do n't get every single thing that I want . "
Moments ago the invite ( pdf ) was sent out from Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius – here is the full text :
Dear Speaker Pelosi , Senator Reid , Senator McConnell , and Representative Boehner :
We are writing to ask that you join President Obama for a bipartisan meeting at the Blair House on February 25 to discuss health reform legislation .
We have seen again in recent days that when it comes to health care , the status quo is unsustainable and unacceptable .
The proof is right in front of us : just last week , a major insurer , Anthem Blue Cross , announced plans to increase premiums for many of its policyholders in California by as much as 39 percent on March 1 .
As the President noted this week , if we do n’t act on comprehensive health insurance reform , this enormous rate hike will be " just a preview of coming attractions .
Premiums will continue to rise for folks with insurance ; millions more will lose their coverage altogether ; our deficits will continue to grow larger . "
Now is the time to act on behalf of the millions of Americans and small businesses who are counting on meaningful health insurance reform .
In the last year , there has been an extraordinary effort to craft effective legislation .
There have been hundreds of hours of committee hearings and mark - ups in both the House of Representatives and Senate , with nearly all of those sessions televised on C - SPAN .
The Senate spent over 160 hours on the Senate floor considering health insurance reform legislation and , for the first time in history , both the House of Representatives and Senate have approved comprehensive health reform legislation .
This is the closest our Nation has been to resolving this issue in the nearly 100 years that it has been debated .
The Blair House meeting is the next step in this process .
The session will begin at 10:00 a.m. and be broadcast live in its entirety .
Although it is impossible to include every House Member or Senator who has played a pivotal role in the health care debate , the President is inviting the most senior House / Senate bipartisan leadership , as well as the chairmen and ranking members of the committees that oversee health insurance reform legislation in both chambers .
A complete list of this group is attached .
The President would like each of you to designate an additional four Members to attend the meeting and be available to participate .
It is also important that each of you have one staff member specializing in health care policy in the meeting .
We will have a representative from the Office of Management and Budget to provide technical assistance , and hope that representatives from the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation will also be able to attend .
In addition to the President , attending and participating on behalf of the Administration will be the Vice President , Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , and Nancy - Ann DeParle , Director of the Office of Health Reform .
The President will offer opening remarks at the beginning of the meeting , followed by remarks from a Republican leader chosen by the Republican leadership and a Democratic leader chosen by the Democratic leadership .
The President will then open and moderate discussion on four critical topics : insurance reforms , cost containment , expanding coverage , and the impact health reform legislation will have on deficit reduction .
Since this meeting will be most productive if information is widely available before the meeting , we will post online the text of a proposed health insurance reform package .
This legislation would put a stop to insurance company abuses , extend coverage to millions of Americans , get control of skyrocketing premiums and out - of - pocket costs , and reduce the deficit .
It is the President ’s hope that the Republican congressional leadership will also put forward their own comprehensive bill to achieve those goals and make it available online as well .
As the President said earlier this week :
I ’m looking forward to a constructive debate with plans that need to be measured against this test :
Does it bring down costs for all Americans as well as for the Federal Government , which spends a huge amount on health care ?
Does it provide adequate protection against abuses by the insurance industry ?
Does it make coverage affordable and available to the tens of millions of working Americans who do n't have it right now ?
And does it help us get on a path of fiscal sustainability ?
These are priorities that we all share , and the President is looking forward to examining with you and your colleagues how we can best achieve the most effective reform possible .
Sincerely ,
Rahm Emanuel
Assistant to the President
Kathleen Sebelius
Secretary of Health and Human Services

The dog is said to be a Jack Russell
The excited pet dog of a German man on the run from the law led police to his master 's hiding place in a cupboard , police in the west of the country say .
When officers called at his flat in Euskirchen , near Cologne , the door was opened by an acquaintance of the missing man who was holding the dog .
The acquaintance said he did not know where the owner was .
But when the dog was set down , it led police to the cupboard , where it stood expectantly with its tail wagging .
Officers who opened the cupboard , which was just a metre ( 3ft 3 in ) high and 80 cm ( 2ft 6 in ) wide , found the fugitive " hunched up inside " .
A police spokesman did not say what offence the man was being sought in connection with but told AFP news agency it was " not a capital crime " .
Neither the name of the suspect , 52 , nor that of the pet was given but , according to AFP , the dog was a Jack Russell terrier .
A hero legislator in Virginia 's House of Delegates sponsored a bill that finally bans the practice of forcibly implanting microchips in humans .
Delegate Mark Cole ( R - Fredericksburg ) is not some mere privacy advocate : he is saving us from the antichrist .
Not since " Jim DeMint 's grandchildren build an igloo to prove that Al Gore is stoopid " ( earlier today ! ) has one piece of mid-Atlantic region local news so succinctly explained just how far this nation of idiot children has regressed .
Cole — no theologian , he admits !— believes that microchips that no one has ever proposed forcibly implanting in humans will turn out to be the " Mark of the Beast " spoken of in the Book of Revelations — generally the most important biblical book for your average fundamentalist Christian , as it elides the gay neighbor - loving shit and the " camel through a needle 's eye " socialism for Michael Bay special effects and fiery vengeance against the heathens .
So today the Virginia House of Delegates banned this nonexistent practice , thus averting ( for now ! ) the End Times .
Please remember , an elected Republican from Virginia said these words :
" I just think you should have the right to control your own body , " Cole said .
He may not necessarily believe that this right extends to a woman 's uterus , but The Founders certainly meant to protect us from Lucifer 's Tiny Computers .
Oddly , at least one legislator thought this whole thing was a waste of time !
Others dismissed the legislation , calling it a sideshow as lawmakers grapple with a huge budget gap .
" We 've got a $ 4 billion hole , and we 're spending time on microchips , " said Del. Albert C. Pollard Jr. ( D - Northumberland ) .
" At least when Nero fiddled , they got good music . "
And that 's how we came to live in a world where you are n't allowed to press charges if you were gangraped while working for a military contractor but they sure as shit were n't allowed to put a DEVIL CHIP IN YOUR NECK LIKE IN THE X -FILES .

Josh Harris created an underground bunker for 100 hedonistic artists - and filmed them
For a man described as the " internet entrepreneur you 've never heard of " , Josh Harris has led an extraordinarily public life .
As an internet pioneer he took webcam surveillance to the extreme , becoming what many called the " Warhol of the web " .
His story is now part of an award - winning documentary film , We Live in Public .
After setting up analyst firm Jupiter , he went on to found Pseudo.com , one of the web 's first webcam portals .
Then , after making millions in the 1990s dotcom boom , he gathered 100 artists and moved them into an underground bunker on the eve of the new millennium for a project called Quiet : We Live in Public .
The new big problem is loss of self , or loss of individuality .
Josh Harris
Listen to Josh Harris on Digital Planet Fitted with many cameras , the artists ' every move - sex , fights , drug - taking - were recorded and broadcast online - until New York police shut the operation down .
Next , Harris fitted cameras in his own home , including in the bedroom , bathroom and toilet .
For six months , every detail of his life , and that of his girlfriend , Tanya Corrin , was captured and broadcast live while Harris interacted with fans in a chatroom .
During that six months , his girlfriend left him , his multi-million fortune was destroyed when the dotcom bubble burst , and he had a mental breakdown - all on camera .
Facing financial ruin , he retreated to an apple farm in upstate New York before heading to Ethiopia , where he now runs the broadcast company African Entertainment Network .
Big Brother anarchy
As the film begins to show at selected cinemas in the UK , Harris spoke to BBC World Service 's Digital Planet about the bunker project , privacy and a changing media world .
" It was ahead of its time and , unlike the television show [ Big Brother ] which was a facsimile of living in public , we actually were living in public and the audience was not just watching - they were literally in our heads and doing things in our lives that we did n't necessarily control . "
DIGITAL PLANET Digital Planet is the weekly technology programme broadcast from the BBC World Service
It is broadcast on Tuesday at 1232GMT and repeated at 1632GMT , 2032GMT and on Wednesday at 0032GMT
It is also available as a podcast
It can be found on the social networks Facebook and Orkut He believes his experiment was prophetic , pre-empting a time when the internet has become the most influential form of media .
" We 're just on the cusp where netcasting , or internet television , is the most powerful medium that man has even invented , " he said .
" The leap is exponential - it 's not incremental . "
" Google is now the most powerful medium on the face of the earth . "
Unsurprisingly for a man who decided to allow anyone to watch his every move , Harris disregards any concept of privacy .
" In my experience , I think privacy is gone .
" The new big problem is loss of self , or loss of individuality . "
Harris ' next project is a return to voyeur experimentation .
" I 'm going to build a facility where pop stars live on set , and all they do all day long is watch people in their homes .

For a while now , I have been wondering how a Phantom Grip Limited Slip open differential conversion works .
I have read often enough on Honda - Tech.com about how “ Phantom Grip LSD ’s do n’t work ” or “ cause excessive metal shavings in the transmission oil ” , and other horror stories .
Never the less , lots of people are lured into buying them because “ they are so much cheaper than a normal LSD ” .
Well , after reading this post on Honda - Tech , I decided to write this entry to study the problem and document the thought process .
Hopefully you will understand the fundamentals of how a Phantom Grip Limited Slip insert works by the end of this article , and will be able to decide for yourself whether it is worth the money .
For this explanation to work , it helps to have some insight into how an LSD mystery box works .
In this case , we will discuss a clutch - type LSD since this is the style of LSD the Phantom Grip purports to be closest to .
But first , a picture for reference :
Powered by Adsense Deluxe Revived
A Clutch - Type Limited slip differential works by using a high friction clamping surface ( orange in color ) , sometimes many plates with high friction surfaces , to resist independent motion of the gears fixed to the axles ( in green ) , and thus causes the front wheels to spin at the same speed .
This independent motion can be caused by driving through a corner , where the outside wheel spins faster than the inside wheel , or often also by torque steer .
If you go into a hard left corner , the left side axle ( in black , attached to the green ) will be spinning slow with not very much load on it , and the right side will be spinning faster with lots of load on it .
This causes the clutch friction material on the left side to break free and rotate the pressure ring gear on the left side at the same rate as the pressure ring gear on the right side , but since the gear fixed to the axle on the left side is not attached directly to the pressure ring gear on the left , it simply overcomes the friction material ’s resistance , and is allowed to spin .
Torque steer is particularly common in front wheel drive cars , where one drive axle is longer than the other , causing different amounts of torque to be applied to each wheel .
This high friction surface still allows the wheels to turn independently of each other , but is not nearly as willing to allow this because the high clamping force imparted on the friction surface by the internal springs ( baby blue color ) of the differential .
This willingness to spin both sides at different rates in the clutch type differential is significantly less than the willingness to allow both sides to spin at a different rate that an open differential normally allows .
The consequence is that if you do a burnout in a open differential car , and turn the wheel slightly , you may end up with one wheel of fury , while the other wheel is just hanging out .
The clutch type differential can help greatly in using the traction of both tires during a burnout , even at a higher than 0 degree steering angle , and it is all thanks to the calibration of the clutch friction material and the pressure exerted on the pressure ring gears by the clutch pressure ring springs .
Careful engineering is performed to find a good balance between friction surface area and spring strength , so the differential is not locked all the time , but not so weak that it acts as an open differential .
Next , a diagram of a stock Honda FWD differential with the “ Phantom Grip Limited Slip ” insert :
As you can see from the diagrams , right off the bat , calling a Phantom Grip insert a clutch type differential is not entirely true , because there is no clutch friction material ( orange in color , diagram 1 ) as there is in a normal clutch type differential .
In fact , there are several parts that appear absent in comparing diagrams 1 and 2 .
You may also note that the clutch type LSD has pressure ring gears ( brown in color , diagram 1 ) driven by the planetary gear system ( purple in color , diagrams 1 and 2 ) , where as the Phantom Grip planetary gears are simply the planetary gears provided by the OEM manufacturer of the open diff .
This brings the next question :
If the Phantom Grip has no clutch friction material , and the pressure ring component is a gear already being driven directly by the planetary gear system , then how does it work ?
It appears that the Phantom Grip Limited Slip insert is only capable of providing friction on the gears driving the axles , which attempts to keep the wheels moving at the same speed .
It is important to note that the springs ( baby blue in color ) in both diagrams are providing some large force in the direction of the gears connected to the axles .
In a normal clutch type differential , this force increases the clamping force of the clutch plates much in the same way as a higher clamping load clutch helps a high horsepower car ’s clutch not slip when the clutch is dumped .
The Phantom Grip Limited Slip insert is imparting force via a spring in the same manner , but that clamping force is being exerted on the gear hub and the face of the axle gears !
There is no friction material , and no set of flat side gears for a friction surface at all .
In fact the total friction surface area provided by the stock open diff , all together , is probably less than 1 inch square .
Unless the springs in the device provide tens of thousands of psi of force , it is unlikely that this device would do anything at all .
This is astonishing !
A quick look at an installed Phantom Grip Limited Slip insert shows how small the axle gear to limited slip insert contact surface must be .

Diagram 3 above makes a big case for what shows up below .
You notice that in the gears that are attached to the axle , the gears are sloped downward , while the Phantom Grip plate is flat .
You will also note that the contact patch is a steel gear to aluminum or steel Phantom Grip plate contact , which when covered in transmission oil , ca n’t possible impart that much friction on the axle gears , even with monster springs .
In the following picture , Diagram 4 , you can see that the theoretical surface area of contact for the Phantom Grip limited slip insert on the tapered gear that is fixed to the axle in green is miniscule .
The drawing below is not to scale in any sort of way , so the angle of contact may be more or less shallow , but it illustrates just how much different the Phantom Grip Limited Slip insert is from a real Clutch Type limited slip .
It may now be obvious how metal shavings will most likely wind up in your oil using the Phantom Grip .
The friction plate of the device itself is resting on gears that do n’t necessarily spin incredibly fast or for long periods of time , but they do spin , and over time , it is easy to see how the friction plate of the Phantom Grip may be worn down due to the tiny contact patch and heavy load on that patch .
Real clutch type LSD ’s have wearing issues of their own , but are engineered from the beginning for the purpose of acting as a clutch .
So with that , we come to the end of this post .
A few unknowns are left for me to ponder , such as the actual , real contact area the Phantom grip has in a normal Honda open diff , and also what exactly the spring pressure is in the limited slip insert .
These factors can make a difference in how well the device works , but in my opinion , this short explanation is enough for me to determine that I will absolutely spend the extra $ 400 or $ 500 for a real clutch type or helical LSD over the Phantom Grip Limited Slip insert .

The Georgian luger killed at the Winter Olympics on Friday had told his father that he feared the lightning - quick track in Whistler .
In a call home shortly before he was thrown from his luge on a fast corner , Nodar Kumaritashvili told his father : " Dad , I really fear that curve , ' "
The news came soon after it emerged that the authorities have been considering an 85 mph speed limit for new tracks .
The record speed at Whistler is 95 mph .
David Kumaritashvili , a former luger himself , told the Associated Press that he told his son to " just take a slower start " .
" But [ Nodar ] responded , ' Dad , what kind of thing you are teaching me ?
I have come to the Olympics to try to win . ' "
Nodar , 21 , died during practice , when he lost control and slammed into a trackside steel pole at nearly 90 miles an hour .
" I have n't and I wo n't see that footage [ of the accident ] , " his father said .
" I still can't fully realise that he 's dead . "
His face lined and shoulders bent in anguish , David Kumaritashvili paused to recall details of one of his last conversations with his son .
" He told me , ' I will either win or die , ' " he said .
" But that was youthful bravado : he could n't be seriously talking about death . "
Concerns about the course had been raised before practice began .
There were worries that the C$ 100 million - plus venue was too technically demanding , and that only the host nation 's sliders would have had enough practice time to adapt .
" They tested that track on my son , " David Kumaritashvili said .
In a joint statement , the luge federation and Vancouver Olympic officials blamed the accident on the athlete , saying Kumaritashvili was late coming out of the next - to - last turn and failed to compensate .
His 46 - year - old father angrily rejected this .
" My son was training since he was 14 , he ran tracks in France , Austria and Canada , and he never suffered an injury , " said the former luge champion of the Soviet Union .
The Georgian president Mikhail Saakashvili has also criticised the organisers , saying that an athlete 's mistake should n't result in his death .
It has also emerged that a speed limit for new luge tracks had been discussed shortly before the fatal crash , according to the Wall Street Journal .
The paper quotes the president of the International Luge Federation as saying : " We discussed a speed limit before the tragic events because we had the experience that the speeds were always getting higher . "
Josef Fendt added that discussions had centred on a limit at future luge tracks of 85 miles an hour .
Fendt insisted that the Whistler track was safe , even though the speed record is 95 mph , or 10 mph higher than the federation 's proposed limit .
Fendt said the run was supposed to have a top speed of 87 mph , which is why the federation did not address it .
He admitted that many lugers were " surprised " at the higher speeds , which he attributed to the unpredictability of designing runs and to advances in technology and technique .
" There 's more to it than just the track , " he said .
The Georgian president has promised Kumaritashvili's family that his body will be flown home as quickly as formalities allow .
No date has yet been set for the funeral .
We like to think that in days gone by , the young venerated the elderly .
But that was n’t always so .
In “ As You Like It , ” Shakespeare ’s morose character , Jaques , calls old age “ second childishness and mere oblivion . ”
Walt Whitman hoped that the tedium and pettiness of his senior years would not infect his poetry .
Developmental psychologists , when they treated old age at all , often regarded it as a period of withdrawal .
The elderly slowly separate themselves from the world .
They can not be expected to achieve new transformations .
“ About the age of fifty , ” Freud wrote , “ the elasticity of the mental processes on which treatment depends is , as a rule , lacking .
Old people are no longer educable . ”
Well , that was wrong .
Over the past few years , researchers have found that the brain is capable of creating new connections and even new neurons all through life .
While some mental processes  like working memory and the ability to quickly solve math problems  clearly deteriorate , others do not .
Older people retain their ability to remember emotionally nuanced events .
They are able to integrate memories from their left and right hemispheres .
Their brains reorganize to help compensate for the effects of aging .
A series of longitudinal studies , begun decades ago , are producing a rosier portrait of life after retirement .
These studies do n’t portray old age as surrender or even serenity .
They portray it as a period of development  and they ’re not even talking about über - oldsters jumping out of airplanes .
Opponents of California ’s ban on gay marriage are using an anti-gay activist ’s claims against him in a landmark gay marriage trial taking place in San Francisco .
Lawyers working to have Proposition 8 — California ’s ban on gay marriage — overturned as unconstitutional played a videotape of William Tam , a leading proponent of Proposition 8 , arguing that allowing gay marriage would lead to the legalization of sex with children .

Opponents of Prop 8 , who launched the constitutional challenge , are using Tam ’s comments “ to buttress the contention that Proposition 8 is unconstitutional because it was fueled by deep - seated animosity against gays , ” reports the Associated Press .
Earlier this week , as the trial got underway , Tam asked to have himself removed from the case , in which he was acting as a defendant .
( Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and state Attorney General Jerry Brown , who are named as the defendants in the lawsuit , declined to defend Prop 8 , leaving the court to appoint Prop 8 backers as defendants . )
Tam , one of the principal mobilizers of the movement to pass Proposition 8 , had argued that he wanted out because the publicity surrounding the case was endangering him and his family .
” In the past I have received threats on my life , had my property vandalized and am recognized on the streets due to my association with Proposition 8 , ” Tam told the court .
” Now that the subject lawsuit is going to trial , I fear I will get more publicity , be more recognizable and that the risk of harm to me and my family will increase . ”
But blogger Timothy Kincaid , writing at Box Turtle Bulletin , did n’t believe that explanation , and argued that Tam ’s decision to withdraw had everything to do with his prior statements that gay marriage would lead to legalized child rape .

[ Tam ’s ] concerns about being recognized did n’t seem to have dissuaded Bill Tam from giving interviews and making videos and participating in debates during the campaign .
And the worrisome issues did n’t give him enough concern to keep him from petitioning the court in May 2009 to be added as a defendant .
And Tam provides no instances since May in which anyone recognizing him has been anything other than “ friendly ” .
Kincaid pointed to news reports that Tam had sent a letter to his supporters in which he outlined the “ disastrous consequences ” of gay marriage to California .
“ One by one , other states would fall into Satan ’s hands , ” Tam reportedly wrote .
“ Every child , when growing up , would fantasize marrying someone of the same sex .
More children would become homosexuals . ”

Lawyers challenging Prop 8 played a video of a deposition Tam gave the court in December during the testimony of Yale law professor George Chauncey , who is testifying in favor of gay marriage .
In the deposition , Tam describes the letter he sent out linking gay marriage to child sex .
The San Jose Mercury - News live blog of the trial reports that Chauncey said Tam ’s letter “ is consistent in tone with a much larger history of anti-gay rhetoric . ”

Lawyers for Prop 8 supporters argued that homosexuals do not need to be protected from discrimination because the US has become more tolerant towards gays and other minorities .
“ The bottom line is that there has been a significant shift in public opinion toward acceptance of gay rights , correct ? ” Prop 8 lawyer David Thompson asked , as quoted at the Mercury - News blog .
“ There has been a shift in public opinion and growing support for gay people , and gay people continue to encounter enormous hostility , ” Chauncey replied .
Over six months ago , Google announced it would start phasing out support for Internet Explorer 6 on Orkut and YouTube , and started pushing its users to modern browsers .
The search giant has now given a specific kill date for old browser support on the video website via a page on Google.com titled Solve a Problem : Upgrading your browser :
Support stops on March 13th .
Stopped support essentially means that some future features on YouTube will be rolled out that wo n't work in older browsers .
As you can see in the screenshot above , YouTube will have an interstitial appear when users on older browser try to watch a video on YouTube .
Google says the interstitial will show up indefinitely every two weeks until the user upgrades to the most recent version of their browser .
Google deems anything below IE7 , Firefox 3.0 , Chrome 4.0 , and Safari 3.0 as an " older browser . "
Users on these browsers will still be able to watch YouTube videos , but additional features that Google plans to roll out may not be supported in these older browsers .
Late last month , Google announced it will end old browser support for Google Docs and Google Sites on March 1 , 2010 and earlier this month , the company announced it would start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar by year end .
Google is pushing both enterprise and consumer users towards newer browsers on all its Web properties .
Google 's stance on IE6 varies from Microsoft 's because the search giant does not need to support Windows XP , the operating system with which IE6 first shipped , as long as Redmond ( which will support XP and IE6 until April 8 , 2014 ) .
Microsoft , on the other hand , which has stated time and time again that it wants to see IE6 disappear as much as anyone else , refuses to force anyone to upgrade ( though it 's worth noting that the software giant 's Office Web Apps wo n't support IE6 either , just like Google Docs ) and says the decision is ultimately up to the user .
Microsoft is trying to push users to upgrade by touting IE8's many features over IE6 , particularly in the area of security .
So far , this has worked relatively well , as IE8 is the most popular browser , although IE6 is still used by about 20 percent of surfers worldwide , according to NetApplications .

Advertisement A coup has taken place in Niger and the president has been captured after a gun battle in the capital , Niamey .
In a televised announcement , a spokesman for the plotters said Niger 's constitution had been suspended and all state institutions dissolved .
The junta imposed a curfew and closed the country 's borders .
President Mamadou Tandja , in power for more than a decade in the uranium - rich nation , is believed to be in captivity at a military barracks .
Reports say government ministers are also being held .
Tensions have been growing in the country since last August , when Mr Tandja changed the constitution to allow him to stay in power beyond his legal term limit .
The move provoked a political crisis and threw Niger into isolation - regional grouping Ecowas ( Economic Community Of West African States ) suspending its membership .
Poverty , deception A spokesman for the coup leaders said the country was now being led by a group called the Supreme Council for the Restoration of Democracy ( CSRD ) .
He called on the people of Niger to " remain calm and stay united around the ideals postulated by the CSRD ... [ to ] make Niger an example of democracy and good governance " .
AT THE SCENE Idy Baraou
BBC News , Niamey
The exchange of gunfire has been between soldiers but it is confusing and one cannot tell one side from another .
I saw tanks being fired and soldiers on the streets using machine guns .
The area near the presidential palace is where the business of government takes place and at least four military barracks are based there .
People have fled the area and some civil servants have locked themselves inside their offices .
Earlier , smoke could be seen from the roof of the office where President Mamadou Tandja was holding his cabinet meeting .
" We call on national and international opinions to support us in our patriotic action to save Niger and its population from poverty , deception and corruption , " he added .
The BBC's Idy Baraou in Niamey says despite the curfew , people have gone to mosques and shops as normal .
He says there is not an obvious military presence on the streets , but heavy artillery has been deployed around the presidential palace .
The African Union has condemned the takeover saying coups were contrary to the AU 's vision of a continent free of unconstitutional changes of government .
But one opposition leader , Mahamadou Karijo , welcomed the coup and praised the soldiers as " honest patriots " .
" They behave like they say - they are not interested in political leadership , they will fight to save the Nigerien people from any kind of tyranny , " he told the BBC's Network Africa .
Huge investment Soldiers captured Mr Tandja while he was chairing his weekly cabinet meeting , a government source told the BBC .
Profile : Mamadou Tandja
The government and opposition have been holding on - off talks since December - mediated by the regional body Ecowas - to try to resolve the country 's political crisis .
Mr Tandja , a former army officer , was first voted into office in 1999 and was returned to power in an election in 2004 .
Niger has experienced long periods of military rule since independence from France in 1960 .
It is one of the world 's poorest countries , but Mr Tandja 's supporters argue that his decade in power has brought a measure of economic stability .
Under his tenure , the French energy firm Areva has begun work on the world 's second - biggest uranium mine - ploughing an estimated $ 1.5 bn into the project .
China National Petroleum Corporation signed a $ 5 bn deal in 2008 to pump oil within three years .

At first , he doubted the claim of digital quality , so the peddler popped a copy into a portable player .
“ I said , ‘ Wow , ’ ” Mr. Sanchez recalled .
Hepaid $ 5 and took the disc home .

After watching it with the grandchildren , he made a copy on his computer and posted it on megaupload , where his screen name is “ SkillyGilly , ” so others could share in the fun and he could get props in the movie - loving community .
He ignored a friend ’s warnings 
“ You ’re going to get in trouble ; it ’s not even out yet ”  and watched as several other copies surfaced on the site .
At 5 a .m. the next day , that friend called and told him to turn on the TV .
“ Fox News is in an uproar for the leak of ‘ Wolverine , ’ ” Mr. Sanchez recalled .
“ They ’re offering a reward . ”
By then , he said , his copy of the movie had been downloaded 198 times , at no charge .
He was scared , but did not imagine he would be blamed .
“ Some employee had it  ‘ Hey , take this down to graphics ’  and he stopped off and showed it to his friends , ” Mr. Sanchez said .
“ They made more copies , more copies , until the Koreans had a copy . ”
Two weeks later , the F.B.I. showed up , having tracked “ SkillyGilly ” through computer footprints .
Mr. Sanchez said he explained what had happened .
“ Talk to the Korean , ” he said he told them .
“ You keep following leads and you ’ll get to a warehouse . ”
But when the F.B.I. asked if he could identify the peddler , he said no .
A few months later , agents took his computer , then returned it , he said .
Several months passed , and then the agents were back with an arrest warrant .
Wesley Hsu , an assistant United States attorney for the Central District of California , who is supervising the prosecution , said financial gain is not necessarily the sole motive for so - called pirates .
“ It ’s some sort of Internet prestige thing , ” Mr. Hsu said .
“ That ’s sort of how the culture works . ”
Mr. Sanchez , who speaks to rehabilitation groups 
“ I ’m Gilberto Sanchez , I ’ve been to jail , I ’ve been through this , I ’ve been through that ”  said he has no intention of fighting the charge .
“ I ca n’t say no , ” he said , pointing to his computer .
“ That ’s like DNA . ”

That ’s a sculpture you can see walking in the town square town Horsell Woking ( England ) .
This Tripod was designed by Michael Kondronom in 1998 , the height of the monument to a little over 23 feet .
The Martian machines in 1953 movie The War of the Worlds are drastically different from the ones in Wells ’ novel .
Instead of towering tripods , the Martian machines resemble sinister - looking manta rays with three electromagnetic legs , visible only when emerging from the pit made by their tapered oblate landing cylinder and later indirectly by their scorching effect on the ground .
Designed by Albert Nozaki , this machine is armed with a reddish Heat - Ray — once more in keeping with the novel — mounted atop in a gooseneck device incinerating anything the ray hits .

With all the attention focused on yesterday 's annual Clash of the Performance Enhanced Titans in Miami , it was easy to overlook the other star - studded exhibition taking place in town .
An event that , like the Super Bowl , boasted top - tier entertainment and a boisterous crowd while requiring little in the way of actual thought .
I 'm speaking , of course , about Governor Rick Perry 's " Super Sunday with Sarah Palin " rally at the Berry Center in Cypress .
If I 'm going to be charitable about it , I 'd say the center was filled to slightly over half its 8,500 - seat capacity .
Most of the rear of the arena was empty , as was about three - quarters of the floor , which had been sectioned off for presumably more teeming masses .
Speaking with some of those in attendance , it also became apparent that this number would have been dramatically lower without Palin 's presence .
Some folks had come from as far away as San Antonio and Austin to hear her speak .
I did n't ask how many were there to see Ted Nugent .
Attendees started filing in shortly after 1:30 .
They were welcomed by dozens of rally placards strategically placed in the stands -- presumably for those who'd left their own " Perry 2010 " signs at home -- and by numerous inspirational banners festooning the center .
My favorite -- which is in no way a play on an idiotic statement made last year by the Governor -- is below :
Even before the rally proper started , it became clear that the Republican Party is going to have to change up its game plan if it wants to stay in any way relevant to future politics .
In particular , they might want to consider diversifying themselves a bit musically .
Bumper songs consisting of country artists like Eric Church and country / rock artists like .38 Special tend to attract ... a certain demographic .
And for a group that gives lip service to being " inclusive " of all races and creeds , their soundtrack sure sounds like something played exclusively at the Bob 's Country Bunker .
I mean , I was n't the only person who commented that pretty much the only black people in attendance ( not counting Railroad Commisioner Michael Williams ) were Berry Center staff or highway patrolmen .
Senator Dan Patrick kicked off the festivities , opening with a crack about how if they'd had five more people in attendance , it would 've equaled the number of " czars Obama has in Washington . "
It never hurts to dredge up that old Cold War era hatred of all things Soviet ( or pre-Soviet , as the case may be ) , though someone will have to refresh my memory if Patrick and his ilk were similarly critical of George W. Bush ( or Ronald Reagan , or George H.W. Bush ) for their " czars " as well .
The rally continued with Aggie country singer Granger Smith ( in yet another display of canny strategizing , Perry and company seemed to expect everyone in attendance to be a Texas A&M graduate ) .
His set was mostly inoffensive , even if he sports the same baldness - concealing headgear favored by the lead singer of Survivor .
Patrick also introduced Perry appointee Texas Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman .
Because putting Latina judges on the bench is only pandering to a much - needed demographic when Obama does it .
I suppose they were going for that " down home " vibe , what with the Boy Scout troop presenting the colors and the marching band providing musical accompaniment , but the whole thing really just felt cheap and hastily thrown together .
And nothing demonstrated that better than Ted Nugent 's performance of the National Anthem , which was plagued by mic and feedback problems .
He soldiered gamely on , to the " delight " of Perry 's more staid supporters .
Finally , it was time to bring out the big guns .
Patrick introduced Rick Perry as someone who " loves life " and " believes in his 10th Amendment rights , " just in case the " Texas is Succeeding " joke went over our heads .
The two entered the center to much applause , with Perry going largely unnoticed as Palin gave handshakes and a few hugs to those lining their path .
Perry , all leer , wisely kept his comments short and let the woman everybody was there to see take the podium without forcing Piper to stand too long next to " Uncle Ted . "
Give Palin credit ; her anecdote about telling Piper that Texas is like " Alaska 's little brother " was n't met with a great deal of enthusiam , but she quickly won the crowd back by describing the two states ' similarities .
Namely , how Texas and Alaska both " proudly cling to our guns and religion . "
From there , she recited a litany of Perry talking points about budgetary successes while conveniently forgetting to mention the social programs gutted to make them possible , or about Texas ' dismal rankings in everything from education to teen pregnancy ( though apparently Palin does n't get too worked up about the latter ) .
She wrapped up with a few choice bon mots designed to give comfort to the aging Reaganites in the stands , praising " America 's exceptionalism " and expressing her belief that we 're still that " shining city on the hill . "
All that was left was for Perry to declare Palin an " honorary Texan " and everybody was free to go home and watch the big game .
" You can burn down my mansion anytime . "
For all of Palin 's admittedly deft manipulation of the crowd , I noticed a distinct lack of enthusiasm among the attendees for Perry himself .
The Governor , to his credit , knows he needs the help of the far right that Palin speaks to so ... eloquently if he 's going to prevent Debra Medina from siphoning off votes and beat Kay Bailey Hutchison for a third term .
Judging by the number of people loudly professing their love for Alaska's
ex -Governor , however , he better make sure he does n't ( se ) cede too much of the spotlight .

Google - Attacke : Chinas Hacker kamen durch die Hintertür
Bruce Schneier ist weltweit anerkannter Sicherheitsspezialist und kein Verschwörungstheoretiker .
In einem Beitrag für CNN wirft er der US - Regierung vor , die Backdoor für den erfolgreichen Angriff auf Google Mail selbst geschaffen zu haben .
Die wirkliche Nachricht ist laut Schneier nicht , dass chinesische Hacker sich in dieser Weise betätigen und ihre Angriffe höchst ausgeklügelt sind , ist es doch schon lange bekannt .
Viel bedeutsamer sei , dass die US - Regierung den Hackern unabsichtlich geholfen hat .
Denn Google habe ein Zugangssystem durch die Hintertür geschaffen zu den Accounts von Google Mail , um Durchsuchungsbefehlen der USA nachzukommen .
“ Wir sind alle dem Patriot Act unterworfen ”
Bruce Schneier nennt keine Quelle für seine Darstellung .
Wäre er weniger respektiert unter Sicherheitsexperten , käme das vermutlich nicht einmal als ernsthafte Nachricht daher und könnte leicht als Verschwörungstheorie unter den Tisch gekehrt werden .
Wenn er es mit der Gewissheit weiß , mit der er es in seinem Beitrag formuliert , woher kann er diese Information haben ?
Der frühere Journalist und Investor Jason Calacanis geht davon aus , dass Schneier diese Information von Google zugespielt wurde , um das Problem öffentlich zu machen .
Eine durchaus plausible Erklärung , vielleicht die einzige .
Es erinnert an die rätselhaften Äußerungen von Google - CEO Eric Schmidt im Dezember , als er auf die Frage antwortete , ob man denn Google wirklich vertrauen könne wie seinem besten Freund .
“ Wenn da etwas ist , von dem niemand erfahren sollte , dann sollten Sie es vielleicht gar nicht erst tun ” , ließ er die Moderatorin des Senders CNBC wissen .
Das hörte sich schon seltsam genug an , aber dann wies er auch noch ausdrücklich auf die Anti-Terror - Gesetze der USA hin : “ Wenn Sie wirklich diese Art von Privatsphäre benötigen , es ist einfach so , dass Suchmaschinen – einschließlich Google – diese Informationen für einige Zeit bewahren .
Dabei ist es zum Beispiel auch wichtig , dass wir in den Vereinigten Staaten alle dem Patriot Act unterworfen sind und es möglich ist , dass alle Informationen den Behörden verfügbar gemacht werden könnten . ”
“ Hintertüren laden zu Angriffen ein ”
Wenn es diese Hintertür zu Google Mail auf Veranlassung der US - Regierung gibt , dann kann sie nicht im Interesse von Google sein .
Das Unternehmen ist auf das Vertrauen der Benutzer – und nicht nur in den USA – mehr angewiesen als auf alles andere , setzt mit Cloud Computing auf Dienste und Daten , die auf Googles Servern gespeichert und verarbeitet werden .
Das erklärt auch die deutliche Reaktion auf die chinesische Cyber - Attacke , während Yahoo und andere Unternehmen schwiegen , obwohl sie ebenfalls angegriffen wurden .
Microsofts CEO
Ballmer schließlich verharmloste und tat , als verstehe er die Welt nicht mehr .
Das Problem mit solchen Schnüffel - Hintertüren , wie auch in anderen Ländern praktiziert und teilweise durch Gesetze gedeckt , die als Anti-Terror - Maßnahmen durchgepeitscht wurden , ist nicht nur der mögliche Missbrauch durch Behörden und ihre Mitarbeiter .
Schneier ist noch stärker beunruhigt darüber , dass sie zu weiteren illegalen Aktivitäten verleiten :
“ Eine Infrastruktur , die der Überwachung und Kontrolle dienlich ist , lädt zu Überwachung und Kontrolle ein , und nicht nur durch die Leute , von denen man es erwartet .
Chinas Hacker haben das Zugangssystem unterwandert , das Google eingerichtet hat , um Anweisungen der US - Behörden nachzukommen .
Wie kann jemand annehmen , dass Kriminelle nicht in der Lage sein werden , das gleiche System zu nutzen , um Bank - und Kreditkarteninformationen zu stehlen , es für weitere Attacken zu nutzen oder es in ein massives Spam - Versender - Netzwerk zu verwandeln ?
Wie kann jemand annehmen , dass nur Strafverfolger nach geltendem Recht gespeicherte Internet - Daten auswerten oder Telefon - und Messaging - Kommunikation belauschen können ? ”

OTTAWA , Feb. 19 ( UPI ) -- A Canadian government department is poised to approve genetically modified pigs for the food supply , the Canwest News Service reported Friday .
Sources told the agency Environment Canada will announce approval of the strain known as " enviropigs " Saturday .
Advertisement
The strain would then need approval from Health Canada before the pigs enter the food market .
The Yorkshire pigs were developed by researchers in Ontario at the University of Guelph , who spliced in genes from mice to decrease the amount of phosphorus produced in the pigs ' dung , the report said .
The genetic modification means the new strain of pigs produce 30 to 65 percent less phosphorus in their waste , which has been problematic in surface and groundwater around large livestock operations , Canwest said .
Steven Liss , associate vice - president for research at the University of Guelph , said an application has also been sent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , but he had no idea how long it would take to get a response .
Megan McPhee , an assistant research professor at the University of Montana– Missoula 's Flathead Lake Biological Station reels in an answer for this query .
There are two general explanations for how a fish species might end up in different lakes separated by hundreds of miles .
The first is termed " vicariance " by biogeographers , who study the distribution of organisms .
In this case , we begin with a species that occupies a much larger , continuous range .
Over long periods of time , geologic , biological and climatic events act to cause populations to go extinct in scattered places throughout their range , leaving behind present - day populations that are isolated by hundreds of miles .
For example , during the late Pliocene and Pleistocene ( between two to 0.5 million years ago ) epochs , western North America experienced a much wetter climate , and many basins were occupied by giant lakes .
When an increasingly arid climate swept into the area , large lakes dried up and separated into smaller ones , leaving fish species isolated in these diminished basins .
Over long periods of time , enough genetic differences may have accumulated to cause us to classify these as separate species .
Without sufficient differences , however , we would still consider these isolated populations to be members of the same species even though they have no genetic contact with one another .
The second explanation is based on " dispersal " ( or movement of individuals away from the population to which they were born ) .
In rare cases , individuals disperse into new areas previously unoccupied by members of their species .
In fish , where most species require male–female sex in order to reproduce , a minimum of one of each sex would be needed to colonize a new lake .
Whereas the chance of this happening once is quite small , given sufficient time there will have been enough opportunities for these rare dispersal events to result in the colonization of new lakes .
Freshwater fish tend to disperse well — as illustrated by the many different species that now occupy the high latitudes of North America , most of which were covered by ice during the last glaciation .
Fish have recolonized all of the present - day rivers and lakes that were under ice during that period .
Although we often tend to think of fish in lakes as lake dwellers , many of these species use rivers during parts of their life cycles .
For example , Yellowstone cutthroat trout occupy a number of lakes throughout their range , but use rivers for spawning .
Some of the young fish then move back to the lake to mature , whereas others remain in the rivers .
One can imagine that over time , fish moving through and between river systems downstream or upstream to lakes , could colonize many different lakes throughout a large basin .
Over longer time periods , movement of fish between basins is often facilitated by " headwater capture . "
This is when a river tributary cutting its way upstream toward the divide between basins causes enough erosion to cut through that divide , thus serving as a waterway between two rivers .
Although this mechanism is primarily responsible for transfer of river - dwelling fishes , it can also move lake fish between basins if they spend part of their life cycle in rivers .
Finally , humans are responsible for " dispersing " fish great distances .
In many cases , this occurs intentionally because people want to be able to fish for a particular species outside of that species 's native range .
For example , in the late 19th century concerted efforts were made by the U.S. Fish Commission to introduce carp — as a food fish — into the waters of the western U.S.
Now these fish can be found throughout lakes and reservoirs across the entire region .
In other cases , transfer occurs accidentally ( or , at least , is not sanctioned by a fisheries management agency ) when individuals release aquarium fish or empty out their bait buckets into wild habitats .
We have learned that intentional and accidental transfers of nonnative fish often prey upon or compete with native species , so such practices are now discouraged .
DRM Assassination : Let 's send a message to Ubisoft
PC gaming is doomed , I can feel the storm clouds gathering , ready for the apocalypse .
Sure , it ’s no more doomed than it has been for the last 20 years , but there is definitely some doom going down right now .
Ubisoft have got a new form of DRM for all their PC games , which will require a constant internet connection to play their games .
Tom Francis over at PC Gamer has been playing Assassin ’s Creed 2 , and this his experience of it :
If you get disconnected while playing , you ’re booted out of the game .
All your progress since the last checkpoint or savegame is lost , and your only options are to quit to Windows or wait until you ’re reconnected .
I do n’t like the sound of that .
Do you ?
If you would like to join my protest , read on .
Why this shit is bad ?
This new DRM is not good .
Here are some reasons :
1. Ubisoft are selling you inferior products at the same prices that they used to .
People who buy games using this DRM have a lot less rights than equivalent other games .
You right to resell is completely removed , your ability to play offline is removed , your privacy is being infringed , and paying customers are being punished for the actions of pirates .
2 . It is a far from perfect system .
Ubisoft ’s servers will go down , routers will be flakey , ISPs will have downtime and they are refusing to 100 % commit to supporting these games in the future .
You may be left with a coaster .
For AC2 , there is no reason that in the event of your connection dropping , they could let you play until the next checkpoint , but it appears that invasive DRM is even more important than game design .
3. Ubisoft are not taking responsibility for it effectively .
Of all the retailers selling AC2 , only two at time of writing actually state that it requires a constant internet connection to play .
If I were selling a game with this kind of DRM , you can be damn sure that I would be doing everything I could to ensure that my paying customers knew about it .
There are plenty more reasons why it is stupid , but these are the main reasons that I think it is bad .
What should we do ?
I ’d like to try and organise some way of encouraging Ubisoft to stop this .
There is n’t any decent mechanism for giving Ubisoft feedback of this kind that they will actually listen too .
Boycotts will be ignored ( and frankly , gamers are bad at doing boycotts ) , protesting by buying the console version is n’t going to bother them at all , since they still get paid , and pirating it will do nothing but prove them right ( at least in the mindset that they are in ) .
I ’ve racked my brain , and I ’ve come up with a form of protest that might just work .
If Ubisoft wo n’t listen to gamers , we need to get someone else that they will listen to to take up our cause .
Perhaps a big retailer .
The reason that pirating the game and saying “ I would have bought it if it did not have this DRM ” does n’t mean anything is that it is just words .
For all Ubisoft know , you might have never bought the PC game at all .
For anything to actually effect their decision making process , they need facts and figures .
What I propose is this .
We all decide on one , preferably high profile , entertainment retailer to buy the PC version AC2 from .
We pick one that has no mention of requiring an internet connection on their listing .
We all then get as many people to preorder the game as possible , we can hopefully get as large amount of the retailers allocated stock as possible .
When the game arrives , we will keep it inside the plastic seal .
Then we will look at the back of the box , and notice that it requires a constant internet connection , and decide that we do not want this game .
We will then have 28 working days to return it .
Assuming it arrives on day of release ( 5th of March ) , we would have until Friday the 16th of April to return it ( taking into account Good Friday and Easter Monday : UK bank holidays ) , so posting it on Tuesday the 13th of April should leave enough margin for error .
When the retailer receives our copies of AC2 with the seal in tact , they will give us full cash refunds .
We should very plainly state that the reason we are returning the game is because we are rejecting Ubisoft ’s DRM .
The game will ship with a return slip that you fill in explaining why you want a refund .
You will have to absorb the small cost of postage ( 90 p first class ) .
The retailer will have a mountain of games that are of much lower value to them than they were at release .
They will not be happy about this .
This message will get back to Ubisoft .
I ’ve looked through the range of retailers selling AC2 , and have decided to pick Tesco .
They have no mention of the DRM whatsoever in their listing .
They are also fairly high profile .
Click here to order it from Tesco .
If everyone who wants to be part of this protest emails me here with the subject “ Ubisoft are baddies ” , then I can keep track of how many people are going to be taking part , and I will email you to remind you to post it back too .
So here is the plan .
1. Order AC2 from Tesco .
2. Email me to let me know you are in on it .
3 . When it arrives , do nothing .
4 . Wait until the 13th of April .
5 . Post it back to Tesco , explaining that you do not want it because you find the DRM to be unacceptable .
Then get a full cash refund .
For this to work , we need to get as many people on board as possible .
If you like the sound of sending a message to Ubisoft , then please join in .
It will cost you £ 26.99 , but you will get all of that back ( minus P&P ) .
Please also spread this around to anywhere you can think , forums , social networking , blogs .
I think a good target is holding 100 copies to ransom , but who knows how well we can do .
Are you with me ?

NVIDIA HAS REVEALED when it will unveil “ The world ’s fastest PC graphics gaming technology ” and it ’s all going to happen on the 26th of March 2010 from 6 to 7 PM at PAX East .
Indeed , Nvidia is launching Fermi , sorry , the GTX480 and GTX470 at a glorified LAN party in Boston .
If you hurry up and pre-register it ’ll let you in for $ 50 and you ’ll be allowed to attend the three day LAN party as well , although if you turn up late , that price goes up to $ 55 .
The good news is that press gets in free , so at least Nvidia will be able to smuggle in a few hacks without having to spend money on tickets for them , then again , a single day ticket for the Friday is $ 30 .
There is n’t much in terms of details as to what Nvidia is going to show and we ’re sure it will try to keep it under wraps for as long as possible .
Seating is apparently limited though and Nvidia claims that “ If you ’re even vaguely a fan of PC games and miss this special event , you ’ll likely be spending the next few months kicking yourself , ” although we ’re not sure if this really is the case .
If you miss the launch event , then Nvidia will also be having a booth at PAX where it ’ll let you have a play with its new toys and “ you may even be able to buy one before anyone else , ” which makes us wonder if Nvidia will actually have any stock of the new cards at all , as it does n’t even seem to know if it does .
There will of course be some gaming demos with 3D glasses , a preview of “ the coolest new PCs and gadgets , including the revolutionary Tegra - powered mobile devices , ” and even some gaming competitions .
Well , we ca n’t wait to see what Nvidia has cooked up , but we ’re also highly disappointed that Nvidia decided not to launch its new cards at CeBIT which kicks off next week .
Not only does this make the big trade shows feel less and less important for media to attend , but it ’s also going to make CeBIT a really boring affair for Nvidia ’s partners , who wo n’t be allowed to show off their GTX480 and GTX470 cards .

HEALTH CARE COSTS HEALTH CARE COSTS WASHINGTON 
Spending on health care consumed an estimated 17 cents of every dollar spent last year in the United States , representing the largest one - year increase since the federal government started tracking the number in 1960 .
By 2019 , health care spending will represent 19.3 % of the nation 's total economic output , according to a report released today by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .
The report is the latest indication of the nation 's mounting medical expenses and it comes as Congress has stalled on President Obama 's proposal to revamp the health care system .
COVERAGE ENDS : State health plans in jeopardy POLL : Regroup on health care , most say
At a meeting with Senate Democrats on Wednesday , Obama urged lawmakers to continue their work on the issue even as Congress has shifted its attention to addressing the nation 's unemployment rate .
The rapid increase in health care spending as a percentage of the economy — up from 16.2 % in 2008 to 17.3 % last year — can be partly explained by the recession .
Although the nation 's gross domestic product declined in 2009 , health care spending rose to an estimated $ 2.5 trillion in 2009 , or $ 8,047 per person , according to the report .
That number will grow to $ 4.5 trillion in 2019 , or 19.3 % of the GDP , which is the entire economic output of the USA .
" This is certainly a very steep rate of growth , " said Christopher Truffer , an author of the report .
The share of health care spending is projected to remain flat in 2010 and 2014 as the economy improves , the report said .
Among the report 's findings : • Spending on prescription drugs grew an estimated 5.2 % , to $ 246 billion , in 2009 .
That growth was driven partly by demand for antiviral drugs to treat H1N1 flu , the report says .
•
Spending on public health programs will continue to outpace private health care spending as more Baby Boomers become eligible for Medicare and the economy continues to force more people into Medicaid .
In 2014 , the federal government will spend $ 1.64 trillion , compared with $ 1.58 trillion in private funds .
•
Out - of - pocket medical spending was estimated at $ 284 billion in 2009 , a 2.1 % increase .
That 's less than the 2.8 % growth in spending between 2007 and 2008 .
The House of Representatives and Senate had passed versions of Obama 's health care bill , but the effort came to a standstill after Republican Scott Brown won a special Senate election in Massachusetts on Jan. 19 .
Brown will give Senate Republicans the 41 votes they need to block legislation .
One approach Democrats are considering is breaking the larger health care legislation into smaller pieces .
Democratic Reps . Tom Perriello of Virginia and Betsy Markey of Colorado say they will introduce a bill Friday to repeal the antitrust exemption for health insurance companies — an idea proposed as part of the broader health care effort .
The House plans to take up the bill next week , said Brendan Daly , Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's spokesman .
Experts such as Gary Claxton , who studies health care costs for the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation , say the growth in medical spending has been rising faster than the economy for decades .
The report , he said , is the latest warning .
" It 's a reminder , but it 's no different from what we 've known , " he said .
" As long as it 's growing faster , it 's going take over more and more of the economy . "

The British medical journal The Lancet yesterday offered a mea culpa of sorts for its role in launching a global vaccine scare .
Its regrets come about 12 years too late .
The journal finally issued a full retraction of a study it ran in 1998 linking measles - mumps - rubella vaccines to autism .
The paper , with Dr. Andrew Wakefield as lead author , sent British parents fleeing from inoculations and fed U.S. alarm over preservatives in vaccines .

Russ Steele Severalof Nevada County 's liberal bloggers , who are strong supporters of the notion that humans are responsible for global warming , often cite the UN IPCC reports to support their position .
Wrapping themselves in a warm sweater of authority .
They claimed that thousands of climate scientists have vetted critical peer reviewed climatology papers , and we should all accept these UN IPCC reports a undisputed fact .
The " science is settled " they claimed , see my warm sweater .
Now those claims are coming unraveled just like a well worn sweater .
As the skeptics pull on the peer reviewed threads the warm " science is settled " sweater is unraveling .
One of those unraveling threads is the IPCC claim that the Himalayan glaciers would be largely melted by 2035 .
This bogus claim was lifted from a news report published in 1999 by New Scientist magazine .
It was never published in an peer reviewed paper .
A second unraveling thread is the discovery the IPCC 's 2007 report , which warned that the world had " suffered rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather - related events since the 1970s " , suggested a part of this increase was due to global warming and cited an unpublished report .
The Sunday Times found that the scientific paper on which the IPCC based its claim had not been peer reviewed , nor published , at the time the IPCC report was published .
When the paper was eventually published , in 2008 , it had a new caveat .
It said : " We find insufficient evidence to claim a statistical relationship between global temperature increase and catastrophe losses . "
The UK Times Online has more details on this second thread here , and Watt Up With That has the details on the melting Himalayan glacier claims here .
Update # 1(01-25-10 )
More IPCC fraud
Yet more evidence that the IPCC cooked the books .
Here ’s its 2007 claim that global warming could devastate African agriculture :
" In other [ African ] countries , additional risks that could be exacerbated by climate change include greater erosion , deficiencies in yields from rain - fed agriculture of up to 50 % during the 2000 - 2020 period , and reductions in crop growth period . "
In fact , that claim comes from a non-peer - reviewed and non-scientific paper which looked at just three African countries , and was produced by a sustainable development lobby group .
How did this end up as IPCC gospel ?
H/T Climate Realists
Update # 2 : More IPCC non-peer - reviiewed fraud
“ The IPCC also made false predictions on the Amazon rain forests , referenced to a non peer - reviewed paper produced by an advocacy group working with the WWF .
This time though , the claim made is not even supported by the report and seems to be a complete fabrication .
Thus , the IPCC is relying for its assertions that “ up to 40 % of the Amazonian forests could react drastically to even a slight reduction in precipitation ” on a free - lance journalist / activist and a specialist in policy and analysis relating to forest fires in Australia , Asia and South Africa .
... not a peer reviewed study .

Adam Turl reviews a new book that tells the story of how Wal - Mart became the biggest -- and meanest -- employer in the U.S .
" The commitment to stay union - free must exist at all levels of management - - from the chairperson of the ' Board ' down to the front - line manager .
Therefore , no one in management is immune from carrying his or her ' own weight ' in the union prevention effort . "
-- from " Labor Relations and You at the Wal - Mart Distribution Center # 6022 "
ONCE UPON a time , GM was the biggest employer in the U.S.
In the historic labor battles of the 1930s , GM workers formed the United Auto Workers ( UAW ) .
During the economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s , they won substantial gains in wages and benefits .
Of course , both GM and the UAW are now pale shadows of their former selves .
Today the largest employer in the U.S. ( and the world ) is the anti-union behemoth Wal - Mart .
Wal - Mart 's 1.4 million U.S. " associates " often earn poverty or near poverty wages .
As Nelson Lichtenstein writes in his new book The Retail Revolution , Wal - Mart got its start in one of the poorest and least - unionized sections of the South nearly five decades ago -- in an overwhelmingly white stretch of rural Arkansas that had been mostly untouched by the New Deal and civil rights .
A Wal - Mart " associate " at work
It was during the economic crises of the 1970s and the right - wing " Reagan Revolution " of the 1980s that Wal - Mart first blossomed into a retail giant .
As recession and free - market policies rolled back the gains of the New Deal and civil rights era , Wal - Mart thrived .
Not only that , it reproduced the conditions of its origin as it spread outward from Arkansas through the South and Midwest .
Wal - Mart drives down retail wages and busts retail unions .
But it has also situated itself in a command position within the globalized manufacturing and shipping system .
In that position , it uses its leverage to drive down manufacturing wages and compel offshoring .
A " battle royal " is building between the Beast of Bentonville and its workers , Lichtenstein argues - - a battle he believes will " shape American life for a generation . "
THE GREAT labor upsurge of the 1930s did n't leave the world of retail work completely untouched .
Thousands of retail clerks joined employee organizations and unions .
Even where there were no such organizations , widespread unionization eventually put upward pressure on retail workers ' wages .
Review : Books Nelson Lichtenstein , The Retail Revolution : How Wal - Mart Created a Brave New World of Business , Metropolitan Books , 2009 , 312 pages , $ 25 .
Some department store mini-chains that catered to lower income workers -- particularly in urban areas -- were even owned by immigrant families who openly professed support for labor and the New Deal .
After the Second World War , department stores that catered neither to the rich or poor but a generation of workers that now had a modicum of disposable income proliferated .
Clerks at these chains -- like Sears and J.C. Penny -- were generally nonunion and made less than manufacturing workers , but were paid enough ( and given enough autonomy ) to keep unions out without losing employees .
But the economic downturn of the 1970s created conditions that were ripe for the return of low - cost retail outlets .
The first chain to benefit from the new climate was Kmart , which had established stores in working - class suburbs throughout the Midwest .
Kmart 's customer base included millions of blue - collar union workers .
Wal - Mart , however , came of age far from this milieu .
As Lichtenstein writes :
Wal - Mart began its stupendous growth in a region that was distinctively provincial , even fundamentally at odds with the economic structures and political expectations that had nurtured commerce in the great northern tier of industrial states that stretched from Boston to Chicago and Minneapolis .
America 's manufacturing belt was a region of ethnic and racial heterogeneity , home to an increasingly skilled workforce and , after the reforms of the New Deal and Great Society eras , a potent union movement and an extensive welfare state .
In contrast , the Ozarks of northeast Arkansas and southern Missouri were poor , white and rural .
Neither the New Deal nor the civil rights impulse had really come to the region when Sam Walton began to assemble his chain of small - town stores in the 1950s and 1960s .
Lichtenstein exaggerates the extent of the Northern " welfare state . "
Nevertheless , in its formative years , Wal - Mart was able to escape a host of labor regulations and play fast and loose with the minimum wage , price - controls ( that had been enacted to put a check on the growth of large chains ) and various " Yankee " laws and business practices .
Wal - Mart had the space to design its own deregulated low wage business model - - a model that could seize the " opportunity " presented by the end of the post - war economic boom and then the general turn toward neoliberalism , deregulation , union - busting and the free market .
The architect of this empire was Sam Walton .
Walton liked to project a down - home folksy persona -- but his roots were n't exactly the salt of the earth .
Sam 's father worked as a debt collector during the Great Depression and took his son with him to meet with farmers defaulting on their mortgages .
Lichtenstein writes , " Tens of thousands of farmers were in default , and it was part of Walton 's job to assess the property , make the threats , and serve the papers that dispossessed a generation of families from their land . "
Sam claimed that his father tried to leave farmers with what little " self - respect " he could -- but as Lichtenstein writes , " the dispossession of so many rural folk was still something close to theft , the brutal climax of America 's great enclosure movement , a multi- decade eviction that would prepare the cultural and economic ground on which Sam Walton built his commercial empire . "
Dispossessing farmers paid reasonably well , but Sam Walton needed more start - up capital for his empire than his father 's real - life job as a villain from The Grapes of Wrath had bequeathed him .
So Walton did what many other " self - made men " have done ; he married into money .
Sam 's wife , Helen Robson , was the daughter of a local banker and politician .
Most importantly , she had a trust fund that allowed Walton to start buying up department stores .
Before Wal - Mart , retail in rural Arkansas was dominated by small general stores down the dirt and gravel side - roads from small farms .
The New Deal paved Arkansas ' roads , and post - war highway construction allowed for larger stores to service larger areas .
The Great Depression -- with the help of Sam Walton 's father -- had deprived thousands of farmers of their livelihoods , making them desperate for work , and the poverty of the region meant customers were looking for discounts .
In other words , rural Arkansas was ripe for low - wage big box retail .
After several years of managing or franchising other chain stores , Walton struck out on his own and formed Wal - Mart .
The 1970s were , as Lichtenstein writes , Walton 's " miracle decade . "
Wal - Mart " moved from obscurity and regional curiosity to crack the $ 1 billion sales mark .
Opening as many as 50 new stores each year , Walton saw revenues soar at an annual rate of almost 40 percent . "
Walton opened almost all of his new stores at this time in towns with a population of less than 10,000 people to ensure domination of the local market .
Wal - Mart established a near monopoly in town after town .
Throughout the 1970s , Wal - Mart " grew between four and five times as rapidly as Penny's , Kmart and Woolco , the discount version of Woolworth . "
LOW WAGES were central to Wal - Mart 's success , but so too was Walton 's obsession with absolute control over inventory and supply and later on , the use of technology .
Wal - Mart cut out the retail " middleman " and came to employ the most advanced technology to keep track of its goods .
It was Wal - Mart that led the way toward the universal adoption of the bar code and the eradication of the wholesale salesmen and jobbers that had dominated retail .
Before Wal - Mart most retail outlets -- especially outside the big urban markets -- had to rely on others to do their warehousing .
Stores had little control over supply compared to the big brand name manufacturers that supplied them .
Walton changed this by creating -- from the start -- his own in - house supply , trucking and warehouse system .
As one executive put it , " the misconception is that we 're in the retail business , we 're in the distribution business . "
Up until 1978 , no Wal - Mart stores were ever built more than a day 's drive from corporate headquarters .
As Wal - Mart spread outward from its base in Bentonville , it did so in roughly concentric circles , with each new wave of stores preceded by a new distribution center ( DC ) .
Today , the company has more than 120 DCs across North America :
Today a typical DC is gigantic , sprawling over 1.2 million square feet , with roofs that cover the equivalent of 15 or 20 football fields .
Two or three hundred trucks arrive each day , either from the company 's suppliers or to pick up a load for the stores .
The trucks nestle into one of the hundred or more bays that penetrate each side of the mile - long wall that encloses the distribution center itself .
From these semi-trailers , thousands of boxes , each labeled with its own identifying bar code and destination address , are quickly fed along one of the many small conveyors -- there are more than 20 miles in all ...
These river - like streams of boxes then converge in four larger tributaries at a " merge center , " from which the torrent of boxes streams into a mechanized sorting area .
Three electronic eyes read the labels after which electric arms reach out and guide the boxes , destined for particular Wal - Mart stores , out of the sorting area and into one of the facility 's 100 chutes , which lead onto a waiting truck , all at the rate of 200 cartons per minute , seven days a week , 24 hours a day .
All this is controlled by computer from Arkansas .
When Wal - Mart first began , however , technology had not caught up to Walton 's designs .
With the invention of the bar code -- the first product to be stamped with a Universal Product Code was a packet of gum in 1974 -- Walton had found the technological advance he needed .
In 1980 , Wal - Mart began to install scanners in its stores .
Productivity increased by 50 percent .
Within a few years , Wal - Mart made scanners standard in all stores , and managers awarded cashiers with pins for " those who could scan 500 items per hour . "
In the mid-1980s Walton 's empire spread into space : " Wal - Mart took the lead , deploying the world 's largest private , integrated satellite communication network , which beamed data , voice , and video communication to and from corporate headquarters and more than 1,500 stores , all via a single communications satellite in geostationary orbit 23,300 miles above the equator . "
In real time , Wal - Mart executives now know exactly what is being stocked , shipped and sold in every store on the plant .
And in real time , Wal - Mart executives can talk live via satellite to their army of underpaid associates .
Wal - Mart changed the balance of power between retailers and manufacturers .
Manufacturers who once set prices found they had to bow before Wal - Mart 's constant demand for low wages if they to access this increasingly massive distribution and retail network .
BENTONVILLE
IS just as interested in monitoring its employees as it is in monitoring its products .
Because wages and working conditions at Wal - Mart are so poor the company has notable difficulty controlling employees .
For example , off - the - clock work is ( illegally ) expected of employees as a matter of course .
Turnover of shop - floor employees has frequently approached crisis proportions .
In 1999 , the company had a 70 percent turnover rate and 67 percent of entry - level workers quit within three months .
Some of these employees were no doubt convinced to quit after they proved incompatible with Wal - Mart 's culture of hyper - exploitation .
Of course , very few former associates ever receive unemployment benefits .
Turnover has declined over the past 10 years ( along with the deteriorating economy ) .
Still , it costs the company millions of dollars a year .
They 're reportedly researching ways to automate both hiring and firing .
Of course , if you can't quit and you can't make ends meet with your paltry Wal - Mart paycheck , you can always steal from work .
Employee theft is counted in retail losses along with shoplifting as a part of what is called " shrinkage . "
Shrinkage , Lichtenstein writes , amounts to about " $ 30 billion a year in unexplained inventory losses " -- nearly half is a result of employee theft .
Wal - Mart is obsessed with shrinkage .
In the 1980s and 1990s , the company developed its own internal police force -- called Loss Prevention -- to deal with employee theft and to spy on employees .
" By 2000 , there were more than 550 salaried managers in Loss Prevention , scores of internal auditors , and thousands of in - store hourly employees to keep associates and managers both vigilant and fearful . "
Loss Prevention even went after " loyal " employees who considered themselves steeped in Wal - Mart 's corporate culture , arbitrarily demanding they be fired even when managers ' defended them .
Walton 's mini-Gestapo had so much power that even dozens of store managers circulated a letter in protest .
Public Enemy number one in Bentonville , however , was ( and is ) organized labor .
Sam Walton developed a nearly messianic opposition to unions and he spread that gospel throughout every corner of his growing empire .
It was an opposition fueling by the same forces that led Arkansas to become the nation 's first " right - to - work " state .
When Wal - Mart first felt the " union threat " in 1972 , Walton turned to John Tate , one of the founding fathers of the modern " union avoidance " industry .
Tate had cut his teeth in the post - war battle between union workers and packinghouse bosses in Omaha - - a battle the unions won .
Tate , however , soldiered on .
As Lichtenstein writes , " Tate traveled in right - wing political circles that linked militant anti-unionism to a libertarian rejection of the welfare state , fair employment legislation , and regulatory oversight by the federal government .
This put him in league with the John Birch Society and the Christian Anti-Communist Crusade . "
When Walton " faced union trouble at two stores in central Missouri , " he put in a phone call to Tate for help .
Tate 's strategy for dealing with the union threat was twofold : bust the union and at the same time develop a more paternalistic approach to associates .
This is the origin of Wal - Mart 's " We Care " program .
This included a " profit - sharing " scheme and a way for associates to bypass their supervisors to talk directly with Bentonville .
The profit sharing was set up in such a way that even at its high point fewer than 1 in 50 employees ever saw any money .
" The most important impact of the profit - sharing scheme was ideological , " Lichtenstein writes , " linking the employees to the fate of the company , but also justifying the self - exploitation that was integral to Wal - Mart culture . "
Likewise , the direct employee pipeline to corporate executives had less to do with solving problems than finding out about them soon enough to prevent union activity .
In the late 1970s , a group of DC workers and truckers started to organize , and the Teamsters launched union drives in Bentonville and Searcy , Arkansas .
An overwhelming majority of the Bentonville DC workers even signed union cards .
But after a long anti-union campaign in which Sam Walton threatened to close the warehouse down , the union was busted .
Rather than redoubling their efforts after having come so close , much of organized labor concluded that Wal - Mart was too difficult to organize .
Wal - Mart drew the opposite lesson and became even more vigilant in " union avoidance " warning new associates that any flirtation with unionization would result in violence and conflict .
EVENTUALLY the United Food and Commercial Workers ( UFCW ) targeted Wal - Mart , or more accurately found their own members in Wal - Mart 's crosshairs .
The UFCW represented ( and still represents ) a significant number of grocery workers .
However , Wal - Mart was able to undercut its union ( and non-union ) supermarket competitors as it expanded into the business .
Labor costs represented up to 70 percent of total expenditures among the traditional supermarkets .
But Wal - Mart 's labor costs were far lower .
UFCW members were , as Lichtenstein writes , " caught in the squeeze " as their current employers were run out of a market or as they cut their own employees ' wages to " remain competitive . "
The UFCW launched a campaign to organize Wal - Mart .
That campaign has been more " defensive " than " offensive . "
UFCW has offered support to some of the few dozen groups of workers who have tried ( over the years ) to organize at different stores , but has often focused on efforts to keep Wal - Mart out of certain markets -- for example , the campaign to keep Wal - Mart out of Chicago .
In the organizing drives that have occurred , Wal - Mart has sprung into action to stamp out the union threat .
Local managers are told they are on full - time anti-union work and if they hesitate they are immediately fired .
" Then comes , " Lichtenstein writes , " a barrage of leaflets , videos , personnel shifts and meetings with individual employees , often climaxed with an on - site visit by top corporate executives .
Captive audience assembles become more frequent and more intimidating as the presumptive date of the NLRB election draws near . "
If the union does win , as in the case of two Canadian stores , or among a group of Texas butchers , Wal - Mart simply closes the store -- or in the case of the butchers , abolishes the department .
Bentonville keeps constant track of the " union threat " through a " Union Probability Index " ( UPI ) , later rechristened " Unaddressed People Issues . "
A store with a high index is given special attention by Wal - Mart headquarters , so that the " right people " ( i.e. , troublemakers ) can be transferred , fired , have their hours cut or otherwise be shown the door .
There is of course , much else that can be said about Wal - Mart .
For example , Lichtenstein shows how the company cynically used a " Buy American " campaign in the 1980s at the same time as it was setting up its new global ( and now largely China - based ) supply network .
He also explores Wal - Mart 's bizarre paternalistic corporate culture .
All this is important , but what stands out the most about this company is that it thrives when workers ( here and abroad ) fall behind .
For Wal - Mart , economic hard times mean more customers and more desperate employees .
It is no accident that Wal - Mart 's " miracle decade " was the same decade that saw the end of the post - Second World War economic boom .
Similarly , deindustrialization at home and hyper - exploitation of workers abroad are simply the natural byproducts of their business - model - - byproducts that also have the added bonus of increasing Wal - Mart 's customer base .
Through relentless exploitation and innovation Wal - Mart has become a dominant economic and political force .
Lichtenstein's book is titled , The Retail Revolution .
Wal - Mart " revolutionized " the technical and logistical aspects of retail and supply , but at the same time Wal - Mart represents a sort of counter - revolution against the historic gains of the labor movement .
Still , those who think Wal - Mart is " too powerful " to organize should take stock of Bentonville 's obsession with organized labor .
Wal - Mart is afraid of its own employees .
It 's afraid of what it has created .
It fears at the very core of its being the accumulated grievances of its associates .
It is time for organized labor -- and not just the UFCW -- to do whatever it takes and allocate whatever resources it takes .
That can not be a merely defensive campaign , but an offensive one - - a campaign to help Wal - Mart workers organize and fight for themselves .

If you think you know everything you need to know about binary search , but have not read Netty van Gasteren and Wim Feijen ’s note The Binary Search Revisited , you should .
In the FLOLAC summer school this year we plan to teach the students some basics of Hoare logic and Dijkstra ’s weakest precondition calculus — a topic surprisingly little known among Taiwanese students .
Binary search seems to be a topic I should cover .
A precise specification will be given later , but basically the requirement is like this : given a sorted array of N numbers and a value to search for , either locate the position where the value resides in the array , or report that the value does not present in the array , in O ( log N ) time .
Given that everybody should have learned about binary search in their algorithm class , you would not expect it to be a hard programming task .
Yet in his popular book Programming Pearls , Jon Bentley noted that surprisingly few professions programmers managed to implement the algorithm without bugs at their first attempt .
I tried it myself and , being very careful ( and having learned something about program construction already ) , I produced a program which I believe to be correct , but rather inelegant .
I tried it on my students and they did produce code with some typical bugs .
So it seems to be a good example for a class about correct program construction .
The Van Gasteren - Feijen Approach
The surprising fact that van Gasteren and Feijen pointed out was that binary search does not apply only to sorted lists !
In fact , the usual practice comparing binary search to searching for a word in a dictionary is , according to van Gasteren and Feijen , a major educational blunder .
Van Gasteren and Feijen considered solving a more general problem : let M and N be integral numbers with M < N , and let Φ be a relation such that M Φ N ( where Φ is written infix ) , with some additional constraints to be given later .
The task is to find l such that
M ≤ l < N ∧ l Φ ( l+1 )
This is the program :
l , r := M , N ; do l+1 ≠ r → m := ( l + r ) / 2 ; if m Φ r → l := m [ ]
l Φ m → r := m fi od
Notice first that the loop guard l+1 ≠ r , if satisfied , guarantees that l and r are not adjacent numbers , therefore assigning m := ( l + r ) / 2 establishes l < m < r , and thus the bound r - l is guaranteed to decrease .
The if statement clearly maintains the invariant , if at least one of the guards are always satisfied :
l Φ r ∧ l < m < r ⇒ l Φ m ∨ m Φ r (*)
For Φ satisfying the condition above , at the end of the loop we will find some l such that l Φ ( l+1 ) .
What relations satisfy ( *) ?
Examples given by van Gasteren and Feijen include :
i Φ j = a [ i ] ≠ a[j ] for some array a .
Van Gasteren and Feijen suggested using this as the example when introducing binary search .
for some array .
Van Gasteren and Feijen suggested using this as the example when introducing binary search .
i Φ j = a [ i ] < a[j ] ,
, i Φ j = a [ i ] × a[j ] ≤
0 ,
, i Φ j = a [ i ] ∨ a[j ] , etc .
Searching for a Key in a Sorted Array
To search for a key K in an ascending - sorted array a , it seems that we could just pick this Φ :
i Φ j = a [ i ] ≤ K < a[j ]
and check whether a [ i ] = K after the loop .
There is only one problem , however -- we are not sure we can establish the precondition a[l ] ≤ K < a[r ] !
Van Gasteren and Feijen 's solution is to add to imaginary elements to the two ends of the array .
That is , for a possibly empty array a [ 0 ..N ) , we imagine two elements a [ - 1 ] such that a [ - 1 ] ≤ x and a [ N ] such that x < a [ N ] for all x .
I believe this is equivalent to using this Φ :
i Φ j = ( i = - 1 ∨ a [ i ] ≤ K ) ∧ ( K < a[j ] ∨ j = N )
which still satisfies ( * ) if a is sorted .
And here is the program
l , r := - 1 , N ; do l+1 ≠ r → m := ( l + r ) / 2 ; if a [ m ] ≤ K → l := m [ ] K < a[m ] → r := m fi od ; if l > - 1 → found := a[l ] = K [ ] l = - 1 → found := false fi
Do not worry about the idea " adding " elements to a .
The invariant implies that - 1 < m < N , thus a [ - 1 ] and a [ N ] are never accessed , and the array a needs not be actually altered .
They are just there to justify the correctness of the program .
It also enables us to handle possibly empty arrays , while the loop body seems to be designed for the case when the range [ l..r ) is non-empty .
Bentley 's Program
Bentley 's program for binary search in Programming Pearls can be rephrased as below :
l , r := 0 , N - 1 ; do l ≤ r → m := ( l + r ) / 2 ; if a [ m ] < K → l := m + 1 [ ] a[m ] = K → found := true ; break [ ] K < a[m ] → r := m - 1 fi od ; found := false
I would like to be able to derive this program in class , since this appears to be the more popular version .
Apart from the presence of break , which I do not yet know of a easy variation of Hoare logic that helps to derive it , to relate the test a[ m ] < K to l := m + 1
I will have to bring in the fact that a is sorted in an earlier stage of the development .
Thus it is harder to put it in a more general picture .
For several reasons I used to believe that Bentley 's program could be preferred , for example , it seems to shrink the range more effectively , assigning l and r to m + 1 and m - 1 , rather than m .
On a second thought I realised that it might not be true .
Variable l can be assigned m + 1 because the possibility of a[m ] =
K is covered in another case with an early exit , and r is assigned m - 1 because this algorithm represents an array segment with an inclusive right bound , as opposed to the previous algorithm .
The two algorithms do not solve exactly the same problem .
With multiple occurrences of K in the array , Bentley 's algorithm is non-deterministic about which index it returns , while the van Gasteren - Feijen algorithm , enforced by the specification , always returns the largest index .
When K does not appear in the array , van Gasteren and Feijen 's program could be more efficient because it needs only one comparison in the loop , rather than two as in Bentley 's case ( I am assuming that the last comparison is a catch - all case and need not be implemented ) .
What if K does present in the array ?
An analysis by Timothy J. Rolfe concluded that a single - comparison approach is still preferable in average -- benefit of the early exit does not outweigh the cost of the extra comparison in the loop .
On Computing the Middle Index
There are some other interesting stories regarding the assignment m := ( l + r ) / 2 .
Joshua Bloch from Google noted that for large arrays , adding l and r may cause an overflow , and Bloch was not picking on Bentley -- the bug was reported by Sun .
Bloch suggests one of the following :
int m = l + ( ( r - l ) / 2 ) ; /* for Java/C/C++ */ int m = ( l + r ) >>>
1 ; /* for Java */ m = ( ( unsigned int )l + ( unsigned int ) r ) ) >>
1 ; /* for C/C++ */
Since the publication of the blog post , there have been numerous discussions on whether it should be considered a bug in the binary search algorithm or the integer datatype , and some more machine dependent issues like whether one may have an array so large that cannot be indexed by an int , etc .
To be more language - independent , on the other hand , Roland Backhouse in his book Program Construction : Calculating Implementations from Specifications suggested using ( l + r - 1 ) / 2 , such that the value of m will be ⌊(l + r ) / 2⌋ , regardless of whether the integral division operator actually rounds the number up or down .
Exercise ?
Among the exercises suggested by van Gasteren and Feijen , this one caught my eye : let array a [ 0 , N ) , with 0 < N , be the concatenation of a strictly increasing and a strictly decreasing array .
Use binary search to find the maximum element .
( For this problem I think it is reasonable to assume that the two sub-arrays could be empty , while a is non-empty . )
This happens to a sub- routine I needed for an O ( N log N ) algorithm for the maximum segment density problem ( there are linear - time algorithms for this problem , though ) , and I do remember I started off treating it as an unimportant sub - routine but had a hard time getting it right .
I am glad that now I know more about it .

The study found exercise particularly benefited elderly women Moderately overweight elderly people may live longer than those of normal weight , an Australian study suggests .
But being very overweight or being underweight shortened lives .
The report , which was published in the Journal of the American Geriatric Society , said dieting may not be beneficial in this age group .
But the study of 9,200 over - 70s also found that regardless of weight , sedentary lifestyles shortened lives , particularly for women .
The study by the University of Western Australia set out to find out what level of body mass index ( BMI ) was associated with the lowest risk of death in the elderly .
Concerns have been raised about encouraging apparently overweight older people to lose weight
Professor Leon Flicker , University of Western Australia
For younger people , there is a well established health risk from being overweight or obese .
Overweight best
The team tracked the number of deaths over 10 years among volunteers who were aged 70 - 75 at the start of the study .
It found that those with a BMI which classed them as overweight not only had the lowest overall risk of dying , they also had the lowest risk of dying from specific diseases : cardiovascular disease , cancer and chronic respiratory disease .
The overall death rate among the obese group was similar to that among those of normal weight .
But those who were very obese had a greater risk of dying during the 10 year period .
Lead researcher , Professor Leon Flicker said : " Concerns have been raised about encouraging apparently overweight older people to lose weight .
" Our study suggests that those people who survive to age 70 in reasonable health have a different set of risks and benefits associated with the amount of body fat to younger people . "
The conclusion of this study , that being overweight may be less harmful for elderly people , corroborates the findings of previous research .
Staying still Sedentary lifestyles shortened lives across all weight groups , doubling the risk of mortality for women over the period studied , and increasing it by 25 % for men .
Physical exercise " really matters " , said Professor Flicker .
As well as helping to build muscle mass , it has broader health benefits for elderly people , he said .
The authors believe BMI may give a poor reflection of fatty mass in elderly people .
" It may be time to review the BMI classification for older adults , " says Professor Flicker .
Professor Kay - Tee Khaw from Cambridge University agreed , noting that optimal weight appears to be higher in older age groups .
" This is important since under-nutrition is an important problem in older people .
" Waist circumference , which assesses abdominal obesity , appears to be a better indicator of health consequences of obesity " she said .

BIG NEWS TODAY meego.com + video from MeeGo Steering Group + video from Nokia & Intel
This is a move that many had desired .
On the paper it just made so much sense .
However , not too many had really thought it would happen .
Big companies have quite often big egos and it ’s not easy for them to be humble and come together .
I ’m happy to work in a company that has been able to push and concede together with another company that has been also able to push and concede .
1 + 1 in this case will bring three and more .
If these two megacorps could drop some of their priorities in order to reach a common ground , other players can do that too .
Including you ?
( yes , you ) .
As a Nokia contact with the Maemo community and as an active community member myself , I expect this announcement to be big news for the maemo.org membership .
Software freedom and more diversified devices have been two loud and consistent claims since the Maemo project was born in 2005 .
MeeGo brings that , and a lot more .
In fact I think today is an historic day for the Linux and free software communities .
Not only for seeing these two companies shaking hands in a Linux Foundation hosted project , but for the rest of handshakes expected to come after today ’s launch .
Now , where is your hand ? 🙂
Intel and Nokia are two major investors and contributors in free software development .
Both have big teams in house and collaborate with a wide variety of open source companies , projects and rock stars .
Now they are combining strategies and resources in order to kickstart a free Linux mobile platform .
Real code will come soon although plenty of it is already available in code repositories from Moblin , Maemo , Qt …
MeeGo is just like you would expect a free Linux OS to be : based on the standard Linux and Free Desktop technologies and developed publicly in a project open to all contributors .
As a huge fan of the free software community at large , I ’m just amazed by the huge amount of passionate ideas and work it pushes .
Every time time someone attempts to encapsulate part of that energy and bring it aside for a mobile platform I think “ Nah , you really want to be part of that storm , fuel that powerful entropy and be clever canalizing the energy to your platform and products . ”
You do n’t know how happy I was the day I knew Nokia and Intel wanted to do just that with MeeGo .
Answers in the new community
You can find more details at meego.com .
However , do n’t look for all answers since there are so many missing .
The reason is obvious : many of these answers rely today in the Maemo and Moblin communities .
Also in the open source upstream projects feeding the MeeGo architecture .
Also in the application developers that ultimately will make this platform successful .
Also in the chipset vendors , device manufacturers and other users and stakeholders of this platform called to spin the whole mobile industry .
All these answers are somewhere : we just must find them .
It will require the best of our brains .
It will be deep , it will be fun .
I just could n’t wait today ’s launch in order to start the bootstrapping of MeeGo .
The whole thing is actually big and digesting it takes some time .
If you want to be part of this I recommend you to go through the website , subscribe to the mailing list and decide the task or area you want to push first .
In other words : choose your mission in the MeeGo project .
My preferred mission here and now is to contribute in the evolution of maemo.org and the Maemo community in the new MeeGo context .
I have some ideas but , to be honest , I ’m biting my tongue in order to let you go first .
But still I could n’t sit just quiet waiting for the launch , so I decided to start a wiki page describing and comparing the most interesting assets of the Maemo and Moblin communities .
Please help improving it .
It will be useful to figure out all what we could have if we are clever integrating and merging .
And now the personal anecdote
In Autumn 2006 I was a 770 user applying for a job at Nokia .
There was this interview with Valtteri Halla ( now MeeGo ’s Technical Steering Group member ) and Ari Jaaksi ( now VP and head of Maemo Devices ) .
I was explaining them how great it was working as self - employed or in small cooperatives and living in a lovely house in Andalusia .
Ari asked me what were my motivations to leave all that , move to Helsinki and join a big corporation .
Well , by that time my second child was born and I really needed a source of income . 🙂
But the reason not to hesitate taking such a chance was my explicit agenda of bringing Linux and free software to the real mainstream .
Today , three years after getting that job , I feel this agenda ( pushed together with many others in the World : I love you all ) is about half the way .
Working at Nokia you really learn the meaning of the word “ mainstream ” and yes it includes your cousin , your neighbor and many people you do n’t even think of .
MeeGo is a platform to reach them and offer them something useful and exciting for their lives .
Software freedom lovers : you know what I mean .

As the Iranian authorities attempt to stifle tomorrow 's protests surrounding the anniversary of the Iranian revolution , they are going one step further : Iran is permanently suspending access to Google 's Gmail .
Earlier this week , we wrote about failing Internet connections in Iran .
The timing of these problems has been met with suspicion : February 11 ( tomorrow ) marks the anniversary of the Iranian revolution and gatherings are already being planned to protest against June 's alleged election fraud .
From the Wall Street Journal :
" Iranians have reported widespread service disruptions to Internet and text messaging services , though mobile phones appeared to be operating normally Wednesday .
Iran 's telecommunications agency announced what it described as a permanent suspension of Google Inc. 's email services , saying instead that a national email service for Iranian citizens would soon be rolled out .
It was n't clear late Wednesday what effect the order had on Google 's email services in Iran . "
We wrote about Iran 's censorship monster back in June , and it's clear that the Iranian authorities have no intention of loosening their grip .
Twitter was famously a catalyst for communication during the Iranian elections and post-election protests , and Iranian citizens have often relied on networks set up by westerners to send information .
While this is n't a completely unique move — the Iranian government did suspend access to Facebook in the lead - up to May 's election — an all - out block on a communication service and the attempt to move citizens to a state - run service is another story .
Even when compared to the Great Firewall of China , this is disturbing and infuriating .
The Wall Street Journal also reports that satellite dishes from residential rooftops have been confiscated , as well as mobile phones from some opposition members .

Though the 1967 film The Graduate popularized a certain female archetype with the sexy seductress Mrs. Robinson , OK Cupid 's latest data crunching reveals that today 's man wants a much younger woman .
Advertisement
Chrisitan , a blogger for OK Cupid , works some magic on the raw data from 200,000 and discovers that numbers wise , older women should n't have a problem finding men to date online .
However , " the male fixation on youth distorts the dating pool , " meaning that men do not necessarily want to date someone within their age range .
[ A ] man , as he gets older , searches for relatively younger and younger women .
Meanwhile his upper acceptable limit hovers only a token amount above his own age .
The median 31 year - old guy , for example , sets his allowable match age range from 22 to 35 - nine years younger , but only four years older , than himself .
This skewed mindset worsens with age ; the median 42 year - old will accept a woman up to fifteen years younger , but no more than three years older .

These types of preferences begin to have a snowball effect , knocking large numbers of women out of consideration .
Even worse is when Christian introduces more information - that men say they are interested in women within a certain age range , but end up messaging women who are even younger .
As you can see , men tend to focus on the youngest women in their already skewed preference pool , and , what 's more , they spend a significant amount of energy pursuing women even younger than their stated minimum .
No matter what he 's telling himself on his setting page , a 30 year - old man spends as much time messaging 18 and 19 year - olds as he does women his own age .
On the other hand , women only a few years older are largely neglected .

Part of the gap has to come from culture .
After all , despite the unfortunately - named MILF phenomenon , there are very few older women in the public eye who are considered attractive and desirable in the same way twenty - somethings are .
Even as we can all point to women who break that mold , the simple idea is that women over the age of thirty are perceived differently than women in their 20s .
However , Christian has a snappy answer ready for that one as well :
Many of you are probably scoffing at the idea that many 35 year - olds are as attractive as many 25 year - olds , but there are social factors at work that you might not consider as you go through life making judgments .
Most importantly : nationwide , thirtysomethings are much more likely to be married and therefore much more likely to have stopped optimizing their attractiveness .
So the typical 35 year - old woman you see out in the world is n't representative of the single 35 year - olds who are still dating and looking good .

Old TV sets , wiring cases and general household waste are being turned into what a Swansea - based company hopes will be the " house of the future " .
Affresol has developed technology to build low carbon houses from plastic and minerals extracted from recycled rubbish .
The firm developed a material called Thermo Poly Rock ( TPR ) from recycled plastics and minerals for use as a structural building product .
Wyre Davies spoke to Ian McPherson from Affresol and took a tour of the house .
The president of Argentina , Cristina Fernández , recently fired the head of the central bank , Martín Redrado , when he rejected the government 's plan to use $ 6.6 bn of international reserves to pay off debt .
The domestic and international press response was overwhelmingly negative , with complaints that this would " kill central bank independence " .
Leaving aside the question of whether it is a good idea to use these reserves to pay off international creditors – something that perhaps only the future will tell – is there a good reason why central banks should be " independent " of their elected governments ?
The business press , which has the support of the vast majority of economists on this question , thinks there is .
The basic argument is that if the central bank is not able to determine monetary policy free of " political considerations " , then politicians will force the bank to be " too loose " with monetary policy and the country will end up with dangerously high levels of inflation .
This would seem to be a tough argument to swallow for anyone who believes in representative democracy .
Fiscal policy – the government 's decisions with regard to spending and taxation – is also a major determinant of economic activity .
There are important tradeoffs that affect the livelihood , income and employment of most of the population .
Yet in the US , these decisions are entrusted to our elected representatives in Congress , together with the executive .
There is no obvious reason why monetary policy – the central bank 's decisions with regard to interest rates and money supply – is so different from other major policy decisions that it should be specially insulated from the electorate .
There is no valid analogy , for example , to the independence of the judiciary – which is based on a theory of separation of powers , or checks and balances , ostensibly to limit abuses of power or infringements on civil rights and liberties .
The argument for an independent central bank is more purely an elitist argument .
It really boils down to the idea that monetary policy is too important for the " uneducated " masses to have an influence over it .
Ironically , the reality is quite the opposite : monetary policy is an area where pressure from the majority is sorely needed .
There is a grand conflict of interest between the financial sector and the rest of society .
This has become more painfully obvious in the last two years , as the unmitigated greed of this bloated collection of special interests collapsed the US economy and dragged a good part of the world down with it .
Our conception of central bank " independence " is so extreme that Ben Bernanke , who was a Federal Reserve governor since 2002 and chairman since 2006 , could not even be denied reappointment – despite his enormous share of responsibility for an economic train wreck that caused millions of people to lose their jobs and homes .
He sat on his hands while an $ 8tn housing bubble accumulated , thus guaranteeing the collapse that followed .
But our financial sector is so politically powerful that even this minimal level of government oversight – refusing to reward one of the worst failures imaginable – was seen as too offensive to the financial markets .
But even in normal times , the financial sector generally prefers higher interest rates and lower employment than the vast majority of citizens would choose .
Most people want the economy to be closer to full employment , and appreciate rising wages .
A central bank that is " independent " of the public 's needs and wants , and caters primarily to those of the financial sector , is therefore going to cause a lot of needless suffering .
For example , prior to the late 1990s , the Federal Reserve subscribed to a theory called the Nairu ( non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment ) .
The Fed would tend to raise interest rates when unemployment fell below a presumed Nairu , thus slowing the economy , raising the unemployment rate , and reducing the growth of wages – on the theory that this was necessary to keep inflation from getting out of control .
Before the 1990s , the Nairu for the US economy was generally considered to be between 5.8 % and 6.6 % .
The empirical evidence for this theory was always very weak .
After unemployment fell below 4.5 % in 1997 , and inflation still did not accelerate , Fed chair Alan Greenspan finally realised that this theory was wrong – and eventually abandoned it .
And now , International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) chief economist Oliver Blanchard , with a new paper Rethinking Macroeconomic Policy ( pdf ) , offers that the preferred 2 % inflation target of most central banks may be too low .
He asks whether 4 % would be better .
The paper questions other central bank orthodoxies and is likely to cause a bit of a stir in the economics profession .
The problem of " independent " central banks is even more serious for low - and middle - income countries than for the rich countries , since they need more co-operation from the central bank with regard to development policy .
In Argentina 's case , it is questionable whether the country could have even begun the remarkable economic recovery that started in 2002 , in which the economy grew more than 60 % in six years , if its central bank had the kind of independence that the US Federal Reserve has .
One of the government 's most important economic policies required the central bank to target a stable and competitive real exchange rate , something that would be anathema to most central bankers .
( Interestingly , Blanchard also now suggests that central banks in emerging market economies may have good reason to pay attention to exchange rates and try to reduce their volatility . )
Here in the United States , the Federal Reserve 's Federal Open Market Committee meets every six weeks to set policy , including short - term interest rates .
Five of the 12 voting members are regional Fed presidents , chosen by local boards where the banking industry is heavily represented .
The CEO of JP Morgan Chase sits on the board of the powerful New York Fed .
As sometimes happens , the business press – with the help of much of the economics profession – has turned reality on its head .
The problem is not that central banks need to be " independent " of political influence – rather they need to be held accountable to the public instead of answering to the all - powerful financial sector .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Stocks zigzagged Thursday in cautious trading ahead of Friday 's big jobs report as investors considered the day 's economic news , Bank of America 's plan to pay back the government $ 45 billion in aid and the latest from Washington .
Investors were also keeping an eye on the dollar , which fluctuated versus other major currencies , and a joint venture between General Electric and Comcast .
The Dow Jones industrial average ( INDU ) lost 86 points , or 0.8 % .

Stocks gained in the early going , with Bank of America 's news lifting the broader financial sector , but the financial sector turned mixed and the advance lost steam as the session wore on .
After watching the market rally more than 60 % of the March 9 lows , many investors are now hunkering down in the last weeks of the year .
" Most investors have seen dramatic swings in their portfolios this year and there 's a bias against making any big changes in this last month , " said Larry Glazer , managing director at Mayflower Advisors .
" There 's a complacency going into year end that 's going to make the jobs report less of a market mover than it might otherwise be . "
Market breadth was negative .
On the New York Stock Exchange , losers beat winners nearly two to one on volume of 1.13 billion shares .
On the Nasdaq , decliners topped advancers by a narrow margin on volume of 2.02 billion shares .
Stocks struggled Wednesday , one day after the Dow industrials closed at a 14 - month high .
GM 's management shakeup , record gold prices above $ 1,210 an ounce and mixed readings on the job market were all in play .
Also in focus :
The Senate Banking Committee was holding its confirmation hearing on Ben Bernanke 's second term as Federal Chairman .
Although Bernanke is widely expected to get the go - ahead to serve a second term , some Senators have been critical of the span of the Fed 's power .
Committee chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , gave his support to Bernanke in the morning , but also said some of the bank 's current powers should be stripped .
Jobs and economy :
The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment last week fell to 457,000 from a revised 466,000 the previous week , the lowest level in 15 months .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com thought the number would rise to 480,000 .
The report had only a minor impact on trading ahead of Friday 's bigger monthly jobs report .
Employers are expected to have cut 125,000 from their payrolls after reducing 190,000 in the previous month , according to estimates .
The unemployment rate , generated by a separate survey , is expected to have held steady at 10.2 % .
Third - quarter productivity was revised down to an 8.1 % annualized unit rate from a previous reading of 9.5 % .

Why Costa Rica scores well on the happiness index
By James Painter
BBC News
Costa Rica is known for its biological diversity and richness Costa Rica - green and happy ?
Whatever the outcome of the presidential elections on Sunday , one thing seems certain .
The country will continue to break the mould .
Central America is a region still associated with coups and civil strife , but Costa Rica has no army .
It was abolished in 1949 .
Successive governments have poured money into books , not bullets .
Not even the recent threat of the Mexican drugs war spilling over has led to calls for the army 's return .
It was also the first developing country to state its aim of being carbon neutral ( by 2021 ) , in part through the mass planting of trees .
Official figures suggest that it has bucked the trend of losing its forests : more than half its territory is now covered in trees , compared to 20 % in the 1980s .
And then there 's Costa Rica 's reputation for being one of the happiest and greenest countries in the world .
It regularly appears top - or near the top - of international surveys .
It is usually the only developing country to do so .
The 2010 Environmental Performance Index was published last month by experts at Yale and Columbia Universities .
Using 10 categories and 25 different measurements , Costa Rica was placed third out of 163 countries , up from fifth two years ago .
PRESIDENTIAL POLL Voters : Must be 18 or older Winner must get 40 % - plus to avoid run-off President elected for four - year term Main candidates : Laura Chinchilla - National Liberation Party
Otto Guevara - Libertarian Movement
Otton Solis - Citizens ' Action Party Only Iceland and Switzerland outperformed it .
The UK came 14th , the US 61st .
" Things are n't perfect in Costa Rica , " Christine Kim from Yale University told the BBC .
" But basically the country does care about the environment .
Other governments shove it down towards the bottom of their priorities . "
The latest version of the Happy Planet Index compiled by the New Economics Foundation ( NEF ) , placed Costa Rica on top of every country in the world .
It makes an explicit link between happiness and the environment , and combines three key variables - what people say about their life satisfaction , their longevity and their ecological footprint .
Open cast mining Costa Ricans have a high life expectancy - 78.5 years - and a low ecological footprint , although the NEF says it still needs to do better .
Some analysts question the validity of such international surveys , in part because they rely on self - reported happiness .
And some non-governmental organisations , like COHA in Washington , question Costa Rica 's green credentials when the government recently allowed a Canadian company to start open cast mining for gold .
But greenness does seem to permeate both public policy and the private lives of Costa Ricans .
The country pioneered a carbon tax in 1997 which is used in part to pay landowners and indigenous communities about $ 65 ( £ 41 ) a hectare not to chop down trees .
Well over 90 % of its energy supply comes from renewable sources .
I can not be happy when the number of poor people is increasing
Bishop Melvin Jimenez Representatives from the business community , churches , diplomats , and farmers say they follow green policies , either voluntarily or because of the law .
" Every time I construct any new building , I have to get a certificate from the national environment office that I am not damaging the environment , " says Juan Francisco Montealegre , who owns a construction company .
" For example , they have to be sure sewage will not contaminate nearby rivers . "
" I am very aware of my carbon footprint , " says Pilar Saborio , Costa Rica 's ambassador to the UK .
" President ( Oscar ) Arias has asked cabinet ministers , vice - ministers and heads of government institutions to offset their flights out of their own pocket . "
If elected , Laura Chinchilla would be the first woman to be president Bishop Melvin Jimenez , from the Lutheran Church , told the BBC it was his church 's policy to support a range of green initiatives , including " ecological sanctuaries " where congregations learn to grow crops , including medicinal plants , in an environmentally sound way .
" I have my own organic garden where I grow carrots and other vegetables , I recycle and I use the car as little as possible , " he says .
Ricardo Ulate , a cattle farmer and adviser to the government on climate change , says that in the past 10 years he has planted trees on what was pastureland to improve the biodiversity on his farm , and has given up one of his two cars .
Pura vida
But does this " greenness " make Costa Ricans happier ?
" Yes , " says Mr Ulate .
" Now I have a simpler , less materialistic life , more in tune with nature . "
" We do n't have a sensation of death , " says Mr Montealegre .
" Nothing is arid here , you can see life everywhere . "
He points out that Costa Ricans often answer the question ' How are you ? ' with the phrase " pura vida " .
It literally translates as " pure life " but roughly means " cool " or " everything 's fine " .
But amid such upbeat views , Bishop Jimenez is more circumspect .
" I can not be happy when the number of poor people is increasing , " he says .
" And when the government is allowing open pit mining and exercising no control over multinationals growing melons and pineapples .
International studies show they are using excessive amounts of agrochemicals . "
Analysts say that Costa Ricans ' apparent happiness could be down to a whole series of factors in addition to greenness : strong social networks of friends , families and neighbours ; ubiquitous social and education programmes ; and tolerance of social divisions and different opinions .
Mr Montealegre says there is another factor .
" A popular piece of philosophy in Costa Rica says no argument or quarrel should last more than three days , " he says .

Anyone else surprised three teams that many thought would be in the market for a goalie -- Philadelphia , Chicago and Washington -- stayed quiet on that front ?
Of the three , Philadelphia seemed to be the favorite to make a move , with Ray Emery 's season - ending hip injury and Michael Leighton never having skated in an NHL playoff game .
But GM Paul Holmgren is willing to roll the dice with Leighton and backup Brian Boucher One rumor had the Flyers interested in Florida 's Tomas Vokoun , but the asking price of center Jeff Carter was too rich for Holmgren .
There also was supposed interest in Nashville 's Dan Ellis , but nothing came of that , either .
Michael Leighton is playing confident since he ’s been in the net , " Holmgren told reporters .
" I do n't see any reason for that to change .
I think the team has the belief and a faith in him and I think are playing very well in front of him .
" Caps coach Bruce Boudreau also is confident in his three - headed goalie rotation of Jose Theodore Semyon Varlamov and Michal Neuvirth " People look for faults on a team , " Boudreau said .
" We all want the negatives .
You can't balk at our offense so you look at our defense .
We 're fine .
" NHL Network Craig Button made a great correlation between what the plan seems to be with the Flyers , Caps and Blackhawks and the Canadiens , when they opted for Ken Dryden for the 1971 playoffs .
You can read all about it here The Thrashers ' only deal on deadline day was to acquire left wing Clarke MacArthur from Buffalo in exchange for 2011 third - and fourth - round draft picks .
MacArthur , 24 , had 13 goals and 13 assists in 60 games for the Sabres .
Thrashers general manager Don Waddell described him as a second - or third - line player who is a really good skater with good hockey sense .
"
He plays hard , plays with grit , " Waddell said of the 5 - foot - 11 , 191 - pounder .
" He 's not overly big , but he plays bigger than his size .
Our team is really starting -- if you watch our game ( Tuesday ) -- speed is really starting to become very important on the team and our game .
He gets around the ice as well as anyone .
" Waddell said he thought the acquisition , along with that of forward Evgeny Artyukhin on Monday , was a statement to players and fans that the team acted as buyers and not sellers .
He said he feels confident the Thrashers can get in the playoffs with the players they have .
However , one immediate problem is that the Thrashers have 15 forwards now .
" We recognize that 's going to be an issue , " Waddell said .
" We 've got everybody healthy right now , which is a very good thing .
But we have 17 games this month .
To think we 're going to get through this stretch being healthy would be very fortunate .
" So we 'll address it and now we 've got competition for jobs and I look at it as a very healthy situation .
" Craig Button has been tireless for NHL.com in breaking down the 20 - something deals that have moved by 3 p.m. Wednesday .
For this latest batch of videos , Button got a little help from NHL.com staffers Dan Rosen and Shawn P. Roarke .
Check out the latest contributions :
One team in each conference dominated the action on trade deadline day .
In the East , it was Washington with GM George McPhee making a series of moves to further position his team for a run deep in the playoffs .
In the West , it was Phoenix that surprisingly dominated the headlines .
Washington , which has an 11 - point lead in the east , got tougher and more tested with a quartet of deals that imported Scott Walker and Joe Corvo in separate deals with Carolina , while also adding big center Eric Belanger from Minnesota and big defenseman Milan Jurcina from Columbus .
Both Walker and Corvo helped the Carolina Hurricanes on a surprising run to the Eastern Conference Finals .
Walker scored the series - winning goal against Boston in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals and finished with a goal and 6 assists in 18 postseason games .
This season , he has 3 goals and 5 points in 33 games .
But , Walker 's value comes mostly in the room and in the toughness departments .
Corvo , meanwhile , is an offensive defenseman who has battled through injuries this year .
Last season , he tied his career high with 14 goals and finished with 37 points .
He had 7 points in 18 playoff games .
Corvo will help tremendously with Washington 's already lethal power play , spelling Mike Green with some second - unit duty .
Belanger , meanwhile , is a big - bodied center that can handle the physical grind of the playoffs and can use his size to wear down opposing forwards .
Out West , it was Phoenix GM Don Maloney that stole the show .
In the biggest individual deal of the day , Maloney rolled the dice by trading Peter Mueller and Kevin Porter -- young players with huge offensive upsides -- in exchange for Colorado 's Wojtek Wolski , who is a proven 20 - goal scorer .
Maloney also added Mathieu Schneider from Vancouver to help with the power play , as well as defenseman Derek Morris from Boston , another offensive guy on the blue line .
Finally , he added Lee Stempniak from Toronto , a young forward with the potential to score 20 goals a season .
Stempniak did not work out in Toronto after moving from the St. Louis Blues , where he had a promising start to his career .
-- Shawn P. RoarkeTwo players that were rumored to be on the move today are staying put .
Carolina 's Ray Whitney will remain with the Hurricanes , who traded both Scott Walker and Aaron Ward on Wednesday .
According to reports ,
Whitney had several teams interested in his services , but Carolina could not find its asking price .
Plus , the need to trade Whitney evaporated to a great deal after the Ward and Walker salaries were moved off the books .
Also , Edmonton 's Sheldon Souray , a hard - shooting defenseman , was in play despite the fact that he is sidelined with a broken hand .
There was a thought that teams would be interested in Souray because he would be back by mid-march .
Now , however , Souray is in the hospital , being treated for an infection after the surgery .
-- Shawn P. RoarkeDan Rosen has the analysis of perhaps the boldest trade of the day , a move that sees Peter Mueller and Kevin Porter moved to Colorado in exchange for Wojtek Wolski , a proven 20 - goal scorer : Colorado and Phoenix are hoping fresh starts produce positive results for Peter Mueller and Wojtek Wolski
In what could be called the biggest move of the day so far , the Avalanche shipped Wolski to the Coyotes in exchange for Mueller and Kevin Porter , a former Hobey Baker Award winner from the University of Michigan who has appeared in only four NHL games this season .
Wolski and Mueller are top - six quality forwards who are 24 and 21 , respectively .
Wolski has had the better season of the two with 17 goals , 30 assists and a plus - 15 rating in 62 games for the resurgent Avalanche .
He 's only three points shy of his career - high of 50 , a number he hit as a rookie in 2006 - 07 .
Wojtek Wolski is a terrific young offensive player , " Phoenix GM Don Maloney .
" He is a talented goal scorer that will help us offensively and on the power play .
He has great size and is just entering the prime of his career .
"
In two - plus seasons with the Coyotes , Mueller never could find his niche .
He struggled even more under Dave Tippett " Peter is a skilled young player who has a tremendous upside , " said Avalanche General Manager Greg Sherman .
" We feel he will be an important addition to our lineup .
Kevin will add more depth up front .
He spent some extended time in the NHL last season and we look forward to having him join our organization .

Jordan Leopold Defense - FLA GOALS : 7 | ASST : 11 | PTS : 18
SOG : 69 | +/-: -7
Craig Button is still churning out the analysis here at NHL headquarters in midtown Manhattan .
Here are some of his latest takes on the action that has gone down today .
NHL.com 's Adam Kimelman weighs in on the move that sent Aaron Ward from Carolina to the Anaheim Ducks The Anaheim Ducks have added a veteran presence to their blueline , acquiring defenseman Aaron Ward from the Carolina Hurricanes Ward , 37 , is a three - time Stanley Cup winner who can provide a strong physical element .
In 60 games , he has 138 hits and led the Hurricanes with 122 blocked shots .
Those numbers would put him at the top of the list among Ducks defensemen .
He also has 1 goal , 11 points and 54 penalty minutes .
In 822 NHL games over 15 seasons with the Red Wings , Hurricanes , Rangers and Bruins , he has 149 points and 728 penalty minutes .
Aaron
Ward brings valuable experience and is a proven winner with three Stanley Cup championships , ” said Ducks Executive Vice President / General Manager Bob Murray .
" We are pleased to bring him on board .
" It was a move Ward was n't expecting , as the Ducks sit 11th in the Western Conference , three points out of a playoff spot , but he told TSN it 's one he 's looking forward to .
" Just watching them over the last two weeks before the Olympic break , I 'd love to go into that situation , " he said .
" Just go in , be quiet , not rock the boat and be part of their success .
" For more on this story , go here NHL. com 's Dan Rosen also has a first look at the move that sent Martin Skoula from Toronto , where he had been traded Tuesday night from Pittsburgh , to New Jersey .
He 'll have more on this deal as the day progresses :
Martin Skoula did n't even have time to meet up with his new teammates in Toronto before had had even newer teammates in New Jersey .
Skoula , who was traded by Pittsburgh to Toronto late Tuesday night , was shipped to the Devils roughly 12 hours later .
Toronto received New Jersey 's 2010 fifth - round pick in the deal .
The Leafs had acquired Skoula as well as 21 - year - old forward Luca Caputi from Pittsburgh for Alexei Ponikarovsky .
While Caputi is part of the Leafs ' future , Leafs GM Brian Burke never had any intention of keeping Skoula , who can become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season .
Skoula will be reunited in New Jersey with coach Jacques Lemaire , who he played under during his three - plus seasons in Minnesota .
When Paul Martin returns to the Devils ' lineup , likely within a week , New Jersey will have eight defensemen on the roster .
For more on this story , including an in - depth fantasy analaysis , go here NHL.com 's Dan Rosen has the insight into the Dennis Seidenberg deal that moved the veteran defenseman from Florida to Boston : GM Peter Chiarelli wasted no time replacing Derek Morris .
The Bruins acquired defenseman Dennis Seidenberg and a prospect from the Florida Panthers in exchange for Craig Weller Byron Bitz and a second - round draft pick .
Morris was traded earlier Wednesday to Phoenix for a fourth round pick in 2011 .
Seidenberg , who played for Germany in the Olympics , had 23 points and a minus - 3 rating in 62 games for Florida this season .
He spent the previous two - plus seasons with Carolina and before that played for Phoenix and Philadelphia .
Seidenberg has 107 points in 351 NHL games .
The prospect heading to Boston is reportedly Ohio State defenseman Matt Bartkowski , who the Panthers selected in the seventh round two years ago .
Bitz had nine points in 45 games for the Bruins this season .
Weller has spent the entire season in the AHL .
For more , including the fantasy impact , go here NHL.com 's Mike Morreale has the latest on the Derek Morris deal : Derek Morris is back with the Phoenix Coyotes The Boston Bruins made it possible when they kicked off the final day of trading Wednesday by dealing the veteran blue liner to the Coyotes in exchange for a conditional draft choice in the 2011 NHL Entry .
Morris , who spent parts of five seasons in Phoenix before earning brief stints with the New York Rangers and Boston Bruins , was willing to waive his no -trade clause approached by the team on Friday after realizing his destination would be Phoenix .
" We are very excited to have brought Derek Morris back to the Coyotes organization , " Coyotes General Manager Don Maloney said .
" Derek is a talented , versatile defenseman who will strengthen our blue line .
His leadership and tenacity will be welcomed in our dressing room .
" Morris , a pending unrestricted free agent on July 1 , still owns a home in Scottsdale .
In 58 games for the Bruins , Morris had produced 3 goals and 25 points while averaging 22 minutes a game .
In 850 career games spanning 11 - plus seasons with five different clubs , the 31 - year old Morris has 79 goals and 286 assists .

Here are some of his early offering from today .
Button will have more throughout tha day , so stay tuned to NHL.com .
Alex Ponikarovsky is this year 's answer to the trivia question of which winger will play with Sidney Crosby and / or Evgeni Malkin .
The Pens officially acquired Ponikarovsky from Toronto in exchange for prospect Luca Caputi and defenseman Martin Skoula Ponikarovsky , a 6 - foot - 4 , 229 - pound left wing , has 19 goals and 41 points in 61 games .
Those numbers should go up if , as anticipated , he plays with one of the Penguins ' two star centers .
Caputi led the Pens ' AHL team with 23 goals ; he had a goal and an assist in four games with the Pens earlier this season .
He 's a Toronto native the Pens took in the fourth round of the 2007 Entry Draft .
Skoula was signed by the Pens as a depth defenseman and had 3 goals and 8 points in 33 games , but had spent most of his time in recent weeks as a scratch .
The yearly answer to what winger will play with Sidney Crosby and / or Evgeni Malkin looks this season to be Alexei Ponikarovsky .
The Pens reportely will pick up the Toronto forward in exchange for prospect Luca Caputi and defenseman Martin Skoula Ponikarovsky , a 6 - foot - 4 , 229 - pound left wing , has 19 goals and 41 points in 61 games .
Caputi led the Pens ' AHL team with 23 goals ; he had a goal and an assist in four games with the Pens earlier this season .
He 's a Toronto native the Pens took in the fourth round of the 2007 Entry Draft .
More if and when this deal becomes official .

Turco likely staying in Dallas
02.24.2010 / 03:45 p.m. ET
The Dallas Stars placed goaltender Alex Auld on waivers Wednesday , according to The Dallas Morning News .
The move appears to be a sign that Marty Turco wo n't be going anyhwere at the trade deadline .
Marty Turco Goalie - DAL RECORD : 19-15-9
GAA : 2.63 | SVP : 0.915
" I do n't want to ever say never , but we would have to be blown away with a great offer to deal him now , '' Nieuwendyk said of Turco .
" We feel this is the best move for our team going forward , so that 's the plan right now . ''
The Stars have climbed to within one point of eighth place in the Western Conference , and it's been thanks largely to the play of Turco .
He 's 4 - 1 - 1 in his last six games with two shutouts .
Turco is expected to share time with recently acquired goaltender Kari Lehtonen over the Stars ' final 21 games .
Lehtonen has n't played a game this season after having two back surgeries during the offseason .

Are Capitals seeking depth ?
02.24.2010 / 09:00 a.m. ET
An interesting report on TheFourthPeriod.com has the Eastern Conference - leading Washington Capitals in the market to add some depth to their already potent lineup .
Barret Jackman Defense - STL GOALS : 2 | ASST : 13 | PTS : 15
SOG : 55 | +/-: 6
The web site states that " according to several reports " Washington GM George McPhee might be interested in acquiring a physical , stay - at - home type defenseman and / or a veteran forward before the March 3 trade deadline .
McPhee apparently had interest in former Carolina Hurricanes veteran center Matt Cullen , who was traded to the Ottawa Senators right before the Olympic roster freeze .
It is now rumored that McPhee may be in discussions with St. Louis Blues General Manager Larry Pleau for defenseman Barret Jackman , who has a no - trade clause in his contract , and Columbus GM Scott Howson for unrestricted free agent forward Raffi Torres .
Jackman has 2 goals , 15 points and a plus - 6 rating in 51 games for St. Louis .
The 17th overall draft choice in 1999 has spent his entire 7 - plus seasons with the Blues .
For now , it appears McPhee is satisfied with goalies Jose Theodore and Semyon Varlamov .
02.23.2010 / 11:15 a.m. ET
The Ottawa Citizen is reporting that it is almost assured that Senators General Manager Bryan Murray will be adding a defenseman -- or two -- to his depleted blue line following the Olympic roster freeze .
When the Sens return to practice on Wednesday , only three defensemen will be on the ice , including Chris Phllips , Matt Carkner and Erik Karlsson .
That number will increase to five when Russia 's Anton Volchenkov and Czech Republic 's Filip Kuba return from the Olympics .
According to the Citizen 's Ken Warren , Murray could recall Brian Lee from the club 's AHL affiliate in Binghamton but the trade route is more of a likely scenario .
Pavel Kubina Defense - ATL GOALS : 5 | ASST : 29 | PTS : 34
SOG : 119 | +/-: 6
The Senators dealt defenseman Alexandre Picard to the Carolina Hurricanes in exchange for center Matt Cullen on Feb. 12 and the team will be without Chris Campoli , who suffered a left knee injury one day earlier , for the foreseeable future .
There 's been speculation that Murray could strike a deal with Atlanta for Pavel Kubina , Florida for Dennis Seidenberg or Jordan Leopold , Nashville for Dan Hamhuis or Columbus for Brendan Bell , who is currently playing for the Syracuse in the AHL .
Either way , the deal by Murray will likely be for a rental player this season as the Senators continue their surge up the Eastern Conference standings .
The hope is that the organization 's ninth - overall draft choice in 2009 -- Jared Cowen -- will compete for a roster spot next season .
Cowen has rebounded nicely for the Spokane Chiefs of the Western Hockey League this season after suffering a right ACL tear that ended his 2008 - 09 campaign .
-- Mike G. Morreale
02.23.2010 / 10:50 a.m. ET
According to sources , unrestricted free agent defenseman Dan Hamhuis of the Nashville Predators might very well be the first player dealt when the Olympic roster freeze if finally lifted March 1 .
Dan Hamhuis Defense - NSH GOALS : 4 | ASST : 12 | PTS : 16
SOG : 83 | +/-: 1
It is reported that Predators general manager David Poile and Hamhuis are not even close to a new contract and that he could be traded for the right parts -- perhaps an experienced blue liner , offensive sniper or a high draft pick .
Hamhuis , who has 4 goals and 16 points in 57 games with the Predators this season , is reportedly being courted by the Boston Bruins , Pittsburgh Penguins , Ottawa Senators and Buffalo Sabres .
Nashville , which certainly would n't want to do anything drastic as it is in the thick of the Western Conference playoff picture , could use another proven goal scorer .
The team has two players with 15 - or - more goals and J.P. Dumont and Patric Hornqvist are tied for the team - lead with 37 points apiece .
The Bruins might be willing to part with Michael Ryder , but his $ 4 million remaining on his deal might not be too attractive .
Hamhuis is in his sixth NHL season , all with the Predators .
02.19.2010 / 9:35 a.m. ( ET )
With the Olympics earning most of the headlines , the NHL trade rumors have certainly subsided but are sure to pick up with the conclusion of the gold - medal game on Feb. 28 .
The NHL trade deadline is March 3 at 3 p.m. ( ET ) .
Ray Whitney Left Wing - CAR GOALS : 19 | ASST : 29 | PTS : 48
SOG : 128 | +/-: -1
Perhaps the most rumored player on the market is Carolina veteran wing Ray Whitney , who has posted 19 goals and 48 points in 59 games this season .
Darren Dreger of TSN.ca reported that Whitney might very well be headed to Los Angeles .
Whitney , who has spent the last five of his 17 NHL seasons in Carolina , would waive his no - trade clause for a multi- year extension .
That was the only sticking point to getting a deal done before the Olympic freeze , according to Dreger .
Whitney had asked for a three - year extension and Los Angeles offered a one - year deal .
If the Kings were to consider a two - year extension , a trade with the Hurricanes would be imminent .
It 's being reported that Carolina would receive a first - round pick and a possible prospect from Los Angeles in exchange for Whitney .
In 1,051 career games , Whitney has 322 goals and 859 points .
-- Mike G. Morreale
02.15.2010 / 7:10 p.m. ET
Aaron Portzline of the The Columbus Dispatch reports that Blue Jackets General Manager Scott Howson will be a " seller " when the trade deadline rolls around next month .
Raffi Torres Left Wing - CBJ GOALS : 19 | ASST : 11 | PTS : 30
SOG : 99 | +/-: -7
The Jackets have three players on their roster scheduled to become unrestricted free agents on July 1 -- Fredrik Modin , Raffi Torres and Milan Jurcina .
While Modin has a no - trade clause attached to his contract , wing Torres might be the most attractive rental for teams seeking that missing piece down the stretch .
Torres is sixth on the team in scoring with 30 points , including 19 goals , in 55 games .
The 28 - year - old Toronto native is in his eighth season -- second with the Blue Jackets .
His 19 goals are the most since the 2005 - 06 campaign when he struck for 27 with the Edmonton Oilers .

02.15.2010 / 11:15 a.m. ET
Now that Philadelphia Flyers General Manager Paul Holmgren has admitted his intentions of keeping goalie Ray Emery sidelined three weeks to help promote the healing of his injured hip , the big question is do the Flyers have any intentions of providing Michael Leighton with any support ?
Dwayne Roloson Goalie - NYI RECORD : 19-13-6
GAA : 2.86 | SVP : 0.908
There are reports that have the Flyers interested in Islanders goalie Dwayne Roloson .
According to Chris Botta of NYI Point Blank , the Flyers , Ottawa , Washington , Chicago and Colorado have expressed interest in the veteran Roloson .
Despite the fact he 's 40 , Roloson has played a big part in the Isles turnaround this season -- he 's 19 - 13 - 6 with a 2.86 GAA and .908 save percentage .
In addition to Roloson , Botta also reports that Isles defenseman Andy Sutton , an unrestricted free agent on July 1 , has also drawn the attention of the Flyers , Devils , Penguins , Senators , Capitals , Blackhawks , Avalanche and Flames .
Sutton , a 6 - foot - 6 , 245 - pound shutdown blue liner , was signed by the Islanders as a free agent in August 2007 .
In 54 games this season , he 's notched 4 goals , 12 points and 73 penalty minutes .
Most impressive is the fact Sutton leads his team in hits ( 155 ) and blocked shots ( 153 ) and is also responsible for 21 takeaways .
Sutton might just be the finest defensive rental on the market at this stage .
02.08.2010 / 9:40 a.m. ET
Pierre LeBrun of ESPN.com has reported that Florida goalie Tomas Vokoun , who has one year remaining on his contract , has been pulled off the trade market -- for the time being .
Tomas Vokoun Goalie - FLA RECORD : 19-21-10
GAA : 2.36 | SVP : 0.931
The reason is simple : Vokoun ( 19 - 19 - 9 ) , who owns a 2.34 goals - against average and .930 save percentage , has been the biggest reason the Panthers are in the hunt for their first Stanley Cup playoff appearance in nine seasons .
Florida is currently 12th in the Eastern Conference with 57 points -- two behind eighth - seeded Philadelphia .
The 11th - season veteran , who'll be the starting goalie for the Czech Republic at the 2010 Olympics in Vancouver later this month , has already notched a career - high 7 shutouts this season .
One reason Vokoun 's name has surfaced in trade talks has been the recent play of the organization 's biggest prospect , Jacob Markstrom , of Brynas , Sweden .
Markstrom was drafted 31st overall in 2008 .
Markstrom , 20 , has been playing exceptionally well in the Elitserien ( Swedish Elite League ) since his arrival in February 2008 .
He 's actually considered the best goalie in Sweden .
Markstrom has started 34 games and leads Elitserien in all the major goaltending categories , including a goals - against average ( 1.96 ) and save percentage ( .929 ) .
He also has four shutouts .
-- Mike G. Morreale
02.08.2010 / 9:22 a.m. ET
The San Jose Sharks bolstered their defensive corps on Sunday with the acquisition of Carolina blue liner Niclas Wallin .
The Sharks also acquired a fifth - round pick in 2010 and sent a 2010 second - round selection , that previously belonged to Buffalo , to the Hurricanes .
" We thank Nic for his time in Carolina , " said Hurricanes GM Jim Rutherford .
" He has been a key part of the Hurricanes for the past nine seasons , and we wish him and his family well . "
The Hurricanes drafted Wallin as a 25 - year - old in 2000 , and he spent his entire nine - season NHL career with the Hurricanes .
The Boden , Sweden , native ranks third among defensemen in franchise history with 517 regular - season games played , and second to only Glen Wesley ( 729 ) in that category since the team 's relocation to North Carolina .
He 's totaled 69 regular - season points ( 18 goals ) to rank eighth all - time in scoring among defensemen in Carolina .
He ranks second among all Hurricanes ' players with 69 playoff games played , and scored three overtime game - winning goals while helping the Hurricanes to the Stanley Cup Finals in 2002 , the Stanley Cup championship in 2006 and the Eastern Conference Finals in 2009 .
" We think he is the right combination of a playoff - hardened player and also has tremendous character , " Sharks GM Doug Wilson said .
" We think he fits in and complements and enhances our team .
The beauty is we did n't have to give up any player on our team to add a player like Niclas . "
San Jose had been seeking a defenseman with experience as evidenced by the fact the club had been moving blue liners to and from its AHL affiliate in Worcester most of the season .

Injuries to Dan Boyle and Marc - Edouard Vlasic may have spurred San Jose GM Doug Wilson to jump into the trade market .
Various reports suggest that the League - leading Sharks are interested in Carolina defenseman Niclas Wallin from the Carolina Hurricanes , who have had a miserable season and are out of the playoff race in the East .
Niclas Wallin Defense - CAR GOALS : 0 | ASST : 5 | PTS : 5
SOG : 50 | +/-: -5
Wallin did not play last night against Calgary , held out of the lineup for unspecified reasons .
The defenseman , who has 5 assists and a minus - 5 rating in 47 games this season , would have to waive his no - trade clause to make the deal happen .
Who Carolina GM Jim Rutherford gets in return remains a mystery , but the venerable GM has publicly stated he wants young players or future draft picks .
Wallin , a fourth - round pick of the Hurricanes in 2000 , is in his ninth season with the Hurricanes .
He has 51 assists and 69 points in 517 career games .
Despite somewhat pedestrian numbers this season , Wallin is attractive because of his ability to play solidly in his own end , as well his rich postseason experience .
Wallin has won a Stanley Cup with the Hurricanes and has made two other playoff runs of at least three rounds .
He has just three postseason goals in 69 playoff games , but , ironically , each has come in overtime .
The injuries to both Boyle and Vlasic are not considered serious , but life without two top - four defensemen has illustrated that some depth may be in order .
Wilson departed this week on a scouting trip that will last until the NHL's Olympic roster freeze , which falls on Feb. 12 .
He admitted he will be taking in a number of junior and college games to scout both his own prospects , who may be used to make deals happen , and assets from potential trade partners

LeBrun is reporting that Rick Dudley , Atlanta 's associate GM , was at the Prudential Center on Wednesday scouting an AHL game between the Lowell Devils and Hartford Wolfpack , the New York Rangers ' top affiliate .
He 's also reporting that a Canucks source told ESPN.com that the Canucks do n't consider themselves in the hunt any more .
Report : Flyers are out on Kovy and more speculation
02.03.2010 / 9:20 p.m. ET
According to Tim Panaccio of CSNPhilly.com , the Flyers are not in the running anymore .
Team sources told Panaccio that the team fears signing Kovalchuk , who is can become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 , would " mortgage our future . "
Kovalchuk is reportedly seeking more than $ 10 million per season , and the Flyers do n't appear willing to pay that .
A Bruins ' source told LeBrun that the team is " not in it " because the price the Thrashers are asking for in return is too high , though he said another NHL source said the Bruins are still interested .
Thrashers GM
Don Waddell did spend this past weekend in the Northeast , taking in games in Philadelphia and New Jersey , where the Kings were playing Sunday night .
He was seen talking to Flyers GM Paul Holmgren , but NHL.com cannot confirm that he talked to Kings GM Dean Lombardi at Prudential Center on Sunday .
LeBrun is speculating that the Kings are the " most logical destination " for Kovalchuk .
However , he also wrote that a Kings ' source told him that they too believe the price is too high right now .
Again , this can all change within the hour , but it is well known that the Thrashers are looking for a player or two who can have an impact on their lineup this season as they try to stay in the playoff race despite trading their superstar .
Atlanta is also likely seeking a high - end prospect and a high draft pick .
Finally , LeBrun is also reporting that the Thrashers offered Kovalchuk an eight - year contract worth $ 80 million , but Waddell had not heard back so he had to move to tell the interested teams to pony up their best offers for Kovalchuk .

Report : Take the Bruins out of Kovalchuk Sweepstakes
02.03.2010 / 9:05 p.m. ET
The latest from ESPN.com 's Pierre LeBrun has sources telling him that the Boston Bruins are no longer in the running for Ilya Kovalchuk 's services and the Vancouver Canucks and New Jersey Devils are only monitoring the situation .
That would leave the Los Angeles Kings and Philadelphia Flyers as the two most likely suitors for Kovalchuk as of right now , but this story is seemingly changing by the minute .

Kovalchuk update
02.03.2010 / 6:55 p.m. ET
You can apparently add the New Jersey Devils into the mix in the Ilya Kovalchuk Derby .
ESPN's Pierre LeBrun is reporting that the Devils , Philadelphia Flyers , Boston Bruins , Vancouver Canucks and Los Angeles Kings are still in the hunt for Atlanta 's star forward .
However , LeBrun also says the Kings may be more interested in a deal for Carolina forward Ray Whitney , who would n't cost nearly as much .
However , Whitney has a no - trade clause and reportedly wants a three - year extension that the Kings do n't want to offer .
LeBrun cites " sources close to the situation " saying the deal could happen " by the weekend . " stay tuned .

Reports : Kovalchuk could be traded tonight
According to various reports out of Canada , including TSN and RDS , Thrashers captain Ilya Kovalchuk was told by GM Don Waddell that he should expect a trade either within the next few hours or the next few days .
The Kings , Bruins , Rangers , Flyers and Blackhawks are reportedly interested .
Kovalchuk is the Thrashers all - time leader in games , points , goals and assists .
He is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent July 1 .
Kovalchuk spoke to Chris Vivlamore at the Atlanta Journal Constitution earlier today and had these comments :
" I'm the player and my job is to go on the ice and play hard .
We are all professionals .
I 've worked here for eight years and hopefully I will stay but you know it 's a business and you never know what 's going to happen . "
" You do n't want to be a distraction .
We are in a playoff race and we are only one point from the playoffs . "
" That 's why we have agents .
They talk to management .
Hopefully , we are going to figure something out . "

Shipping out of Boston ?
02.03.2010 / 1:43 p.m. ET
A report on TSN. ca today has Boston Bruins wing Michael Ryder , 29 , on the trade block .
Michael Ryder Right Wing - BOS GOALS : 12 | ASST : 8 | PTS : 20
SOG : 131 | +/-: 1
Ryder , who has 12 goals and 20 points in 54 games this season , signed a three - year contract with the team in 2008 .
At the time of the signing , it was thought the reason he signed with the Bruins was the fact he had nearly six seasons worth of play ( three in junior hockey , one in the AHL and two with the Canadiens ) under current Bruins coach Claude Julien .
The Bruins , who finished as the top seed in the East last season , currently sit 12th in the Conference with 55 points .
Ryder was drafted in the eighth round ( 216th overall ) by the Canadiens in 1998 .
He 's produced 138 goals and 280 points in 442 career games , which includes four seasons in Montreal .

Do n't be surprised if Thrashers captain Ilya Kovalchuk is traded soon , and by that we mean before the Olympics .
Chris Vivlamore of the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported Tuesday in his blog that trade talks have heated up in the last few days .
Also Tuesday , John Kincade of 680 the Fan in Atlanta , the Thrashers ' flagship radio station , reported the club had offered Kovalchuk the largest contract in franchise history , but it was turned down .
It is believed that the Kings , Rangers , Flyers and Bruins are high on the list of suitors for the Russian sniper who is Atlanta 's all - time leader in games , points , goals and assists .
The Blackhawks are reportedly interested as well .
Kovalchuk reportedly ducked the media after Tuesday 's 2 - 1 loss to Tampa Bay , dressing and leaving the locker room before it was opened to the press .
Thrashers coach John Anderson had this to say about the swirling trade rumors : " Quite honestly , Don ( Waddell ) and Kovalchuk have kept the negotiations behind closed doors .
Kovalchuk comes out and plays every day .
All of the stuff bothers him a little , but he 's a professional and is playing hard for the Atlanta Thrashers right now .
" When he was in New Jersey on Sunday , Atlanta GM Don Waddell told NHL.com that he was n't doing any more interviews about Kovalchuk 's status .
He apparently reiterated that to Vivlamore , who wrote that Waddell did tell him that he has n't had any contract negotiations with Kovalchuk 's agent , Jay Grossman , in over a week .
The NHL roster freeze goes into effect atand does n't end until 11:59 p.m. ET on Feb. 28 .
The trade deadline is 3 p.m. ET on March 3 .
At last count , there were five teams in the mix for Atlanta Thrashers captain Ilya Kovalchuk -- the Rangers , Bruins , Blackhawks , Kings and Flyers .
Ilya Kovalchuk Left Wing - ATL GOALS : 31 | ASST : 27 | PTS : 58
SOG : 177 | +/-: 2
Of course , if Atlanta GM Don Waddell has his way , the Thrashers captain will remain in Atlanta for the foreseeable future .
Still , options must be kept open .
Waddell actually had discussions with Flyers GM Paul Holmgren at last week 's game in Philadelphia .
The Atlanta GM has been scouting several teams , in fact , including the Flyers on Jan. 28 and the Kings on Jan. 31 in New Jersey .
Waddell and Holmgren , by the way , are both a part of Team USA 's Olympic management group .
" Find one winger , one defenseman that adds up to what Kovalchuk makes and the Flyers could do this deal , " one NHL executive said .
Holmgren preferred not to comment on his discussions with Atlanta .
Keep in mind center Jeff Carter is one of very few Flyers forwards who does n't have a no - trade clause within his contract but it 's assumed Carter is n't going anywhere .
02.02.2010 / 10:15 a.m. ET
Raffi Torres Left Wing - CBJ GOALS : 16 | ASST : 10 | PTS : 26
SOG : 89 | +/-: -5
02.02.2010 / 9:18 a.m. ET
02.02.2010 / 8:30 a.m. ET
" Does n't do anyone any good and it should be confidential , " Holmgren said .
Columbus forward Raffi Torres is on the block , according to Aaron Portzline of the Columbus Dispatch .
Portzline says that Blue jackets are looking for draft picks or prospects in return .
Torres , 28 , has 16 goals this season in 53 games .
He is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent this summer .
According to the report the team and player have not discussed a contract extension .
" I want to stay here and play hockey here , " Torres told Portzline .
" I 'm very happy here in Columbus .
To be honest , I have to stop thinking about ( a contract extension ) and just worry about what 's happening on the ice .
I do n't feel like I 've been playing my best hockey for the last couple of weeks or so .
" Torres may want to stay , but it will be hard to make that happen .
He is making clolse to $ 3 million this year , but is playing just 13 - plus minutes a game in mostly lower - line duty .
There is doubt that the Blue Jackets want to take such a hefty cap hit for a player they use in the second half of their forward rotation .
Therefore , GM Scott Howson might want to offload Torres before he reaches free agency .
And , with his club hanging on the fringes of a tough Western Conference race -- Blue Jackets were nine points out with 25 games remaining -- that option will come More and more appealing as the trade deadline approaches .
" Raffi has played very well for us , " general manager Scott Howson told Portzline .
" He has scored some really timely goals for us , he 's pretty versatile and he 's so very competitive .
"
The long - awaited deal that sent Olli Jokinen , as well as Brandon Prust , to New York for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins was completed early this morning .
Our man Brian Compton had all the details as soon as they broke and you can read the details here
The deal raises almost as many questions as it answers , though .
Are the Flames done dealing ?
That is the biggest question .
The Flames took on two more forwards in this deal after taking three from the Maple Leafs on Sunday in the Dion Phaneuf deal .
But , none of the forwards arriving is a natural center and that is certainly a position of weakness for the Flames at the moment .
So , will Darryl Sutter use his glut of NHL - caliber wings to make at least one more deal before the March 3 deadline ?
It would seem to be the case , but the Flames are playing things close to the vest .
Will Olli Jokinen thrive in New York City ?
He certainly did n't play to his potential in Calgary after being dealt for near the trade deadline last season .
Jokinen had flashes of brilliance , but could not parlay a plum assignment as the No. 1 center for elite forward Jarome Iginla into headlining duty .
Now , he is being asked to be the set - up man for Marian Gaborik , who already has more than 30 goals and may play a style more compatible to Jokinen 's game .
Another question is what does the acquisition of Prust mean for the tougher players currently on the Ranger roster ?
Aaron Voros was making some inroads after being a healthy scratch for much of the season .
Brashear has not had the desired impact since being signed to a free - agent deal this summer and dressed for just seven games in the month of January .
Prust , meanwhile , was making a name for himself in Calgary with his willingness to take on all comers in a bid to establish himself as a full - time player .
All of those questions and more will be answered in the course of the next month , but it seems entirely possible that neither the Flames nor the Rangers has finished with its roster re-making business .
-- Shawn P. RoarkeThe Calgary Flames put the finishing touches on their second trade in three days in the wake of their 10th loss in 11 games late Monday night when they shipped forwardsandto the New York Rangers for forwardsand
The big question , however , was what took so long ?
According to Larry Brooks of the New York Post , Kotalik had a three - team no - trade clause and , as fate would have it , one of those teams happened to be the Flames .
The trade was made official shortly after the Flames were defeated by the Flyers , 3 - 0 , at the Saddledome on Monday .
News of the deal was made public on Sunday by TSN .
Olli Jokinen Center - NYR GOALS : 11 | ASST : 24 | PTS : 35
SOG : 162 | +/-: 2
Jokinen , 31 , has skated in 56 games for Calgary this season , tallying 11 goals and 24 assists for 35 points , along with 53 penalty minutes and a plus - two rating .
He is tied for third in the NHL with five shootout tallies , including one game deciding goal .
He ranks second on the team in assists ( 24 ) , third in points ( 35 ) and is tied for third in goals ( 11 ) .
Originally drafted by the Los Angeles Kings with the third overall pick in the 1997 NHL Entry Draft , Jokinen has eclipsed the 30 - goal mark four times in his career , most recently in 2007 - 08 when he recorded 34 , including 18 power play goals which ranked third in the NHL .
Jokinen will represent Finland at the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in Vancouver , Canada and will be making his third Olympic appearance ( 2002 , 2006 , 2010 ) .
He helped lead Finland to the Silver Medal at the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino , Italy , tying for the tournament lead with 6 goals and ranking sixth with 8 points in eight games .
In addition , Jokinen was a member of the Silver Medal - winning Team Finland at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey .
He was dealt to Calgary by Phoenix at the 2009 trade deadline in exchange for Matthew Lombardi , Prust and a conditional first - round pick .
The Rangers are the sixth team Jokinen will have played for in his 11 seasons .
Prust , 25 , has skated in 43 games with Calgary , registering one goal and four assists , along with 98 penalty minutes and a plus - six rating .
His 98 penalty minutes lead the team , while his plus - six rating ranks second .
The 5 - 11 , 195 - pounder ranks second in the NHL in fighting majors with 18 .
Higgins has skated in 55 games this season , registering six goals and eight assists for 14 points , along with 32 penalty minutes .
He was acquired from Montreal along with Ryan McDonagh , Doug Janik and Pavel Valentenko , in exchange for Scott Gomez , Tom Pyatt and Mike Busto on June 30 , 2009 .
Kotalik has appeared in 45 games this season , recording eight goals and 14 assists for 22 points , along with 38 penalty minutes and a minus - 18 rating .
He signed with New York as an unrestricted free agent on July 9 , 2009 .

Dion Phaneuf Defense - TOR GOALS : 10 | ASST : 12 | PTS : 22
SOG : 138 | +/-: 3
With three new forwards coming over from the Leafs following Sunday 's trade , Flames coach Brent Sutter did some line juggling this morning at practice .
Matt Stajan , who just came over from the Leafs , will center the top line , with captain Jarome Iginla on the right , and Dustin Boyd on the left .
" It was good to get out there , " Stajan told the Flames '
Web site following the morning skate .
" It was a little different wearing red but it was good to get out there because there are some nerves and things , which is only natural . "
Daymond Langkow will center the second line , flanked by Rene Bourque and Curtis Glencross .
The third line will be centered by Olli Jokinen -- despite rumors of him being traded to the New York Rangers -- with newcomer Niklas Hagman on the left and Jamie Lundmark on the right .
Brandon Prust will center the fourth line , with Eric Nystrom on the left and newly - acquired Jamal Mayers on the right .
On defense , Ian White will take Dion Phaneuf 's place next to Robyn Regehr .
Other pairings include Cory Sarich and Jay Bouwmeester , and Adam Pardy and Mark Giordano Following practice Monday , Leafs coach Ron Wilson appointed newly - acquired goalie Jean - Sebastien Giguere the starter for the remainder of the season , starting with tomorrow 's game against New Jersey .
"
He'll get the majority of starts the rest of the way , " Wilson told reporters .
The other marquee arrival , defenseman Dion Phaneuf , also was on the ice yesterday , wearing the same No. 3 he wore in Calgary -- and the same No. 3 that until this morning belonged to Garnet Exelby .
Exelby was sporting Ian White 's old No. 7 . " We 'll have to talk about that , " Phaneuf said of giving Exelby a reward for giving up No.
3 . " I may have to get him something .
" Phaneuf was partnered at practice with Francois Beauchemin .
Other pairings had Luke Schenn with Exelby , and Tomas Kaberle with Carl Gunnarsson Fredrik Sjostrom , who came over from the Flames with Phaneuf , was at right wing on a line centered by Rickard Wallin , with Nikolai Kulemin on the left side .
Tyler Bozak centered the top line , with Alexei Ponikarovsky on the left and Phil Kessel on the right .
Wayne Primeau centered a line with Jay Rosehill on the left side and Colton Orr on the right , and another line saw John Mitchell at center , with Lee Stempniak on the right wing .
Jeff Finger skated on the left side , but the Toronto Sun reported that spot could be filled by AHL call - up Christian Hanson before tomorrow 's game .
Atlanta Thrashers GM
Don Waddell is in New Jersey tonight taking in the Devils game against Los Angeles from the Prudential Center 's press box .
The Kings are reportedly high on the list of teams trying to acquire Thrashers ' captain Ilya Kovalchuk prior to the March 3 trade deadline .
Waddell told NHL.com that he did not want to do an interview if it centered on Kovalchuk , but did say that he is still trying to sign the Russian sniper who is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent on July 1 .
Waddell added that he is aware of the kind of speculation his presence at this game will cause , but he stressed that he's at this game tonight to scout the two teams , something he rarely gets a chance to do when he 's watching his own team play .
The Thrashers played in Philadelphia on Thursday and instead of going with the team to Nashville for Saturday 's game , Waddell stayed behind to catch some other games in the area .
" When you are watching your own team play , you never get to scout the other team , " Waddell told NHL.com .
It is interesting that it just happens to be the Kings in New Jersey tonight and L.A. GM Dean Lombardi is in the building as well .
NHL.com planned to launch this blog on Feb. 3 , but you know what they say about best - laid plans and all that .
So , welcome to the NHL.com Trade Deadline blog , which will cover all the wheelings and dealings from across the NHL landscape right past the March 3 Deadline .
The blog launches early because Toronto GM Brian Burke was kind enough to start this season 's activity with a pair of blockbusters Sunday -- trading for Dion Phaneuf as part of a seven - player deal with Calgary in the morning and then acquiring goalie Jean - Sebastien Giguere from the Anaheim Ducks in exchange for Vesa Toskala and Jason Blake
Those moves certainly got everyone 's attention and kicked the trade market into overdrive , where it will likely remain until the Olympic Break trade freeze , which begins Feb. 12 at 3 p.m. ET and runs until Feb. 28 , the last day of the Olympics .
After the freeze , teams will have what should be a wild 63 hours to finish remaking rosters before the close of business at 3 p.m. March 3 .
Stay right here from now until March 3 to get the low down on all the news regarding one of the most exciting periods of the NHL season .
Free checking began as a privilege .
Once it spread , customers felt entitled .
Eventually , it became a commodity , as most banks felt they needed to offer it .
Soon , people took it for granted .
But now , free checking may be an endangered species .
Banks are feeling heat from all sides .
This week , President Obama moved to limit the size and activities of the biggest institutions .
Last week , he proposed a tax to recover bailout funds .
The biggest impact on checking accounts , however , is likely to come from new regulations governing overdraft protection .
Starting in July , banks will need explicit permission from customers before allowing them to use their debit cards to spend more than they have in their bank accounts on a one - time purchase .
Similar restrictions will apply to A.T.M. withdrawals .
Banks earn billions in overdraft fees , money that helps pay for free checking .
A chunk of that revenue will disappear when some consumers elect not to sign up for the opportunity to spend more than they have .
This week , Bank of America said that $ 160 million in overdraft fee revenue had already disappeared , because of changes it made in its policies ahead of the new federal rules .

There once was a time when all food was organic and no pesticides were used .
Health problems were treated with folk wisdom and natural remedies .
There was no obesity , and people got lots of exercise .
And in that time gone by , the average life expectancy was … 35 !
That ’s right .
For most of human existence , according to fossil and anthropological data , the average human life expectancy was 35 years .
As recently as 1900 , American average life expectancy was only 48 .
Today , advocates of alternative health bemoan the current state of American health , the increasing numbers of obese people , the lack of exercise , the use of medications , the medicalization of childbirth .
Yet life expectancy has never been longer , currently 77.7 years in the US .
Advocates of alternative health have a romanticized and completely unrealistic notion of purported benefits of a “ natural ” lifestyle .
Far from being a paradise , it was hell .
The difference between an average lifespan of 48 and one of 77.7 can be accounted for by modern medicine and increased agricultural production brought about by industrial farming methods ( including pesticides ) .
Nothing fundamental has changed about human beings .
They are still prey to the same illnesses and accidents , but now they can be effectively treated .
Indeed , some diseases can be completely prevented by vaccination .
So why are advocates of alternative health complaining ?
They are complaining because they long for an imagined past that literally never existed .
In that sense , alternative health represents a form of fundamentalism .
Obviously , fundamentalism is about religion and the analogy can only go so far , but there are several important characteristics of religious fundamentalism that are shared by alternative health advocacy .
These include :
The desire to return to a “ better ” lifestyle of the past .
The longing for a mythical past that never actual existed .
An opposition to modernism ( in daily life and in medicine ) .
And the belief that anything produced by evolution ( or God , if you prefer ) is surely going to be good .
Advocates of alternative health bemoan the incidence of diseases like cancer and heart disease without considering that they are primarily diseases of old age .
That both cancer and heart disease are among the primary causes of death today represents a victory , not a defeat .
Diseases of old age can become primary causes of death only when diseases of infancy and childhood are vanquished , and that is precisely what has happened .
Alternative health as a form of fundamentalism also makes sense in that it has an almost religious fervor .
It is not about scientific evidence .
Indeed , it usually ignores scientific evidence entirely .
All the existing scientific evidence shows that all of the myriad claims of alternative health are flat out false .
None of it works , absolutely none of it .
That ’s not surprising when you consider that it never worked in times past ; advocates of alternative health merely pretend that it did , without any regard for historical reality .
Alternative health is a belief system , a form of fundamentalism , and like most fundamentalisms , it longs for a past never existed .
It is not science ; it has nothing to do with science ; and it merely reflects wishful thinking about the past while ignoring reality .
( CNN ) -- Newburgh , New York , was a main military headquarters for George Washington during the American Revolution .
More recently , authorities say , it was the birthplace of a foiled terrorist plot .
If Mayor Nick Valentine gets his way , the town of 30,000 will host the terror trial of accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four alleged accomplices .
" We 've got nothing to lose , " said Valentine , who also runs a tailor shop .
About 60 miles up the Hudson River from New York City , Newburgh struggles with poverty , unemployment and crime .
In 2004 , the town was dubbed the third worst metropolitan area in the country .
" Sometimes , we 're the top five in crime , which is not a very good recognition , " said Valentine , a lifelong resident .
" We struggle with everything . "
That 's why , he said , the trial would be a boon for his town .
The influx of security personnel would chase the bad people out ; journalists and lawyers in town for the trial would provide a much - needed economic boost .
" People have said :
If you have a trial , bad guys will come .
My comment back to them :
We 've got bad guys right now , " the mayor said .
" If I had a police presence here for an extended period of time , this place would be a safer place .
And in the end ... the city of Newburgh would be up a couple notches than where it was before . "
The White House has said it is considering changing the current plan to hold the 9/11 trial in lower Manhattan after New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other officials expressed concerns about security , costs and disruption to the city .
Four alternative locations around New York have been discussed : Governors Island , the U.S. Military Academy at West Point , a prison complex in Otisville and Newburgh .
Three of the sites , including Newburgh , fall within Orange County , which lost 44 residents in the 9/11 attacks .
The top county official is doing everything he can to make sure the trial stays out .
" I do n't want to be known as the terrorist capital of the world , " said Orange County Executive Edward Diana .
" I do n't want them here .
Nobody wants them here . "
This is one battle , he said , " I will fight tooth and nail . "
" If I have to shut down roads , if I have to sue the federal government , I will do just that .
...
That 's my stance , and I will never back off from there . "
Several senators on Tuesday lined up against a civilian 9/11 trial , saying that they would try to cut off funding for it and that it should take place in a military court .
Mayor Valentine said he would allow the trial in his town only if Newburgh received the estimated $ 200 million needed for security .
" If it 's going to cost us money , then forget it , " he said .
He also agrees with many lawmakers -- that the accused terrorists do n't " deserve a trial like any other citizen in the United States . "
" But if the president of the United States wants a trial , let me put together a jury of peers from the Hudson Valley area , " he said .
The town recently built a $ 22 million courthouse , mandated by the state , and is struggling to pay its bills as a result , Valentine said .
The federal funds would help get the town out of a mountain of debt .
Ever since he 's spoken up for Newburgh , he said , people have been abuzz in his tailor shop .
" Customers have come in saying , ' You give it your best shot . ' "
He added , " I 've had a couple of negative , but very , very few . "
The town has a diverse population -- 36 percent Latino , 34 percent African - American and 28 percent white -- with a median household income of roughly $ 30,000 .
The town is the home of the 105th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard .
Within its four square miles , there are 70 places of worship , including two synagogues and one mosque , the mayor said .
A tree planting last May honored a Muslim U.S. soldier from Newburgh who was killed by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan .
The soldier , 1st Lt. Mohsin Naqvi , had signed up with the Army Reserve just four days after 9/11 .
" We 're a proud city , " the mayor said .
Last June , four men , dubbed the Newburgh Four , were indicted in what prosecutors said was a plot to bomb two New York City synagogues and fire surface - to - air missiles at U.S. military planes .
The mayor lauded his law enforcement for its participation in that federal probe .
" We have challenges .
We have risen up to challenges in the past .
We 're very formidable , " he said .
Now , he hopes the town " where George Washington refused the crown " will have a new place in history : the town that sentences the 9/11 mastermind to death .
A 14 - year - old girl from the tiny Isle Of Man has become an internet sensation for videos she posted of herself singing Japanese songs online .
Rebecca Flint , known online as Beckii Cruel , has had millions of hits to her YouTube performances , and has bagged herself a record deal in Japan .
While this is all great and everything ( while also clearly showing that Japan will go crazy for anything a “ cute ” foreigner does with Japanese culture ) it really really agitates me .
I might get flamed by some of her fans that may ( or may not ) stumble upon my blog , but I do n’t really care .
Recently , she was awarded a “ cuteness gold medal ” and some have even claimed her to be “ too cute . ”
The thing is , her “ cuteness ” comes from the fact that she looks like an anime character ( I do n’t mean that in a hostile way , I ’m just calling it as I see it ) .
While I will give her the benefit of the doubt and call her “ cute , ” I can honestly not tell if she is genuinely happy about what she is doing .
She has a very plastic looking smile makes it seems like she does n’t really care .
Her mannerisms are also kind of fake cute if you ask me .
I think what really bothers me about her becoming so popular in Japan so quickly is that there has been a trend recently of “ promoting foreigners ” on TV … but not always in the most positive light .
I have seriously had students come up to me and tell me that 1 ) I am cuter than this girl , so that means I must be able to dance better than her or a billion other things like this .
On another TV program , they had foreigners come on and talk to some highly educated Japanese people about the differences in Japanese culture and other countries .
What this pretty much turned out looking like was that the foreigners were ignorant twebs who understood nothing and refused to accept culture differences .
The types of questions asked were ridiculous and I cringed the entire time watching it .
In fact , I made Jun change the channel because I was becoming downright offended by the program .
I am not sure exactly where I am going with this anymore besides just showing my aggravation for foreign girls becoming popular in Japan for such ridiculous and “ cute ” things which in turn creates negative stereotypes about everyone else .
The other day I was “ hit on ” by a semi - drunk middle aged man who asked me to dance for him just like Beckii Cruel .
I could have kicked him square in the balls .
According to a recent ABC report , " As many as three dozen criminals who converted to Islam in American prisons have moved to Yemen where they could pose a ' significant threat ' to attack the U.S. , according to a report on al - Qaeda from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . …
Also of concern to U.S. officials , the Senate staff found , is a group of ' nearly 10 non-Yemeni Americans who traveled to Yemen , converted to Islam , became fundamentalists , and married Yemeni women so they could remain in the country . ' …
An American official described them as ' blond - haired , blue - eyed types ' who fit the profile of Americans who al - Qaeda has sought to recruit for terror missions . "
These , of course , are not the first Americans — " blond - haired , blue - eyed types " or otherwise — to convert to Islam and join the jihad : John Walker Lindh wound up fighting fellow Americans alongside Taliban forces in Afghanistan ; Adam Gadahn became a major character in al - Qaeda 's propaganda machine ; Gregory Patterson , Levar Washington , and Kevin James plotted terror strikes against the U.S. ; Christopher Paul and Jose Padilla conspired to use weapons of mass destruction .
Then there are the countless European converts , such as the British " shoe - bomber , " Richard Reid , who attempted to achieve " martyrdom " by detonating explosives in his shoes while aboard a passenger aircraft ; the late Germaine Lindsay , who did achieve " martyrdom " by killing himself and 56 of his fellow citizens and injuring over 700 , in the London bombings of 2005 ; and Abu Abdullah , the native Briton - turned - fiery - Islamist - preacher who makes no secret of his vitriolic hatred of the West ( all , of course , while enjoying that unique Western liberty , freedom of speech ) .
What causes such men , born and raised in the West , often from Christian backgrounds , to abandon their heritage , embrace Islam , and become radicalized to the point that they conspire to kill their fellow countrymen ?
As for Islam 's intrinsic appeal , it has long been argued that , unlike Christianity , which can be " heavy " on theology , Islam is relatively simple and straightforward .
Thus while Christianity may revolve around the metaphysical — the Trinity , Christology , even the notion of grace — Islam , in black - and - white terms , commands its adherents to do this and not do that .
In fact , the Arabic word " Sharia , " that comprehensive body of laws Muslims are to obey , is etymologically related to the word for " pathway " — as in , " the pathway to paradise . "
Yet there is another , more subtle , factor that may entice men to Islam : traditional male roles are highlighted in the religion .
This may appeal to non-Muslim men who want to assert their " masculinity " in what they perceive to be gender - free Western societies .
Harvey Mansfield 's book , Manliness , defines that term as " a quality both bad and good , mostly male , often intolerant , irrational , and ambitious .
Our gender - neutral society does not like it but cannot get rid of it . "
Indeed , with an ethical code that coalesced in the seventh century — when the Muslim prophet and " perfect example " walked the earth , enforced his will , and conquered his " infidel " neighbors — Islamic culture can hardly be deemed " gender - neutral . "
Even philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche , who despised Christianity as " effeminate " and preached the need for man to be transformed into an amoral " hyper-man , " professed admiration for Islam , describing it as " noble and manly " ( The Antichrist ) .
Of course , traditional masculine roles are not the sole domain of Islam ; most civilizations have lived in accordance to such norms ; so - called " gender - neutral societies " are , from a historical perspective , aberrant .
James Bowman , author of Honor : A History , points out that , when it comes to the West 's disregard for notions of honor and masculinity , " we are , in global terms , the odd ones out " ; he further asserts that , up until the Victorian era , in the West , " honor was rather closer to the Arab and Muslim idea of it today . "
It is in this context , then , that disaffected young men — who , like Nietzsche , despise what they perceive to be a " gender - neutral " society — may find a religion which emphasizes " masculinity " appealing .
John Walker Lindh especially seems to fit this paradigm .
Precipitating his conversion to Islam was his teenage discovery that his father was homosexual — an event that appears to have traumatized and alienated Lindh .
Islam 's masculine ideals and unequivocal condemnation of homosexuality may have lured young Lindh , who , soon after his father left his mother and moved in with another man , converted to Islam at age 16 .
Shortly thereafter , he went a - jihading .
This is all further exasperated by Muslims mocking Western masculinity — such as Osama bin Laden , who has ridiculed Western acceptance of homosexuality and characterized the American soldier as " a paper tiger " who is " too cowardly and too fearful to meet the young people of Islam face - to - face " ( The Al Qaeda Reader ) .
Whatever position one may hold regarding these issues , one thing is clear :
If traditional masculine virtues are upheld in Islamic culture , so too do traditional masculine vices abound — for it is often a very fine line that separates hyper- virtue from hyper-vice .
Honor , courage , and patriarchic ethics can — and , in Islamic culture , regularly do — morph into destructive pride ( e.g. , " honor killings " ) , disdain for life ( e.g. , suicide bombings ) , and brutal misogyny .
Nonetheless , for those more " adventurous " young men looking to add a bit of " excitement " to their lives , Islam offers avenues .
Based on the Koran and Muhammad 's biography , raiding , killing , and plundering infidels ( i.e. , the " other " ) , abducting their women , and enslaving their children are all permissible , so long as they are done in a jihadist context , that is , in the " service " of Islam .
In fact , that is how the Islamic prophet and first Muslims spread Islam — a historical fact , not a slander — as attested to by Islam 's sacred texts and histories , written and compiled by pious , authoritative Muslims .
Of course , such behavior was " normal " in the seventh century .
Then , wherever one looked , men of all races , creeds , and religions were raiding , pillaging , plundering , and enslaving their neighbors .
For Islamists , however , the actions of seventh - century Muhammad , no matter how at odds with modernity , must be emulated today no less than yesterday .
Moreover , any moral scruples a potential jihadist may experience over such " antiquated " practices — that is , should his conscience momentarily get the best of him — immediately dissipate in light of Allah 's explicit approval .
For instance : " Married women are prohibited to you [ Muslims ] — except for those taken captive in war " ( Koran 4:24 ; see also 23:6 and 33:50 - 52 ) .
Little wonder , then , that Islam appeals to certain Western men over Christianity : Aspects of it better comport with man 's baser proclivities — for war , possessions , and women — than , say , the passive and inhibiting teachings of Jesus : " turn the other cheek , " " pray for those who persecute you , " and " he who lusts after a woman in his heart has already committed adultery . "
Even Islam 's version of paradise is far more alluring .
There , a river of wine and dozens of " voluptuous women " await the jihadist who dies battling infidels ( see Koran 78:33 ) .
And so , like mischievous little boys who find the pirate lifestyle fascinating — raiding , killing , plundering , abducting , hiding in caves — so do some Western men find the lifestyle of the jihadist captivating .
So they convert .
Nor is it any small irony that the physical appearance of today 's Islamist heroes is reminiscent of those wily pirates of old — from the furtive Taliban leader , " One - Eyed " Mullah Muhammad Omar , to London 's radical ideologue Abu Hamza , who not only boasts one eye , but has a metal hook for a hand which he used to shake menacingly when referring to infidels .
( Like Walt Disney 's Captain Hook , he was affectionately referred to by his followers simply as " The Hook . " )
It goes without saying , of course , that none of this is to imply that Muslims are piratical by nature .
It is to say , however , that persons naturally inclined to such activities — including would - be converts — can and do find exoneration under the rubric of " sunna " and jihad legal theory : if it was okay for Muhammad and the first Muslims to wage war on , plunder , and enslave infidels — so the logic goes — surely it is okay today .
This phenomenon is further highlighted by the obvious intersection between prison incarceration and conversion to radical Islam .
Indeed , most of the aforementioned proselytes had criminal records previous to their Islamic conversion , evincing a proclivity for violence and lawlessness : Reid and Abdullah had convictions for muggings ; Padilla for gangster activity ; and Lindsay for drug dealing .
Patterson , Washington , and James began their terrorist cell while incarcerated in a very real cell for committing over a dozen armed robberies .
And , most recently , the three dozen converts - turned - potential - terrorists who just fled to Yemen were all , as the ABC report puts it , " criminals . "
Traditionally , one of the reasons ex-cons turn to religion is to change their evil ways .
Not so these Western men-turned - Islamic - terrorists .
Consciously or unconsciously , it would seem they embraced Islamism — and subsequently jihadism — merely to receive divine sanctioning for their otherwise violent and rapacious behavior , being transformed in the process from petty criminals to major criminals — terrorists and traitors .

Earlier today , veteran creator Jim Lee was named co-publisher of DC Comics alongside former executive Dan DiDio ; while writer Geoff Johns was named Chief Creative Officer of DC Entertainment .
Only hours after this announcement , MTV News spoke with DC Entertainment President Diane Nelson about the new direction of the company .
Part of the discussion was the highly talked about Deadline.com rumor regarding Batman director Christopher Nolan ' godfathering ' a new Superman movie .
MTV asked if there was any validity to this information that swept across the internet , she said with a laugh .
After the surge of approval from fans around the world , it 's hard to imagine why DC / Warner Bros .
would debunk that news unless , of course , it was nothing more than misinformation .
What of the Watchmen movie / comic sequel ( or prequel ) news that had fans outraged ?
she replied .
She repeated ,

Ten years ago , even the most shocking entertainer 's rise to stardom was missing the accelerating momentum of social media .
While fame 's appeal lies within its ambiguity , we do know it accelerates with rapid conversation .
Lady Gaga has played a hand in manipulating fame to her advantage , emerging this year as arguably the hottest pop star on the planet .
She 's done this by developing the image of a shock artist — wearing futuristic attire , sculpted hair styles and glittery makeup to complete her socially disruptive persona that ultimately drives the popularity and consumption of her music .
Today , Lady Gaga is n't just popular ; she 's rapidly accelerating in popularity .
Lady Gaga By the Numbers
On Twitter , the phrase “ Lady Gaga ” has averaged over ten thousand mentions per day over the past three months , soaring in frequency past other 2010 Grammy performers .
Does the buzz translate into commercial success ?
Do people actually listen to Gaga 's music , or is she merely a spectacle ?
As it turns out , Lady Gaga 's Twitter buzz is n't just noise — it 's backed up by consumption data .
Take , for instance , her number of listeners on Last.fm .
They continue to rise , with an accelerating upward trajectory beginning last fall when she appeared on Saturday Night Live with Madonna .
As the graph above shows , Lady Gaga 's rise in popularity has been meteoric even in the last month when she surpassed John Mayer in listeners .
While Lady Gaga 's wardrobe stunts and persona stir conversation , the data suggests that people are actually listening to her music , as well .
The same holds true for MySpace listeners .
As the data suggests , she maintains a strong position against other pop icons such as Jay - Z , and Rihanna .
Lady Gaga wins again versus another global star , Beyonce , who peaked in November coinciding with the Kanye West / Taylor Swift VMA incident .
While it 's obvious that both stars are frequent press items , the key insight gained from comparing the slopes of the trend lines indicates the accelerating social momentum Gaga has built over the past six months .
What All This Tells Us
With consumption of Lady Gaga 's music skyrocketing on social sites where users do not pay to listen , one key fact is clear ; she remains a strong performer where it counts : music sales .
A final question worth considering : if there was an absence of free channels to hear Gaga , would her album sales be higher ?
Or , does the social media universe only perpetuate and support her existing successful career ?
Let us know what you think in the comments .
Two congressional lawmakers have announced legislation that would effectively remove military contractors from war zones .
Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) and Rep. Jan Schakowsky ( D - IL ) introduced the “ Stop Outsourcing Security Act ” on Tuesday .
If passed , the act would force the United States to phase out its controversial use of private security contractors in war zones like Iraq and Afghanistan .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The legislation would restore the responsibility of the American military to train troops and police , guard convoys , repair weapons , administer military prisons , and perform military intelligence , ” the lawmakers ’ offices said .
“ The bill also would require that all diplomatic security be undertaken by US government personnel , ” they added .
While the bill is likely to meet stiff opposition from the Pentagon and the defense industry , it ’s certain to be well received among progressives and peace activists , who have watched with alarm as the use of private contractors in war zones has skyrocketed in recent years .
Last month , a report ( PDF ) from the Congressional Research Service found that one - fifth of the US armed forces in Iraq consists of private contractors , while in Afghanistan that number reached one - third by September of 2009 .
The report found that there were some 22,000 “ armed private security contractors ” in the two war zones , and that the number in Afghanistan is likely to keep growing .
ADVERTISEMENT
While “ [ m ] any analysts and government officials believe that DOD would be unable to execute its mission without PSCs , ” the report stated that the “ use of armed contractors has raised a number of issues for Congress , including concerns over transparency and accountability . ”
“ It is inexcusable that as much as one - third of our military ’s armed force in Afghanistan may be contractors , ” Schakowsky wrote to Defense Secretary Robert Gates , following the report ’s release .
“ These men and women are not part of the US military or government .
They do not wear the uniform of the United States , though their behavior has , on numerous occasions , severely damaged the credibility and security of our military and harmed our relationship with other governments . ”
This is not the first time that Schakowsky has attempted to end the growing tradition of private contractors fighting public wars .
In 2007 , she introduced a bill , with the same name as the new one , which would have phased out the use of contractors over a number of years .
The bill never made it out of committee .
ADVERTISEMENT
In an interview with Russia Today earlier this month , Schakowsky said that the use of private contractors “ masks the scope of our involvement ” in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ When the President asks for a 30,000 troop increase in Afghanistan , we are talking about at least that number of contractors too , which makes the mission much bigger .
We do n’t even count them when they get killed , ” she said .
ADVERTISEMENT
Schakowsky added : “ We have seen these private hired guns , mercenaries if you will , actually in situations that have jeopardized the mission of the United States , have put our own troops at risk , have killed private civilians , really raising the question , can these private companies that do n’t seem to be part of the chain of command [ or ] have the same transparency or accountability as our military , can they actually get away with murder ?
And so far the answer has been yes . ”
Much of the anger around the use of security contractors has focused on the company formerly known as Blackwater , whose involvement in the September , 2007 , civilian massacre in Baghdad ’s Nissour Square is widely seen as a watershed moment when public opinion among some began to harden against contractors .
Seventeen Iraqi civilians were killed when Blackwater guards opened fire during what they mistakenly thought was a security breach .
Since then , many allegations have surfaced regarding Blackwater , including allegations of homicide reaching to the company ’s highest levels , as well as claims that company employees hired underage prostitutes .
A series of reports over the past six months indicates that Blackwater is deeply involved in counter - terrorist activities in Pakistan .
ADVERTISEMENT
Earlier this month , Schakowsky questioned why the US government continues to do business with Blackwater .
“ After everything that has gone wrong … with Blackwater , I cannot understand why the US government has anything to do with them , ” Schakowsky said .
“ I have yet to hear a convincing reason for their continued work for the government . ”

As mentioned in my previous bikini post some redressing of the balance was needed .
It ’s all very well skitting at bad bikinis but if that overlooks the far greater in number good bikinis it ’s simply unfair .
With that in mind I simply had to do a follow up post showing good bikinis in all their glory .
You understand that right ?
So onwards on a journey of discovery to the island of H!P where every day is sunny ( even when it ’s clearly pissing down ) and all the girls are beautiful ( except in the case of that Alo - Hello Sakura Gumi and Otome Gumi pb where Kago Ai was there too ) .
So some pics …
With bikinis you want things simple but beautiful .
Nobody pulls off simple but beautiful better than Michishige Sayumi .
Simple colours , simple design and simple beautiful girl .
Here again we have beautiful but simple designs in simple colours .
Just a plain white or black can make one heck of an impression .
Plus bikinis go well with water so it ’s always a good idea to get one wet at some stage .
It ’s important when on a beach to remember that bikinis make more of an impression when you have removed your outer layer of clothing .
Therefore always remember to do this .
If you then make a series of cute poses while smiling the impact will be multiplied by roughly 20 times .
A bikini top that has a little frill is a surefire way to catch the eye of any would - be suiters or Japanese pop moguls .
In these pics we see that simple approach pay off wonders .
The final lesson to learn is that you will make far more of an impression if you bring along two friends and make sure they are wearing really quite visually upsetting bikinis .
If you then stand apart from them all eyes will peel to you and victory is yours .
So there we have it .
Some great bikinis that show the wonders of simplicity when matched with a great body .
What ?
You want to see more ?
Okay …
There you go .
What ?
You want to see some different models ?
Tsk .
Well alright then …
Again a simple bikini design and colour scheme mixed with a drop dead gorgeous singer will equal instant love .
Again here we see more of that ‘ simple design equals timeless beauty ’ formula .
But sometimes patterns can work too .
For instance …
Simple yet patterned yet stunning .
Simple but plain still works best though …
Okay other models are available …
Again a simple look .
However do remember to remove outer garments before entering the water .
Again a simple design only this time on a female body builder .
However sometimes something completely different can work …
However plain with a twist works well too .
Here we have a plain colour with some interesting neck action …
Those last 4 Kamei pics are some of my favourite of hers .
Some more good bikinis …
On very rare occasions flowery patterns do work but should only be attempted if you really know what you are doing …
It also works if you go plain and bring two friends along …
Oh and patterns can work on rare occasions if you happen to be both young cute and with other young and cute people …
Finally any pattern at all would work if your name happens to be Konno Asami …
So there you have it .
I hope that goes some way to redressing the balance .
I would like to assure you that no idols were harmed during the making of this post but that one blogger suffered a sore wrist ( through clicking through so many pics ) .
I ’ll leave you however with a final picture of the bikini Queen .
This picture shows that even a simple design with a polka dot effect can work well if you happen to be incredibly and adorably pretty …
Kawaii times infinity .

11.3 million homeowners underwater on mortgage
WASHINGTON ( MarketWatch ) —
More than 11.3 million homeowners — nearly one - fourth of all Americans with a mortgage — owe more on their loan than their home is now worth , according to a report released Tuesday by FirstAmerican CoreLogic .
More than 10 % of people with mortgages owe 25 % more than their home is worth .
The number of underwater mortgages increased by about 620,000 from the third quarter , the firm said .
Another 2.3 million mortgages had less than 5 % equity in their home , which could be wiped out if home prices fall further .

President Barack Obama received a failing grade this year from The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence on Monday .
The Brady Campaign blasted the president , whom the group endorsed in 2008 , for not having taken significant steps to advance gun control laws .
" It 's been a very disappointing year for us , especially considering what he campaigned on , " the group 's president , Paul Helmke , said during an appearance on MSNBC .
" This year they ran away from the issue , and actually signed two repeals of good gun legislation . "
ADVERTISEMENT
Those changes , which would allow guns in national parks and on Amtrak trains , were attached as amendments to larger pieces of legislation the president generally supported .
Obama got an " F " on every issue the Brady Campaign scored , according to its report card .
Helmke said the Obama administration had n't yet reached out to the gun control group , and that he does n't expect the White House to do so anytime soon .
The critical remarks come as the president has come under fire from other groups of supporters for having ceded too much ground to centrists and Republicans in the national healthcare debate .
Helmke urged Obama to make the case for stricter gun laws after the kinds of shooting tragedies that plagued the U.S. in 2009 .
" The response to the White House to these events was basically silence ; sympathy , but nothing about guns , " he said .
“ He was in a hurry home , he said , because they were closing the airport in Washington , ” Mr. Reinfeldt said of Mr. Obama .
“ There was a snowstorm coming in . ”
Ed Miliband , the British secretary of state for climate and energy , acknowledged Europeans ’ disappointment in the talks ’ result but said he was “ absolutely not in the blame game . ”
Rather , he said , negotiating strategies needed to be examined .
Delaying discussion of the toughest issues until the final moments of the conference came close to dooming the chances of an accord , Mr. Miliband said .
“ My biggest frustration at this conference is not talking about substance , apart from the last day , frankly , ” he said .
Mr. Miliband said the months of jockeying leading up to Copenhagen had resulted in some benefits .
“ The process has been a nightmare , but the substance of the last year means you have ambitious targets from lots of countries , ” he said .
He noted that Brazil , South Africa , India , China and Japan were among the nations that had proposed limits on their emissions before the talks .
“ The success of this process has been the fact that it has concentrated minds and has made all the major players put numbers on the table , ” Mr. Miliband said .
But he added : “ I would have preferred a much more comprehensive agreement .
I think going forward there are some difficult issues if emerging economies do n’t want to be part of a legal treaty — which they obviously do n’t — about what is the framework in which you operate .
We do want a legal treaty , and we will be campaigning for it , but I think there are some difficult issues there . ”

Seán Manchester ( left ) .
Seán Manchester is a British author and self - proclaimed exorcist best known for his book The Highgate Vampire which was written subsequent to " vampire sightings " in London , England during the 1970s .
Manchester claims to be a skilled " vampire hunter " and to hold the title of bishop of the Old Catholic Church .
The Highgate Vampire [ edit ]
In March 1970 , Manchester , described as " president of the British Occult Society " , and David Farrant , described as a local " tobacconist " , were featured in the north London newspaper Hampstead & Highgate Express .
The Express connected Farrant 's claims of seeing a ghost and finding dead foxes in Highgate Cemetery with Manchester 's beliefs that a vampire was loose in the old graveyard .
[ 1 ]
The British tabloid press picked up the story and gave it intense coverage .
Manchester and Farrant each appeared in the press and on television talking about his plans to hunt down and destroy the " vampire " .
After one ITV broadcast , a mob of thrill - seekers swarmed the cemetery and climbed over the gates despite police efforts to control them .
The press hysteria eventually waned , but Manchester and Farrant 's reputations as rival " authorities " on the matter were firmly established .
Manchester published his opus The Highgate Vampire in 1985 , followed a few years later by Farrant 's competing account , Beyond The Highgate Vampire .
Their rivalry continues to this day . [ 2 ] [ 3 ]
Activities and research [ edit ]
Manchester 's knowledge of vampirism may have been inspired by horror novels and old vampire movies .
His account of the Highgate Vampire has so many parallels to Dracula that Bram Stoker 's estate could probably sue if it was n't in public domain .
This is a perhaps surprising situation , as most people who do believe in vampires generally follow folklore , rather than Universal Monster Movies .
Nevertheless , he is also president and founder of the " Vampire Research Society " . [ 4 ]
It claims : [ 5 ]
“ ” The supernatural vampire of folklore as defined in dictionaries , encyclopedias and non-fiction works is the matter of the Society 's research and pursuit .
In addition to his account of the Highgate saga , Manchester has published several books , including vampire fiction . [ 6 ]
Claims [ edit ]
In his book The Highgate Vampire Manchester claims that he personally tracked a vampire to its lair where he witnessed it " transform into a giant spider " , which he bravely killed by pounding a stake through its heart and setting it afire with gasoline . [ 7 ]
In his book entitled From Satan To Christ he claims to have infiltrated a " loathsome cult " of demon - worshipping Satanists , exposed their evil practices to the world via " sensational photographic evidence " , and rescued an innocent young woman ( who looks a lot like his present - day wife ) from their clutches . [ 11 ]
Manchester makes the dubious claim of being a direct descendant of the poet Lord Byron , based on unidentified records of births and deaths showing that Byron had a child named " Lucy , " while Manchester has an ancestor called " Lucille . " [ 12 ]

Feud with David Farrant [ edit ]
The Highgate saga presents the collision of two strange and contradictory accounts of the supernatural , with both parties attacking each other . [ 13 ]
Manchester and Farrant each claim to tell the " real " story of the Highgate Vampire and essentially accuse each other of being frauds . [ 14 ]
This may stem from the fact that Manchester claims the title Bishop , and Farrant claims the title " occultist " or High Priest in Wicca . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]
Or it may be simply a deep , personal conflict between two highly competitive personalities .
When Manchester founded his British Occult Society , Farrant launched his own British Psychic and Occult Society . [ 17 ]
When Manchester published The Highgate Vampire , Farrant countered with his Beyond The Highgate Vampire .
In the late 1970s , Manchester publicly challenged Farrant to a series of " duels " ( some with swords , some with " magic " ) that were advertised around London .
These apparently occurred before Manchester took up the title of " bishop . " [ 18 ]
Today , Manchester maintains numerous blogs devoted to vilifying Farrant and calling him an " interloper " suffering from " narcissistic personality disorders " .
These are often illustrated with Photoshopped images and oil paintings that depict Farrant as a demon . [ 19 ]
In return , Farrant is involved in the distribution of a series of comic books called The Adventures of Bishop Bonkers [ 20 ] as well as a line of Bishop Bonkers merchandise such as T - shirts , drinking glasses , and mugs . [ 21 ]
Feud with ... pretty much everyone [ edit ]
Manchester maintains numerous blogs that contain rants against perceived enemies which appear to number in the dozens .
They usually feature a green - tinted or Photoshop - distorted picture of the victim and claims that the person is undoubtedly influenced by Farrant or Satan , which he considers to be the same thing . [ 22 ] [ 23 ]
On being a bishop [ edit ]
Manchester claimed to be a Catholic Bishop in a BBC interview . [ 10 ]
“ ” I 'm not a vicar , I 'm a priest and a bishop .
I 'm a Catholic .
— Sean Manchester in his BBC interview .
However , Manchester is not a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church , as one might expect from his reference to being " Catholic . " [ 24 ]
Manchester claims not to be just a member , but the UK Primate of the British Old Catholic Church . [ 25 ] [ 26 ]
Bishop Manchester and the media [ edit ]
Bishop Manchester seems to have a somewhat turbulent relationship with British television and radio , having made at least three complaints to the UK communications regulators .
All of them revolve around the matter of how he should be described .
Two complaints made against radio stations in 2002 were upheld in part .
In the first His Grace did n't like the fact that he was not addressed as Bishop during an interview , and in the second he complained about being referred to as a " self - styled bishop of what he calls the Old Catholic Church " .
The regulator decided he was a bishop in each case . [ 27 ]
The third complaint , made in 2006 , was in respect of the Highgate vampire hunters ( including Manchester ) being referred to on a Channel 4 programme as " 1970 's weirdos " and other things .
Ofcom , who were handling the complaint , ultimately decided in this case that calling him a " 1970 's weirdo " was fair comment . [ 28 ]
In part of their weirdo judgment Ofcom stated :
Bishop Manchester had not denied that he had , in the past , carried out an exorcism and he was published describing the traditional method of dispatching a vampire as being to drive a stake through its heart before beheading it and incinerating the remains .
And
Bishop Manchester had himself claimed , in his own book , to have violently dispatched the Highgate Vampire by tracking it down , kicking " the lid off the coffin " , driving " a stake through the creature 's heart " , and " burning the remains ” ;
So if we follow Ofcom 's decisions — which His Grace has elsewhere encouraged us to do —- there is no doubt that he is a bishop and a weirdo .
Internet activities [ edit ]
Bishop Manchester 's concerns about his public image do not stop with mainstream media : he also appears overly preoccupied with negative comments made about him on virtually any part of the internet , including the article you 're looking at right now .
Manchester posts on several blogs ( see external links below ) .
As of January 2010 , 5 out of 6 of his posts on the Bishop Seán Manchester blog are concerned with Rational Wiki , and Mustex in particular , who started this article .
Having made pedantic criticisms of this article 's content , accompanied by vague intimations about possible legal action [ 29 ] he proceeded to do the same with the comments on the article 's talk page . [ 30 ]
He has even made a brief appearance on - site , or at least somebody " authorised to act on his behalf " did , ( posting under the Latin name " Episcopus " ) to make more explicit threats and demands .
This seems to be part of a repeating pattern of internet feuds .
Similar behaviour from Manchester , or somebody representing his interests , ( posting under the Latin name " Exorcistate " ) can be found in the Fortean Times forums . [ 31 ]
A blogger calling himself Alexander Lucard has claimed that Manchester harassed him , [ 32 ] allegedly accusing him of actually being the vampire Dracula . [ note 1 ]
When RationalWiki mentioned these claims in this article , and Manchester responded in his blog , the Bishop initially denied all knowledge of Lucard , and insinuated that RationalWiki was perpetuating defamation . [ 29 ]
Later he acknowledged that he had once got one of Lucard 's websites shut down because of negative comments about himself in it , but had apparently forgotten the incident . [ 30 ]
Seán Manchester 's books seem to be getting good customer reviews at Amazon .
However , it 's notable that all of the most glowing reviews come from a single reviewer ( posting under the Latin name " Veritas " ) , who has also posted one - star reviews of vampire - related books which are hostile to Manchester or present Farrant 's side of events . [ 33 ]
It would seem that this Veritas also has access to unpublished information about Bishop Manchester , including his private letters .
In one of his / her book reviews Veritas claims that Manchester 's body language during an interview was misrepresented in the text , concluding that the interviewer / author " is indescribably petty " . [ 34 ]
Interactive 3D game project [ edit ]
In 2013 , design student Aaron Manchester ( claims to be no relation ) published his plans to visualize the vampire - hunting exploits of Seán Manchester in a complex interactive 3D environment modeled after London 's Highgate cemetery .
The game is designed to run on PC , Playstation and Xbox platforms , with a projected completion date of June 2013 .
The game 's objective is for a character called " The Bishop " to successfully locate the " head vampire " from among several tombs .
He plans to include things such as catacombs , drains , religious items , and animated birds as interactive elements for the gameplay . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
Documents published by self - described " environmental artist " Aaron Manchester include a lot of boring discussion about getting each shrub in the cemetery to look exactly right and making sure the architecture is accurate .
They do n't mention what happens when the Bishop finds the head vampire .
Or even how a vampire gets to be a head vampire .
( Works his way up through the ranks ? )
But they do reveal that permission was obtained from Seán Manchester to create a 3D vampire hunting Bishop character of the same name . [ note 2 ]
It 's entirely possible the two are not related , as the student Manchester confesses his glowing admiration for the vampire - hunting Manchester , saying that he first read of his alleged exploits at very early age , and has been fascinated ever since .
So perhaps all it takes to soften the notoriously prickly Bishop and get him in a happy mood is a little good old fashioned flattery .
The " Nazi room " [ edit ]
In 2012 , a man named Kevin Chesham published photos of a room in Manchester 's home which he described as " a massed amount of Nazi paraphernalia ; framed photographs of goose - stepping Nazis and German Officers giving the Hitler salute , swastikas on the walls , and most strikingly a photograph of Adolf Hitler in pride of place . "
A former friend of Manchester , Chesham says he was photographed in the room by the bishop 's wife as a form of blackmail insurance . [ 38 ]
Manchester has issued a counter - blog claiming that his " historical militaria collecting hobby " had been misrepresented , and vilifying Chesham as " the real Nazi " . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ]

Notes [ edit ]
↑ In case you did n't notice , A Lucard ( or Alucard ) is " Dracula " spelled backwards .
The alternate name of Alucard is one of the oldest memes in vampire fiction , probably originating in the 1940s film Son of Dracula , starring Lon Chaney Jr. ↑ So .
An ( Ofcom sanctioned ) weirdo who is known to threaten litigation to anyone who even mentions his name online suddenly gives a student who just happens to share his name permission to turn him into a vampire hunting game character .
Just letting that sink in .
The Supreme Court ruled unanimously today that a corporation 's " principal place of business is where a corporation ’s high level officers direct , control , and coordinate the corporation ’s activities . "
In other words , for diversity purposes , a corporation is a " citizen " where it 's incorporated ( likely Delaware ) and where its executives have their well - decorated offices -- and nowhere else .
In Hertz v. Friend , the 9th Circuit held that the rental car company 's principal place of business was California , where most of its operations take place , rather than New Jersey , where its headquarters are .
The Supreme Court disagreed .
In making its decision , the opinion said , the Court placed " primary weight upon the need for judicial administration of a jurisdictional statute to remain as simple as possible . "
What does this mean ?
It means that the discussion over removing a case to federal court just got a whole lot simpler .
Arguments and calculations regarding what is built where or how much activity is in a particular state just became superfluous .
Bottom line -- a whole lot of cases will be removed to federal court in big states where a company does a lot of business but does not have its headquarters .
This really is a huge shift , as there were major differences in how the circuits handled the issue .
It can also be considered a big victory for corporations in general -- they usually prefer to litigate in the more formal federal court system whereas plaintiffs prefer state courts .
It 's is also a victory for law firm associates everywhere , who can scratch one thing off their list when drafting documents to remove cases to federal courts .
SCOTUSblog has a copy of the full opinion .
So - called " naked " body - ­scanning machines at airports , the latest defence against would - be plane bombers , have already raised concern for breaching flyers ' privacy and , potentially , feeding the voyeurism of security officials .
But could being screened also pose a health risk ?
The question arises because one of the two types of new ­scanner – those that deploy " back - scatter " x-ray technology – uses ionising radiation to generate the images that indicate if someone is concealing something dangerous .
The Department for Transport , which ordered the introduction of whole - body scanners at all UK airports after the plot to blow up an aeroplane over Detroit on Christmas Day , says that they are completely safe .
" The level of radiation that you usually receive from a back - scatter machine is equivalent to what you would naturally receive [ from the sun ] from two minutes of flying at about 35,000 ft , " says a DfT spokesman .
He points to a report this week by the Health Protection Agency , which says that standing to be examined by back - scatter technology involves ­receiving a dose of just 0.02 micro­sieverts or less of radiation , a tiny fraction of the 2,700 microsieverts that a typical Briton is ­exposed to naturally every year from sources such as radon gas , cosmic rays and building materials .
" That 's a very small dose of radiation , " says Professor Richard Wakefield , a radiation expert at Manchester University 's Dalton Nuclear Institute .
" I can't say that these scanners pose no risk , but at the doses you are talking about it 's verging on the ridiculous to be worried about them . "
Many of us may well prefer the notional risk from those minute doses to the risk of being on a plane that is blown up , anyway .
But Douglas Boreham , professor in medical physics and applied radiation sciences at ­McMaster University in Ontario , Canada , cautions that there is a small possibility of harm for frequent flyers or those who are sensitive to the effects of radiation .
Radiation from x-ray scanners could be more highly concentrated than radiation encountered naturally at high altitudes , he says .
He wants the possible impact to be monitored .
" We do n't have enough information to make a decision on whether there 's going to be a ­biological effect or not , " he says .
Jefferies & Company analyst Katherine Egbert told her clients last night that Redmond is getting ready to launch a phone based on Windows Mobile 7 .
" Our recent industry checks indicate Microsoft will be debuting its own phone sometime in the next two months , " Egbert said .
" We expect the new phone to debut soon , at either the Feb 15 - 18 Mobile World Congress conference in Barcelona Spain , or possibly at CTIA in Las Vegas one month later . "
Egbert says the company is " partnering with a few OEM manufacturers , " similar to what Google has done with the Nexus One , to create a Zune - like phone which will have 720p HD video capabilities , at least a 5 MP camera , and that will run Windows Mobile 7 .
She also notes that Windows Mobile 7 will include " premium mobile services , " including a Zune video store and music subscription and purchasing services .
It will have an interface " similar " to the Zune HD UI , " and could include social networking apps like Xbox Live , Facebook and Twitter , " she writes .
" We do n't have any information about the cost of the Pink phone , nor do we know what service providers might be partnered with Microsoft , " she admitted .
" Revenue from the phone is also very unlikely to be meaningful for many years , " she believes .
Her reasoning for the phone is a little odd though .
" However , the new phone might explain why Microsoft has allowed WinMo to dwindle to less than 10 percent mobile OS market share .
Pink would be the ' third screen ' ( after Windows and Xbox ) and [ the ] final component in Microsoft's ' 3 screens and a cloud ' strategy . "
If she 's right , Microsoft would be fulfilling the dreams of Zune fans , Windows Mobile fans , and many others who have been waiting for Microsoft to counter Apple 's iPhone with its own software and hardware combination , as opposed to just a new version of its mobile OS .
Speculation and rumors about a secretive effort known as Project Pink to develop a Microsoft - branded handset have been around for many , many months .
The tidbits mentioned by the analyst have a strong resemblance to recent rumors about a media edition of Windows Mobile 7 that has " Microsoft Zune Phone Experience , " and supposedly features HD video , a Zune - like music player , and streaming media , as well as Silverlight , Mediaroom , Xbox Live ( possibly gameplay ) , Facebook and Twitter interfaces ( similar to Xbox ) , and Zune Music integration .
The media edition does n't refer to a single " Zune Phone " though , and the latest rumors say it 's coming in 2011 .
Each time rumors about a Zune Phone spring up , Microsoft is quick to knock them down , insisting that it is only interested in the mobile OS business , not competing with hardware manufacturers .
Officially , the company insists that releasing its own branded smartphone would be contrary to its strategy of offering just the operating system to a number of partners who then provide various hardware options so that consumers can have a myriad of devices to choose from .
Earlier this month , Microsoft Entertainment and Devices President Robbie Bach bashed Google for its move with the Nexus One , saying that handset makers may fear the company will prioritize its own product over theirs and ditch Android as a result .
Mr Chapelhow has received a letter from the CSA stating : “ We can confirm that in the present circumstances the Agency will not undertake any other enforcement action against you , including bailiff , committal and order for sale action , until Emma has reached 16 and only then if such enforcement action is considered appropriate at the time . "
This is the last of my material from the 24 Hour Drawathon .
Its the longest story I have done to date , and I like it for that .
Going to have to start drawing again , now that I ’ve posted all my material from the Drawathon .
Anyone have any ideas ?

For some time I ’ve been meaning to test my small collection of PDA / smartphone gadgets to see which of their methods of input was quickest .
The iPhone ’s software keyboard ?
The Newton ’s handwriting recognition ?
Palm ’s Graffiti ?
With the possible imminent arrival of a tablet from Apple that will save the world , it seemed a good time to get round to the test .
I have six input methods to compare :
Although an exhaustive test could have included other devices , these four seem to cover the main types of input .
For comparison ’s sake I also tested :
Pen and paper
A full - size QWERTY keyboard
To test the speed of input I was going to use the same piece of text for each one .
I also wanted to use some text I could memorise , so I did n’t have to pause typing / writing to look up , and the later tests would n’t benefit from my increasing knowledge of the text .
So I used a piece of text I memorised a couple of years ago as it did n’t take much effort to retrieve it from my memory and become fluent again .
This is the final paragraph of a speech given by Aneurin Bevan to the British Labour Party in 1959 , following their general election defeat :
I have enough faith in my fellow creatures in Great Britain to believe that when they have got over the delirium of the television , when they realize that their new homes that they have been put into are mortgaged to the hilt , when they realize that the moneylender has been elevated to the highest position in the land , when they realize that the refinements for which they should look are not there , that it is a vulgar society of which no decent person could be proud , when they realize all those things , when the years go by and they see the challenge of modern society not being met by the Tories who can consolidate their political powers only on the basis of national mediocrity , who are unable to exploit the resources of their scientists because they are prevented by the greed of their capitalism from doing so , when they realize that the flower of our youth goes abroad today because they are not being given opportunities of using their skill and their knowledge properly at home , when they realize that all the tides of history are flowing in our direction , that we are not beaten , that we represent the future : then , when we say it and mean it , then we shall lead our people to where they deserve to be led !
Armed with this not - entirely - appropriate 221 - word passage , I set to work in chronological order .
Pen and paper
I decided to time my fast handwriting , rather than my neatest ; so long as I could read it easily , that was good enough .
For those who care about such details , I used a Lamy Safari pen filled with Noodler ’s ink on some cheap and unlikeable Ryman ’s brand A4 lined paper .
It took me 5 min 33 sec to write the passage .
I could probably have gone faster at the expense of legibility , but it seems a good balance .
Full - size QWERTY keyboard
For the past few months the only keyboard I ’ve been using is my MacBook ’s , so I used that for the test .
I can touch - type , although I tend to make too many mistakes .
As with all the tests , I corrected mistakes as I went , which was much easier and quicker on a computer than on some of the more fiddly devices .
Typing the passage out took 3 min 14 sec .
Apple Newton MessagePad 2100 ’s handwriting recognition
From here on I performed each test twice and used the best time .
I figured that despite practising a little before each test , and being surprised how quickly the knack always came back to me , I ’d need more time to get into the flow of each input method .
Contrary to its reputation I did n’t have many problems with the Newton ’s handwriting recognition .
Just as when I used it ( and the earlier 120 model ) regularly I relied on the printed character recognition , rather than the cursive ; my handwriting is only partly joined - up anyway , so this was n’t much of a problem and , as John Gruber pointed out recently , the printed recognition is much more reliable .
For those unfamiliar , you write with a stylus anywhere on the MessagePad ’s large screen and your handwriting appears there as you write .
A moment after you finish a word it disappears and reappears as “ typed ” text wherever the cursor currently is .
This method was easier than I expected and it felt like it was as quick as handwriting recognition could be — there is some delay in translating my scribble into text , but it ’s no slower than the speed of my writing , so the device did n’t get behind .
Once I got into it , correcting mistakes was also easy : tapping a word brings up alternative spellings and capitalisation , and one further tap away are two ways to manually correct the characters .
The first test took 11 min 30 sec and the second , with fewer mistakes and quicker corrections , took 9 min 17 sec .
This is about twice as long as my standard handwriting test , mainly because of the need to write neatly enough for the MessagePad to recognise my writing .
Palm Vx’s Graffiti
[ Graffiti ] ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graffiti_(Palm_OS)) is a simplified version of handwriting input .
There is a small part of the screen dedicated to accepting input , and you write each specially - stylised letterform in the same place .
Unlike the Newton , you do n’t see the marks you make with the stylus .
In theory this simpler method is less error - prone than having to interpret normal handwriting , although I remember that even when I was using the Vx every day I found it at least as frustrating .
Small mistakes mean letters are mis-interpreted and , then and now , I was forever having my ‘Y ’s appear as ‘ X’s .
The first time through it took 13 min 24 sec to tap the passage out , improving slightly to 12 min 16 sec on the second pass .
Although I could have improved the accuracy a little , it felt like there was a speed limit that was n’t present with the MessagePad — there ’s less “ flow ” in the input and it feels like a more regular and mechanical means of input , o n e l e t t e r a t a t i m e .
Palm Treo 650 ’s hardware QWERTY keyboard
I was interested to see how the Treo and the iPhone would compare , given how many people dismiss the iPhone ’s software keyboard in favour of a “ real ” keyboard something like the Treo’s .
I had pleasant memories of using the Treo ’s keyboard ( and the device as a whole ) and after a little practise I was n’t disappointed .
I was using the KeyCaps600 extension which makes a few things easier , although I ’m not sure it was much of a factor in this test .
I ended up doing this test three times .
The first couple I had times of 6 min 18 sec and 6 min 8 sec but it felt like my thumbnails were getting in the way .
They were n’t long but were long enough to make me uncertain whether to type with the nails or the pads of my thumbs .
So I cut them shorter and tried again , using only my thumbs themselves : 5 min 23 sec .
Apple iPhone 3 G ’s software QWERTY keyboard
Finally , the loved and loathed software keyboard .
I remember being frustrated with it when I first purchased my iPhone 18 months ago , but after a couple of weeks , and after finding some degree of peace with its auto - correction , I started to like it .
I still had no idea how it would compare to the other methods , particularly the Treo’s .
I used the iPhone in the vertical position .
I expect the larger horizontal keyboard might be better in general , but I never use it as I get frustrated with the tiny area remaining to view what you ’re typing .
It ’s like using one of those old 1980s “ laptops ” with a tiny LCD strip display .
So I stuck with the orientation with which I ’m most familiar .
The first pass at the text took me 6 min 1 sec to tap out , but I must have got into the flow as the second took only 4 min 56 sec .
Conclusion
If it ’s not already clear , this is n’t a particularly scientific experiment .
If you performed the same tests you ’d probably come up with different results depending on your proficiency with the various devices .
But here are my results , shorter bars are quicker and better :
I ’m surprised by some of this .
I thought that typing on a full - size keyboard would be a lot quicker than the iPhone and Treo than it is , although a real touch - typist could have beaten my 68 words per minute .
I ’m surprised at how slow Graffiti was for me , particularly when its simplicity was supposed to be a huge benefit over the Newton MessagePad ’s ridiculed handwriting recognition .
I had no idea how the iPhone and the Treo ’s keyboard would compare but they ’re similar ; I expect someone who uses a comparable miniature hardware keyboard frequently could beat my iPhone time but I suspect neither is radically , objectively quicker than the other .
A map showing how a " retreat " strategy would change Portsmouth Rising sea levels and more storms could mean that parts of at - risk cities will need to be surrendered to protect homes and businesses , a report warns .
The authors say that " radical thinking " is needed to develop sea defences that can cope with the future threats .
About 10 million people in England and Wales live in flood risk areas .
The project , launched on Friday , is a joint venture between the Institution of Civil Engineers ( Ice ) and the Royal Institute of British Architects ( Riba ) .
The report , Facing up to Rising Sea Levels , urges the government , planning authorities and the public , to act sooner rather than later .
" If we act now , we can adapt in such a way that will prevent mass disruption and allow coastal communities to continue to prosper , " said Riba president Ruth Reed .
" But the key word is ' now ' , " she added .
The study warns that rising sea levels , an increase in the frequency of storms and sinking landmasses could leave many UK coastal areas vulnerable to extreme flooding .
Facing the future
The project focuses on Kingston - upon - Hull and Portsmouth , two cities deemed among the most at - risk areas in the UK , and presents a series of six scenarios set up to 90 years in the future .
The scenarios are based on three themes : • Retreat - moving " critical infrastructure " and housing to safer ground , allowing the water into parts of the city • Defend - building city - wide sea defences to ensure water does not enter the existing urban area • Attack - extending the existing coastline and building out on to the water ( using stilts , floating structures and / or land reclamation )
The scenarios were developed by a group of experts , including architects , civil engineers , city designers , developers and policymakers .
The UK must urgently change the way it plans , builds and designs at - risk communities
Ben Hamer ,
Chairman , Ice steering group
Flood - risk areas in the UK
Their ideas also had to take into account a number of constraints , including a lack of funding to protect the entire coastline of the UK , which stretches for more than 12,500 km ( 7,700 miles ) .
" The scenarios we have created are extreme , but it is an extreme threat we are facing , " observed Ms Reed .
The authors decided to focus on Kingston - upon - Hull and Portsmouth because the two cities displayed many of the characteristics of flood - prone areas .
They said that Kingston - upon - Hull was a low - lying city that has to be constantly drained by pumps , the River Hull - which runs through the middle of the area - is liable to flooding , and the port is of national strategic importance .
Portsmouth was also vulnerable , they added , because most of the city is located on an island that was no more than 3 m ( 10 ft ) above sea level , and was densely populated .
Ben Hamer , chairman of the Ice steering group , said that government , public officials and businesses needed to work together in order to halt the " water invasion " .
" Some very difficult decisions need to be made in the future , and to do this we need integrated thinking , " he said .
" The UK must urgently change the way it plans , builds and designs at - risk communities . "
The project 's findings , which include sketches and details of the proposed " new cities " , will be presented in a exhibition that will visit London , Portsmouth and Kingston - upon - Hull .

Here in the UK it ’s cold , and the cold weather tends to bring with it an upsurge in the rates of viral infections such as the common cold and flu .
It has been suggested that one reason such infections surge in the winter is because we ’re more likely to be cooped up with other people , spreading infections among us .
However , another mechanism that might explain this phenomenon relates to vitamin D : this nutrient has anti-infective properties and its levels usually fall in the winter , perhaps increasing our risk of succumbing to infection .
I wrote about this a couple of years ago here .
I also recently suggested that optimising vitamin D might help keep infections at bay ( I ’ve not had a single infection since I started supplementing with vitamin D about a year ago ) .
The mainstay of conventional strategies for preventing flu is vaccination .
However , as I have reported previously here and here , doubts have been raised about how useful vaccination actually is .
Now fresh concerns have been raised regarding the appropriateness of flu vaccination policy in the form of a review of relevant evidence performed my scientists from the Cochrane Collaboration ( an international group of scientists specialising in systematic reviews of health - related interventions ) [ 1 ] .
The review focused on flu vaccination in individuals aged 65 and older ( deemed to be the ones most likely to benefit from vaccination , as this group is at increased risk of complications of flu including death ) .
You can download a pdf of the review here .
The reviewers identified 75 vaguely - relevant studies , but only one of these was deemed especially relevant in that it was a ‘ randomised controlled trial ’ ( generally regarded as the most relevant and useful test of a medical treatment ) which compared outcomes in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals using currently available vaccines .
This study , apparently , yielded some evidence that vaccination helped protect against the flu , but it was big enough to tell us whether this translated into a reduced risk of complications .
This is important because one could argue that getting the flu is neither here nor there really .
What is really important is whether this then leads to an enhanced risk of things like pneumonia and death ( as I mentioned above , this is particularly important in the elderly ) .
The authors concluded that “ The available evidence is of poor quality and provides no guidance regarding the safety , efficacy or effectiveness for people aged 65 years or older . ”
In other words , flu vaccination in the elderly is a shot in the dark .
Some of you may be surprised that governments institute and fund health policies for which there is little or no evidence of benefit .
Do n’t be – not so long ago we learned that the UK Government ’s doling out of a anti-flu prescription medication ( Tamiflu ) over the phone was n’t based on any decent science either .

Oh we all know the story about how Scott Brown won back the U.S. Senate for the Republican Party and how Republicans are now well on the way to retaking every single branch of government .
They are in great shape , more popular than ever .
Right ?
Um ... not so much .
When to the problems facing America , more people blame Republicans than any other group , according to the latest NBC / WSJ poll :
When it comes to dealing with the problems facing America , how much blame do you give [ ___ ] in not finding solutions to those problems -- a great deal of blame , quite a bit of blame , just some blame , or very little blame ?
Blame Not Blame
The Republicans in Congress 48 % 50 %
The Democrats in Congress 41 % 56 %
President Obama 27 % 71 %
The challenge for Dems is making sure these people vote .
This was a poll of all adults -- not just people likely to turn out in November .
But if there 's one thing that these numbers make clear , it 's that the more they can get people fired up to head to the polls , the better Democrats will do next November .
On February 7 , 1968 , American bombs , rockets and napalm obliterated much of the South Vietnamese town of Ben Tre — killing hundreds of civilians who lived there .
Later that day , an unidentified American officer gave Associated Press reporter Peter Arnett a memorable explanation for the destruction .
Arnett used it in the opening of the story he wrote :
“ It became necessary to destroy the town to save it , ” a U.S. major said Wednesday .
He was talking about the grim decision that allied commanders made when Viet Cong attackers overran most of this Mekong Delta city 45 miles southwest of Saigon .
They decided that regardless of civilian casualties they must bomb and shell the once placid river city of 35,000 to rout the Viet Cong forces .
After Arnett ’s story was published in newspapers the next morning , February 8 , 1968 , the unnamed major ’s remark became one of the most infamous war - related quotes in modern history .
To this day , it is still used as a quotation that epitomizes the brutal absurdities of war in general and of the Vietnam War in particular .
The veracity of the quote has also been a subject of controversy .
Since Arnett did not identify the officer who supposedly used the line , some people have questioned whether anyone actually said it .
In 2006 , a Vietnam veteran named Michael D. Miller created a website titled “ Saving Ben Tre . ”
On that site , Miller claims to have been present when a “ Major Booris ” said something very close to what Arnett reported .
Miller gives the quote as : “ We had to destroy Ben Tre in order to save it . ”
However , like Arnett ’s report , Miller ’s version has been disputed .
More significant to the people of Vietnam is the issue of whether Ben Tre actually had to be destroyed .
The U.S. military ’s official explanation of why “ it became necessary to destroy the town ” is that it had been infiltrated by thousands of Viet Cong .
Thus , their rationale went , trying to oust the VC in ground - level fighting , from street to street , would have caused a high number of American casualties and even more civilian casualties .
Perhaps they were right .
But the outcome described in Arnett ’s news story does n’t quite smell like victory :
U.S. advisers said the heavy allied firepower hurled on the city to drive out the Viet Cong probably contributed largely to the deaths of at least 500 civilians and possibly 1,000 .
South Vietnamese officials say the enemy dead totaled 451 .
About 50 Vietnamese soldiers died , along with more than 20 Americans ... Lt. Col James Dare of Chicago , commander of U.S. Advisory Team 93 , said “ we will never know for sure ” the number of civilians who died … Maj .
Chester L. Brown of Erie , Pa. , spent hours over the city as an Air Force forward air controller directing helicopter and fighter - bomber attacks .
“ It is always a pity about the civilians , ” he said .
The story went on to say :
U.S. officials reported it was impossible to determine the attitude of the city ’s residents to the bombing and artillery fire .
“ Most of those we see around appear mighty relieved that they survived , ” one official said , “ But I know that there are lots of refugees , maybe 10,000 to 15,000 , outside of town in a camp and they may not be so happy . ”
I suspect that last quote was a bit of an understatement .

LIMA , Peru —
With frantic rescue efforts under way , a rising death toll and isolated outbreaks of looting , the Chilean president on Sunday issued an order that will send soldiers into the streets in the worst - affected areas to both keep order and speed the distribution of aid .
After huddling in a crisis meeting with her cabinet , President Michelle Bachelet called the damage caused by Saturday ’s magnitude - 8.8 quake “ an emergency unparalleled in the history of Chile . ”
She said the death toll had reached 708 and suggested it would probably grow in the days ahead .
The police fired water cannons and tear gas to disperse hundreds of people who forced their way into shuttered shops in the southern city of Concepción , which was devastated .
But law enforcement authorities , heeding the cries of residents that they lacked food and water , eventually settled on a system that allowed staples to be taken but not televisions and other electronic goods .

Her aides also called on residents not to hoard gas or food , both of which were being bought up in huge amounts by residents fearful of shortages .
Using power saws and their bare hands , rescue workers atop the rubble of collapsed buildings tried to pull out those caught inside .
Although there were successes — like Julio Beliz , who managed to free his neighbor from the rubble in Santiago after hearing him yell out , “ Julio , help me ! ” — the search for survivors was frustratingly slow .
“ It ’s very slow , dangerous work , because on top of it all , it ’s still shaking there , ” said Victoria Viteri , a spokeswoman with the national emergency office in Santiago , referring to rescue efforts in the country ’s hardest - hit areas .
The earthquake , one of the strongest in recorded history , left a devastating footprint on a country that knows quakes well .
Residents of a collapsed 15 - story apartment building in Concepción , opened just months ago , were outraged that it had been so badly damaged and were convinced that contractors had not complied with building codes that require buildings to be able to withstand temblors .
Already , there was talk among residents of taking builders to court once the emergency is over .

In Cobquecura , 50 miles north of Concepción , state television showed collapsed bridges , crashed buses and sunken pavement .
Residents had fled to the hills , prompting local journalists to declare it a virtual ghost town .
In remote coastal towns , waves had obliterated homes , and boats were found on land next to overturned cars .
The authorities acknowledged that the damage was spread over such a vast area that they were just beginning to get a grasp on it .
Early Sunday , a 6.1 - magnitude aftershock , one of more than 100 that have followed the original quake , sent residents scrambling again for cover .
With the earth still unsettled , many Chileans have opted to camp outside .
In Maipú , outside Santiago , the capital , the authorities inspected an apartment building , found it relatively stable and allowed residents half an hour each to hustle inside and remove any personal belongings , local media reported .
At another building nearby , however , the damages were considered too severe and the city told residents to stay out .
The National Office of Emergency raised the number of displaced people on Sunday to two million .
Among the quake ’s victims were Lurde Margarita Arias Dias , 24 , and her infant child , Peruvian immigrants who were crushed as a wall toppled in their Santiago home .
A collaborative study involving scientists from 12 UK research institutions , universities and conservation organizations suggests that the trend towards earlier UK springs and summers has been accelerating .
The study , published recently in Global Change Biology , is the most comprehensive and rigorous assessment so far of long - term changes in the seasonal timing ( phenology ) of biological events across marine , freshwater and terrestrial environments in the UK , the authors say .
Researchers gathered more than 25,000 long - term phenology trends for 726 species of plants and animals .
More than 80 % of trends between 1976 and 2005 indicated earlier seasonal events .
The study considered a diverse array of organisms including plankton , plants , insects , amphibians , fish , birds and mammals .
On average , the seasonal timing of reproduction and population growth has become earlier by more than 11 days over the whole period , but change has accelerated in recent decades .
Large differences were detected between species in the rate at which seasonal events have shifted , according to the study .
Changes have been most rapid for many organisms at the bottom of food chains , such as plants and the animals that feed upon them .
Predators have shown slower overall changes in the seasonal timing of their life cycle events .
However , the seasonal timing of reproduction is often matched to the time of year when food supply increases , so that offspring receive enough food to survive .
A key question is whether animals higher up the food chain will react to the faster rates of change in the plants and animals they feed upon , or whether they will fail to do so and become less successful at rearing their offspring .
" This is the first time that data have been analyzed with enough consistency to allow a meaningful comparison of patterns of changing seasonal timing in the UK among such a diverse range of plants and animals , " said Dr Stephen Thackeray .
"
Phenology is ' the canary in the cage ' .
The results of this new study make real our changing climate and its potential to have profound consequences for the complex web of life , " added co-author Richard Smithers of the Woodland Trust . : hackeray et al. , ' Trophic level asynchrony in rates of phenological change for marine , freshwater and terrestrial environments ' , Global Change Biology , 2010 ; doi : 10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02165.x
None of this , however , means that the government is confined to ruling a city - state centered on Sana .
The Yemeni Army and national police exert significant day - to - day control over most of the country , and almost everywhere else on an ad hoc basis .
Yemen is much like the United States in the latter half of the 19th century , when the government faced a rebellious South and a Wild West , but was hardly powerless outside the East Coast .

Myth 2 : Yemen is a Qaeda haven because it is the ancestral home of Osama bin Laden , who is supported by tribes in Hadhramaut Province .
Osama bin Laden ’s father , Muhammad , was one of many Yemenis who achieved great success outside his native country .
But the bin Ladens are not part of any politically significant tribe or clan , nor has the family sought to convert its wealth into power in Yemen .
Osama bin Laden has some popularity , but no more so than elsewhere in the Islamic world .
The Qaeda virus  which has been present in Yemen since 1992 , when Qaeda members bombed a hotel in Aden where American troops had been staying on their way to Somalia  is the problem for Yemen , not Mr. bin Laden ’s ancestral ties .

Myth 3 : Yemen is torn by Sunni - Shiite divisions , much like Iraq .
The Houthi rebellion is often described as Shiite resistance against a Sunni establishment .
In fact , both the Houthis and President Saleh are followers of the Zaidi sect of Shiite Islam .
Generally , there is no clear divide between Sunnis and Shiites in Yemen , although the Shiites tend to live in the north and northwest while the Sunnis , mostly members of the moderate Shafii school , predominate in the south and southeast .
In any case , one ’s sect matters far less in Yemen than in countries like Lebanon or Iraq , and it ’s not unknown for Yemenis to convert from Sunni to Shiite as a matter of convenience .

Not long ago , we were telling you of a campaign coming from the Westboro Baptist Church that aimed to show that Lady Gaga was the closest thing to Devil on Earth , leading her followers ( fans ? ) to perdition .
This , of course , according to Rev. Fred Phelps .
His granddaughter , Megan Phelps - Roper , even goes as far as to use Gaga ’s own song to illustrate her father ’s case .
Megan Phelps uses Gaga ’s “ Poker Face ” to show that the message behind her music and her so - called showmanship is as shallow as her lyrics .
This time , there is no statement accompanying the leak on the Internet of the re-made version of the hit track , but the lyrics speak for themselves if one only bothers to listen to them carefully .
The idea is simple : with everything that she did / does , Gaga upset God .
As such , she must pay the price .
The same message was also contained in a press statement issued by the Reverend a while back , calling for boycott of Gaga ’s January 7 gig at the Fox Theater .
Back then , the Reverend used holy quotes to illustrate that Gaga was nothing short of a cheap woman of the night that was using her music and her image , which somehow continues to garner a lot of attention , to corrupt as many impressionable youngsters as possible .
“ ‘ Art ’ and ‘ fashion ’ are the euphemisms , the guise under which proud [ expletive ] Lady Gaga teaches rebellion against God ( incidentally , her claim to the title of ‘ lady ’ is sound only if she tacks on ‘ of the night , ’ thereby alluding to another euphemism of what she is . )
As much as she ’d like to pretend otherwise , there ’s nothing new or different about this particular [ expletive ] ’s pretentious prancing .
Does the simple [ expletive ] truly think that she can change God ’s standards by seducing a generation of rebels into joining her in fist - raised , stiff - necked , hard - hearted rebellion against Him ?
Get real ! ” the Reverend wrote .
“ Even as she gives lip - service to ‘ liberating ’ her young fans , Lady Gaga brings them into slavery to their own corruption , teaching them to glory in their shame .
She hates you !
‘ For when they speak great swelling words of vanity , they allure through the lusts of the flesh , through much wantonness …
While they promise them liberty , they themselves are the servants of corruption !’
2 Pet. 2:18 -19 YOU’RE GOING TO HELL , ” the statement also said .
While fans continue to be perplexed about the anti-Gaga campaign , in the sense that they ’re still to decide whether they should laugh out loud or disregard it as utterly ridiculous , below is Megan Phelps ’ version of “ Poker Face . ”
* Some discretion is advised as the song contains some language that might be deemed offensive .
Anthropologist Steven Churchill holds a replica of a Neanderthal spear in his left hand ; in his right is the kind of spear thrower that probably killed Shanidar 3 .
Only modern humans make such a thrower .
Duke Photography
Aiming his crossbow , Steven Churchill leaves no more than a two - inch gap between the freshly killed pig and the tip of his spear .
His weapon of choice is a bamboo rod attached to a sharpened stone , modeled after the killing tools wielded by early modern humans some 50,000 years ago , when they cohabited in Eurasia with their large - boned relatives , the Neanderthals .
Churchill , an evolutionary anthropologist at Duke University , is doing an experiment to see if a spear thrown by an early modern human might have killed Shanidar 3 , a roughly 40 - year - old Neanderthal male whose remains were uncovered in the 1950s in Shanidar Cave in northeastern Iraq .
Anthropologists have long debated about a penetrating wound seen in Shanidar 3 ’s rib cage :
Was he injured by another Neanderthal in a fight — or was it an early modern human who went after him ?
“ Anyone who works on the ribs of Shanidar 3 wonders about this , ” Churchill says .
The possibility that early humans attacked , killed , and drove small bands of Neanderthals to extinction has intrigued anthropologists and fascinated the public ever since Neanderthal bones were first studied in the mid-19th century .
At first naturalists were not sure what to make of the funny - looking humanlike bones .
But with publication of Darwin ’s
On the Origin of Species , the idea that the bones were from a species closely related to us began to make sense .
Eventually scientists recognized that Neanderthals were an extinct species that shared a common ancestor ( probably Homo heidel­bergensis ) with Homo sapiens .
For thousands of years , Neanderthals were the only hominids living in Europe and parts of Asia .
Then , around 50,000 years ago , early modern humans migrated into Europe from Africa .
By 28,000 to 30,000 years ago , the Neanderthals had disappeared .
For more than a century after their discovery , our robust relatives were depicted as dumb brutes , but the Neanderthals have had something of a face - lift in recent years .
They are now considered to have been intelligent ( as smart as early modern humans , some anthropologists think ) , perhaps red-haired and pale - skinned , and capable of speech .
They might even have created their own language .
The more we learn about Neanderthals , the more familiar they seem .
But one deep mystery remains :
Whatever happened to them , and why did they disappear ?
There are many theories but not a lot of proof .
That is why Churchill ’s study of Shanidar 3 and another study published this year about humans cannibalizing Neanderthals are essential .
They add a few details to the shadowy picture we have of our long - lost cousins .
Anthropologists have many interpretations .
Maybe our direct ancestors and Neanderthals largely coexisted ( as did many other overlapping hominid species before them ) , with occasional bouts of quasi-tribal warfare that ebbed and flowed .
Then again , maybe humans relentlessly drove Neanderthals into extinction .
Right now these are just possibilities .
Only the bones and artifacts can tell what really happened .
The Killing of Shanidar 3
Churchill ’s curiosity about the fate of Shanidar 3 led him to try re-creating the sharp , deep scratch in the left ninth rib of this hapless Neanderthal .
This strategy actually came from Churchill ’s colleague John Shea , a paleoanthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York who reconstructs the behavior of prehistoric peoples by analyzing their stone tools .
To understand how stone points are worn down when piercing flesh and bone , Shea had run a set of experiments , stabbing goat carcasses and then noting the damage to the tools .
Churchill hoped to compare the cuts on Shea ’s goat bones to the mark on Shanidar 3 ’s rib .
Unfortunately , the goat bones were so damaged by the blows that “ it was impossible to analyze them , ” he says .
He concluded that he would have to do his own experiments to replicate the physics of Shanidar 3 ’s prehistoric wound .
Neanderthals were the power - thrusters of the Paleolithic world , driving their heavy spears with great kinetic energy and momentum into bison , boar , and deer .
If Shanidar 3 had been injured by such a thrust , it would suggest that he had gotten into a fight with another Neanderthal , or perhaps that he had been hurt in a hunting accident .
But if the wound had resulted from a lighter spear — from a projectile deftly thrown at a distance , with less momentum and energy — the attacker was most likely human .
There is no evidence whatsoever that Neanderthals ever used throwing spears , Churchill says .
After inflicting a set of sample wounds on pig bones , which are close in terms of size and shape to those of Neanderthals ( and which were easily obtained from a nearby slaughterhouse ) , Churchill and his team of students spent an evening cleaning the bones by boiling them in hot water and Biz , a laundry detergent containing enzymes that are , Churchill says , “ really good at breaking down proteins . ”
The process revealed signs of damage to the pig bones similar to those seen in Shanidar 3 .
“ We cannot definitively rule out accidental wounding , attack with a knife , or attack with a hand - delivered , heavy Neanderthal spear , ” Churchill says .
“ But Shanidar 3 ’s wound is most consistent with injury from a lightweight , long - range projectile weapon . ”
In other words , a human probably did it .
Neanderthal ( top ) and reindeer ( bottom ) jawbones from the Les Rois cave show similar cut marks ( details at right ) , suggesting that both were butchered by modern humans .
F. Ramirez Rozzi
Eating the Neanderthal of Les Rois
The spearing of Shanidar 3 documents only the act of one individual against another .
Paleontologist Fernando Ramirez Rozzi discovered something far more nefarious while comparing the jawbones of a Neanderthal child and an early modern human last year at the Institute of Human Paleontology in Paris .
Both mandibles , dating from about 30,000 years ago , had been excavated from a cave called Les Rois in southwestern France .
Finding Neanderthal bones mixed in with human bones is in itself significant because it shows that early humans and Neanderthals truly did meet face - to - face .
Ramirez Rozzi thinks that some of the encounters may have been peaceful , but this one apparently was not .
The Neanderthal jawbone exhibits cut marks made by a stone tool that mirrors those seen on a number of reindeer jawbones found nearby .
The marks are distinctive indicators of slaughtering , including repeated indentations in the bone where the tongues were cut out .
“ It is clear that early humans were eating Neanderthals , ” Ramirez Rozzi says .
The cut marks are also similar to ones noted a decade earlier on deer and Neanderthal bones found at Moula - Guercy , a Paleolithic site in southeastern France near the Rhone River .
The cannibals in that instance , though , were other Neanderthals , not early humans .
Anthropologists suspect that there was never a huge population of Neander­thals , although we do not have enough evidence yet to know how many lived at any given time .
That is why some scientists doubt there were frequent run-ins between Neanderthals and humans .
But Ramirez Rozzi disagrees .
He thinks that Neanderthals and early humans met “ on many occasions ” and that some of those meetings were violent .
“ We can also say that , as with violent encounters between different peoples , on one of those violent meetings the loser — the Neanderthal — was eaten by the winner , ” he says .
The Last Days of the Neanderthals
The proven proximity has fostered a debate over whether humans and Neander­thals might have mated with each other as well .
Ramirez Rozzi classifies Neanderthals as a separate species , Homo neanderthalensis , and therefore suspects that close relationships with early humans were rare .
“ I think early modern humans viewed Neanderthals as a different group , as ‘ the other , ’ ” he says .
But Erik Trinkaus , a physical anthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis , thinks the two hominids had a much stronger connection .
In fact , he controversially argues that Neanderthals did not really go extinct .
Rather , he claims , they were absorbed into the larger , rapidly growing population of early humans migrating into Eurasia from Africa .
“ We will never know to what extent they were absorbed .
The bottom line is that they were humans , and sex happens , ” he says .
Many of Trinkaus ’s colleagues dispute that idea .
Svante Pääbo , who leads the Neanderthal Genome Project at the Max Planck Institute in Germany , painstakingly sequenced samples of Neanderthal DNA and found little evidence of their genes in us .
His result implies that there was minimal interbreeding .
“ But so far we have only been able to see if humans have any genes from Neanderthals , ” he says .
“ We are now starting to look to see if there are genes in Neanderthals that came from modern humans . ”
Most anthropologists interpret the disappearance of the Neanderthals some 30,000 years ago as a true extinction .
They are just not sure why it occurred .
“ My gut feeling , ” says Neanderthal expert Francesco d’Errico , director of the National Center for Scientific Research in France , “ is that the Neanderthal extinction went on for several millennia and was modulated , but not determined , by climatic changes . ”
Indeed , the era between 65,000 and 25,000 years ago , toward the end of the Pa­leo­lithic , was a time of major volcanic eruptions , along with extremes of climate that included rapid shifts in temperature accompanied by alternately creeping and contracting glaciers across many regions of Eurasia .
“ This put a lot of stress on plant and animal life , ” says archaeologist Steve Kuhn of the University of Arizona .
“ Habitats were shrinking .
Some researchers believe that everything was changing faster than the Neanderthals ’ capacity to adjust to them . ”
There also probably were not very many Neanderthals , and their small population may have played a role in their extinction .
“ Rare animals can be wiped out by climatic stress and competition more easily than animals that are common , ” Kuhn says .
Kuhn and his colleague and spouse , archaeologist Mary Stiner , also suggest that the Neanderthals ’ social structure put them at risk .
Unlike early human hunter - gatherer groups , Neanderthals concentrated almost entirely on hunting big game , as evidenced by the abundance of large animal bones in Neanderthal archaeological sites .
At these sites there is also an absence of technology for grinding or crushing plant foods to extract their nutrients , which is essential to the lifestyle of foragers .
“ They engaged their entire group — men , women and children — in hunting big game , ” Kuhn says .
Involving the whole tribe in hunting worked well until the climate changed and competition showed up in the form of early humans .
Homo sapiens ’s division of labor allowed women and children to focus on small game and gathering while men went after the larger prey .
In tough times , Kuhn argues , this diversified diet gave early humans a survival edge .
It is impossible to know exactly how major a role human aggression played in the Neanderthals ’ disappearance .
The groups undoubtedly competed for resources , though , and evidently humans sometimes attacked or even ate Neanderthals .
The death of Shanidar 3 may thus have foreshadowed the fate of his entire species .
After a human threw a spear into his chest , Shanidar 3 lived at least another two weeks with the spearhead ( if not the whole spear ) stuck in his ribs .
At the time of his death , the gouge in his bone had started to heal .
He was one tough guy .
Archaeologists found him some 50,000 years later in the cave in Iraq ’s Zagros Mountains , buried under the rubble of a collapsed ceiling .
There is no way to tell whether he died from his wound or from being trapped under the rock .
Like so much else about our wayward cousins , the final cause of Shanidar 3 ’s death remains a mystery .
Subjects
A total of 16 boys with ADHD and 16 healthy male controls participated in the study with both groups ranging in age from 8 to 13 years ( M = 10.4 , SD = 1.4 ) .
Only participants with an IQ = 85 ( based on the WISC - III ) were included in this study .
Children in the ADHD group met DSM - IV criteria for ADHD [ 11 ] and were recruited from the Outpatient Unit at the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry .
Healthy controls were recruited from local primary or grammar schools .
All participants underwent an extensive psychiatric examination conducted by an experienced child psychiatrist using a German semi-structured parent interview ( K - DIPS ; [ 12 ] ) .
In addition , parents evaluated their child 's behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ; [ 13 ] ) and the German parental report on ADHD symptoms ( FBB - HKS ; [ 14 ] ) .
The number of items from the FBB - HKS questionnaire equates to the number of DSM - IV items and also provides a severity score for each ADHD symptom .
Psychiatric classification of individuals with ADHD was based on the diagnostic interview ( K - DIPS ) , the developmental history of the child , playroom observations , pediatric examinations , and parent questionnaires ( FBB - HKS , CBCL ) .
Only children who fulfilled diagnostic criteria of DSM - IV in the K - DIPS were included in the ADHD group .
CBCL ratings of the inattention / hyperactivity subscale were above a T score of 65 in all ADHD cases .
Seven participants with ADHD were coded as inattentive - only subtype , and nine children satisfied criteria for the combined subtype ( two with comorbid oppositional defiant disorder / ODD ; none fulfilled criteria of conduct disorder / CD ) .
Exclusion criteria included any potentially confounding diagnoses such as obsessive - compulsive disorder , psychosis , mania , major depression , substance abuse , pervasive developmental disorders or developmental disorders .
None of the ADHD participants used any medication other than stimulants , which were discontinued at least 48 hours prior to testing .
Informed consents were obtained from all participants and their parents .
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the University Hospital , Aachen .
Demographic data and descriptive statistics for task performance of the two groups are summarized in Table 1 .
The groups did not differ with respect to age or IQ ( all p s > 0.1 ) .
However , children and adolescents with ADHD were rated as having significantly higher inattention , externalizing and internalizing scores as assessed with the CBCL , and stronger ADHD symptom severity in the FBB - HKS ( all p s = 0.01 ) .

Experimental procedure
Incentive go / no - go task
In our incentive go / no - go task ( see [ 9 ] for details ) , participants were instructed to respond with their dominant hand as quickly as possible for all go signals ( letters " A " through " E " ) , but to inhibit a response for all no - go signals ( letter " X " ) .
The stimuli were pseudorandomly presented in the center of the computer screen for 500 msec with a fixed intertrial interval ( ISI ) of 1500 msec .
Feedback – uninformative or informative ( see below ) – was given after no - go trials and was shown 1500 msec after the offset of the no -go signal for an additional 1500 msec .
The incentive go / no - go task consisted of two experimental blocks , each block with 150 trials ( 60 % go signals and 40 % no - go signals ) .
In the first experimental block , all children underwent the same non-reward baseline condition where meaningless feedback ( represented by uninformative mosaic pictures ) was given for both successful and failed response inhibitions .
In the second experimental go / no - go block , children from both groups were reinforced for successful inhibitions with social or monetary rewards presented block - wise .
One reward block consisted of six rewards of the same type .
Altogether 5 blocks of social ( total number of trials = 30 ) and 5 blocks of non-social rewards ( total number of trials = 30 ) were presented in a pseudorandom order .
Happy and exuberant facial expressions served as positive social reinforcers , while neutral facial expressions were shown after false alarms ( for validation of face stimuli , see [ 9 ] ) .
Correct inhibitions in non-social trials were positively reinforced with money , symbolized by different colored wallets each filled with a 50 Eurocent coin ; empty wallets were shown after false alarms .
Each child in the two groups won additional three Euros , irrespective of his performance , although he was informed that a better performance in the money condition would result in a higher amount of money paid after the experimental session .
Participants were reminded at the beginning of each experimental block to react quickly while maintaining a high level of accuracy .
We did not incorporate response cost manipulations in our go / no - go task ( e.g. , losing money for false alarms in the non-social condition ) , since we primarily focused on motivational effects of rewarding stimuli and not on punishment or punishment avoidance .
To ensure that all children understood the task instructions , experimental blocks were preceded by 20 practice trials with opportunities to repeat trials , if needed .
After each block , children were required to complete a subjective rating questionnaire to assess self - reported motivation , insight into performance , and aspects of task manipulations .
Subjective rating questionnaire
Following each experimental block , children were interviewed with a rating questionnaire .
The questionnaire was developed to assess self - reports on subjective experiences associated with performing different experimental manipulations .
A 5 - point Likert - type scale ( ranging from 0 to 4 ) was applied .
The children were asked ( 1 ) how much they were motivated doing the task prior to the start of the experimental procedure , ( 2 ) how motivating and ( 3 ) how difficult they found the task , ( 4 ) how satisfied they were with their performance , and ( 5 ) how rewarding they found the different feedback stimuli .
Statistical analysis
Dependent measures of the incentive go / no - go task – false alarm rates ( FA rates ) , reaction times for hits ( RT for hits ) , and reaction times for false alarms ( RT for false alarms ) – were analyzed using a multivariate ANOVA model with group as the between - subjects factor ( two levels : healthy controls , ADHD ) , and reward type as a within - subjects repeated factor ( three levels : non-reward , social reward , monetary reward ) , followed by univariate ANOVAs .
As age and IQ did not differ significantly between the groups and were not correlated with the dependent measures , these variables were not included as covariates in analysis of performance data .
The alpha level was set at 0.05 .
In addition , effect sizes were calculated using partial eta square ( η2 p ) .
Since omission errors were very infrequent ( below 3 % ) , they were not included in the analysis .
To analyze the effects of performance feedback on subjective rating scores , the Wilcoxon signed - rank test for related samples was employed .
Mann - Whitney U-tests were applied to assess differences between groups .
Concerning subjective motivation ratings , we specifically analyzed the differential changes in the two groups from the baseline to the reinforcement conditions using the non-parametric Pair Differences - U-test for two independent samples [ 15 ] .
All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 14.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , Illinois ) .

Soaring above the rugged British Columbia landscape , the young Austrian sensation Gregor Schlierenzauer will aim for gold .
But conspicuously absent will be women jumpers , who lost a legal battle to end Olympic ski jumping 's 86 - year history as a men 's - only sport .
Who to Watch
Gregor Schlierenzauer , AUT ( see video )
Schlierenzauer just turned 21 , but he ’s already celebrated more World Cup wins than birthdays .
His work ethic is renowned in the ski jumping world , where he made a name for himself last year by capturing the overall World Cup title .
Part of a dominant Austrian team , Schlierenzauer heads to Vancouver as one of the top - ranked jumpers in the world and a key contender for gold .
After the season , perhaps he ’ll have more opportunity to indulge is some of his hobbies – cooking , photography , and poker .
German speakers can check out his website for more personal details and photos .
Event Details
Click here for schedule and results .
In each of ski jumping ’s three events , competitors are judged on distance , form , and landing .
While a jumper 's technique scores are important in their overall score , the skier with the longest distance generally earns the most style points ( see how they train ) .
Each competition round is designed to allow the best jumpers to reach the point where the hill beings to level out , but no farther – if they were to land on the flatter part of the slope , it could result in serious injury .
To avoid such outcomes , judges determine how far up the in - run the athletes should start – the higher the start , the greater the opportunity to gain velocity .
Judges standing along the landing hill visually determine the length of each jump in case the video equipment fails .
But in the old days , there was no video system , and the competition results were decided by the naked eye .
Normal Hill Individual : Despite representing their countries at the Olympic Games , most of the athletes must first qualify to actually compete in the official competition .
While the top 15 internationally ranked jumpers are prequalified to participate in the medal - contention rounds , only the top 35 skiers from the Olympic preliminary jumps may join them .
There are two rounds of jumps : the 35 top performing athletes from the first round advance to the second .
In this final round , the best skiers jump last and lowest scoring skiers jump first
Large Hill Individual : Just like the normal hill individual competition but held on the large hill .
Team : Sixteen four - man teams compete in two rounds .
During the first round , each of the four jumpers has one attempt .
The top eight teams from the first round advance to the final round .
The team with the highest total score between both rounds wins
History
Forget ski cross or the snowboard half - pipe .
Ski jumping is the original extreme sport of the Winter Olympics .
Accelerating from 0 to 60 m.p.h. as fast as a BMW , ski jumpers launch off the in -run and fly as far as two football fields placed end to end .
Demanding explosive strength and technical precision , the graceful arc of the best jumpers belies the difficulty inherent in their sport .
For women , there ’s an added obstacle : The International Olympic Committee turned down a 2006 bid to add women 's jumping to the Olympic program , saying there was n't enough depth at the top level .
A group of female elite international ski jumpers took their case to the Canadian courts in an attempt to gain entrance to the 2010 Vancouver Games under a Canadian law that prohibits gender discrimination in government - sponsored activities .
Though the initial judge agreed that the IOC ’s refusal to admit women , which lack the depth of the men ’s field , constituted discrimination , but ruled that the Vancouver Organizing Committee was powerless to do anything about it .
That ruling was upheld on appeal , and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case , ending the women ’s bid to compete in Vancouver .

Vyacheslav Bykov : “ All games at the Olympics should be played with passion ” ( Photo © sportbox.ru )
Russian coach Vyacheslav Bykov talked about the reasons of the loss to Slovakia , stated that not all players had passion , explained why Alexander Ovechkin had three shootout attempts and talked about power play units in an interview to the Russian site gazeta.ru .
RussianHockeyFans.com offers you a translation .
– Do you agree that only the Zaripov - Zinoviev - Morozov line displayed some teamwork ?
Bykov : “ You are not far from being right .
We will try and find out why it happened .
I do n’t think that our players did n’t want it .
It ’s just that the opponent did n’t give us many opportunities .
But I also should notice that a lot of players lacked passion and thirst for game .
At the same time I agree that it was n’t our day . ”
– You experimented playing Ovechkin as the 4th forward on power play , tried this four times and then gave it up .
You are n’t going to use it anymore ?
Bykov : “ Most likely not .
We do n’t want to allow goals on our power play .
It ’s very risky and our guys are not ready for it .
The concentration should be very good and we lacked it today .
But we will seek for new ways . ”
– Are you going to shuffle the lines because some of them are n’t clicking ?
Bykov : “ Not now . ”
– What shortcomings of the team did you find out ?
Bykov : “ The players had no passion .
It looked like it was a regular game for them . ”
– Ovechkin was turned on the whole game , made like five hits .
Why were n’t other players pumped up ?
Bykov : “ Yes , Alexander was one of the players who tried to demonstrate their best during the whole game .
Others were in shadow . ”
– Are you going to change the preparation for the game against the Czech Republic ?
Bykov :
“ We have a plan and we are not going to change it . ”
– Why did Ovechkin have so many attempts in the shootout ?
He is n’t very good at it in the NHL .
Bykov : “ Because Ovechkin was one of the few who really fought .
Besides it was his wish . ”
– Are you satisfied with the defence ?
Bykov : “ Today we played better than in the first game against Latvia .
We committed one error and it led to the goal . ”
– Maybe it ’s even better now when Russia drove themselves into a corner .
To get a bye the team has to defeat the Czechs .
Bykov : “ My opinion is that all games at the Olympics should be played with passion . ”
– Canada lost points too .
Bykov : “ That ’s their problems . ”
– Players complained about the bad food and the Games organization …
Bykov : “ No , now they wo n’t say a thing .
You have to understand that they have certain wishes , which we and the Russia Olympic Committee need to fulfill .
The players live in good conditions , they have everything , the food is good .
Besides , do n’t forget that all teams live in the same conditions . ”

This is the definitive guide on purchasing and preparing the ing redients that make up a quality pizza .
It  s a massive resource that combines scientific findings and industry research with hands - on experience .
In doing so it provides proven practical answers for pizzeria owners , managers , chefs , buyers , R&D staff , suppliers , and franchisees , as well as at - home pizza - makers .
It is a redesigned and republished edition of the seminal pizza guide created by John Correll in 1992 .
The original book , first titled  The Pizza Managers Guide to Ingredient Purchasing and Preparation  and later changed to  Encyclopizza ,  was sold from 1992 to 1999 .
It was then retired , and remained out - of - print from 1999 to 2011 .
Growing demand from pizzeria operators and at - home pizza - makers has prompted the creation of this newly redesigned edition .
Its 440 pages are packed with vital information  including equipment specifications , proven recipes , step - by - step procedures , and a special trouble - shooting section for solving dough and crust problems .
Among many things , a reader can learn how to manage pizza dough for proper rise and consistency , design special dough and sauce formulas , create distinctive cheese blends , select the best brands , gain supplier help and cooperation , choose the right mixer and use it properly , apply labor - saving methods , and  most importantly  create an even better pizza .

This softcover book comes in a handy 8.5 by 11 inch page size .
It tips the scale at over two pounds , making it a weighty publication not only in content but also in heft .
In Corrells words :  Even though this is a modern version of a 20 - year old book , the vast majority of information contained in this reference resource ( like , say , about  99.9 percent ) remains relevant and highly useful .
Its new design and formatting creates an easy , pleasant reading experience  enhanced over the original 1992 print edition and greatly enhanced over the prior online version .
The books subtitle is Pizza Ingredient Purchasing and Preparation .
As this indicates , the book is about ingredient purchasing and preparation .
Accordingly , it does not cover pizza - making  i.e. , pizza assembly and baking .
Perhaps some day an additional Encyclopizzia - type book on pizzia assembly and baking will be produced .
SEOUL — North Korea is getting bigger , older and less healthy , according to data from the country 's latest census , and its fabled million - man army might have fewer than 700,000 people .
The authoritarian government in December released results of the census conducted in 2008 , saying its population had climbed to 24 million people from 21.2 million in the previous census in 1993 .
More details have been published by the United Nations Population Fund , which helped North Korea conduct the census and sent five teams of observers to monitor it .
Even so , it 's difficult for outsiders , with so little access to the country , to be certain of the precision of North Korea 's data .
For decades , the government has cut off the dissemination of most information about the country .
The new census numbers provide a rare glimpse of official statistics .
The census reported that North Korea 's population grew at an annual average rate of 0.85 % for the 15 - year period , a time that included a devastating multiyear famine that analysts and foreign aid agencies estimate killed between one million and two million people .
The elaborate assassination of a Hamas official last month in Dubai has all the earmarks of a Mossad operation and was likely sanctioned by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu , says a former case officer in the Israeli intelligence service .
Victor Ostrovsky , who wrote a controversial book about his four years with the Mossad in the 1980s , says that many of the details in the surveillance video of an alleged 11 - person assassination team indicate that the operation was likely rushed , and that the use of aliases belonging to Israeli citizens is a common tactic of the Mossad , though generally not for assassination plots .
The video and assassination have sparked extensive debate in the media , inside and outside Israel , over , among other things , the alleged assassin team ’s use of forged passports from the United Kingdom , Ireland , France and Germany .
At least seven of the passports used the names of residents in Israel who hold dual citizenship in other countries and who say they were not part of the operation .
They are now concerned that they could be targeted for revenge by Hamas or others .
Another three aliases are similar to the names of Israeli citizens , but they have different middle names .
There have been reports that some of the forged passports were being used for travel for at least six months prior to the assassination in Dubai .
The operation has resulted in diplomatic fallout for Israel , with British authorities demanding to know why UK passports were used in the plot .
Ostrovsky told Threat Level it was common during his time in the Mossad to ask permission of foreign - born Israelis to use their passports for intelligence operations .
“ When you come to live in Israel and you ’re a dual citizen , a lot of times you ’re asked for the use of your passport , ” he said .
“ In the 90s they used to ask .
Especially if you ’re in the military and you ’re an officer and you have dual citizenship . ”
But then , he says , there came a time when people began to say no “ and they started to do that without asking [ permission ] . ”
Ostrovsky said , however , that it was highly unusual to use the name of an Israeli for a kill operation such as this one .
Instead , such passports might be used for an undercover Israeli operative in the United Kingdom posing as a businessman traveling to Syria for a week or so for business .
“ It ’s not supposed to be used in operations like this .
It ’s not a throwaway .
It ’s not something you put at risk , ” he said .
“ Having used it this way shows that whoever did it was really in a rush . ”
Ostrovsky says he worked for the Mossad between 1982 and 1986 .
He spent two and a half years in training , after which he worked as a case officer out of Israel .
His job was to enter surrounding countries , such as Greece , Cyprus , Turkey and Jordan to recruit local spies for the Mossad .
Although he was never involved in assassination operations , he says he knows how they were conducted , and the Dubai operation matches Mossad tactics .
The Israeli government has acknowledged Ostrovsky ’s work for the Mossad and tried to halt publication of his book By Way of Deception .
Earlier this week , Dubai authorities released extensive footage from surveillance cameras that allegedly shows the movements of a professional 11 - person assassination team in the hours before and after a top Hamas leader was killed in January in a hotel room .
The government has since indicated that at least 17 people were involved in the operation , though it has only released the aliases used by 11 of them .
The footage , taken from cameras at the Dubai airport and several luxury hotels , follows the activities of 10 men and one woman as they arrived in Dubai on various European passports and moved among hotels and a shopping center , even changing disguises at one point , during the hours before Mahmoud al - Mabhouh was killed .
Al - Mabhouh , 48 , was a founder of Hamas ’ military wing and was also said to be a liaison for smuggling weapons from Iran to Gaza .
According to the Jerusalem Post , two weeks before he was killed he admitted in an interview later broadcast on Al Jazeera that he was responsible for kidnapping and murdering two Israeli soldiers in 1989 .
He said he had disguised himself as an Orthodox woman to conduct that attack .
Al - Mabhouh had survived at least three other assassination attempts , according to statements his family made to CNN .
He was found dead in room 230 at the Al - Bustan Rotana hotel on January 20 .
The door on al - Mabhouh ’s room was latched and chained from the inside .
An initial report indicated that he died from sudden high blood pressure in the brain , but his family told CNN that there were signs of electric shock on the back of his knees , behind his ears on his genitals and on his chest .
They say he was also smothered .
An investigation into hotel records and surveillance tapes uncovered the suspicious activities of a group of Westerners who were in the hotel at the time , most of whom are seen in the video wearing baseball caps to shield their faces .
Members of the group staked out al - Mabhouh ’s room on the hotel ’s second floor , met clandestinely in a shopping mall and other locations , donned wigs and other disguises and left the hotel briskly after the deed was done .
Dubai police have indicated that they have retinal scans of the suspects , that were taken at the Dubai airport as part of routine passenger scanning .
Investigators believe the assassins tried to reprogram the electronic lock on al - Mabhouh ’s door to gain entry .
Some news reports say the assassins entered the room while the victim was out and waited for him to return , while others say they were thwarted from entering the room when a hotel guest stepped off the elevator on al - Mabhouh ’s floor .
They then had to resort to tricking al - Mabhouh into opening his door to them after he returned .
Interpol has issued wanted notices for the 11 suspects .
Dubai authorities have blamed the Mossad for the attack and have called on Interpol to issue a “ red notice ” for Mossad chief Meir Dagan .
Israeli foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman told an Israeli radio channel that “ There is no reason to think that it was the Israeli Mossad and not some other intelligence service or country up to some mischief . ”
Ostrovsky told Threat Level that there ’s little doubt for him that the Mossad is behind the plot .
He said the number of people involved in the operation indicates that it may have been put together in a rush .
“ The less time you have to plan and carry out an operation , the more people you need to carry it out [ on the ground ] , ” he said .
“ The more time you have to plan . . . there ’s a lot of things you eliminate . ”
If you know that you can stop the elevator in the basement , for example , you do n’t then need people guarding the elevator lobby on the victim ’s floor to make sure no one steps off the elevator , he said .
He says it was likely that the Mossad ’s second in command for operations was in the hotel or the area when the assassination took place and has gone unnoticed by the Dubai authorities .
Dubai police identified one of the team members named “ Peter Elvinger ” as the leader of the operation .
Elvinger was caught on tape at the Dubai airport shortly after arriving the morning of the assassination .
He left the airport terminal , then came back in to speak with someone briefly .
Shortly after the victim checked into his hotel room , Elvinger booked the room across from the victim ’s room .
But he never entered the room .
Instead he gave the key to other team members , who used the room to organize their attack .
Elvinger also left Dubai an hour before the killing occurred .
Ostrovsky , however , said the real leader of the operation “ would be one of the last ones to leave ” and would not have departed before the operation was completed .
Ostrovsky said that ever since the agency bungled an operation in Lillhammer in 1973 when it killed a waiter erroneously believed to be part of the Palestinian Black September group , it has stationed a high - ranking officer on the ground to call off kill operations at the last minute if needed .
The identity of this officer is generally not known by the public or even to most members of the kill team , who would only have indirect communication with the officer through a command center .
According to investigators in Dubai , the alleged assassins never called each on their phones , but did make a number of calls to Austria , where their command and control center was believed to be stationed .
Ostrovsky said although the operatives scattered to various parts of the world after the operation was completed , he believes they ’re all back in Israel now .
He says other countries are likely sifting through their airport surveillance tapes now to track the final destination of the team members .
He added that the Mossad was likely surprised by how the Dubai authorities pieced everything together so well and publicized the video and passport photos of the suspects .
“ Nobody thought that somebody was going to piece that all together , ” he said .
“ After all , who really cares about a guy in Hamas ?
There ’s a perception that . . . the Arab world does n’t really like Palestinians and that everyone would say it ’s just another terrorist killed , great .
Nobody ’s going to make a fuss . ”
He said he ’s surprised that Israel would have risked such an operation while the government is in the midst of negotiations to release Israeli soldier , Gilad Shalit , who is reportedly being held prisoner in Gaza by Hamas since June 2006 .
“ It shocks that they would do [ the assassination ] now , ” Ostrovsky said .
“ But that ’s Netanyahu in my opinion . ”
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was in office in 1997 during another Mossad assassination operation .
This one involved agents who , under Netanyahu ’s orders , traveled to Jordan on forged Canadian passports and ambushed Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal as he was entering his office building , injecting him with a lethal nerve toxic .
The plot backfired , however , when one of Meshaal ’s bodyguards gave chase and caught the agents .
Israel was forced to provide Jordanian authorities with an antidote to the poison to save Meshaal .
Ostrovsky said that despite the Dubai operation ’s success , it was amateurish at moments .
He points to the bad disguises the suspects used — wigs , glasses and moustaches — and the fact that some of the suspects seemed to slip into the same room to change their disguises .
He also points to two of the suspects who followed the victim to his hotel room while dressed in tennis outfits and who did n’t seem to know what they were doing .
The two seemed to confer momentarily while the victim exited the elevator , as if deciding who would follow the victim to his room .
A hotel employee accompanying the victim to his room even glanced back at the two , as if noticing their confusion .
“ A lot of people in the field make those mistakes and they never come up because they ’re never [ caught on tape ] , ” Ostrovsky said .

It may not be The Crying Game but " Crying Girl " ( Nakigao , in Japanese ) from Amuse Soft Entertainment has its fair share of crying .
In fact , it 's almost ALL crying .
One after another , 11 minor female celebs shed real tears as they recount some of the worst days of their lives .
The " 11 stories of people crying in earnest " , as the DVD 's tag line states , include some that really do n't seem so terrible but instead reflect the rigors of being an up & coming model in Japan 's fiercely competitive " idol " culture :
Marika , who was yelled at by her manager .
Risa , who had been jilted by her boyfriend .
Nana , who saw a bad picture of herself in a magazine .
Shiho , who cried when her boyfriend said goodbye .
Mai , who cried " touching the loneliness of the city " .
Yutaka , who has a friend with cancer who 's engaged to be married .
If the Crying Girl DVD was being marketed in the Western World , it would certainly be aimed at women who can sympathize , empathize and ultimately feel catharsis through sharing the sad recollections of the 11 women on the DVD .
But that 's not the case - Crying Girl , which will be available at Amazon Japan from March 26th , appears to be aimed at Japanese men .
This is a tricky concept , but it seems that men in Japan need to have their " conquering instinct " stoked up , and the way to do this is by watching beautiful women cry .
Yep , in a nutshell : men feel stronger after experiencing the weakness of women .
Try expressing that select philosophical nugget over here and you 'll earn yourself a swift kick in the , er , nutshells .
But hey - Japan is a different culture and Crying Girl just underlines that fact .
What 's that ?
Oh , the Crying Girl DVD will cost you 2,940 yen ( discounted to 2,176 yen , about $ 24 ) , tax included .
Knock yourself ( and ONLY yourself ) out .
The army of denialist bloggers and cyber - bullies is sometimes accused of being the tool of fossil fuel companies .
Although there is certainly a concordance of interests , that is as far as the relationship goes .
The bloggers are motivated not by financial gain ( indeed , their activities may have a financial cost ) but by political grievances and an anti-elite worldview at odds with the mainstream .
Nevertheless , it is true that the raw material that feeds their anger is generated overwhelmingly by a network of right - wing think tanks and websites in part funded by Big Carbon .
These links , which have been heavily documented , are close enough to provoke the Royal Society to take the unprecedented step of writing to Exxon Mobil asking the company to desist from funding anti-science groups .
Yet the funding continues , often through foundations that in effect launder oil and coal money to make it more difficult to trace to its sources .
One of the more important conduits is the Washington - based Atlas Economic Research Foundation .
Atlas supports financially a network of some 200 libertarian think tanks around the world , including ( according to an investigation by US magazine Mother Jones ) the Institute of Public Affairs and the Centre for Independent Studies in Australia .
Atlas co-sponsored the Heartland Institute 's climate sceptic conference in Washington last June attended by a number of prominent Australian skeptics .
The Heartland Institute has received funding from Exxon Mobil and earlier received funding from Philip Morris to campaign against smoking restrictions .
It has superseded Frontiers of Freedom and the Competitive Enterprise Institute as the foremost US " think tank " working to discredit climate science and stop action on climate change .
Black ops
The deployment of think tanks and sceptic websites to attack climate science has been a carefully planned strategy that was developed in the United States in the mid-1990s .
It was refined with the advice of political consultant Frank Luntz who in 2002 urged the Republican Party to undermine the credibility of climate science by commissioning " independent " experts to " make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate " .
The strategy is comprehensively exposed by former PR insider Jim Hoggan in his recent book Climate Cover - Up .
The strategy 's use of operations that fall into the " grey area " of political campaigning - such as the creation of fake citizens groups to advance the interests of fossil fuel companies - is well - known and continuing .
Only now is light being shone on a far more sinister campaign of black operations .
The hacking into computers at the Climatic Research Centre at the University of East Anglia is only part of a more extensive campaign of black ops organised by elements of the denial industry in the run-up to the Copenhagen meeting .
Others include break - ins to the offices of climate scientists , an attempt to infiltrate the computer system at the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis at the University of Victoria by two people posing as technicians , and industrial espionage directed at US green groups .
The think tanks
Although Australia does not have the proliferation of well - funded conservative think tanks that have been so influential in US politics , local counterparts have served effectively as conduits for the stream of anti-science pouring out of their kindred organisations in the United States .
They have also been instrumental in publicising and promoting the work of Australian sceptics such as Ian Plimer and Bob Carter .
There are three established think tanks and a new one emerging .
Lavoisier Group : Perhaps better described as an advocacy group than a think tank , the Lavoisier Group was founded in 1999 by Hugh Morgan , then CEO of Western Mining Corporation and a former president of the Mining Industry Council , and his long - time political operative Ray Evans .
Its board consists mostly of mining industry figures .
Evans has close links with the Competitive Enterprise Institute , for some years the most active denialist think tank in the United States .
Evans , with Morgan 's backing , had created a string of organisations promoting conservative causes , including the anti-union H.R Nicholls Society ( with which the Lavoisier Group shares a postal address ) and the Samuel Griffiths Society , committed to defending states ' rights .
The Lavoisier Group brings together leading sceptics at its conferences , promotes sceptics ' books , and publishes material such as " Nine Lies About Global Warming " , penned by Evans and parroted by sceptical columnists in the newspapers .
A book edited by Evans was last year launched by Senator Barnaby Joyce , now the shadow finance minister .
Institute of Public Affairs :
The oldest think tank in Australia , and with close links to the Liberal Party , the IPA took up the denialist cause early .
The IPA is coy about its funding sources , but is known to have received the bulk of its income from mining , resource and tobacco companies .
In addition to promoting the work of Australian sceptics like Ian Plimer , the IPA has hosted international visitors such as Bjorn Lomborg and Mark Steyn , events attended by Liberal Party heavyweights .
The IPA also sponsored the visit to Australia of President Putin 's former adviser Andrei Illarianov who fulminated against " fraudulent science " and described the Kyoto Protocol as a " death pact " , " an interstate Auschwitz " , " a sort of international Gosplan , a system to rival the former Soviet Union 's " , an argument bizarre even in the world of climate denial , but reasonable enough to be reproduced by The Australian .
Centre for Independent Studies :
The CIS projects itself as a more moderate conservative think tank , but has not been able to resist promoting climate scepticism .
After struggling in its early years , it was reprieved by a major funding boost from six mining companies , a rescue facilitated by Hugh Morgan .
Among its board members is Sir Rod Eddington , a senior business adviser to the Labor Government .
It has hosted a string of climate sceptics from overseas and Australia .
Brisbane Institute : The Brisbane Institute has for some years been a middle - of - the - road think tank but appears to have been taken over by climate sceptics .
Some of its followers were shocked to hear that the Institute would host the Brisbane leg of Christopher Monckton 's Australian tour .
Last year the Brisbane Institute hosted a public lecture by Dr Jay Lehr , Science Director of the Heartland Institute .
As we saw , the Heartland Institute is now the most active climate denialist organisation in the United States .
Lehr was presented by the Brisbane Institute as an " internationally renowned " scientist , which is simply untrue ; he has been heavily criticised for distorting and misrepresenting climate science .
He is better known for spending three months in jail for defrauding the US Environmental Protection Authority in 1991 .
The Brisbane Institute is perfectly entitled to take the denialist road .
The puzzle is why the University of Queensland , the Institute 's primary sponsor , would support an organisation that promotes anti-science .
Paying for Monckton and Fehr to trash climate science in Brisbane does not seem compatible with the University 's aim " to achieve internationally - acknowledged excellence in all forms of research " .
Several scientists from the University serve as authors or reviewers for the IPCC , a body attacked as fraudulent by Monckton and Lehr .
The University of Queensland appears unconcerned about linking itself with climate denial .
In 2008 it accepted a donation of $ 350,000 from a climate change sceptic , channeled through the IPA , who wanted it to be spent on funding doctoral research on climate change .
Of course , the University said there would be no strings attached .
These think tanks are at the heart of the denial movement in this country .
They provide funding and organisational capacity , they convene conferences and private meetings , they commission sceptical scientists to write papers , they publish and promote sceptical papers and books , they supply " experts " to the media and they lobby at every opportunity .
Every sceptical scientist , no matter how independent he starts out , is sooner or later drawn into the web formed by these think tanks .
In Australia , Bob Carter is a favourite of the Heartland Institute and the Lavoisier Group , Ian Plimer is an associate of the Institute for Public Affairs and an adviser to Nigel Lawson 's Global Warming Policy Foundation , and William Kinninmonth ( the Australian sceptic with perhaps the strongest claims to being a climate scientist ) allowed his book to be launched by the Lavoisier Group .
The links of these sceptics to political organisations with strong ideological agendas stands in sharp contrast to the vast assemblage of legitimate climate scientists who have no political connections .
Yet it is the latter who are accused of being politicised .
Backlash against the 60s
Despite their financial support from Big Carbon , it would be wrong to believe that the conservative think tanks operate solely at the behest of the fossil fuel industries .
Their objectives are principally ideological and they would still be campaigning against climate science without funding from Exxon Mobil and others ; they would just be less effective .
In the United States and Australia , it is probably true that they have received more funding from right - wing foundations with no links to Big Carbon than from oil and coal companies ( although some , like the Scaife Foundations , owe their wealth to oil ) .
So , in the end , their motives are political rather than commercial .
The arms of the denialist war on climate science - the bloggers and letter writers ; the right wing columnists like Andrew Bolt , Christopher Pearson and Miranda Devine ; the Murdoch broadsheets ; and the conservative think tanks - are united by one factor , a hatred of environmentalism .
Environmentalism is variously seen to be the enemy of individual freedom , an ideology of smug elites , an attack on capitalism and consumerism , and the vanguard of world government .
This antagonism towards the real or assumed ideas of environmentalism is spiced with a loathing for " green culture " represented by the image of the long - haired tree - huggers who want to impose their ascetic lifestyle on others .
Politically , climate denialism represents a backlash against the advances begun by the social movements of the 1960s and their destabilisation of traditional social structures and beliefs , including those of the right of humans to exploit the natural world , which helps explain why its activists are overwhelmingly older .
Raging against climate science fits perfectly with the worldview , style and audience demographic of populist shock - jocks like Alan Jones , Australia 's answer to Rush Limbaugh .
To turn back the tide of denialism , perhaps the most significant step would be for those conservative leaders who accept the science to speak out loudly and clearly about the need to take action .
It is in their hands to break down the belief that global warming is somehow a left - wing cause .

Website performance is a hugely important topic , so much so that the big companies of the Web are obsessed with it .
For the Googles , Yahoos , Amazons and eBays , slow websites mean fewer users and less happy users and thus lost revenue and reputation .
In your case , annoying a few users would n’t be much of a problem , but if millions of people are using your product , you ’d better be snappy in delivering it .
For years , Hollywood movies showed us how fast the Internet was : time to make that a reality .
Even if you do n’t have millions of users ( yet ) , consider one very important thing : people are consuming the Web nowadays less with fat connections and massive computers and more with mobile phones over slow wireless and 3G connections , but they still expect the same performance .
Waiting for a slow website to load on a mobile phone is doubly annoying because the user is usually already in a hurry and is paying by the byte or second .
It ’s 1997 all over again .
Performance is an expert ’s game … to an extent .
You can do innumerable things to make a website perform well , and much of it requires in - depth knowledge and boring testing and research .
I am sure a potential market exists for website performance optimization , much like there is one now for search engine optimization .
Interestingly , Google recently announced that is a hugely important topic , so much so that the big companies of the Web are obsessed with it .
For the Googles , Yahoos , Amazons and eBays , slow websites mean fewer users and less happy users and thus lost revenue and reputation .
In your case , annoying a few users would n’t be much of a problem , but if millions of people are using your product , you ’d better be snappy in delivering it .
For years , Hollywood movies showed us how fast the Internet was : time to make that a reality .
Even if you do n’t have millions of users ( yet ) , consider one very important thing : people are consuming the Web nowadays less with fat connections and massive computers and more with mobile phones over slow wireless and 3G connections , but they still expect the same performance .
Waiting for a slow website to load on a mobile phone is doubly annoying because the user is usually already in a hurry and is paying by the byte or second .
It ’s 1997 all over again ..
You can do innumerable things to make a website perform well , and much of it requires in - depth knowledge and boring testing and research .
I am sure a potential market exists for website performance optimization , much like there is one now for search engine optimization .
Interestingly , Google recently announced that it will factor performance into its search rankings , so this is already happening .
That said , you can do a lot of things without having to pay someone to point out the obvious .

Know Your Performance Blockers
Performance can be measured in various ways .
One way is technical : seeing how fast a page loads and how many bytes are transferred .
Another is perceived performance , which ties into usability testing .
This can only be measured by testing with users and seeing how satisfied they are with the speed of your interface ( e.g. do they start clicking on your JavaScript carousel before it is ready ? ) .
The good news ( and hard truth ) about performance is that 80 to 90 % of poor performance happens in the front end .
Once the browser gets the HTML , the server is done and the back - end developer can do nothing more .
The browser then starts doing things to our HTML , and we are at its mercy .
This means that to achieve peak performance , we have to optimize our JavaScript , images , CSS and HTML , as well as the back end .
So here are the things that slow down your page the most .
External Resources ( Images , Scripts , Style Sheets )
Every time you load something from another server , the following happens :
The browser opens up the Internet ’s address book and looks up the number associated with the name of the server that ’s holding the things you want ( i.e. its DNS entry ) .
It then negotiates a delivery .
It receives the delivery ( waiting for all the bytes to come in ) .
It tries to understand what was sent through and displays it .
Every request is costly and slows down the loading of the page .
This is also caused by browsers loading things in chunks ( usually four at a time ) rather than all at the same time .
This is akin to ordering a product from a website , choosing the cheapest delivery option and not being at home between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm .
If you include several JavaScript libraries because you like a certain widget in each , then you ’ll double , triple or even quadruple the time that your page takes to load and display .
Scripts
JavaScript makes our websites awesome and fun to use , but it can also make for an annoying experience .
The first thing to know about scripts that you include in a document is that they are not HTML or CSS ; the browser has to call in an expert to do something with them .
Here is what happens :
Whenever the browser encounters a < script > block in the document , it calls up the JavaScript engine , sits back and has a coffee .
The script engine then looks at the content in the script block ( which may have been delivered earlier ) , sighs , complains about the poor code , scratches its head and then does what the script tells it to do .
Once the script engine is done , it reports back to the browser , which puts down its coffee , says good - bye to the script engine and looks at the rest of the document ( which might have been changed , because the script may have altered the HTML ) .
The moral of the story is to use as few script blocks as possible and to put them as far down the document as possible .
You could also use clever and lazy JavaScript , but more on that later .
Images
Here is where things get interesting .
Optimizing images has always been the bane of every visual designer .
We build our beautiful images in Illustrator , Photoshop or Fireworks and then have to save them as JPG , GIF or PNG , which changes the colors and deteriorates the quality ; and if we use PNG , then IE6 arrives as the party - pooper , not letting us take advantage of PNG ’s cool features .
Optimizing your images is absolutely necessary because most of the time they are the biggest files on page .
I ’ve seen people jump through hoops to cut their JavaScript down from 50 KB to 12 KB and then happily use a 300 KB logo or “ hero shot ” in the same document .
Performance needs you !
Finding the right balance between visual loss and file size can be daunting , but be grateful for the Web preview tool , because we did n’t always have it .
I recall using Photoshop 4 and then Photoshop with the Ulead SmartSaver , for example .
The interesting thing about images , though , is that after you have optimized them you can still save many more bytes by stripping unnecessary data from the files and running the files through tools that further compress the images but are non-lossy .
The bad news is that many of them are out there , and you ’ll need different ones for different image formats .
The good news is that tools exist that do all that work for you , and we will come back to this later .
For more advanced optimizaition techniques feel free to take a closer look at the Smashing Magazine ’s articles Clever JPEG Optimization Techniques , PNG Optimization Guide and Clever PNG Optimization Techniques .
All of those companies that obsess about page performance offer tools that allow you to check your own website automatically and make it easy to work around problems .
Test Your Performance
The first thing to do is find out how your website can be optimized .
Here are three great tools ( among others that crop up all the time ) to use and combine .
Yahoo’s YSlow
YSlow is a Firebug add - on from Yahoo that allows you to automatically check your website for performance issues .
The results are ranked like American school grades , with A being the best and F being the worst .
The grades are cross -linked to best practice documentation on the Yahoo performance pages .
You can test several settings : “ classic YSlow , ” which is targeted to Yahoo - sized websites , “ YSlow 2 ” and “ small site or blog . ”
Results are listed clearly and let you click through to learn .
In the components view , YSlow lists all of the issues it has found on your website and how serious they are :
The statistics view in YSlow gives you all information in pie charts :
The tools section in YSlow offers a lot of goodies :
JSLint Checks the quality and security of your JavaScripts by running them through JSLint .
All JS Shows all JavaScript code in a document .
All JS Beautified Shows all JavaScript code in a document in an easy - to - read format
All JS Minified Shows all JavaScript code in a document in a minified format ( i.e. no comments or white space )
All CSS
Show all CSS code in a document
All Smush .it Automatically compresses all of your images ( more on this later ) .
Printable View Creates a printable document of all of YSlow ’s results ( great for showing to a client after you ’ve optimized the page ! )
Google ’s Page Speed
Like YSlow , Page Speed by Google is also an add - on for Firebug .
Its main difference is that it does a lot of the optimization for you and provides the modified code and images immediately .
Page Speed ’s other extra is that it monitors the overall activity of your page , allowing you to see when a document loads other resources after it has been loaded and to see what happens when a user rolls over elements or opens tabs and menus that load content via AJAX .
Be careful with this feature , though : it hammers your browser quite hard .
AOL ’s WebPageTest
Rather late to the game , AOL ’s WebPageTest is an application with some very neat features .
( It is also available as a desktop application , in case you want to check Intranets or websites that require authentication . )
WebPageTest allows you to run tests using either IE8 or IE7 from a server in the US or the UK , and it allows you to set all kinds of parameters , such as speed and what to check for :
Once you have defined your parameters and the testing is completed , you will get in - depth advice on what you can do to optimize .
You ’ll get :
A summary ,
Detailed results ,
A performance review ,
An optimization report ,
The content breakdown ,
The domain breakdown ,
A screenshot .
One very cool feature of WebPageTest is the visual recording you get of how long it takes for page elements to show up on screen for users .
The following screenshot compares the results of this blog , Ajaxian and Nettuts + :
You can even create a video of the rendering , which is another very cool thing to show clients .
Once you get the test results , it is time to fix any problems .
Use Image Sprites
Image Sprites were first discussed in an article published by Dave Shea and based on the work of Petr Stanicek .
They have been covered extensively here before , but understanding their full benefit is important before you start using them :
All of your images will be available as soon as the main image has loaded ( no flickering on roll - overs or other annoyances ) .
One HTTP request is made , instead of dozens ( or hundreds , in some cases ) .
Images have a much higher chance of staying cached on the user ’s machine because they are contained in a single file .
Shea ’s article points out a lot of cool resources for creating CSS Sprites but misses one that was released not long ago .
Sprite Me was produced by Google ( under the supervision of Steve Souders ) and allows you to create Sprites automatically from any website , even via a bookmarklet .
It analyzes the images on a page and offers you various options before generating the Sprite and CSS for you .
Here ’s a video of Steve showing Sprite Me in action :
Optimize Your Images
You know now that Page Speed can automatically optimize your images .
Another way to do this is with Yahoo ’s Smush
It , which is a set of image optimization tools that analyze your images , create the smallest possible versions and sends you a ZIP file of them all .
You can use Smush . it directly in the browser or automatically from YSlow .
The website tells you how many bytes you can save by optimizing your images .
This is yet another cool thing to show potential clients when pitching for a job .
Collate Scripts and Load Scripts on Demand
As noted , try not to spread your < script > nodes all over the document , because the browser stops whenever it encounters one .
Instead , insert them as far down in the document as possible .
You could even collate your scripts automatically in one single include using back - end scripts .
Edward Eliot wrote one of these in PHP a while ago .
It lets you create a single JavaScript include for all of your scripts and one for your CSS files , and it even versions them for you .
JavaScript can be added dynamically to the page after the page has loaded .
This technique is called “ lazy loading , ” and several tools are available to do it .
Jan Jarfalk has one to lazy load jQuery plug-ins .
Some JavaScript libraries let you import only what you really need , instead of bringing in the whole singing - and - dancing library .
YUI , for example , has a configurator that allows you to pick and choose what you need from the library and either gives you a single URL where you can get the different scripts or creates a JavaScript that loads them on demand :
Notice that a tab tells you what the overall size of the library will be .
The main trick in lazy loading is to dynamically create script nodes with JavaScript after the page has loaded and only when they are needed .
I wrote about that two years ago on 24 ways , and it has been a best practice for displaying badges and widgets for a long time now .
Use Network Distributed Hosting
If you use a library or CSS provided by a library , make sure to use the hosted versions of the files .
In the case of YUI , this is done for you if you use the configurator .
And you can pick from Yahoo or Google ’s network .
For other libraries , there is a Google code repository of AJAX libraries .
This is useful for a few reasons :
Visitors to your website will get the JavaScript and CSS from the server that is as geographically close to them as possible and wo n’t have to wait for your server to send the information from around the globe .
There is a high probability that these servers are faster than yours .
Visitors who have visited other websites that use the same includes will already have them on their computers and wo n’t need to load them again .
You save on bandwidth and can easily upgrade the library by changing the version number of the include .
While you probably would n’t be able to afford distributed hosting for your own files , Coral makes an interesting offer to distribute your data onto a network of servers for an affordable $ 50 a month .

Follow The Leaders
To learn more about website performance , here are some resources and people to follow .
( Be warned : some of the content is technically tough . )
Joel has decided to chase venture capital for StackOverflow , but I ca n’t exactly figure out why .
He lists six benefits that just do n’t compute under even light scrutiny :
1 . The Answers market is in a land grab mode
Unlike eBay , where there ’s a general market for goods and you get huge network effects from having a critical mass of buyers and sellers , StackOverflow is all about niches .
People who are searching for “ how to make sql server not go slow ? ” are n’t likely to bleed over to “ how to make swedish meatballs ? ” .
This means that you ’ll have to fight for every niche .
Similar to how general forums would have to fight for every niche .
Just because you have a forum site that ’s big for gamers , you wo n’t have much of an edge attracting foodies .
Finally , it ’s not like this is a new idea with no other entrants .
Look at Yahoo Answers for a site that ’s still up with a similar model and look at Google Answers for another that could n’t be turned into a worthwhile business and closed .
2. Stack Overflow is like Starbucks
It really is n’t .
Starbucks can use capital efficiently because they have big capital expenditures securing land , building out stores , and purchasing coffee machines .
Where ’s the capital intensity part of starting another answers site ?
Adding another server ?
Coming up with a new design ?
It does n’t seem like Stack Overflow can efficiently use big money for anything but advertising itself .
Which is kinda funny when the whole business is about getting page views to sell for ad crumbs .
It also rings very much like dot -com .
Remember when all you had to do was get eyeballs ?
Oh , it ’s free ?
Who cares , let ’s make it up on volume !
3. Stack Overflow wants to get on Techcrunch
If you ’re listing the publicity of “ Stack Overflow raises $ 10 M in Series A by Fancy Schmancy VC ” as the 3rd pro for taking money , you ’re bound to be in trouble .
The Techcrunch post you ’re going to get from this is going to scroll off the front page in 4 hours and nobody who ’s actually going to use your service is going to care .
Do you think people looking for an answer to “ how do I get the three gold rings in zelda ? ” is going to give a hoot who ’s money you ’re burning to provide that forum ?
Or even that the advertisers you ’re hoping to attract is going to look at anything else than CPM and demographics for a clue on whether to invest ?
No .
4 . The investor will give you advice , connections , and introductions
They may , but most of the introductions your typical investor is going to give you is how to get you out in 3 - 5 years .
You can find a lot of advice in many places .
Rarely is the quality of the advice associated with having money involved of largely superior quality .
And if you end up building something of considerable value , then the connections and introductions will come all by themselves .
You usually have to work to fight them off with a stick when things are going great .
And getting an intro to Mr. Very Important Person before you have anything of material value is usually not going to give you much anyway .
5 . Taking money means big exit or IPO
I ’d argue the opposite .
When you take money , your exit is bound to be smaller unless you ’re playing the Web 2.0 lottery game ( where a few lucky contestants gets bought for sums completely uncorrelated to business fundamentals ) .
Taking money means giving up equity , which means there ’ll be less left over if you happen to build something that ’s valuable enough for others to buy .
And I do n’t know if you ’ve heard , but the IPO markets are n’t all that interested in eyeball companies without the numbers to back them up any more .
Does n’t matter how many letters of the alphabet you ’ve used for series whatever funding before you got there .
If you can build a great , profitable business , you ’ll have all the options to sell or go IPO .
Taking VC only complicates that .
6 . Taking VC will make your company successful
This one is funny .
So if you ’re not looking to take VC and play the Web 2.0 lottery or aim for an early exit , you ’re just in it for “ personal aggrandizement ” .
If you take the money , you just want the best for your business .
Spot the disconnect here .
Now even given all this , there ’s actually still an argument for why Joel should take the money .
It ’ll probably lower the chances of Stack Overflow ultimately succeeding as a long - term sustainable business , but if he has eyed that he has a hot property right now , it ’ll be a good time to take some money off the table .
A fool and his money will soon be departed applies equally to venture capitalists as it does to everyone else .
If Joel and co. can negotiate a deal with Sand Hill road to give them a nice payout as part of the deal , this might well be even better than trying to shop around Stack Overflow for a sale that it ’s probably premature for .
Much better to take a small slice of the proceeds from a “ if this just get 1 % of the billion dollar advertising market ” than to take the slice from “ how much money did you make for the past 12 months ? ” of a strictly look - at - the - books sale .
Go cherries , go !
After a post we featured earlier this year on whether deaf people can hear hallucinated voices , I was sent an amazing study that attempted to distil the variety of ‘ hearing voices ’ experiences in deaf people .
It was published in the journal Cognitive Neuropsychiatry in 2007 ( there ’s a full text copy available online as a pdf ) and attempted to avoid some of the pitfalls of studying auditory hallucinations in people with absent or limited hearing .
Some of the earlier research on deaf people who hear voices has been criticised for assuming that when a deaf person describes a ‘ voice ’ it automatically means they are having a similar experience to hearing people .
For example , when a deaf person describes the experience as ‘ loud ’ they may just mean it is particularly intrusive , rather than that it has specific auditory properties .
This later study used a sorting method , were a number of statements about what the experience could be like ( some illustrated ) were presented to deaf participants and they are asked to select the ones that best describe their experiences .
The data was then analysed using factor analysis – a statistical procedure that , in this case , was used to group participants whose experiences were similar .
Five groups or ‘ factors ’ were found , and I ’ve reproduced the descriptions below as they are a completely fascinating insight into how these experiences appear in their diverse and varied forms .
Factor A : Nonauditory voices with subvisual perception of voice - articulators in the mind ‚Äôs eye
These experiences were mostly reported by profoundly deaf participants who were deaf at birth or before the development of language .
Voices were reported to be nonauditory , clear , and easy to understand .
Participants were certain that they did not hear any sound when voices were present .
They did not consider questions about pitch , volume , and loudness relevant to their experiences .
Participants knew the identity and gender of the voice but did not deduce this information from the way it sounds .
They reported seeing an image of the voice communicating with them in their mind ‚Äôs eye when voice hallucinations were present .
All participants had experienced seeing an image of the voice signing or lips moving in their mind .
Imagery of fingerspelling was also seen but was less common .
These images appeared to be subvisual in nature and distinct from true visual hallucinations .
They were clearly understood as originating internally and several participants stated that the image could still be perceived with their eyes closed .
Factor B : Mixed perception and uncertainty about how voices are perceived .
These experiences were mainly reported by deaf people who had experience of hearing speech and used hearing aids .
The participants were uncertain about whether their voice hallucinations were auditory in nature .
Comprehensibility and clarity are variable .
The voice used speech / lip movements to convey its ‚Äô message and occasionally fingerspelling and gesture .
The voice was perceived as sometimes being silently articulated and sometimes having sound .
Participants were uncertain if the voice was mouthing with or without vocalisation .
Despite this uncertainty , Participant 10 was able to make attributions about voice pitch , volume , and loudness .
No primary visual hallucinations were reported , although Participant 10 described seeing a stationary image of her deceased husband when the voice was present .
There was less certainty about whether a visual image was present when the hallucinations occurred but participants agreed that the hands / lips of the voice could be perceived but that they were unclear .
Strange sensations were perceived in the body both when the voice was present and not present .
These included the perception of air currents , electric currents , and vibrations .
Factor C : Poorly defined voices .
These experiences were largely reported by participants who were born deaf in developing countries and spent their early years without hearing aids or formal language , only acquiring sign language as their first language after moving to the UK after the critical period for language development
The voices were poorly defined , hard to understand and unclear , with no definitive statements about exact voice properties but rather a picture of what they were not .
There were contradictory responses about whether the voices made sound or not .
It was not clear whether participants were completely unable to make judgements about pitch and volume because the voices were not auditory in nature , or because they did not possess a sufficiently developed concept of sound - based descriptions .
There was a great deal of uncertainty about voice genesis that may have led the participants to speculate that they might be ‚ Äò ‚Äòhearing ‚Äô‚Äô something when they were present .
This factor is unique because participants did not perceive imagery of the voice articulators during hallucinations .
The gender and identity of the voice were unknown and there was much more uncertainty about which language or modality the voice used to communicate .
Participants were unable to articulate voice content but merely described a sense of being persecuted and criticised by an external other .
Factor D : Auditory voices .
These experiences were reported by deaf people who were born moderately or moderately severely deaf and used hearing aids .
Voices were auditory and participants report that they could always hear sounds when the voices were present .
Participant 11 was able to make judgements about auditory properties including pitch and volume .
Participant 7 was less able to provide qualitative description of acoustic aspects but she was convinced that she could hear the voices .
Interestingly , the bilingual participant showed a mixed pattern of voice perception .
She experienced predominantly auditory hallucinations but also reported silently articulated sign language hallucinations , with concurrent subvisual imagery of the articulators similar to those experienced by participants on Factor A. Factor E : Voices and true visual , olfactory , gustatory , and tactile phenomena
These experiences were reported by two deaf participants who were both profoundly deaf .
This factor was distinguished by the presence of true visual , auditory , olfactory , and gustatory phenomena , which occurred separately to voice hallucinations .
These included tinnitus , the perception of a black shadow darting through peripheral vision , strange smells emanating from the body , and a petrol taste in the mouth .
Other phenomena occurred in conjunction with the voices such as vibrations and electric currents in the body , which occurred only when the voice was present .
Participant 25 reported seeing a true visual hallucination of someone signing to her in real space as well as imagery of the voice in her mind ‚Äôs eye .

The wonders of cooperative inheritance , or using super in Python 3
by Michele Simionato
February 3 , 2010
Summary
This essay is intended for Python programmers wanting to understand the concept of cooperative inheritance and the usage of super .
It does not require any previous reading .
The target is Python 3.0 , since it has a nicer syntax for super , even if most of what I say here can be backported down to Python 2.2 .
Advertisement
Most languages supporting inheritance support cooperative inheritance , i.e. there is a language - supported way for children methods to dispatch to their parent method : this is usually done via a super keyword .
Things are easy when the language support single inheritance only , since each class has a single parent and there is an unique concept of super method .
Things are difficult when the language support multiple inheritance : in that case the programmer has to understand the intricacies of the Method Resolution Order .
Why cooperative hierarchies are tricky
This paper is intended to be very practical , so let me start with an example .
Consider the following hierarchy ( in Python 3 ) : class A ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : print ( ' A.__init__ ' ) super ( ) .__init__ ( ) class B ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : print ( ' B.__init__ ') super ( ) .__init__ ( ) class C( A , B ) : def __init__ ( self ) : print ( ' C.__init__ ' ) super ( ) .__init__ ()
What is the " superclass " of A ?
In other words , when I create an instance of A , which method will be called by super ( ) .__init__ ( ) ?
Notice that I am considering here generic instances of A , not only direct instances : in particular , an instance of C is also an instance of A and instantiating C will call super ( ) .__init__( ) in A.__init__ at some point : the tricky point is to understand which method will be called for indirect instances of A .
In a single inheritance language there is an unique answer both for direct and indirect instances ( object is the super class of A and object .
__init__ is the method called by super ( ) .__init__ ( ) ) .
On the other hand , in a multiple inheritance language there is no easy answer .
It is better to say that there is no super class and it is impossible to know which method will be called by super ( ) .__init__ ( ) unless the subclass from wich super is called is known .
In particular , this is what happens when we instantiate C : >>> c = C( ) C.__init__ A.__init__ B.__init__
As you see the super call in C dispatches to A.__init__ and then the super call there dispatches to B.__init__ which in turns dispatches to object .
__init__ .
The important point is that the same super call can dispatch to different methods : when super ( ) .__init__( ) is called directly by instantiating A it dispatches to object .
__init__ whereas when it is called indirectly by instantiating C it dispatches to B.__init__ .
If somebody extends the hierarchy , adds subclasses of A and instantiated them , then the super call in A.__init__ can dispatch to an entirely different method : the super method call depends on the instance I am starting from .
The precise algorithm specifying the order in which the methods are called is called the Method Resolution Order algorithm , or MRO for short .
It is discussed in detail in an old essay I wrote years ago and interested readers are referred to it ( see the references below ) .
Here I will take the easy way and I will ask Python .
Given any class , it is possibly to extract its linearization , i.e. the ordered list of its ancestors plus the class itself : the super call follow such list to decide which is the right method to dispatch to .
For instance , if you are considering a direct instance of A , object is the only class the super call can dispatch to : >>> A.mro( ) [< class ' __main__.A '> , < class ' object ' > ]
If you are considering a direct instance of C , super looks at the linearization of C : >>> C.mro( ) [< class ' __main__.C '> , < class ' __main__.A '> , < class ' __main__.B'> , < class ' object ' > ]
A super call in C will look first at A , then at B and finally at object .
Finding out the linearization is non-trivial ; just to give an example suppose we add to our hierarchy three classes D , E and F in this way : >>> class D : pass >>> class E( A , D ) : pass >>> class F( E , C ) : pass >>> for c in F.mro( ) : ... print( c.__name__ )
F E C A D B object
As you see , for an instance of F a super call in A.__init__ will dispatch at D.__init__ and not directly at B.__init__ !
The problem with incompatible signatures I have just shown that one cannot tell in advance where the supercall will dispatch , unless one knows the whole hierarchy : this is quite different from the single inheritance situation and it is also very much error prone and brittle .
When you design a hierarchy you will expect for instance that A.__init__ will call B.__init__ , but adding classes ( and such classes may be added by a third party ) may change the method chain .
In this case A.__init__ ( when invoked by an F instance ) will call D.__init__ .
This is dangerous : for instance , if the behavior of your code depends on the ordering of the methods you may get in trouble .
Things are worse if one of the methods in the cooperative chain does not have a compatible signature , since the chain will break .
This problem is not theoretical and it happens even in very trivial hierarchies .
For instance , here is an example of incompatible signatures in the __init__ method ( this problem affects even Python 2.6 , not only Python 3.X ) : class X ( object ) : def __init__ ( self , a ) : super ( ) .__init__ ( ) class Y( object ) : def __init__ ( self , a ) : super ( ) .__init__ ( ) class Z ( X , Y ) : def __init__ ( self , a ) : super ( ) .__init__(a)
Here instantiating X and Y works fine , but as soon as you introduce Z you get in trouble since super ( ) . __init__( a ) in Z.__init__ will call super ( ) .__init__( ) in X which in turns will call Y.__init__ with no arguments , resulting in a TypeError !
In older Python versions ( from 2.2 to 2.5 ) such problem can be avoided by leveraging on the fact that object .
__init__ accepts any number of arguments ( ignoring them ) , by replacing super ( ) .__init__ ( ) with super ( ) .__init__( a ) .
In Python 2.6 + instead there is no real solution for this problem , except avoiding super in the constructor or avoiding multiple inheritance .
In general if you want to support multiple inheritance you should use super only when the methods in a cooperative chain have consistent signature : that means that you will not use super in __init__ and __new__ since likely your constructors will have custom arguments whereas object .
__init__ and object .
__new__ have no arguments .
However , in practice , you may inherits from third party classes which do not obey this rule , or others could derive from your classes without following this rule and breakage may occur .
For instance , I have used super for years in my __init__ methods and I never had problems because in older Python versions object .
__init__ accepted any number of arguments : but in Python 3 all that code is fragile under multiple inheritance .
I am left with two choices : removing super or telling people that those classes are not intended to be used in multiple inheritance situations , i.e. the constructors will break if they do that .
Nowadays I tend to favor the second choice .
Luckily , usually multiple inheritance is used with mixin classes , and mixins do not have constructors , so that in practice the problem is mitigated .
The intended usage for super Even if super has its shortcomings , there are meaningful use cases for it , assuming you think multiple inheritance is a legitimate design technique .
For instance , if you use metaclasses and you want to support multiple inheritance , you must use super in the __new__ and __init__ methods : there is no problem , since the constructor for metaclasses has a fixed signature ( name , bases , dictionary ) .
But metaclasses are extremely rare , so let me give a more meaningful example for an application programmer where a design bases on cooperative multiple inheritances could be reasonable .
Suppose you have a bunch of Manager classes which share many common methods and which are intended to manage different resources , such as databases , FTP sites , etc .
To be concrete , suppose there are two common methods : getinfolist which returns a list of strings describing the managed resorce ( containing infos such as the URI , the tables in the database or the files in the site , etc. ) and close which closes the resource ( the database connection or the FTP connection ) .
You can model the hierarchy with a Manager abstract base class class Manager ( object ) : def close ( self ) : pass def getinfolist ( self ) : return [ ] and two concrete classes DbManager and FtpManager : class DbManager ( Manager ) : def __init__ ( self , dsn ) : self.conn = DBConn ( dsn ) def close ( self ) : super ( ) .close ( ) self.conn.close ( ) def getinfolist ( self ) : return super ( ).getinfolist ( ) + [ ' db info ' ] class FtpManager ( Manager ) : def __init__ ( self , url ) : self.ftp = FtpSite ( url ) def close ( self ) : super ( ) .close ( ) self.ftp.close( ) def getinfolist ( self ) : return super ( ).getinfolist ( ) + [ ' ftp info ' ]
Now suppose you need to manage both a database and an FTP site : then you can define a MultiManager as follows : class MultiManager ( DbManager , FtpManager ) : def __init__ ( self , dsn , url ) : DbManager.__init__(dsn ) FtpManager.__init__(url )
Everything works : calling MultiManager.close will in turn call DbManager.close and FtpManager.close .
There is no risk of running in trouble with the signature since the close and getinfolist methods have all the same signature ( actually they take no arguments at all ) .
Notice also that I did not use super in the constructor .
You see that super is essential in this design : without it , only DbManager .close would be called and your FTP connection would leak .
The getinfolist method works similarly : forgetting super would mean losing some information .
An alternative not using super would require defining an explicit method close in the MultiManager , calling DbManager.close and FtpManager.close explicitly , and an explicit method getinfolist calling `DbManager.getinfolist and FtpManager.getinfolist : def close ( self ) : DbManager.close(self ) FtpManager.close( self ) def getinfolist ( self ) : return DbManager.getinfolist( self ) + FtpManager.getinfolist ( self )
This would be less elegant but probably clearer and safer so you can always decide not to use super if you really hate it .
However , if you have N common methods , there is some boiler plate to write ; moreover , every time you add a Manager class you must add it to the N common methods , which is ugly .
Here N is just 2 , so not using super may work well , but in general it is clear that the cooperative approach is more effective .
Actually , I strongly believe ( and always had ) that super and the MRO are the right way to do multiple inheritance : but I also believe that multiple inheritance itself is wrong .
For instance , in the MultiManager example I would not use multiple inheritance but composition and I would probably use a generalization such as the following : class MyMultiManager ( Manager ) : def __init__ ( self , * managers ) : self .
managers = managers def close ( self ) : for mngr in self .
managers : mngr.close ( ) def getinfolist ( self ) : return sum( mngr.getinfolist ( ) for mngr in self .
managers )
There are languages that do not provide inheritance ( even single inheritance ! ) and are perfectly fine , so you should always question if you should use inheritance or not .
There are always many options and the design space is rather large .
Personally , I always use super but I use single - inheritance only , so that my cooperative hierarchies are trivial .
The magic of super in Python 3 Deep down , super in Python 3 is the same as in Python 2.X .
However , on the surface - at the syntactic level , not at the semantic level - there is a big difference : Python 3 super is smart enough to figure out the class it is invoked from and the first argument of the containing method .
Actually it is so smart that it works also for inner classes and even if the first argument is not called self .
In Python 2.X super is dumber and you must tell the class and the argument explicitly : for instance our first example must be written class A ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : print ( ' A.__init__ ' ) super ( A , self ) .__init__ ()
By the way , this syntax works both in Python 3 and in Python 2 , this is why I said that deep down super is the same .
The new feature in Python 3 is that there is a shortcut notation super ( ) for super ( A , self ) .
In Python 3 the ( bytecode ) compiler is smart enough to recognize that the supercall is performed inside the class A so that it inserts the reference to A automagically ; moreover it inserts the reference to the first argument of the current method too .
Typically the first argument of the current method is self , but it may be cls or any identifier : super will work fine in any case .
Since super ( ) knows the class it is invoked from and the class of the original caller , it can walk the MRO correctly .
Such information is stored in the attributes .__thisclass__ and .__self_class__ and you may understand how it works from the following example : class Mother ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : sup = super ( ) print( sup.__thisclass__ ) print( sup.__self_class__ ) sup.__init__( ) class Child ( Mother ) : pass >>> child = Child ( ) < class ' __main__.
Mother '> < class ' __main__ .
Child '>
Here .__self__class__ is just the class of the first argument ( self ) but this is not always the case .
The exception is the case of classmethods and staticmethods taking a class as first argument , such as __new__ .
Specifically , super ( cls , x ) checks if x is an instance of cls and then sets .__self_class__ to x.__class__ ; otherwise ( and that happens for classmethods and for __new__ ) it checks if x is a subclass of cls and then sets .__self_class__ to x directly .
For instance , in the following example class C0 ( object ) : @classmethod def c( cls ) : print ( ' called classmethod C0.c ' ) class C1 ( C0 ) : @classmethod def c( cls ) : sup = super ( ) print (' __thisclass__ ' , sup.__thisclass__ ) print('__selfclass__ ' , sup.__self_class__ ) sup.c( ) class C2 ( C1 ) : pass the attribute .__self_class__ is not the class of the first argument ( which would be type the metaclass of all classes ) but simply the first argument : >>> C2.c( ) __thisclass__ < class ' __main__.C1 '>
__selfclass__ < class ' __main__.C2 '> called classmethod C0.c
There is a lot of magic going on in Python 3 super , and even more .
For instance , this is a syntax that cannot work : def __init__ ( self ) : print ( ' calling __init__ ' ) super ( ) .__init__ ( ) class C ( object ) : __init__ = __init__ if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : c = C ( )
If you try to run this code you will get a SystemError : super ( ) : __class__ cell not found and the reason is obvious : since the __init__ method is external to the class the compiler cannot infer to which class it will be attached at runtime .
On the other hand , if you are completely explicit and you use the full syntax , by writing the external method as def __init__ ( self ) : print ( ' calling __init__ ' ) super( C , self ) .__init__ ( ) everything will work because you are explicitly telling than the method will be attached to the class C .
I will close this section by noticing a wart of super in Python 3 , pointed out by Armin Ronacher and others : the fact that super should be a keyword but it is not .
Therefore horrors like the following are possible : def super ( ) : print ( " I am evil , you are NOT calling the supermethod ! " ) class C ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : super ( ) .__init__( ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : c = C ( ) # prints " I am evil , you are NOT calling the supermethod ! "
DON'T DO THAT !
Here the called __init__ is the __init__ method of the object None !!
Of course , only an evil programmer would shadow super on purpose , but that may happen accidentally .
Consider for instance this use case : you are refactoring an old code base written before the existence of super and using from mod import * ( this is ugly but we know that there are code bases written this way ) , with mod defining a function super which has nothing to do with the super builtin .
If in this code you replace Base . method ( self , * args ) with super ( ) . method ( * args ) you will introduce a bug .
This is not common ( it never happened to me ) , but still it is bug that could not happen if super were a keyword .
Moreover , super is special and it will not work if you change its name as in this example : # from http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2010/1/7/pros-and-cons-about-python-3 _super = super class Foo( Bar ) : def foo( self ) : _super ( ) .foo ()
Here the bytecode compiler will not treat specially _super , only super .
It is unfortunate that we missed the opportunity to make super a keyword in Python 3 , without good reasons ( Python 3 was expected to break compatibility anyway ) .

The owners of several high traffic adult " tube " sites have developed an application that enables porn studios to prevent copyright infringement at no cost .
The new system initially got some press coverage on an industry news outlet , but the coverage was pulled after complaints from some of the major porn studios .
The rise of YouTube and all the adult - focused video streaming sites that followed has caused major headaches for the adult entertainment industry .
Instead of having to worry about people seeding their content on BitTorrent , so called “ tube sites ” are now the prime threat .
The owners of these streaming sites tend to be very cooperative and assist in taking down copyrighted material when they ’re asked to .
In fact , the owners of several popular streaming sites have recently launched a system through which the porn studios can protect their entire catalogs for free .
The system named COP - CMS creates unique fingerprints for each of their videos .
It then checks all current videos on the participating “ tube ” sites and removes any matches it finds and prevents the video from being uploaded in the future .
“ We believe we have one the most robust systems available .
Videos can be matched even if they ’re blurred , resized , rotated or have sections removed .
Our system is accurate enough to detect a video from just 1 second of footage , ” Torrent Freak was told by David , one of the people behind the COP - CMS system .
The innovative anti-piracy solution was picked up by XBIZ , one of the leading adult news outlets , and is already in use by several porn studios .
However , not all studios were equally happy about this free anti-piracy service offered by the ‘ pirate ’ tube sites , possibly because it directly competes with their own solution .
In the forum thread discussing the XBIZ article on the COP - CMS system , several studio representatives vent their concerns .
The overall opinion seems to be that these “ scoundrel thieves ” do n’t deserve the coverage , and not too long after the article was posted the head of leading porn studio TitanMedia replied that “ It ’s been taken care of … ”
Indeed , the article on XBIZ was pulled from the site .
“ We rang xbiz.com and spoke to the editor who said they had been contacted by someone about us and now the article is “ dead in the water , ” Steve told TorrentFreak , adding that he never got an explanation why .
Coincidentally , the Free Speech Coalition ( FSC ) , the trade association for the adult entertainment industry announced it ’s very own anti-piracy solution on XBIZ a day later .
Could it be that this upcoming competitor was one of the reasons why the other article was pulled ?
If we take a look at the directors of the FSC we see that they are made up of a TitanMedia lawyer , the founder of XBIZ and the Senior Editor from AVN news .
Something smells fishy here , to say the least .
Meanwhile , COP - CMS continues its free service and is currently working with several studios that are not members of FSC .
On the other hand , the Free Speech Coalition might have to rethink whether or not it should change its name after this alleged gagging escapade .
It happens that a number of " conspiracy theories " - generally consigned to the bin for loonies today - are actually proven true .
At least , that 's the premise of a pretty compelling bin of data with supportive evidence ( in many cases ) .
In 1933 , group of wealthy businessmen that allegedly included the heads of Chase Bank , GM , Goodyear , Standard Oil , the DuPont family and Senator Prescott Bush tried to recruit Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler to lead a military coup against President FDR and install a fascist dictatorship in the United States .
And yes , we 're talking about the same Prescott Bush who fathered one US President and grandfathered another one .
In 1934 , the Business Plot was publicly revealed by retired Marine Corps Major General Smedley Butler testifying to the McCormack - Dickstein Congressional Committee .
In his testimony , Butler claimed that a group of men had approached him as part of a plot to overthrow Roosevelt in a military coup .
-------------------------------------------
The HSCA was established in 1976 to investigate the John F. Kennedy assassination and the Martin Luther King , Jr. assassination .
The Committee investigated until 1978 , and in 1979 issued its final report , concluding that President John F. Kennedy was probably assassinated by a conspiracy involving the mob , and potentially the CIA .
The House Select Committee on Assassinations undertook reinvestigations of the murders of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King , Jr. In 1979 , a single Report and twelve volumes of appendices on each assassination were published by the Congress .
In the JFK case , the HSCA found that there was a " probable conspiracy . "
It 's interesting that our media tend to minimize , or to dismiss , and in some cases simply refuse to report such findings .
The JFK assassination was carried out by one guy - Lee Harvey Oswald .
Jack Ruby was just a citizen acting out of moral outrage .
And a prominent bridge is up for sale .
Wait , what ?
Overthrow and install a fascist dictatorship ( pretty much what we seem to have going now , but that 's another story ) ?
Joe Basel , one of the guys arrested after sneaking into Mary Landrieu 's office to tamper with her phones , was , you will be shocked to hear , a complete " douchebag " in college .
Basel is the one who bragged on Facebook about having a date with one of Scott Brown 's available daughters .
He honed his Conservative Stuntcraft as a student at the University of Minnesota - Morris , which is a small , public liberal arts school .
( Yes , he went to a public liberal arts school and complained relentlessly about how liberal everyone was .
You could n't get into Bob Jones , Joe ? )
We mentioned , earlier , the time he set off a racial incident by putting up posters calling for White Males to be Killed ( he was making an ironic statement about Racism , which is to say that he does n't understand what it is and how it works ) .
Anyway , Joe was apparently the beneficiary of what amounts to affirmative action : the liberal student paper hired him to contribute , not because of his talent or skill at journalism , but because they needed some token conservatives .
Joe , oddly , did not quit in disgrace rather than subject himself to the humiliation of being selected over a more qualified white liberal writer !
In an otherwise unremarkable piece , Basel printed a quote from an anonymous source supposedly paraphrasing something insulting the state Majority Leader said .
Journalism , ladies and gentlemen :
According to one Morris lobbyist , " Senator Dean Johnson , Majority Leader of the Senate , was extremely rude and verbally stated that none of the legislators were going to listen to the college kids in the capital .
He also shared his belief that all college students are about drinking and partying .
All this animosity was inserted between snide comments about the Governor and his cronies . "
Positively Game Change - esque , right ?
Maybe this guy does have a future in journalism !
Anyway , many people , including Dean Johnson ( who was , seriously , a decent guy and a good public servant and a Lutheran Minister , and not the sort of idiot to say things like this ) , asked for this to maybe be retracted .
Basel 's liberal editors and publisher stood behind him , though , and never apologized for anything !
The next year , Basel started a competing conservative newspaper because the one that let him run irresponsible , unsupported anonymous smears was too liberal .
We wonder , just as Ravi wondered why conservatives Are n't Funny , why conservatives produce such shoddy , shitty " journalism " for their dedicated Conservative Journalism projects .
( The answer is actually pretty simple : the ones who want to go into conservative advocacy journalism are political hacks with a proud contempt for " facts . " )
After Massachusetts : Obama fakes anti-Wall Street stance
By Patrick Martin
25 January 2010
In a public statement criticizing the major banks Thursday , followed by a speech on jobs in the industrial town of Elyria , Ohio , Friday , President Barack Obama has begun a transparent effort to posture as the defender of the people against corporate interests .
In what media pundits and White House insiders have described as a “ pivot to populism , ” Obama has responded to the shock defeat of the Democratic Party in the US Senate election in Massachusetts with a round of verbal bashing of Wall Street .
White House aides who appeared on the Sunday television interview programs indicated that Obama would incorporate populist themes into his first State of the Union address , to be delivered Wednesday evening to a joint session of Congress and a national television audience .
Top White House political aide David Axelrod claimed that the defeat of the Democrats in Massachusetts was not an anti-Obama vote .
“ The same forces that we saw at play in Massachusetts were the ones that propelled him to office , ” he said .
“ There ’s no reinventing any message here .
It ’s a reaffirmation of a message .
And that is our goal to advocate fiercely for the middle class and for people all across this country who ’ve been struggling in this economy and long before the recession . ”
This kind of language shows how the Democratic Party will seek to make a verbal appeal to working people leading up to the November congressional elections , after a year in which the Obama administration and the Democratic - controlled Congress have worked to boost corporate profits and prop up the US financial aristocracy .
In his statement Thursday , Obama scolded Wall Street for precipitating the crash of September 2008 .
“ This economic crisis began as a financial crisis , when banks and financial institutions took huge , reckless risks in pursuit of quick profits and massive bonuses , ” he said .
“ Markets plummeted , credit dried up , and jobs were vanishing by the hundreds of thousands each month .
We were on the precipice of a second Great Depression . ”
He continued : “ To avoid this calamity , the American people — who were already struggling in their own right — were forced to rescue financial firms facing crises largely of their own creation .
And that rescue , undertaken by the previous administration , was deeply offensive but it was a necessary thing to do , and it succeeded in stabilizing the financial system and helping to avert that depression . ”
This is a potted history that downplays the central role that Obama himself and his top economic policy advisers played .
Obama supported the bailout begun under the Bush administration and voted for it in the Senate .
As the Democratic presidential nominee and heavy favorite to win the November election , his support was necessary for passage , and he pledged that if elected his administration would continue the program .
Half the initial $ 700 billion in bailout funds , and the vast majority of the loan guarantees and other subsidies to Wall Street , were doled out by the Obama administration , with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner playing the major role .
The total financial resources dwarfed , by more than 30 to 1 , the amount provided for the rest of America in the so - called economic stimulus package — a clear indication that for Obama , as for Bush and every other Democratic and Republican politician , defending the financial aristocracy is the number - one priority .
As for Obama ’s cynical reference to “ the American people , ” they had no say whatsoever in the bank bailout , which was deeply unpopular at the time and has only become more hated as the banks saw their profits and stock prices soar and resumed their speculative binge and self - rewarding bonus pools of previous years .
Obama combined this grotesque distortion of the bailout ’s history with claims that his administration would now carry out far - reaching measures to prevent any recurrence of the financial crash .
He did not explain the delay of an entire year since the biggest financial crash since the Great Depression , and gave few details , instead pledging , “ Never again will the American taxpayer be held hostage by a bank that is ‘ too big to fail . ’ ”
Obama said he would propose a ban on proprietary trading by deposit - taking commercial banks as well as a ban on these banks investing in or owning hedge funds and private equity funds .
This announcement , made without providing any details , came as a surprise to European and Asian governments and markets , sparking uncertainty and near - panic and contributing to sharp declines Thursday and Friday on stock markets in the US and internationally .
Obama concluded by criticizing “ an army of industry lobbyists from Wall Street descending on Capitol Hill , ” and declared , “ if these folks want a fight , it ’s a fight I ’m ready to have . ”
Given that the Obama administration is largely staffed by financial industry figures — including Geithner , chief economic adviser Lawrence Summers , and chief of staff Rahm Emanuel — this is the crassest kind of false pretense .
The real class allegiance of the Obama administration is demonstrated by the individual Obama brought forward as the point man in his “ attack ” on the banks — Paul Volcker , the former Federal Reserve Board chairman in the administrations of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan .
Volcker was widely hated by American workers in 1980s for his policy of sky - high interest rates , which devastated manufacturing and caused the highest unemployment since the Great Depression , until exceeded in the current slump .
Obama intensified the populist rhetoric in his speech Friday before a largely working class audience in Elyria , Ohio .
He reiterated the word “ fight ” as many as 20 times , and sought to present his reactionary health care program , based on slashing spending for Medicare and taxing the health benefits of higher - paid workers , as though it was an economic boon to working people rather than to corporate America .
While this speech was televised live by the cable networks and given considerable publicity in the media as a whole , there was less notice taken of Obama ’s remark that banks might be subject to too much rather than too little regulation .
“ The banks feel as if regulators are looking over their shoulder , discouraging them from lending , ” he told the town hall - style meeting .
He said he had told Treasury Secretary Geithner not to let “ the pendulum swing too far . ”
In the midst of his bank - bashing , Obama took time off to reassert his confidence in Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and urge wavering Democrats to vote this week to confirm Bernanke ’s reappointment to a second term .
Administration lobbyists were aggressively working on Capitol Hill after several Democratic senators announced their opposition to the nomination in an effort to strike a populist pose after the Massachusetts vote .
White House vote counters claimed Saturday they had secured the 60 votes to break any filibuster against the Bernanke nomination .
Obama ’s support for the chief architect of the bank bailout underscores the insincere and politically driven character of his populist rhetoric .
The establishment press openly speaks of the political expediency underlying Obama ’s show of anger toward the banks .
The Washington Post , in a front - page analysis Sunday , commented that in the wake of the Massachusetts debacle , “ The president ’s rhetoric over the past week suggests he has decided to try to fight anger with anger .
If Americans are fed up with bank bailouts and bonuses going to their top executives , Obama wants people to believe that he resents them just as much . ”
With considerable understatement , the Post commented : “ His fight , fight , fight rhetoric marks a big change in his demeanor , ” adding , “ there is little question that a dose of populist rhetoric holds the promise of some political benefit for Obama .
When voters think the administration has done more for bankers and auto companies and big corporations than for them , the president has to show otherwise . ”
The White House also disclosed that it was bringing in campaign manager David Plouffe and other operatives from the 2008 campaign to hone its political messaging .
This underscores that the populist rhetoric is all show and no substance .
Obama and his top advisers want to posture as opponents of Wall Street , while privately reassuring the financial interests that little or nothing will actually be done to curb their speculative practices and massive bonuses .
They calculate that with the congressional Republicans committed to vote on principle against any policies proposed by the White House , they can gain political advantage by presenting supposedly punitive measures against Wall Street and allowing the Republicans to defeat them through a Senate filibuster or an alliance with conservative Democrats in either house of Congress .
Thanks for writing me about my comments on my program regarding homosexuality .
It might be worth noting that what I actually suggested is that we impose the same sanctions on those who engage in homosexual behavior as we do on those who engage in intravenous drug abuse , since both pose the same kind of risk of contracting HIV / AIDS .
I 'd be curious to know what you think should be done with IV drug abusers , because whatever it is , I think the same response should be made to those who engage in homosexual behavior .
If you believe that what drug abusers need is to go into an effective detox program , then we should likewise put active homosexuals through an effective reparative therapy program .
Secondly , I 'm afraid you 're simply wrong about the Bible 's perspective on the law and homosexuality .
Paul lists quite explicitly in 1 Timothy 1:8- 11 the actions and behaviors that are the proper concern of the law :
" Now we know that the law is good , if one uses it lawfully , understanding this , that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient , for the ungodly and sinners , for the unholy and profane , for those who strike their fathers and mothers , for murderers , the sexually immoral , men who practice homosexuality , enslavers , liars , perjurers , and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine ... "
The bottom line here is that , biblically , those " who practice homosexuality " should come under the purview of the law just as much as those who take people captive in order to sell them into slavery .
You express a belief in the Scriptures , and I trust your confidence in Scripture is not selective .
If you believe all Scripture is inspired , then you are compelled to accept that legal sanctions may appropriately be applied to those who engage in homosexual behavior .
President Obama 's health - care bill is now moving toward final passage .
The policy issues may be coming to an end , but the legal issues are certain to continue because key provisions of this dangerous legislation are unconstitutional .
Legally speaking , this legislation creates a target - rich environment .
We will focus on three of its more glaring constitutional defects .
First , the Constitution does not give Congress the power to require that Americans purchase health insurance .
Congress must be able to point to at least one ...
The decisive turn came in summer 2006 , when the insurgency exploded across southern and eastern Afghanistan , with depth and skill .
It has n’t been the same since .
Image Gen. Stanley McChrystal Credit ... Tyler Hicks / The New York Times
By any measure , 2009 was the most difficult and demoralizing year .
“ The Afghan insurgency can sustain itself indefinitely , ” Maj. Gen. Michael Flynn , the head of military intelligence , said in a briefing paper at year ’s end .
Twice as many American troops died in combat in 2009 as the year before .
Worst of all : the model of democratic rule painstakingly constructed since 2001 collapsed , in the presidential election , under an avalanche of fraud .
Which brings us to now .
The capture of Mr. Baradar , followed by the arrest of two Taliban “ shadow governors ” in another Pakistani city , suggested that the haven the insurgency ’s leaders have used for so long might not be so safe after all .
If that proves true , the potential impact — on Taliban operations , on the prospects for a negotiated peace — seemed enormous .
Still , it was the mission in Marja that seemed to bear the most potential , if only because in the end the war ’s outcome is going to be decided on Afghan ground .
In Marja , the Americans , British and Afghans were implementing the ambitious new strategy championed by Gen. Stanley McChrystal , the top military commander .
Under that plan , killing the insurgents in Marja figured as the least important part of the battle .
( As it was , the heaviest fighting appeared to be over by week ’s end . )
What comes after the shooting , by General McChrystal ’s account , is what matters most : building an Afghan government , police force and army that can keep the Taliban out after the fighting is over .
Failing to do so — to build institutions to allow the Afghan state to stand on its own — has been the main shortcoming of America ’s strategy since 2001 .
There are many reasons to believe that General McChrystal ’s plan could work .
Among his own forces , he has sharply curtailed the use of heavy firepower in order to spare Afghan civilians .
He has stepped up the training and recruitment of the Afghan Army and police , to prepare for the day when the Americans and Europeans have left .
In Marja , he has insisted that Afghans play a large role , putting more than five Afghan battalions in the field .

Australia has warned Israel it is " gravely concerned " about the use of Australian passports in an alleged assassination in Dubai and demanded full co-operation into an investigation into the incident .
The Foreign Affairs Minister , Stephen Smith , today said that preliminary analysis by Australian officials indicated the passports had been duplicated or altered .
The passports were issued in 2003 , before enhancements were made to Australian documents .

Mr Smith called in the Israeli ambassador , Yuval Rotem , in Canberra this morning and demanded " full and transparent co-operation " from Israeli authorities .
TMZ has obtained the newest , face piercing - less , mug shot for Brian Bonsall -- that adorable kid from " Family Ties " -- who was arrested today after allegedly failing a drug test .
Authorities in Boulder , Colorado say the 28 - year - old had weed in his system , a direct violation of his bond in an ongoing assault case .
Brian 's lawyer says the former kid star needs the green stuff for headaches -- but has no medical marijuana card .
Bonsall was already in court for an incident in 2009 -- in which he allegedly smacked a friend in the face with a bar stool .
He plead not guilty to the assault charge .
But as you can see from the trio of mug shots , Bonsall is no stranger to trouble -- he was arrested back in 2007 for allegedly beating up his then - girlfriend .
At least he took out the lip rings .
When NASA 's satellite operators need accurate , real - time space - weather information , they turn to the Community Coordinated Modeling Center ( CCMC ) of the Space Weather Laboratory at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. The CCMC 's newest and most advanced space - weather science tool is the Integrated Space Weather Analysis ( iSWA ) system .
The iSWA is a robust , integrated system provides information about space weather conditions past , present , and future and , unlike many other programs currently in use , has an interface that the user can customize to suit a unique set of data requirements .
" The iSWA space - weather data analysis system offers a unique level of customization and flexibility to maintain , modify , and add new tools and data products as they become available , " says Marlo Maddox , iSWA system chief developer at NASA Goddard .
iSWA draws together information about conditions from the sun to the boundary of the sun 's influence , known as the heliosphere .
The iSWA systems digests information from spacecraft including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 's ( NOAA ) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites ( GOES ) , NASA 's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory ( STEREO ) , the joint European Space Agency and NASA mission Solar and Heliospheric Observatory ( SOHO ) , and NASA 's Advanced Composition Explorer ( ACE ) .
Citizen scientists and science enthusiasts can also use the data , models , and tools of the iSWA system .
Similar to the way in which armchair astronomers have used SOHO data to discover comets , enthusiasts will find the iSWA system a wonderful resource for increasing their familiarity with the concept of space weather .
" We are continuously evolving the iSWA system , and we hope that it will benefit not only NASA satellite operators , but also that it may also help space - weather forecasting at other agencies such as the Air Force Weather Agency and NOAA , " says Michael Hesse , chief of the Space Weather Laboratory at NASA Goddard .
Space - weather information tends to be scattered over various Web sites .
NASA Goddard space physicist Antti Pulkkinen says the iSWA system represents " the most comprehensive single interface for general space - weather - related information , " providing data on past and current space - weather events .
The system allows the user to configure or design custom displays of the information .
The system compiles data about conditions on the sun , in Earth 's magnetosphere -- the protective magnetic field that envelops our planet -- and down to Earth 's surface .
It provides a user interface to provide NASA 's satellite operators and with a real - time view of space weather .
In addition to NASA , the iSWA system is used by the Air Force Weather agency .
Access to space - weather information that combines data from state - of - the - art space - weather models with concurrent observations of the space environment provides a powerful tool for users to obtain a personalized " quick look " at space - weather information , detailed insight into space - weather conditions , as well as tools for historical analysis of the space - weather 's impact .
Development of the iSWA system has been a joint activity between the Office of the Chief Engineer at NASA Headquarters and the Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate and the Science and Exploration Directorate at NASA Goddard .
The iSWA system is located at NASA Goddard .
The Community Coordinated Modeling Center is funded by the Heliophysics Division in the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters , and the National Science Foundation .

If movies are right , bank robbers are the coolest .
They look like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt and Clive Owen .
They use lasers and explode things and seduce un-seducible women .
They ’re so criminally righteous , they actually come out on the side of justice , moral superiors to the invariably greedy Capitalist / Cop / Society on the legal side of the law .
Movies , upon brief examination of reality , are wrong .
It ’s doubtful movies have even been to a bank robbery .
Style - wise , the modern bank robber more closely resembles the Hamburgler than Johnny Depp .
His getaway car is a bike .
He gets covered in exploding blue ink .
A hostage tweets the whole thing .
It ’s a wonder the modern bank robber can tie his own shoes .
Maybe he has Velcro .
In the aftermath of Rip " Don Geiss " Torn ’s bizarre , addled attempt at money - taking , GQ looks back at the greatest epically botched bank jobs of all time .
One afternoon in 2007 , Anthony Miller robbed a bank to go to jail and escape his " overbearing " wife .
According to court testimony , Miller waltzed up to the teller , brandished a gun , demanded money , and asked her to call the police .
He and his wife are no longer married .
Step One : Blast the roof off bank and steal money .
Step Two : Realize you destroyed the roof of the wrong building .
Step Three : Proceed to next building .
Step Four : Blast roof off and steal money
Step Five : Realize you can’t blast through the roof .
Because that ’s how banks are designed .
Lesson : Blueprints .
Or , do n’t steal things .

I have seen these rain gutter bookshelves several places online and have always thought they would be wonderful to have in our book loving home .
Then I saw them at my friend Heather ’s house , asked if she liked them , how easy they were to clean , etc. and I finally decided to take the plunge .
The theory behind these rain gutter book shelves is that they encourage children to read more because they can see the fronts of the books and are intrigued , rather than just seeing the edge of the book and not being able to tell what it is about .
Our children have always read a lot , but the little ones are reading even more since we installed these shelves .
The first day that the shelves were in , my two year old , upon waking from his nap , grabbed a book and came running out asking me to read it to him .
All the children are reading more of our books and several of the older ones were heard saying , “ Oh , I forgot we had that book , it ’s one of my favorites ” about a book that had been on the book shelves in their bedroom for the past year or so !
These rain gutter book shelves also make it easy for little ones to put the books back away properly and that makes mommy happy !
Rain gutter shelves wo n’t hold a ton of books , not nearly as many as the same space used for traditional shelving .
However , they certainly are prettier and much easier for young children to help themselves without making a mess .
Plus , our children are reading the books that are on the rain gutter shelving more than they ever read them when they were shelved more traditionally in their bedrooms .
I installed rain gutter shelves by each child ’s bed to give our room - sharing children some space to keep their favorite books and stuffed animals .
Since Mark has been so amazingly busy with his job and since I was too impatient to wait until he had some free time , I installed the shelves myself .
They were quick and easy to install .
I did both of the children ’s bedrooms in an afternoon and did the shelves in the hall ( top picture ) in a couple hours .
Here are my perfectionist , not - very familiar - with - power - tools instructions for installing your own rain gutter book shelves .
Items needed :
Vinyl rain gutters –
Our rain gutter shelves are all 5 feet or 2 1 / 2 feet long and the gutters come in 10 foot lengths .
Brackets for the rain gutters – I used either 2 or 3 brackets per 5 feet of shelving depending on how much use I thought the shelf would get .
End caps for the rain gutters .
Be sure to get the appropriate number of right and left end caps .
Wood screws that will fit through the hole in the brackets .
Hack saw
Sand paper
Sharpie marker
Tape measure
Drill
Level
Marking pencil
Stud finder – unless you are good at the whole hammer tap / listening thing
Spackle and paint –
You only need this when you mess up . 🙂
1. Decide the length that you want your shelf to be .
Measure and mark this length on the shelf with the Sharpie .
Since I ’m one of those perfectionist types and not so handy with a hack saw , I measured and marked six different places around the gutter and then connected the dots so that I had a solid line to cut on .
2 . Cut the rain gutter with the hack saw .
I did this part on our stairs .
The carpet held the gutter still and I had space to saw between the steps .
It worked for me !
3 . Sand the cut edges smooth .
Yes , you could probably skip this step since you will be covering the ends with an end cap , but it ’s that perfectionist thing again .
Good thing Mark does most of the projects around our house .
4 . Decide where you want to put the shelves and find and mark the studs .
Find a stud that is close to where you want one end of the shelf to be and that will be within the shelf area .
Mark with your marking pencil .
Now find the studs within the next 5 foot area ( if that is the length of shelf that you are installing ) or just find the stud on the other end of that 5 foot stretch .
( HINT : Typically studs should be every 16 ″ . )
5 . Determine the height that you want the top of the shelf to be and mark that point on one of the studs that will be close to the end of the shelf .
6 . Using the wood screw and the drill , screw a bracket into the point that you just marked .
HINT : If the screw will not drill all the way into the wall and you think that perhaps you hit a nail head ( it is possible ) , well , before you drill another hole a little higher than the first and it still wo n’t go in and certainly before you drill a third hole and still ca n’t get the screw to go into the stud , have your 12 - year old daughter check to make certain that the drill is set to screw things IN rather than to screw things OUT .
Not I would know anything about that , I ’m just thinking that it is excellent that I know how to Spackle and paint ! 🙂
7 . Level the shelf .
Place the gutter onto the bracket that is already screwed into the wall and place another bracket onto the opposite end of the gutter .
Now balance or hold a level on the gutter and adjust until everything is level .
Then mark where you will screw your next hole on the stud that is closest to the other end of your gutter .
8 . Screw the bracket into the stud at the marked height .
Tuh duh !
You should have a shelf on your wall .
Now depending on where you ’ve installed the shelf or how long it is , you may want to put on additional brackets .
If so …
9. Install additional brackets for stability .
This is simply a matter of sliding them onto the gutter and making sure that you hit a stud when you screw them in .
10 . Glue on the end caps .
11 . Repeat steps 1 - 10 for additional shelves .
I found that 12 ″ - 16 ″ from the top rim of one gutter to the top rim of the other was sufficient for even our tallest books , but measure for yourself and see what looks good to you .
I added close up pictures of the brackets and end caps here .

Today , Apple announced the new iPad and humbly claimed that there will be a " gold rush " of native apps for the App Store .
Sure , but what I find more interesting is that Apple also ironically created the most promising open web app platform , which may eventually undermine the App Store itself .
Everything shown in the keynote looked great ( imagine playing World of Goo on the large touch screen ) , but what I 'm most excited about is the open , WebKit - powered browser : Safari .
The iPad is the first mainstream device which combines all of the following factors : reasonably powerful hardware , a ( potentially ) huge user base , a mature WebKit implementation , and constant 3G internet capabilities .
All the dominoes are in place , and I think that the iPad will knock the first one down .
A brief history of web apps on the iPhone
Let 's go back in time two and a half years to when people were lining up to buy the first iPhone .
One of the most contentious topics was Apple 's policy that third - party applications would be sandboxed in Safari due to security concerns .
Many people were dubious about this decision , but we were told that it would be fine .
The era of web apps was upon us and native third - party apps were unnecessary .
Most people scoffed at this , but there were some who agreed with the underlying philosophy that web apps are ultimately the future .
This has long been a mantra among web developers , which I actually agree with for the most part , but sadly , even loading digg.com was often enough to freeze Safari on the iPhone .
Web apps gained a terrible reputation and Apple rapidly launched the native app SDK , along with the App Store as we know it today .
Soon after , the App Store exploded and became a bona fide gold - rush , and we have not really heard much about web apps since .
What is different now ?
However , that was 2.5 years ago .
That is an eternity , both in terms of Moore 's law and in terms of well - managed , active , open - source projects like WebKit .
Keep in mind that WebKit , in addition to having many contributors , is heavily developed by full - time employees of Apple , Google , Nokia , and others -- all with a huge vested interest in its rapid success .
Watching new code land in the project is truly humbling .
Here are a few specific examples of improvements to WebKit since the original iPhone was launched :
JavaScript and WebKit in general are much , much faster now , due to Squirrel Fish Extreme ( now called Nitro ) and many other optimizations .
I am hesitant to put an exact percentage , but I 'd guess that WebKit is now an order of magnitude faster than it was when the iPhone was launched .
I 'm only guessing at exact figures here for the sake of example , but if Webkit is 10 times more efficient than it used to be , and the iPad is 5 times faster than the original iPhone , that means that web apps will run 50 times as fast as they did at the iPhone 's launch .
Multi - touch DOM extensions have been added to WebKit so that a web app can actually respond to gestures , orientation changes , and other events like you would in Cocoa Touch .
WebGL has been added to WebKit so you can use the same OpenGL ES 2.0 API that is available to native apps directly from Safari ( n.b. I doubt this has been enabled in the iPad 's version of Safari yet , but it almost certainly will be soon ! )
WebKit has added a quite a number of UI - centric features , for example hardware accelerated transformations , transitions , and animations , which are inspired by Core Animation in Cocoa .
WebKit has added support for many modules of HTML5 , such as local storage and web sockets , which are critical for desktop quality web applications .
Hardware - accelerated video and audio tags are now present and exposed to JavaScript .
It is also important to note that web applications and the web industry have matured as well .
Since then , many companies have subscribed to the web app philosophy -- including Google Chrome OS , Palm Web OS , 280 North , the ill - fated CrunchPad , Adobe Air , and many others .
I personally believe in it too , having spent the past year working on the UI layer of Overgrowth which is 100 % HTML5 ( here 's an example ) .
No one has quite succeeded yet .
Despite the extraordinary efforts of these other companies and the about - face Apple has made on web apps , I think that Apple is ironically the closest to the holy grail of the native - quality web app platform .
What can native apps still do better ?
WebKit has improved dramatically , and I believe that most apps ( including virtually all of the non- game apps demoed today during the keynote ) could be achieved using HTML5 and other open standards .
Maybe a better question is what advantages do native applications still have over web apps ?
Access to some lower level APIs
While Apple has exposed some , like multi - touch events and orientation , there is some important functionality that remains to be exposed .
For example , there is no way to authorize a web - app to access your camera , microphone , photo library , emails , contact list , and other data that a native app could access .
HTML5 and WebKit are powerful enough to handle any of this , including a video feed from the camera -- there is no technical reason for this omission .
Performance - critical apps .
Despite the dramatic improvements in JavaScript , compiled code is still much , much faster .
Keep in mind that this is not really relevant to most apps .
It is easy to say " Objective - C is 30 x faster than JavaScript !
JavaScript is unusable ! " but most apps do not need this kind of performance .
Basically , if an action takes 100 microseconds in JavaScript , it is not necessary to use compiled code to get it down to 10 microseconds , the difference is imperceptible .
So do n't expect to see performance - critical games in Safari anytime soon ( although , a game like Flight Control could easily be achieved using WebKit ) or an app that requires direct access to say , the microphone ( until Apple decides to expose this ) .
What does this mean for the App Store ?
At this point , the question is not really " will native - quality web apps be feasible ? " but rather " when will my favorite app be converted into a web app ? " or in the case of certain apps " when will WebKit add support for [ feature that is not implemented ] ? " so that the second question is applicable .
It is really just a matter of time .
If not now , maybe in the next generation of the iPad when WebKit has become even better and hardware has doubled in speed yet again .
Many apps on the app store can already make the transition .
I think that the iPad will soon be joined by quite a few cheaper competitors running Google Chrome OS or an equivalent WebKit powered app layer .
WebKit will emerge as the layer in common and as technology and hardware improves , more and more apps will migrate from native code to WebKit so that they can reach more devices .
The App Store will have fewer and fewer exclusive titles , and we 'll start hearing about success stories from developers who have bypassed the App Store and sold premium , native - quality web apps .
I do n't really see Apple going back to just being a premium hardware company now that they are in this position to be the broker and gate - keeper for a closed , super - popular platform , but it will be really interesting to see how they handle the emergence of WebKit .
Mr. Ebewo , through his lawyer , declined to comment for this article .
His case took years to reach a hearing because of a state law that requires the city to show evidence that it has given the teacher a chance to improve and instruction on how to do so .
Any missing file could jeopardize a case , lawyers for the department said .
And the hearing will probably go on for months , because of a rule the city agreed to four years ago .
In an effort to impose more order on the process , the city and the union agreed to set up a panel of arbitrators to hear such cases regularly .
There are only so many arbitrators , however , and lawyers can handle only so many cases at once , so the arbitrators hear a case only five days a month .
Howard C. Edelman , who has been an arbitrator on teacher cases for 20 years , said it was hard to judge the success of the city ’s effort “ because these are the hardest cases . ”
He said he preferred hearing cases of misconduct — for example , a teacher accused of corporal punishment — to hearing cases of incompetence .
“ What you have 99 percent of the time is an administrator testifying about something they observed one and a half to three years ago , ” he said .
“ They try to refresh their memory before the hearing , but you get into these arcane issues of were you asking a pivotal question of the students , and what are pivotal questions ? ”
One arbitrator recently stepped down from a case after the department said he had fallen asleep during a hearing .
( The arbitrator said he might have “ dropped off once or twice . ” )
The urge is not uncommon .
Alan R. Viani , another arbitrator , said he had done “ one or two cases , and it made me want to put a bullet through my head . ”
In general , the department considers bringing incompetence cases when teachers have received consecutive unsatisfactory ratings from their principal .
There are currently 190 teachers who have received at least two consecutive unsatisfactory ratings in the past three school years , and 586 more who received such a rating last year .
Fifty - five teachers are currently facing incompetence charges , eight others are in arbitration and one is awaiting a decision from a recently completed arbitration .

The heady pace of economic growth fueled by rapid industrialization coupled with hurried urbanization that take people away from traditional employment in rural areas has contributed to the degradation of natural resources .
But these natural resources are in many ways the foundation of a society and its economy .
Shockingly , political economy in many countries emphasizes discounting the future value of human development , natural resources and ecological processes in exchange for short - term benefits .
Spurred by poverty , population growth , ill - advised policies and simple greed , humanity is at war with the plants and animals that share the planet .
Nature 's biodiversity is being destroyed by agents no other than humans simply out of greed .
Every year fire caused by companies with vile greed for plantation and timber interest continue to destroy huge forest cover from Malaysia to Indonesia to India to even Bangladesh .
Director of Missouri Botanical Garden predicts that if things are allowed to go on like this , during the next three decades man will drive an average of 100 species to extinction every day .
Extinction , believably is part of evolution but the present rate is at least 1000 times the pace that has prevailed since pre- history .
Biologist E. O. Wilson believes that even the mass extinction 65 million years ago that killed off the dinosaurs and countless other species did not significantly affect flowering plants .
But these plant species are disappearing now through greed and population pressure and people , not comets and volcanoes , are the angels of destruction .
Who knows how many plant species like willow , many of them till now unexplored , have been extinct for good ?
Unfortunately , the earth is suffering the decline of the ecosystems -- the nurseries of life forms .
As forests continue to be decimated , the soil has lost its protective cover and lies exposed to the relentless forces of wind and sun .
As reports have been gleaned , nearly every habitat is at risk .
Forests in all parts of the world has fallen to lumbering , development and acid rain .
Marine ecosystems around the world are also threatened by pollution , over - fishing and coastal development .
The last best hope to preserve the bio-diversity remains in the tropics .
Tropical forests cover only seven per cent of the earth 's surface but they house between 50 and 80 per cent of the planet 's species .
Even developed countries can't afford to dismiss the growing concern about this planet earth 's future or so to say their own countries ' environmental woes .
It has been stressed time and again that variety is the spice of life .
Life needs diversity because of the interdependence that link flora and fauna , and because variation within species allows them to adapt to environmental challenges .
But ironically , as the world 's population explodes , other life forms continue to go extinct .
And surely humans are indulging in a risky game .
Many of us are mistakenly prone to believe that we do n't need the great variety of earth 's species to survive .
With the alarm bells ringing , governments in many countries have turned their attention to high profile animals like tiger , elephant and rhino while most people hardly see the point of worrying about insects or plants .
These are also on the verge of extinction .
And extinction is a sort of environmental calamity that is irreversible .
As these low species go extinct , they take away with them survival mechanism of other species .
“
It is as though the nations of the world decided to burn their libraries without bothering to see what is in them , ” said Pennsylvania biologist Daniel Janzen .
Harvard 's Wilson called this profligacy , the “ folly ” that future generations are not likely to forgive .
Humanity has already benefited greatly from the little known species .
Some 25 per cent of the pharmaceuticals in use in the US today contain ingredients originally derived from the plants .
Hidden anonymously in clumps of vegetation , ready to be bulldozed or burned , might be plants with cures for still unconquered diseases like AIDS and cancers .
In addition to creating habitable environment , wild species are the source of products that help sustain our lives .
With the advent of genetic mapping and engineering , nature 's diversity has offered many opportunities to agriculture , especially to biotechnology firms , the potent power to improve crops by transferring genes to wild strains .
The most visible results are drought and salt resistant crops , natural fertilizers and pesticides .
Diversity is the raw material of earth 's wealth , but nature 's true creativity lies in the relationships that that link various creatures .
The coral in a reef or the orchid in a rain forest is a part of the ecosystems that supports as well as offer check and balances integrating life forms into functioning communities .
Given the complex workings of the ecosystems , it is never clear which species , if any , are expendable .
Biologists have identified numerous “ hotspots ” where ecosystems are under attack and surely a large number of unique species face an immediate threat of extinction .
These troubled areas include Madagascar where 90 per cent of the original vegetation has disappeared , the monsoon forests of Himalayan foothills that include Nepal , India and Bangladesh that are being denuded by villagers in search of wood , building materials , and arable land , as well as forests of East Africa , peninsular Malaysia , Indonesia along with the Atlantic coast of Brazil and Mexico .
Because of such plundering of the forest , 976 species , throughout the world are classified as critically endangered .
The animal species facing total extinction are Javan rhinoceros , Philippine eagle , Hawaiian crow , Chinese river dolphin , giant panda , Sumatran rhinoceros , and mountain gorilla .
Researchers grimly point out that our descendants would inherit a biologically impoverished and homogenized world .
Not only would there be many fewer life forms , but also faunas and floras would look much the same over large parts of the world , with disaster species such as fire ants and house mice widely spread .
As it is catalogued now , humanity 's food supply comes from a narrow sliver of bio-diversity .
Throughout the history people have cultivated or gathered 7,000 plant species for food .
Today only 20 species provide 90 per cent of the world 's food and three -- rice , wheat and maize -- more than half .
Natural pharmaceuticals offered by bio-diversity are also under-utilized .
Only a few hundred wild species have served to stock our antibiotics , anticancer agents , pain killers and blood thinners .
The biochemistry of the vast majority , millions of other species are unfathomed reservoir of new and potentially more effective substances .
Looking more closely at nature it would become evident that every species is a masterpiece , exquisitely adapted to the particular environment in which it has survived for millions of years .
But we have to be concerned about the current spasm of extinction , which has been accelerated by the inexorable expansion of agriculture and industry .
Nobody can deny now that the wellbeing of the human race is tied to the wellbeing of many other species which are most important for our own survival .
But dealing with the extinction crisis is no simple matter , since much of the world 's bio -diversity resides in its poorest nations , especially in Asia , Africa and Latin America .
These countries can't think of spending huge sums of money to save some species -- be it elephant or an orchid .
In a nation where a sizeable percentage of the people are living below the poverty line , the question promoting wildlife is something unthinkable .
People in poor countries should not be asked to choose between their own short term survival and long term environmental needs .
Since protecting the environment is such a paramount necessity , the money should come from the international sources .
What is needed now is a paramount global endowment devoted to wildlife protection and forest growth , funded primarily by the industrial nations .

Even at 46 years of age , UFC Hall - of - Famer Randy Couture is planning on fighting more often than nearly anyone else in the UFC .
Fresh off his decimation of Mark Coleman at last weekend 's UFC 109 , Sherdog has word that " The Natural " is in discussions to take on fellow fan favorite Rich Franklin at UFC 115 in Vancouver on June 12th .
The bout would serve as a co-main event alongside the third meeting of Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz .
Randy Couture , fresh off his submission win over fellow hall of famer Mark Coleman may be heading back to the Octagon this June to take on former UFC middleweight champion Rich Franklin , according to a source with knowledge of the discussions .
The fight is in the early planning stages and it is not clear whether either fighter has verbally committed to the bout .
Couture , Franklin , Liddell , and Ortiz all on the same card could bring in some impressive PPV numbers for the UFC .
If this one pans out , the rumored UFC 115 card would now include :
A coroner selling body parts ?
Anything goes in New Orleans , so I would n't be surprised .
This outrageous political spot , backing Dwight McKenna for Orleans Parish coroner , paints 36 - year incumbent Frank Minyard as Dr. Frankenstein , and refers to a 1990s lawsuit that accused Minyard of shipped bones and corneas to transplant centers without permission .
Minyard was dropped from the suit , and his office denies selling body parts .
Since this is politics , it figures McKenna has a rap sheet of his own : a 1992 conviction for tax evasion .
At least he did n't sell body parts .
As far as we know .
Martha Coakley should 've tried this tactic against Scott Brown .
No way was he born with such a pretty face .
He 's a Republican !

Presto ( a partire dall ' ultimo quadrimestre del 2010 ) avremo SSD più capienti e meno costosi : parola di Intel e Micron , grazie agli sforzi comuni nella ricerca delle NAND Flash MLC che le vede unite nella IMFT .
Raggiunti i 25nm , insieme a capacità che supereranno il mezzo TeraByte .
Grazie ad una partnership che prende il nome di IMFT ( Intel - Micron Flash Technologies ) , i due colossi dei chip condividono la produzione proveniente da tale iniziativa : Intel al 49 % , Micron al 51 % .
La IMFT , a partire dalla sua formazione risalente oramai al 2006 , ha cercato di essere sempre competitiva sul mercato , così come fortemente voluto da Intel .
L'Azienda iniziò a produrre NAND a 72 nanometri per poi passare nel 2008 ai 50nm ed infine ai 34nm .
Un esempio di SSD con NAND 50nm è l'Intel X25 - M G1 ( QUI una recensione di InformaticaEasy ) , mentre l'X25 - M G2 così come il nuovissimo RealSSD C300 di Micron ( del quale trovate una rapida preview su InformaticaEasy a QUESTO link ) condividono l'integrazione di memorie NAND Flash a 34 nanometri .
Secondo quanto riportato da AnandTech ed altri website , IMFT ha recentemente annunciato di aver dato il via alla fase di sampling di memorie NAND Flash MLC da 2 bit per cella prodotte utilizzando transistor a 25 nanometri .
L'Azienda ha affermato di essere sei mesi avanti nella ricerca rispetto alla concorrenza già con il processo produttivo a 34nm , dunque il passaggio ai 25 non potrà che accentuare questa disparità .
La produzione in volumi di nuovi SSD a 25nm dovrebbe iniziare verso metà 2010 , mentre le vendite inizieranno a partire dalla fine di quest ' anno .
Secondo Anandtech , la terza generazione di drive Intel X25 - M vedrà la luce il quarto quadrimestre del 2010 ed offrirà capacità di 160GB , 320 GB e 600GB .
Il primo test con i 25nm ha riguardato la realizzazione di una memoria NAND da 8GB ; un singolo die dall ' estensione di 167m m2 .
La " flagship " dei 34nm fu invece un chip da 4GB , il cui die era esteso qualche millimetro quadrato in più .
Con la miniaturizzazione di tale processo produttivo , dunque , è possibile ottenere un raddoppio della capacità a parità di estensione del die di silicio .
I device SSD con NAND IMFT da 25nm supportano lo standard ONFi 2.2 ; altri cambiamenti architetturali con il passaggio ai 25nm riguardano la dimensione delle pagine ( che passa da 4 KB a 8KB ) e dei blocchi ( da 128 pagine a 256 pagine )
IMFT dovrebbe rinnovare nuovamente la produzione verso metà 2011 , ma stavolta potrebbe essere utilizzato un processo differente dalla classica litografia per fabbricare i die di NAND Flash .
Insomma , gli SSD guardano sempre al futuro e vedono davanti a loro un panorama di scoperte infinite .
In ogni caso , dal 2012 i Solid State Drive , tanto amati dall ' high - end user , potrebbero davvero raggiungere prezzi che farebbero completamente crollare il mercato degli hard disk a piatti rotanti .

THE Opposition Leader , Tony Abbott , has dismayed welfare services by telling them that governments cannot stop people from being homeless '' if that 's their choice ' ' and declining to match the Rudd government 's goal to halve homelessness by 2020 .
In comments made at a Catholic social services conference in Melbourne last week , Mr Abbott said that while wanting to boost services for the homeless , one of the difficulties with making commitments over targets was their achievement depended on some things over which governments had no control .
'' There 's got to be emergency accommodation for people or systems to provide emergency accommodation for people who 've got big problems and … we can do all of those things and we must do them better as time goes by , '' he said .
'' But we just can't stop people from being homeless if that 's their choice or if their situation is such that it is just impossible to look after them under certain circumstances so I would rephrase a commitment like that . ''
Mr Abbott was responding to a question by the chief executive of the Sacred Heart Mission , Michael Perusco , who asked whether a Coalition government would continue the Rudd government 's pledge to halve homelessness by 2020 .
Mr Abbott also surprised some of the people in the room with a biblical reference that some felt was inappropriate .
'' You know politicians love to make big heroes of themselves by making these sweeping statements and yet I , who was it who said ' the poor you have with you always ? ' … you know everyone in the Catholic tradition is trying to build a better world but we know this one is never going to be perfect and that does n't stop us , does n't excuse us from trying to do better , but it should caution us against thinking that we are going to achieve heaven on earth .
It just ca n't be done . ''
Previously , the report concluded that two key authors — Jay Bybee , now a federal appellate court judge , and John Yoo , now a law professor — violated their professional obligations as lawyers when they crafted a crucial 2002 memo approving the use of harsh tactics , say two Justice sources who asked for anonymity discussing an internal matter .
But the reviewer , career veteran David Margolis , downgraded that assessment to say they showed " poor judgment , " say the sources ....
The shift is significant : the original finding would have triggered a referral to state bar associations for potential disciplinary action — which , in Bybee ’s case , could have led to an impeachment inquiry .
In an initial assessment by bmaz at Emptywheel , for whom I owe the H/T for the Newsweek article :
Margolis is nearly 70 years old and has a long career at DOJ and is fairly well though of .
Margolis was tasked by Jim Comey to shepherd Pat Fitzgerald ’s Libby investigation .
In short , the man has some bona fides ....
Margolis is , however , also tied to the DOJ and its culture for over forty years , not to mention his service in upper management as Associate Attorney General during the Bush Administration when the overt acts of torture and justification by Margolis ’ contemporaries and friends were committed .
For one such filter to redraw the findings and conclusions of such a critical investigation in order to exculpate his colleagues is unimaginable .
Hence it seems the involvement of Margolis in defanging the OPR report , and thereby assuring that governmental agencies or bar associations will not hold John Yoo , Jay Bybee and other Bush - era attorneys accountable for paving the way for legalistic torture , is perhaps not an incidental fact .
Dubious David
The role of Margolis , and the man himself , deserve a closer look .
It does not take long to see that 40 + year DoJ veteran David Margolis has some skeletons in his closet , and that his track record is not unblemished .
In a July 2000 letter to the New York Review of Books by by E.L. Doctorow , Peter Matthiessen , William Styron , Rose Styron , Kurt Vonnegut , singled out Margolis as " point man " on a DoJ " vendetta " against Cointelpro victim Leonard Peltier .
Three months ago , in March , I had a phone call from a lawyer who has never been involved in the Peltier case but was aware of my longtime concern .
A friend in the Justice Department had just mentioned to him that the FBI was intensifying its anti-Peltier vendetta within the department , with Associate Deputy Attorney General David Margolis as the point man .
More recently , a 2008 Los Angeles Times story indicated that Margolis had changed DoJ policy and decided to withhold summaries of OPR investigations .
The article noted that " the resolution of most matters investigated by the OPR remains closely guarded , even in cases where courts have found evidence of serious prosecutorial misconduct . "
The LA Times continued :
Publishing the summaries " reassures the public that [ the Department of Justice ] takes its self - regulatory responsibilities seriously and puts prosecutors on notice that they face public embarrassment if they are caught engaging in wrongdoing , " said Bruce Green , a former federal prosecutor and a professor at Fordham Law School in New York .
Associate Deputy Atty .
Gen. David Margolis said it was his decision to excuse the OPR from preparing summaries of cases that might be released to the public .
He said the decision reflected a lack of resources , as well as concern about balancing public interests with the privacy rights of individual attorneys facing accusations .
A 1999 story involves then Assistant Attorney General Eric Holder and Margolis acting together to spike a serious investigation into the 1993 Waco disaster , and in particular after it was discovered the FBI and DoJ had lied for years about using military incendiary devices at the Branch Davidian siege .
Holder was overseeing an investigation led by Republican Senator John Danforth into the Waco Branch Davidian government siege .
Bill Clinton 's Attorney General Janet Reno had taken the investigation out of the hands of U.S. Attorneys in Texas and given to GOP stalwart Danforth , who later exonerated the FBI of any wrongdoing , and recommended indictment of the only whistleblower in the case , U.S. Attorney William Johnston .
From a 9/15/99 Washington
Post story :
The Justice Department has removed the entire U.S. Attorney ’s Office for the Western District of Texas from further work related to the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian compound near Waco , Tex .
The broad recusal is intended to avoid conflicts that could impede a fresh investigation being led by former senator John C. Danforth ( R - Mo. ) , a senior Justice Department official said yesterday .
Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said U.S. Attorney Bill Blagg , whose office handled the criminal trial of the Branch Davidians in 1994 , requested that his Western District office be recused from further work on Waco .
Holder said that it is routine to approve recusal requests and that David Margolis , the senior department official who handled the details of the matter , told him he had never turned down a recusal request ....
One of the attorneys in Blagg ’s office who is being recused is Assistant U.S. Attorney William Johnston , who recently sent Attorney General Janet Reno a strongly worded letter warning that she had been misled by people within her department about the Waco siege .
Holder said the broad recusal had nothing to do with Johnston ’s letter .
Holder , who is second - in - command at the Justice Department , has been overseeing the Danforth probe since last week , when Reno recused herself from the matter because she too anticipates being a witness in the Danforth inquiry .
I ’d say that Margolis ’s " clean " reputation has been meticulously assembled , and I ’m sorry if there are progressives who fell for it .
Until I investigated further , I had no reason to question it myself .
It goes to show that received wisdom if often not wisdom at all , and that we need to have a curious mind when it comes to acceptance of good intentions by this particular government ( or maybe any government ) .
Margolis Covers - up Earlier Interrogation Scandal ?
More speculatively , and intriguing , given the claims involved , is Margolis ’s involvement in the investigation of a forgotten FBI sting operation against NASA contractors in the early 1990s .
Operation Lightning Strike was , according to a Washington Post article at the time , a " 20 - month Justice Department sting operation focusing on NASA ’s Johnson Space Center in Houston ... [ resulting ] in criminal fraud and bribery charges against nine men and one contractor . "
Later , in 1996 , a defense committee was formed to support the " NASA - 13 " .
The committee , in a petitionto the U.S. House of Representatives Government Reform and Oversight Committee claimed that the men caught up in the Operation Lightning Strike , some of whom were victims of " ’ frame - ups ’ and torture , to obtain prosecutions . "
David Margolis was mentioned as admitting that an OPR investigation into the case was begun in 1994 to look into " investigative and prosecutive misconduct . "
However , no results from that report were ever made public .
The involvement of Margolis in this case deserves further scrutiny , given it involved serious allegations about coercive interrogations and torture .
A defense committee press release was more specific about the abuses conducted by the FBI :
In a report submitted to Congress today , a team of defense attorneys representing the so - called " NASA - 13 , " requested the US .
House of Representatives Government Reform and Oversight Committee to hold hearings and appoint a Special Prosecutor , not affiliated with the U.S. government , to investigate the " NASA - 13 " cases in the light of scientific research competed by a team of NASA industry experts , defense attorneys and behavioral scientists .
This report furnishes evidence that at least one of the NASA / IG Federal agents who conducted the NASA sting operation in Houston from 1991 to 1994 was in fact a highly qualified military intelligence interrogator , who with the FBI , employed a highly dangerous form of " psycho- technology " known in the behavioral science community as " Coercive Persuasion " or " CP " , a form of mind control .
The phenomenon of " CP " was first observed in the post - traumatic reactions of Korean War military and civilian POWs .
Many of these prisoners had confessed to non-existent crimes and cooperated with the enemy after having been subjected to what was then called " brainwashing . "
Given that these claims are coming from a pre-9/11 era , they can not be said to be derivative of recent news reports and scandals .
I am not convinced about what actually went on in this case , but it is notable that the defense committee procured a letter from well - known psychologist , and former government Margaret Thaler Singer backing the claims of the defendants :
I have reviewed the Lightning Strike Victims Questionnaires and summary provided by the NASA - 13 Defense Committee , and I concur with the committee ’s assessment that there is substantial data in these highly consistent statements to confirm that a program of Coercive Influence was employed in the Interrogations of the Lightning Strike Suspects .
The questionnaires uniformly reveal a systematic application of psychological techniques , in an organized programmatic way , within a constructed and managed environment , which was aimed at the participants sense of self and sense of reality , producing extreme anxiety and emotional distress ....
Such programs can and regularly do produce psychiatric casualties .
Practitioners of these programs attempt to hold the subject at the point of maximum stress , without inducing psychosis .
My experience over the past four decades and in observing over 3,000 cases since participating in the evaluation of released Korean POW ’s , unfortunately reveals that practitioners of these nefarious methods frequently exceed the limits with devastating results .
According to the defense committee , Department of Defense interrogators played key roles in the interrogations of the defendants , as aspect of the case that has also never been explained .
Now this may all be a lot of smoke , but when one adds in the latest role played by Mr. Margolis in spiking the initial results of misconduct on behalf of Yoo , Bybee , Addington , et al . ( if we can believe the Newsweek leak ) , his appearance in this role does not seem so remarkable .
Margolis appears to have a long history of involvement in government frame - up and / or obfuscation of internal misconduct by the FBI or Justice Department prosecutors .
Will we see the intrepid U.S. press look more deeply into this ?
One could wish this were true .
Every once in a while the mainstream press shows what it ’s capable of , as with the exposure of torture at Bagram under Obama ’s administration , or with Scott Horton ’s Harper ’s revelations on the 2003 killings of three Guantanamo prisoners , covered - up as supposed " suicides " .
But the OPR report is shaping up to be one gigantic cover - up , assuming we ever get to see much of it , after the government censors get done with it .
The country is thick with torture and crime , and unable to free itself from thralldom to its governmental enablers .
Let ’s see how easily Holder , Obama , and Margolis get away with their cover -up of Yoo , Bybee , Gonzales , and Addington ’s lies and alibis .
Meanwhile , torture continues as official policy of the Obama administration in the guise of an appendix to the Army Field Manual .
But outside of Emptywheel , some former interrogators , and a few others , no one seems to care .
And so it goes .

This past fall , an Afghan video journalist negotiated extraordinary access to a part of the country that has quietly reverted back to Taliban control .
For close to two weeks , the journalist traveled a region that he found was now largely under control of the Taliban “ shadow ” government .
He also tracked members of an insurgent cell working with members of Al Qaeda on a mission to sabotage a major U.S. / NATO supply route .
As the new U.S. strategy focuses on the south and eastern parts of the country , this film opens up a window onto a potential new front in the north , and sheds an important light on who ’s fighting the U.S. efforts in Afghanistan and why .

Sega has revealed in the latest edition of Famitsu 360 that they would be willing to resurrect the Shenmue franchise if console manufacturers paid them for an exclusive deal .
Although Shenmue received it ’s fair share of critical acclaim , it was not a big seller and considering it was one of the most expensive ( $ 70 m ) games back in the days , Sega is reluctant to take the plunge alone .
With exclusive titles being hyped up and well marketed by both Sony and Microsoft it seems Sega is also looking for something extra apart from the investment .
Whether Microsoft or Sony take a punt on this one with the Shenmue franchise being as good as dead for the last seven years , depends on the fact that will Shenmue help move systems .
Shenmue is an adventure game developed by Sega AM2 and published by Sega for the Dreamcast in 1999 .
Shenmue II was released in 2001 for the Dreamcast and 2002 for the Xbox .
We ’ll keep you posted on any further development so check back later .
Used humorously as a random parameter on which something is said to depend .
Sometimes implies unreliability of whatever is dependent , or that reliability seems to be dependent on conditions nobody has been able to determine .
“ This feature depends on having the channel open in mumble mode , having the foo switch set , and on the phase of the moon . ”
See also heisenbug .
True story :
Once upon a time there was a program bug that really did depend on the phase of the moon .
There was a little subroutine that had traditionally been used in various programs at MIT to calculate an approximation to the moon 's true phase .
GLS incorporated this routine into a LISP program that , when it wrote out a file , would print a timestamp line almost 80 characters long .
Very occasionally the first line of the message would be too long and would overflow onto the next line , and when the file was later read back in the program would barf .
The length of the first line depended on both the precise date and time and the length of the phase specification when the timestamp was printed , and so the bug literally depended on the phase of the moon !
The first paper edition of the Jargon File ( Steele - 1983 ) included an example of one of the timestamp lines that exhibited this bug , but the typesetter ‘ corrected ’ it .
This has since been described as the phase - of - the - moon - bug bug .
However , beware of assumptions .
A few years ago , engineers of CERN ( European Center for Nuclear Research ) were baffled by some errors in experiments conducted with the LEP particle accelerator .
As the formidable amount of data generated by such devices is heavily processed by computers before being seen by humans , many people suggested the software was somehow sensitive to the phase of the moon .
A few desperate engineers discovered the truth ; the error turned out to be the result of a tiny change in the geometry of the 27 km circumference ring , physically caused by the deformation of the Earth by the passage of the Moon !
This story has entered physics folklore as a Newtonian vengeance on particle physics and as an example of the relevance of the simplest and oldest physical laws to the most modern science .
Growing Complexity
Bureaucratic Shenanigans
The Vultures Are Circling
Usually in the STRATFOR Global Security and Intelligence Report , we focus on the tactical details of terrorism and security issues in an effort to explain those issues and place them in perspective for our readers .
Occasionally , though , we turn our focus away from the tactical realm in order to examine the bureaucratic processes that shape the way things run in the counterterrorism , counterintelligence and security arena .
This look into the struggle by the U.S. government to ensure visa security is one of those analyses .
As STRATFOR has noted for many years now , document - fraud investigations are a very useful weapon in the counterterrorism arsenal .
Foreigners who wish to travel to the United States to conduct a terrorist attack must either have a valid passport from their country of citizenship and a valid U.S. visa , or just a valid passport from their home country if they are a citizen of a country that does not require a visa for short - term trips ( called visa - waiver countries ) .
In some early jihadist attacks against the United States , such as the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , the operatives dispatched to conduct the attacks made very clumsy attempts at document fraud .
In that case , the two operational commanders dispatched from Afghanistan to conduct the attack arrived at New York 's Kennedy Airport after having used photo - substituted passports ( passports where the photographs are literally switched ) of militants from visa - waiver countries who died while fighting in Afghanistan .
Ahmed Ajaj ( a Palestinian ) used a Swedish passport in the name of Khurram Khan , and Abdul Basit ( a Pakistani also known as Ramzi Yousef ) used a British passport in the name of Mohamed Azan .
Ajaj attempted to enter through U.S. Immigration at Kennedy Airport using the obviously photo - substituted passport and was arrested on the spot .
Basit used the altered British passport to board the aircraft in Karachi , Pakistan , but upon arrival in New York he used a fraudulently obtained but genuine Iraqi passport in the name of Ramzi Yousef to claim political asylum and was released pending his asylum hearing .
But the jihadist planners learned from amateurish cases like Ajaj's and that of Ghazi Ibrahim Abu Mezer , a Palestinian who attempted to conduct a suicide attack against the New York subway system .
U.S. immigration officials arrested him on three occasions in the Pacific Northwest as he attempted to cross into the United States illegally from Canada .
By the Millennium Bomb Plot in late 1999 , Ahmed Ressam , an Algerian who initially entered Canada using a photo - substituted French passport , had obtained a genuine Canadian passport using a fraudulent baptismal certificate .
He then used that genuine passport to attempt to enter the United States in order to bomb Los Angeles International Airport .
Ressam was caught not because of his documentation but because of his demeanor — and an alert customs inspector prevented him from entering the country .
So by the time the 9/11 attacks occurred , we were seeing groups like al Qaeda preferring to use genuine travel documents rather than altered or counterfeit documents .
Indeed , some operatives , such as Ramzi bin al - Shibh , a Yemeni , were unable to obtain U.S. visas and were therefore not permitted to participate in the 9/11 plot .
Instead , bin al - Shibh took on a support role , serving as the communications cutout between al Qaeda 's operational planner , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , and al Qaeda 's tactical commander for the operation , Mohamed Atta .
It is important to note , however , that the 19 9/11 operatives had obtained a large assortment of driver 's licenses and state identification cards , many of them fraudulent .
Such documents are far easier to obtain than passports .
After the Sept. 11 attacks and the 9/11 Commission report , which shed a great deal of light on the terrorist use of document fraud , the U.S. government increased the attention devoted to immigration fraud and the use of fraudulent travel documents by terrorist suspects .
This emphasis on detecting document fraud , along with the widespread adoption of more difficult to counterfeit passports and visas ( no document is impossible to counterfeit ) , has influenced jihadists , who have continued their shift away from the use of fraudulent documents ( especially poor quality documents ) .
Indeed , in many post - 9/11 attacks directed against the United States we have seen jihadist groups use U.S. citizens ( Jose Padilla and Najibullah Zazi ) , citizens of visa - waiver countries ( Richard Reid and Abdulla Ahmed Ali ) , and other operatives who possess or can obtain valid U.S. visas such as Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab .
These operatives are , for the most part , using authentic documents issued in their true identities .
Concerns expressed by the 9/11 Commission over the vulnerability created by the visa - waiver program also prompted the U.S. government to establish the Electronic System for Travel Authorization ( ESTA ) , which is a mandatory program that prescreens visa - waiver travelers , including those transiting through the United States .
The ESTA , which became functional in January 2009 , requires travelers from visa - waiver countries to apply for travel authorization at least 72 hours prior to travel .
This time period permits the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) to conduct background checks on pending travelers .
Counterfeit visas are not as large a problem as they were 20 years ago .
Advances in technology have made it very difficult for all but the most high - end document vendors to counterfeit them , and it is often cheaper and easier to obtain an authentic visa by malfeasance — bribing a consular officer — than it is to acquire a machine - readable counterfeit visa that will work .
Obtaining a genuine U.S. passport or one from a visa - waiver country by using fraudulent breeder documents ( driver 's licenses and birth certificates , as Ahmed Ressam did ) is also cheaper and easier .
But in the case of non-visa waiver countries , this shift to the use of genuine identities and identity documents now highlights the need to secure the visa issuance process from fraud and malfeasance .
This shift to genuine - identity documents also means that most visa fraud cases involving potential terrorist operatives are going to be very complex .
Rather than relying on obvious flags like false identities , the visa team consisting of clerks , consular officers , visa - fraud coordinators and Diplomatic Security Service ( DSS ) special agents needs to examine carefully not just the applicant 's identity but also his or her story in an attempt to determine if it is legitimate , and if there are any subtle indicators that the applicant has ties to radical groups ( like people who lose their passports to disguise travel to places like Pakistan and Yemen ) .
As in many other security programs , however , demeanor is also critically important , and a good investigator can often spot signs of deception during a visa interview ( if one is conducted ) .
If the applicant 's documents and story check out , and there are no indicators of radical connections , it is very difficult to determine that an applicant is up to no good unless the U.S. government possesses some sort of intelligence indicating that the person may be involved in such activity .
In terms of intelligence , there are a number of different databases , such as the Consular Lookout and Support System ( CLASS ) , the main State Department database and the terrorism - specific Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment ( TIDE ) system .
The databases are checked in order to determine if there is any derogatory information that would preclude a suspect from receiving a visa .
These databases allow a number of U.S. government agencies to provide input — CLASS is tied into the Interagency Border Inspection System ( IBIS ) — and they allow these other agencies to have a stake in the visa issuance process .
( It must be noted that , like any database , foreign language issues — such as the many ways to transliterate the name Mohammed into English — can often complicate the accuracy of visa lookout database entries and checks . )
Today the lookout databases are a far cry from what they were even 15 years ago , when many of the lists were contained on microfiche and checking them was laborious .
During the microfiche era , mistakes were easily made , and some officers skipped the step of running the time - consuming name checks on people who did not appear to be potential terrorists .
This is what happened in the case of a poor old blind imam who showed up at the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum in 1990 — and who turned out to be terrorist leader Sheikh Omar Ali Ahmed Abdul - Rahman .
As an aside , although Rahman , known as the Blind Sheikh , did receive a U.S. visa , DSS special agents who investigated his case were able to document that he made material false statements on his visa application ( such as claiming he had never been arrested ) and were therefore able to build a visa fraud case against the Sheikh .
The case never proceeded to trial , since the Sheikh was convicted on seditious conspiracy charges and sentenced to life in prison .
The U.S. government 's visa fraud investigation specialists are the special agents assigned to the U.S. Department of State 's DSS .
In much the same way that U.S. Secret Service special agents work to ensure the integrity of the U.S. currency system through investigations of counterfeiting , DSS agents work to ensure the inviolability of U.S. passports and visas by investigating passport and visa fraud .
The DSS has long assigned special agents to high fraud - threat countries like Nigeria to investigate passport and visa fraud in conjunction with the post 's consular affairs officers .
In the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 , Congress ordered the State Department to establish a visa and passport security program .
In response to this legislation , a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Bureau of Consular Affairs and the DSS to establish the Overseas Criminal Investigations Branch ( OCI ) .
The purpose of the OCI was to conduct investigations related to illegal passport and visa issuances or use and other investigations at U.S. embassies overseas .
A special agent assigned to these duties at an overseas post is referred to as an investigative Assistant Regional Security Officer ( or ARSO - I ) .
While the OCI and the ARSO - I program seemed promising at first , circumstance and bureaucratic hurdles have prevented the program from running to the best of its ability and meeting the expectations of the U.S. Congress .
As we 've previously noted , there is a powerful element within the State Department that is averse to security and does its best to thwart security programs .
DSS special agents refer to these people as Black Dragons .
Even when Congress provides clear guidance to the State Department regarding issues of security ( e.g. , the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 ) , the Black Dragons do their best to strangle the programs , and this constant struggle produces discernable boom - and - bust cycles , as Congress provides money for new security programs and the Black Dragons , who consider security counterproductive for diplomacy and armed State Department special agents undiplomatic , use their bureaucratic power to cut off those programs .
Compounding this perennial battle over security funding has been the incredible increase in protective responsibilities that the DSS has had to shoulder since 9/11 .
The bureau has had to provide a large number of agents to protect U.S. diplomats in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan and even staffed and supervised the protective detail for Afghan President Hamid Karzai for a few years .
Two DSS special agents were also killed while protecting the huge number of U.S diplomats assigned to reconstruction efforts in Iraq .
One agent was killed in a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and the other by a suicide car - bomb attack in Mosul .
The demands of protection and bureaucratic strangulation by the Black Dragons , who have not embraced the concept of the ARSO - I program , has resulted in the OCI program being deployed very slowly .
This means that of the 200 positions envisioned and internally programmed by Bureau of Consular Affairs and DSS in 2004 , only 50 ARSO - I agents have been assigned to posts abroad as of this writing , and a total of 123 ARSO - I agents are supposed to be deployed by the end of 2011 .
The other 77 ARSO - I positions were taken away from the OCI program by the department and used to provide more secretarial positions .
In the wake of State Department heel - dragging , other agencies are now seeking to fill the void .
In a Feb. 9 , 2010 , editorial on GovernmentExecutive.com , former DHS Under Secretary for Border and Transportation Security Asa Hutchinson made a pitch for the DHS to become more involved in the visa - security process overseas , and he is pushing for funding more DHS positions at U.S. embassies abroad .
To support his case that more DHS officers are needed for visa security , Hutchinson used the case of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as an example of why DHS needed a larger presence overseas .
Unfortunately , the Abdulmutallab case had nothing to do with visa fraud , and the presence of a DHS officer at post would certainly not have prevented him from receiving his initial visa .
Abdulmutallab was first issued a U.S. visa in 2004 , before he was radicalized during his university studies in the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2008 , and he qualified for that visa according to the guidelines established by the U.S. government without fraud or deception .
Of course , the fact that he came from a prominent Nigerian family certainly helped .
The problem in the Abdulmutallab case was not in the issuance of his visa in 2004 .
His identity and story checked out .
There was no negative information about him in the databases checked for visa applicants .
He also traveled to the United States in 2004 and left the country without overstaying his visa , and was not yet listed in any of the lookout databases , so his visa renewal in June 2008 in London was also not surprising .
The real problem in the Abdulmutallab case began when the CIA handled the interview of Abdulmutallab 's father when he walked into the embassy in November 2009 to report that his son had become radicalized and that he feared his son was preparing for a suicide mission .
The CIA did not share the information gleaned from that interview in a terrorism report cable ( TERREP ) , or with the regional security officer at post or the ARSO - I .
( The fact that the CIA , FBI and other agencies have assumed control over the walk - in program in recent years is also a serious problem , but that is a matter to be addressed separately . )
Due to that lack of information - sharing , Abdulmutallab 's visa was not canceled as it could have and should have been .
His name was also not added to the U.S. government 's no -fly list .
Again , had there been a DHS officer assigned to the embassy , he would not have been able to do any more than the ARSO - I already assigned to post , since he also would not have received the information from the CIA that would have indicated that Abdulmutallab 's visa needed to be revoked .
Once again , information was not shared in a counterterrorism case — a recurring theme in recent years .
And once again the lack of information would have proved deadly had Abdulmutallab 's device not malfunctioned .
Unfortunately , information - sharing is never facilitated by the addition of layers of bureaucracy .
This is the reason why the addition of the huge new bureaucracy called the Office of the Director of National Intelligence has not solved the issue of information - sharing among intelligence agencies .
Hutchinson is correct when he notes that the DHS must go back to basics , but DHS has numerous other domestic programs that it must master the basics of — things like securing the border , overseeing port and cargo security , interior immigration and customs enforcement and ensuring airline security — before it should even consider expanding its presence overseas .
Adding another layer of DHS involvement in overseeing visa issuance and investigating visa fraud at diplomatic posts abroad is simply not going to assist in the flow of information in visa cases , whether criminal or terrorist in nature .
Having another U.S. law enforcement agency interfacing with the host country police and security agencies regarding visa matters will also serve to cause confusion and hamper efficient information flow .
The problem illustrated by the Abdulmutallab case is not that the U.S. government lacks enough agencies operating in overseas posts ; the problem is that the myriad agencies already there simply need to return to doing basic things like talking to each other .
Getting the ARSO - I program funded and back on track is a basic step necessary to help in securing the visa process , but even that will not be totally effective unless the agencies at post do a better job of basic tasks like coordination and communication .

This story is almost too hard to believe , but it is indeed true : A pregnant woman in Iowa was jailed for " attempted feticide " because she told hospital staff she once thought about having an abortion .
Apparently , in Iowa it can be regarded as a crime ― in this case attempted feticide ― if a pregnant woman gets unwell and falls down the stairs .
In any case , it may be regarded as a possible crime if this happens a few months after she considered having an abortion .
The simple fact of this weird tale are as follows :
In the beginning of her pregnancy , the woman considered abortion but decided against it .
After a meeting with her estranged husband , she became unwell and fell down the stairs .
Medics in the hospital told her the child she was carrying was fine .
She was elated to hear this .
After the fall , however , she mentioned she had previously thought of terminating the pregnancy .
Soon after , she found herself in jail because someone interpreted her falling as an attempt to " intentionally terminate a human pregnancy , " an act which is the legal definition of feticide .
This shocking tale can be found in the women 's rights section of the website belonging to the organization change.org .
The story was also carried by Nerve and pointed to by Harper 's Magazine on Feb.

But the opening of the latest batch of Britain 's own " X - files " today reveals that the RAF in March 1997 did mount an inquiry into reports from six members of the public , including two firefighters , of a large , triangular " humming " object in the sky above his Folkestone home during his last months as home secretary .
The Ministry of Defence file reports that witnesses said the UFO hovered for several minutes above a field before shooting off in a flash of light .
Sophie Wadleigh , 25 , from Hythe , told the Folkestone Herald : " It was so peculiar , it all felt really odd and I heard this humming noise .
As I looked across the field I saw a large triangular shaped flying craft hovering about 300 feet off the ground . "
The MoD file includes a report from Chris Rolfe , of the East Kent UFO monitoring group , which says he believes it could have been looking for the former home secretary , as it was not interested in Wadleigh : " This … has left me wondering if its purpose had something to do with Mr Howard . "
Other witnesses described it as being a lot bigger than a plane , with lights around the outside and a disc on the back .
The official inquiry into the sighting on 8 March 1997 concluded : " MoD air defence staff have confirmed that there is no evidence to suggest any unauthorised incursion of the UK air defence region on that date . "
It added that " additional inquiries had confirmed that no unusual or unauthorised air activity , civil or military , was reported or observed in that area on that date " .
The incident is one of thousands of reports of what are officially known as " unexplained aerial sightings " in the latest batch of MoD files released today at the National Archives in Kew .
The 24 files contain more than 6,000 pages of documentation covering 1994 to 2000 .
The government remains officially " open minded " on whether there are aliens among us .
The MoD says : " We are often misquoted as saying we do not believe ' UFO / flying saucers ' to be a threat ; this is a distortion of the MoD 's stated position which is that to date we have seen nothing which could be classed as proof that extraterrestial life exists . "
OTTAWA–Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's office went after one of Bay Street 's top figures – TD Bank CEO Ed Clark – for saying senior Canadian executives favour higher taxes to slay Ottawa 's deficit .
It all started when Clark said at a a conference in Florida last week how much Canadians despise the budget deficit .
Although Canadians are " fiscally unbelievably conservative , " Clark said , the government went into a " big deficit position " to stimulate the economy .
" The Canadian population is extremely unhappy to see these deficits , " he added .
A member of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives , Clark recounted a recent meeting of the high - powered , 150 - company group .
" We had a meeting two weeks ago , and almost every single person said raise my taxes .
Get this deficit done , " Clark said during a question - and - answer session at the TD Ameritrade Inc. conference .
He spoke about a prebudget consultation he recently had with Harper .
" He does n't listen , but you get to chat with him , " the TD Bank chief executive remarked .
The comments did not go unnoticed in Harper 's office .
A day later , an email labelling Clark a rich supporter of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff went out from the PMO to senior Conservatives .
Entitled " Millionaire Ignatieff Economic Czar Calls for Higher Taxes , " the email pointed out that Clark had been one of several financial experts who attended a dinner last spring to provide economic advice to Ignatieff .
" Yesterday , another member of Liberal party leader Michael Ignatieff 's so - called `economic brain trust , ' Bay Street banker Ed Clark , lectured Canadians from sunny Florida on our need to pay higher taxes , " the PMO note said .
It went on to say that Ignatieff will use statements from " his well - heeled economic advisers " to justify massive tax hikes for " working - and middle - class Canadians . "
The email ended :
It 's been reported " that Michael Ignatieff 's Bay Street buddy Ed Clark earned $ 11 million in 2009 .
He can afford higher taxes .
Can you ? "
Sources said TD Bank was aware of the PMO email about Clark , but TD spokesman Mohammed Nakhooda declined to discuss it .
PMO spokesman Dimitri Soudas said : " This government will not entertain raising taxes on hard - working Canadians or cutting transfers to provinces . "
John Manley , the former Liberal MP who now heads the Canadian Council of Chief Executives , said last week that the Harper government needs to have a " realistic conversation " with Canadians about balancing Ottawa 's books , including the option of higher taxes .
But the council has not taken a position on how the Conservatives should address the deficit .
The email to senior Conservatives about Clark was one of a series fired out of the Langevin Block , home of the PMO , on the subject of the deficit and possible tax hikes .
In a note earlier last week , the PMO cited remarks by former finance department official Scott Clark as proof that Ignatieff plans to raise taxes .
Clark , who has occasionally given advice to Ignatieff , prompted the response from the PMO by saying that the Conservatives will have to slash programs or raise taxes to trim the deficit .
" Today at an economic forum , Scott Clark , a member of Michael Ignatieff 's so - called " economic brain trust , " called for tax hikes .
This is not the first time this Ignatieff adviser has argued for higher taxes , " the email said , citing a newspaper op - ed article .
Fear of reprisals from the Harper government has made some people reluctant to take part in Liberal hearings on Parliament Hill these past few weeks , Ignatieff said Wednesday .
" I 'll be frank with you .
We 've had a little of that , " Ignatieff said , without providing details on who backed out of the events .

The Liberal leader hinted , however , that some people were afraid of possible damage to their business or livelihood .
" Let 's be clear .
Most of the people we asked were only too happy to come .
" But I will not deny that there were a few who were concerned .
I think it 's regrettable .
I think everybody should come to the House of Parliament , give their testimony and go home , secure in the knowledge that whatever business they have with the government of Canada is unaffected . "

Typical steroids user is well - educated and thirty plus , says study Governments are taking a harder line against the use of anabolic steroids – for reasons that do n't hold water , say American researchers in a study published a couple of years ago .
Steroids users are not young adolescents , but adults who have made well - considered decisions , according to the Americans .
Steroids users are not top athletes out to cheat , but non -pros who train in gyms .
The researchers – among whom were lawyer Rick Collins [ handsome guy on the right ] and psychologist Jack Darkes – did four months of internet research .
They approached bodybuilders through body building message boards , and asked if they were prepared to complete an extensive questionnaire .
This way they collected data from 2700 men and women in 80 countries .
The ' average ' steroids user turned out to be completely different from the stereotype the lawmakers have in mind .
The average age steroids user is aged 31 .
Ninety percent of the respondents were white , half were unmarried and 64 percent had no children .
Most were more highly educated than the average American , and 77 percent were self employed .
Of those who replied , 98 percent had work , far higher than the average employment rate in the US .
The most popular substances were testosterone , methandienone and nandrolone .
Other frequently used substances were hCG , tamoxifen , clomiphene and anastrozole .
The doses were higher than those prescribed by doctors , but not as high as you 'd expect .
In Europe a course of testosterone usually consists of one gram a week , but the respondents said that they used lower doses .
The same was true for methandienone .
Most bodybuilders followed the recommendations made in underground manuals .
The question that springs to mind is how typical the users are that the Americans interviewed .
But the researchers admit this too : " No data is available to compare participants to non medical anabolic steroids users without Internet access , those unaware of the survey , or those who chose not to participate . "

BEIRUT — Iranian authorities deployed in force across Tehran Wednesday to conduct last - minute security sweeps and warn residents to refrain from joining antigovernment protests planned for Thursday .
The government typically orchestrates large , carnival - like rallies and demonstrations to mark the anniversary of the Islamic Republic .
For this year 's events on Feb. 11 , the day marking the culmination of the annual celebrations , opposition leaders have called for protesters to demonstrate against the regime .
That has set the stage ...
Women should be allowed to eat and drink what they want during labour , say Cochrane Researchers .
The researchers carried out a systematic review of studies examining the traditional practice of restricting food and fluid intake during labour and found no evidence for any risk or benefit for women at low risk of complications .
Throughout much of the last century , eating and drinking during labour was considered dangerous and many maternity units operated " nil by mouth " policies or restricted what women in labour were allowed to eat and drink , regardless of women 's preferences .
This was largely due to concerns about possibly fatal damage to the lungs caused by " Mendelson 's syndrome , " where particles of regurgitated food are inhaled under general anaesthetic during Caesarean sections .
Recently , however , attitudes have begun to change and in many maternity wards , particularly in the UK , women are now allowed to eat and drink what they want during labour .
The Cochrane Systematic Review , which included five studies and a total of 3130 women , looked at the evidence for restricting food and drink in women who were considered unlikely to need anaesthesia .
They found no evidence of any risk or benefit associated with eating or drinking , whether in studies comparing eating and drinking at will or just water with complete restriction , or in studies comparing specific foods , fluids , or carbohydrate drinks with water .
" Since the evidence shows no benefits or harms , there is no justification for nil by mouth policies during labour , provided women are at low risk of complications , " said lead researcher Mandisa Singata , who is based at the East London Hospital Complex in East London , South Africa .
" Women should be able to make their own decisions about whether they want to eat or drink during labour , or not . "
The researchers did not find any studies that assessed the risks of eating and drinking for women with a higher risk of needing anaesthesia .
Therefore , further research is need before specific recommendations can be made for this group .
However , Singata concludes that there may be better ways to approach studies of eating and drinking during labour .
" While it is important to try to prevent Mendelson 's syndrome , it is very rare and not the best way to assess whether eating and drinking during labour is beneficial for the majority of patients .
It might be better to look at ways of preventing regurgitation during anaesthesia for those patients who do require it , " she said .
Work on this review was supported by a grant from the National Institute for Health Research ( NIHR ) , UK .
Phil Jones was granted an average of $ 120,000 USD per month for 15 years .

this is simply to say tha I will get my paper to you as soon as I can .
Frank knows that I am currently involved with writing a bid on behalf of the earth science community to try to extract 8 million pounds for a 5 year project from NERC to support Palaeo / Modelling validatin work .
I was not allowed to say no to this request and it is involving me in a lot of meetings and associated crap .
I am now redrafting the proposal .
Also I must write my application to NERC for a fellowship – if this fails Sarah and I are unemployed after December as things stand .
God knows there is little chance of success but the application must be in be the end of September and I have not started it yet .
This is a big deal for me and I am putting you down as my primary suggested scientific referee .
The PAGES paper can only be done in mid October and I really need your and Frank ’s understanding on this .
I had to do the Thematic bid proposal as Nick Shackleton asked me to , and I want to put him down as my primary Personal reference !
In early October I have to attend a NERC Earth Science Board meeting to defend the Thematic bid ; a meeting of PEP3 in Belgium ; a UK CLIVAR meeting in London ; an EC meeting to present our ADVANCE - 10 K results in Vienna .
This is not bullshit .
I will do the PAGES meetin paper as fast as I can and you must please allow me the leeway .
Sorry – but this will not really hold the publication up .
If I could sort out some funding I could afford to drop some of these things but with the EC future also up in the air at the moment , I have to try to juggle these things .

This email discussing his possible ‘ unemployment ’ for the Hider of the decline ( it was keith Briffa ’s data with Phil Jones help using the trick to hide the decline ) .
Leads to a second interesting point , first noticed by Lubos Motl .
The spreadsheet linked shows Dr. Phillip Climategate Jones did n’t earn the vast majority of his 22 million in grants until after this email .
Line 10 in the linked Lubos sheet shows Phil Jones only earned a paultry 104,230 pounds from NERC .
or $ 167,000 dollars at a 1.6 conversion which is applicable in 1998 dollars .
Anyone here mind receiving $ 167,000 ?
IT WAS NOTHING !!
What happened since then ?
You can see that even the great Phil was going to be fired for raising a mere , 2.5 milion USD in the six years prior to 1998 .
Imagine what your job would be like if you were forced to raise four times your salary in raw after tax profit , just to keep your gojob .
Dr. Phil had no qualms about it and was eventually successful .
We should have no doubt that a non-leftist , non-advocate person would fail miserably in the same position .
Phil Jones grants averaged 122,000 US dollars per month between 1991 and 2006
BIG OIL , MY ASS !
OTTAWA — Almost all the remaining MPs from the old Reform Party — including Stephen Harper — stand to collect over $ 100,000 a year in pension benefits once they retire .
Back in 1993 , a group of 52 Reformers took Ottawa by storm , capturing the public attention with their stand against so - called gold - plated pensions for Members of Parliament .
At the time , they said they would refuse to collect their pensions as a way of leading by example and fighting the deficit .
But since then , according to tracking by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation , most of them have quietly opted back in , including the 11 who are still in the House of Commons ,
Now , as the public service suspects Ottawa is about to target the pension packages of government workers as a way to tackle the latest deficit , MPs ’ own pensions are under scrutiny again .
Numbers crunched by the Taxpayers Federation lobby group show that Prime Minister Harper is in line to collect $ 150,244 a year if he were to retire at the end of this year , while Indian Affairs Minister Chuck Strahl could collect more than $ 155,000 .
THE LIST
Just 11 of the 52 Reform Party MPs elected in 1993 remain in the House of Commons , most of them now Conservative .
The Canadian Taxpayers Federation has calculated what their annual pension benefits would be if they retired at the end of 2010 .
The numbers are approximate , since details on each MP are not made public .

The iPad Big Picture
There was a meta - message in today ’s Apple event , not about the iPad in particular , but rather about Apple as a whole .
Jobs ’s brief preamble included a bit of extra emphasis on the fact that the Apple now generates over $ 50 billion per year in revenue .
( Apple also emphasized this $ 50 billion revenue thing in their PR two days ago announcing their Q1 2010 financial results . )
He also said that when you consider MacBooks as “ mobile ” devices , Apple generates more revenue from mobile hardware than any other company in the world ; the three competitors he singled out were Sony , Samsung , and Nokia .
The adjective he used was “ bigger ” .
Lastly , there ’s the fact that the iPad is using a new CPU designed and made by Apple itself : the Apple A4 .
This is a huge deal .
I got about 20 blessed minutes of time using the iPad demo units Apple had at the event today , and if I had to sum up the device with one word , that word would be “ fast ” .
It is fast , fast , fast .
The hardware really does feel like a big iPhone — and a big original iPhone at that , with the aluminum back .
( I have never liked the plastic 3G / S iPhones as much as the original in terms of how it feels in my hand . )
I expected the screen size to be the biggest differentiating factor in how the iPad feels compared to an iPhone , but I think the speed difference is just as big a factor .
Web pages render so fast it was hard to believe .
After using the iPhone so much for two and a half years , I ’ve become accustomed to web pages rendering ( relative to the Mac ) slowly .
On the iPad , they seem to render nearly instantly .
( 802.11 n Wi-Fi helps too . )
The Maps app is crazy fast .
Apps launch fast .
Scrolling is fast .
The Photos app is fast .
The iPad hardware is exactly what you think .
It looks great , it feels great .
It ’s very nice to hold .
( People are complaining about the wide bezel around the display , but without that , where would your thumbs go ?
You do n’t want your thumb that ’s holding the device to cover on - screen content or register as a touch .
Trust me , it ’s just right . )
Just like with the iPhone , it ’s all in the software .
And the software is obviously marvelous in many ways .
It is clearly the result of deep thought and hard work .
But : everyone I spoke to in the press room was raving first and foremost about the speed .
None of us could shut up about it .
It feels impossibly fast .
( And our next thought :
What happens if Apple has figured out a way to make a CPU like A4 that fits in an iPhone ?
If they pull that off for this year ’s new iPhone , look out . )
Apple does n’t talk much about the technical details of the iPhone .
They never talk about CPU speed or the name of the chip being used .
They do n’t tell you how much RAM is in there .
Part of their vision for moving computers from technical culture to popular culture is about getting away from defining these things by their technical specs .
So the prominent talk about A4 is telling .
This is something they want us to notice .
I mentioned this year - ago quote from Apple COO Tim Cook the other day , but it ’s apt here , too .
Cook told BusinessWeek , “ We believe in the simple , not the complex .
We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products we make , and participate only in markets where we can make a significant contribution . ”
Apple now owns and controls their own mobile CPUs .
There are n’t many companies in the world that can say that .
And from what I saw today , Apple does n’t just own and control a mobile CPU , they own and control the hands - down best mobile CPU in the world .
Software aside ( which is a huge thing to put aside ) , it may well be that no other company could make a device today matching the price , size , and performance of the iPad .
They ’re not getting into the CPU business for kicks , they ’re getting into it to kick ass .
They ’re Microsoft and Intel rolled into one when it comes to mobile computing .
In the pre-taped video Apple showed , Bob Mansfield said of the iPad , “ No one else could do it . ” Only Apple .
And so my takeaway from this — with the bragging about making their own CPUs and their annual revenue and their size compared to companies like Sony , Samsung , and Nokia — is that this is Apple ’s way of asserting that they ’re taking over the penthouse suite as the strongest and best company in the whole ones - and - zeroes racket .

It took one playoff game as a manager for David Ross to join a Hall of Fame - caliber class of former Cubs managers with a head - scratcher postseason moment that wo n't soon be forgotten .
A CATHOLIC school student has been " dealt with " after he set up a Facebook page that appeared to advocate killing prostitutes .
The page , called " Killing your hooker so you do n't have to pay her " , has now been removed by Facebook but not before almost 18,000 people joined the site .
The principal of St Laurence 's College in Queensland , Ian McDonald , confirmed a student from the school had been disciplined over the creation of the page .
" It has been sorted out and the boy has been dealt with , " Mr McDonald said .
" The student told us , of course , he did n't believe what was on there and he did something stupid .
" This did n't happen at the school , but does highlight the fact that we really need to educate the students about the dangers on the internet . "
Mr McDonald said students did not have access to Facebook at the school .
Elena Jeffreys , president of the Australian Sex Workers Association , was one of dozens of people to complain to Facebook .
She condemned the site for inciting violence against prostitutes .
" It 's a sad indictment of how people just think it 's normal that the sex industry and violence goes hand in hand , " she told .
" It 's pretty disgraceful there 's a web page advocating violence or murder . "
The 18,000 members of the Facebook group included a handful of people claiming to be sex workers who had joined the group while it was still live in order to voice their disapproval .
" As a hooker , I wish I could find this site funny , " one person posted .
" It 's about as funny as black people being hung from trees , Jewish people burning in ovens and kids being raped .
" Not funny in this society ! "
Other pages that appear to advocate violence against prostitutes are currently live on Facebook .
Many of them are linked to the computer game Grand Theft Auto , in which players can run over prostitutes in cars .
Another page called " Killing hookers and doing coke off their ass " says in its description : " Come here for all your hooker killing , and or eating of their diseased internal organs . "
The group , which at the time of writing had 79 members , featured a photo of a woodchipper that claimed to " mince up hookers or your money back guarantee " .
Ms Jeffreys said she did not blame Facebook , but urged people to think twice before creating such pages .
Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
Nvidia has finally officially unveiled its Tegra 2 system - on - a- chip ( SoC ) .
The 40nm ARM - based chip reportedly consumes less power than Intel 's Atom , and even Qualcomm 's Snapdragon , whilst being brawny enough to pump HD video .
Tegra 2 offers " uncompromised graphics " capable of delivering over 16 hours of HD video or 140 hours of music on a single charge .
It features eight independent processors , including dual ARM Cortex A9 cores , and is up to four times faster than the previous generation Tegra .
According to Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeny , the SoC's specs are comparable to both current high - end game consoles and high - end gaming PCs from two to four years ago .
As proof , the chip was demonstrated running Unreal Engine 3 , the engine that powers games like BioShock , Mass Effect and Gears of War .
Tegra 2 is currently in production , and a developer kit is available for those interested in creating applications for Tegra - powered devices .
TEHRAN / LONDON ( Reuters ) - Iran will take serious measures against five British yachtsmen detained in the Gulf if it proves they had “ evil intentions ” , a close aide to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday .
Relations between Britain and Iran have been dogged by tension in recent years over a range of issues , from Tehran ’s nuclear program to Iranian allegations of British involvement in post-election violence in June this year .
“ The judiciary will decide about the five ... naturally our measures will be hard and serious if we find out they had evil intentions , ” Esfandiar Rahim - Mashaie , the president ’s chief of staff , told the semi-official Fars news agency .
Britain stressed the five men , detained on November 25 , were civilians and played down parallels with an incident in March 2007 when Iran seized eight British Royal Navy sailors and seven marines off its coast .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki late on Tuesday and he repeated his call for formal consular access to the men and their speedy release .
“ He ( Miliband ) pressed Mr Mottaki for clear information on what had happened and for a statement of Iranian intentions in respect of the five , ” a Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement .
It added that Mottaki undertook to get a response “ at the earliest possible opportunity ” .
Ahmadinejad gave an extended interview to Iran ’s state television on Tuesday but made no mention of the Britons .
Earlier , Miliband told parliament he saw no political dimension to the case and the men were being treated well .
“ I think it is important to say there is no link at all between the position of the yachtsmen and the Iranian nuclear file or other political issues that exist between Iran and the international community , ” he said .
PROPELLER FAULT
Iran ’s English - language state Press TV said the Britons were detained “ kilometers away from their claimed route of Bahrain to Dubai .
They were detained near the Iranian island of Siri ” , it said .
Andrew Pindar , chairman of Sail Bahrain , which owns the yacht , told reporters the crew believed they were in the waters of the United Arab Emirates .
“ But due to a fault with a propeller they may have inadvertently drifted into Iranian waters . ”
He said the crew appeared to be in good spirits and were being well looked after .
Hardline Iranian students will gather outside the British embassy in Tehran on Wednesday to protest against “ the Britons ’ illegal entry ” into Iranian waters aboard the racing yacht Kingdom of Bahrain , the ISNA news agency reported .
Britain is often singled out for suspicion in the minds of many Iranians because of meddling during the colonial era .
The yacht that was crewed by five Britons when they were detained by Iranian officials is seen in this undated handout image received in London on December 1 , 2009 .

Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called Britain “ the most treacherous ” of Iran ’s enemies after Prime Minister Gordon Brown condemned Tehran ’s violent suppression of protests that followed the disputed June presidential election .
Iran ’s reformist opposition is planning to hijack an official demonstration on Monday to keep up pressure on the hardline establishment .
For Iran , the timing of capture of the sailors may be fortuitous .
“ They are so convinced that the British are orchestrating all the problems within Iran ... this will be just the sort of thing to keep the British press and the embassy in Tehran occupied , ” said Ali Ansari of Britain ’s St. Andrews University .
“ What it will do is detract attention .
Miliband has to be very nice and gentle , ” Ansari said .
“ My feeling is they will keep the tension up until Monday has passed and then gradually it ’ll start to ease , then they will probably release them . ”
Three Americans who crossed into Iran from Iraq in July are still detained and face spying charges .
Their families say they were hiking and strayed across the border accidentally .
Gulf Arab state Bahrain , a partner of the yachting team for which the crew was racing , said on Tuesday it would help to resolve the crisis .
“ The director of the consular department at the Foreign Ministry , Ambassador Yusuf Ahmed , is currently in touch with Iranian authorities to release the crew of the racing boat , ” the official Bahrain News Agency said .

2D Platformers are often the go - to for aspiring developers , and for many good reasons : it ’s a well - established genre that can look good with basic assets , there are lots of programming tutorials on how to make ’em , and tons of people grew up with the genre during its heyday .
However , the actual design of these is sometimes an afterthought .
To help fix that , I wanted to take a look at three common gameplay elements of many classic platformers .
These point are not the only things that made those games great , but they ’re a shared base that appears again and again .
1. The Moveset
The moveset is a nebulous term that encompasses all of the player character ’s abilities and properties .
These include the standard run and jump , but also other mechanics such as sliding , and the rules of various behaviours , e.g. , how much time does it take to accelerate to a maximum velocity , how does the character react when he ’s hit , etc .
Temporary powerups such as Mario ’s Starman and permanent modifiers like Mega Man ’s boss weapons also fall under this umbrella .
So what makes a great moveset ?
Well , let ’s start at the beginning .
First of all — and it ’s hard to believe that this needs to be explicitly stated — the moveset should be very clear and accurate .
There ’s nothing worse than running over a collectible and not picking it up .
Well , unless it ’s getting hit by an enemy that ’s clearly not touching you .
This kind of stuff is incredibly frustrating , and it makes the player feel cheated by the game .
As soon as we ’re sure that we ’re not actively pissing off the audience , we can build a connection between the player and the game itself .
To start off , the interface needs to be quick and responsive .
Input should have an immediate effect on the character in order to foster a sense of full control .
Granularity and different control techniques , i.e. , pressing , tapping and holding , are also important as they provide a level of precision to the movement .
It ’s important to note that the majority of 8 - bit and 16 - bit games actually ran at 60 frames - per-second .
Sure , many of the animations were composed of only 2 - 5 frames , but the actual motion of the sprites was very smooth .
This not only aided the physics , but also created a very dynamic sense of movement .
Now precision in platformers is often associated with pixel - perfect leaps that — if not properly executed — result in game death .
While that is sometimes the case , precision is an ever - present facet of these titles that ’s experienced at virtually all times , e.g. , jumping up to a moving platform , dashing through a tight tunnel , firing shots at floating enemies , etc .
So how do we actually make the moveset fun ?
Well , there ’s something to be said for vicariously living through a speedy , agile ninja that performs maneuvers one would not likely do in real life .
However , what I consider even more important to the “ fun factor ” is the integration of the moveset with the various facets of level design itself .
2. The Levels
On largely aesthetic level , it helps a great deal if the game is composed of various zones that each have their own unique look .
Of course that uniqueness is often accompanied by numerous interactive objects that add variety and help with the pacing , but there ’s one small detail that occasionally falls through the cracks : the separation of foregrounds and backgrounds .
This might seem like a relatively small issue , but if not handled correctly , it can confuse and frustrate the player .
Confusion is rarely a good thing , and pretty art is a poor consolation for jumping on phantom platforms .
Now as far as the environments themselves , it ’s not a coincidence that they ’re often filled with all sorts of slides , bridges , trampolines , ladders , etc. ,
In a way , they ’re simply playgrounds for the player , both literally and figuratively .
They cater to the moveset and enhance the flow of the game .
Smart playgrounds also funnel the player into using his various abilities .
Once again , this is to provide a wide array of experiences by fully utilizing existing resources .
The funneling itself can be subtle — indicating a path through a series of collectibles — or forced — requiring the player to scale a wall in order to proceed .
When designing levels , a guiding approach also helps with creating specific setups for how the player enters and leave a specific area .
For example , a path of collectibles can lead to an isolated spot that contains a useful powerup .
Getting there requires a series of leaps and wall jumps that take the player through the lines of collectibles and deposit him at the desired destination .
On his way back , the collectibles are gone , removing the need to retrace steps and making the descent itself easier and more enjoyable .
3. The States
Picture this scene : your character is jumping through the air , an enemy is homing in on him , and a stray missile explodes and destroys a brick wall .
A snapshot of this scene reveals multiple states : jumping , homing in , and exploding / crumbling .
States are basically logical denominations that encompass various behaviours and properties of “ game objects . ”
They give standard enemies and end - level bosses a rudimentary intelligence , and challenge the player to decipher and exploit their patterns .
This imbues them with personality , and once again encourages the use of various techniques to defeat them .
However , states are just as important to the levels themselves as to their inhabitants .
Even though it ’s easy to visually separate enemies and interactive objects , they ’re largely the same thing .
Springs , conveyor belts , swinging vines , breakable walls , etc. fill out the playground , and they do a tremendous job of turning a static image into a living , breathing environment .
On the initial playthrough , states encourage experimentation and improvisation .
Despite the fact that they ’re entirely predictable , they also enhance the replay value .
Learning the mechanics and patterns of a game guarantees that the player — at least to a certain extent — will continuously get better at it .
In some cases , this can even lead to the creation of speed runs .
And if you really doubt how vibrant a game can be largely through its use of states , click the play button below .
Now as you start putting all three of these principles together , chances are you ’ll also foster those intentional and emergant moments that players tend to remember .
What moments , exactly ?
Well , it ’s stuff like using pinball bumpers to dart around in Sonic the Hedgehog while avoiding the boss ’ attacks .
It ’s exploring all new underground caverns in Super Metroid thanks to a special ability .
It ’s running through a level of Super Mario Bros .
without stopping while piranha fish sail above you , but never quite touch you .
The flow created by intelligently combining movesets , levels and state mechanics is a large part of what makes platformers fun .
And as a final point , the combination of all three of these aspects can actually be seen in the intro to Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark , and who did n’t like that ?
Dedicated artist Paul Lung spends up to 60 hours sketching these photorealistic pencil drawings .
A graphic artist from Hong Kong , Paul uses a 0.5 mm technical pencil to draw everything from his family and friends to cats .
His highly detailed work has been written about in newspapers like The Sun and Telegraph .
Self - Portrait
His work reminds me of another amazing photorealistic artist but one that uses a ballpoint pen , Juan Francisco Casas Ruiz .
KERMIT , Tex . 
It occurred to Anne Mitchell as she was writing the letter that she might lose her job , which is why she chose not to sign it .
But it was beyond her conception that she would be indicted and threatened with 10 years in prison for doing what she knew a nurse must : inform state regulators that a doctor at her rural hospital was practicing bad medicine .
When she was fingerprinted and photographed at the jail here last June , it felt as if she had entered a parallel universe , albeit one situated in this barren scrap of West Texas oil patch .
“ It was surreal , ” said Mrs. Mitchell , 52 , the wife of an oil field mechanic and mother of a teenage son .
“ I said how can this be ?
You ca n’t go to prison for doing the right thing . ”
But in what may be an unprecedented prosecution , Mrs. Mitchell is scheduled to stand trial in state court on Monday for “ misuse of official information , ” a third - degree felony in Texas .
You 've all heard about the " eat local " movement , but we here at Happy Hour believe in drinking local as well .
Next time you 're at the neighbourhood LCBO , keep an eye out for a new vodka from Still Waters Distillery , Ontario 's first and only micro-distillery .
From its Concord facility , Still Waters produces a single malt vodka using artisan distilling techniques .
Yes , that 's right , single malts are n't just for scotches any more .
Most vodkas are made in industrial settings from a mix of grains ( not potatoes , as is the misconception ) , says Still Waters co-founder Barry Bernstein .
Instead , at Still Waters , Canadian malted barley is triple - distilled in small batches using a pot still .
" Not only does it have a unique taste and exceptional smoothness that makes it very appealing , but we are finding that consumers are drawn toward it since it is a locally produced product , " Bernstein says .
Sipped neat , the vodka does go down smoothly and has a clean finish .
Not yet a year old ( it opened last March ) , the distillery is also planning the launch of single malt whisky and rye products , to be available in several years once the liquor has matured in oak casks – casks that were built locally , of course .
In the meantime , Still Waters Single Malt Vodka ( $ 36.95 for 750 mL ) is available at many LCBO outlets in the premium section .
Vodka is one of my favourite spirits to mix – it's almost impossible to make a bad - tasting drink with it .
Add the sweet flavours of brown sugar and chocolate , as the folks at Still Waters have done , and you 've got this week 's recipe .
Still Waters S'mortini
S'mortini :
2 graham cracker squares , finely crushed
2 oz vodka ( recipe calls for Still Waters Single Malt Vodka )
1 oz crème de cacao
2 tsp Brown Sugar Cinnamon Syrup
Handful mini marshmallows for garnish
Brown Sugar Cinnamon Syrup :
2 tbsp brown sugar
1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
2 tbsp water
For Brown Sugar Cinnamon Syrup , combine sugar , cinnamon and water in small glass bowl .
Microwave 30 seconds .
Let cool .
( Makes 4 servings .
Save extra for encores . )
For S'mortini , moisten rim of martini glass and dip into plate covered in graham cracker crumbs .
In cocktail shaker , shake alcohol and 2 teaspoons Brown Sugar Cinnamon Syrup with ice .
Pour into martini glass .
Garnish with marshmallows .
Makes 1 drink .

Here ’s a quick way to create a “ nebula ” effect without any code at all :
Create a default particle system from the menu in Unity ’s UI
Delete just the “ Particle Animator ” component
Check the “ One Shot ” option in the emitter settings
Now you have a static set of particles .
The min & max emission controls how many particles there are ( you should probably set them both to the same value , unless you want a random value somewhere between the two ) .
The default particle textures are already fairly suitable as they are have a fuzzy glow look .
Try these values for a very quick nebula - like effect :
Min size : 0.1
Max size : 0.7
Min & Max emission : 200
You might want to set one of the ellipsoid size dimensions smaller than the others , to give it a sort of oval shape instead of spherical .
And of course you could use some custom particle textures , colour variations , and adjust the size to fit your game .
When I tried this , I found that having two particle systems in the same location worked really well , where the first particle system serves to show the larger blobby white areas , and the second particle system has the size values turned right down so that the particles are tiny specks , and the emission values turned right up ( to 2000 or so ) .
The settings for the first particle system are :
Min Size : 0.3
Max Size : 3.5
And for the second particle system :
Min Size : 0.01
Max Size : 0.03
And apply these settings to both systems :
Emit : On
One Shot : On
Simulate in world space : off
Min Emission : 2000
Max Emission : 2000
Ellipsoid : X:8 , Y:4 , Z:8
Then add the second system as a child of the first system ( by dragging the 2nd onto the 1st in the hierarchy ) .
Because they are not set to simulate in world space , you can then just rotate the parent particle system and the whole nebula will rotate including the tiny dots in the child particle system .
( until I sort out proper hosting for my unity files on this blog , you ’ll have to make do with pretty pictures and video ! )
The results suggest a strong reservoir of bipartisan support on the issue for President Obama and congressional Democrats , who are in the midst of crafting legislation aimed at limiting the impact of the high court 's decision .
Likely proposals include banning participation in U.S. elections by government contractors , bank bailout recipients or companies with more than 20 percent foreign ownership .
But Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( Ky. ) and other Republican lawmakers have praised the ruling as a victory for free speech and have signaled their intent to oppose any legislation intended to blunt the impact of the court 's decision ...
Republicans and business groups have rallied around the ruling , arguing that the decision merely levels the playing field with free - spending unions and other liberal interest groups .
The new poll , however , suggests there may be political risks for the GOP in opposing limits that appear to be favored by the party 's base .
Americans have to go beyond thinking in terms of that narrative and focus on the real struggle between the ordinary working folks who make up 95 % of the country and the 5 % who own most of it .
Classically , this is the struggle between progressives and reactionaries ( or progressives on the one side and reactionaries plus morons on the other side ) .
Even on his way out , Bayh is screwing working folks and trying to bolster his big money pals .
Yesterday : " Two days after he announced he would n't seek reelection , Sen .
Evan Bayh is throwing a wrench in the works of a signature administration initiative , expressing reservations about the plan for the government to eliminate private - sector middlemen and make student loans directly ...
Bayh 's stance could be a look toward either of two next moves for the senator :
If , like his predecessor , he becomes a lobbyist , warm relations with the financial industry wo n't hurt .
And if he runs for governor , he 's standing up for Hoosier jobs .
" Is it just that ?
Maybe -- at least among Republicans , theconservative party that exists to protect the status quo on behalf of the ownership class , as is the case with all right - wing political parties .
Right now the GOP is a narrowly based ideological party , very much in contrast to the Democrats ' all - things - to - all - people " big tent . "
But if the Republican Party is the overtly conservative one , the Party of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt has degenerated into aconservative party , almost as thoroughly owned by the same anti-worker , anti-consumer , anti-special interests that own the GOP .
Almost .
With innumerable corporate hacks beholden to Wall Street and other powerful special interests -- thespecial interests that Republicans are beholden to -- what , aside from jersey color , differentiates notoriously corrupt Democrats like Rahm Emanuel , Harold Ford , Blanche Lincoln , Joe Lieberman , Arlen Specter and Max Baucus from even the most blatant of the Republican whores -- the likes of John McCain , Mitch McConnell , Dick Shelby and John Cornyn on the Senate side and top House criminals like Tom DeLay , Duke Cunningham , Roy Blunt , Eric Cantor , Spencer Bachus , John Boehner and Pete Sessions ?
I remember a friend of mine telling me how he arrived at a job at the DSCC , all fresh and fired up with idealism .
After a routine discussion in which he brought up someone 's propensity to vote more frequently with the Republicans against working families than with the Democratic Senate caucus , one of the money men looked at him with contempt and said something to the effect of " Oh , do n't tell me you 're one of those ideological dorks !
" Last night I heardcorporate ConservaDem , DLC leader and Senate Democratic assistant whip Tom Carper making a half - hearted and utterly failed attempt to communicate on NPR .
Listening to him -- even just his inability to frame a cohesive thought or sound vaguely interested or just his repulsive manner of speaking as though he were also eating at the same time ( which he may have been ) -- made me physically ill .
Could I possibly be in the same party that this doofus in a leader of ?
He was supposedly on the show to represent the side that wants to reform the Senate by changing the filibuster rules that allow 40 senators to hold up every nomination and every piece of legislation passed by the more representative lower House .
( England took care of this throwback from Divine Right and aristocracy in 1911 . )
And Carper had a solution as well .
He said that if we just wait until there 's a Republican President and a GOP majority in the Senate , we 'll be able to scrap the filibuster .
And from the corporate point of view , that makes perfect sense and is certainly worth waiting for .
Yesterday ' sreported on a poll that shows nearly 80 % of Americans agree that corporations should n't be allowed to buy American democracy .
In other words , there is overwhelming public consensus against the single most important conservative initiative , diluting the power of the voters and tilting the balance of power into the hands of the rich and powerful .
Will our political class do anything to serve this expression of populist desire ?
Do n't count on it -- especially not on anything definitive .
The Democrats have overwhelming control of the House and Senate and they occupy the presidency .
But because they are nearly as sold out to the powerful special interests as the Republicans , it is unlikely that the handful of progressives within the party caucuses will be able to do anything effective at all .
When it came time for the Establishment to end the virtual state of war with China , the world 's biggest market and an economic powerhouse of the ( very immediate ) future , it was lifelong anti-Communist firebrand Richard Nixon who could do it without damaging his political standing much .
Now that the Establishment has determined it 's time to ditch Social Security , they 've tasked Barack Obama to do the job for them .
Yesterday we saw how very ready he was to do the job for them with his selection of two mainstream conservatives to head up his deficit commission , Erskine Bowles ( the Democratic Party conservative ) and Alan Simpson ( the Republican Party conservative ) , who the White House claims was picked to provide some levity for the gruesome task .
He 'll also provide the butcher 's cleaver .
Economist Dean Baker : " Simpson is not just your run of the mill Republican .
He is an extreme foe of Social Security ... [ As a Senator ] his agenda was cutting Social Security .
And that is who President Obama picked to co-chair his deficit commission .
" I do n't want to sound like a Naderite -- I actually held my nose and pulled a lever that included the detestable Joe Lieberman on it in the fear that Bush was surging in California -- but I have so little faith in the Democratic Party as it stands that the only efforts I want to undertake are involved with helping it find its roots as the party that sticks up for working families and fightsthe entrenched wealth and power that has taken control of it .
That , of course , is why Blue America is concentrating on Sending Democrats A Message They Can Understand right now .
And that 's why , if I were a drinking man , I would have indeed popped the cork of a bottle of champagne when I heard Evan Bayh was going bye - bye .

The " poo cakes " have a high calorific content and burn easily
The UK is firmly in the grip of one of the coldest winters on record and many households are seeing their fuel bills soar .
Although the government has dismissed fears over dwindling gas supplies during the big freeze , the weather highlights the desirability of finding more " green " fuel .
One water firm thinks it may have the answer - and it is not wind or hydro power .
Thames
Water has successfully been using human toilet waste to make electricity for the past decade .
Long before you get to Beckton sewage treatment plant in east London the smell tells you it is near .
Not strange considering it is the biggest sewage plant in Europe and treats a large majority of the waste coming from London 's toilets .
There is a difference in the summer holidays in the calorific value of the sludge ; it 's lower because people eat more salads
Harjeet Singh , plant manager Human waste has long been seen as a by - product , but Thames Water claims it saved £ 15 m last year , and generated 14 % of its power , from either burning sludge or methane derived from its 13 million customers ' toilets .
In total the firm treats 2.8 billion litres of sewage every day from people in London , Berkshire , Oxfordshire , Hertfordshire and Surrey .
Harjeet Singh is the plant manager for the sludge - powered generator at Beckton .
Before it , and its sister plant Crossness on the other side of the River Thames , was built in 1998 at the cost of £ 165 m , the sludge was simply deposited in the sea .
" It was taken on big barges out into the North Sea and dumped , " Mr Singh explained .
" A tanker was leaving every two minutes .
Now we only have about four lorries of ash [ the only by - product ] a day . "
The solid sludge is emptied out of the compressor and fed into a hot furnace Mr Singh describes the process which every day turns tons of human waste into electricity as " totally green " .
The raw sewage comes into the plant and is filtered , with anything that is not excrement or toilet paper removed , leaving a mix of 95 % water and 5 % solids which is then pumped into industrial 50 m ( 165 ft ) compressors where the water is squeezed out , leaving solid " poo cakes " .
These cakes , which still contain a large amount of water but burn easily , are fed into a gigantic hot furnace which produces steam that drives a large turbine , creating electricity .
" In the same way our domestic boilers work , " Mr Singh explained The electricity generated has the capacity to power 10,000 homes but here it is fed back into Beckton 's own system to keep the sewage plant running .
Fat for lipsticks Mr Singh said : " A computer monitors emissions so we do n't emit any nasties .
" That 's not happened in the past 12 years , we 've not exceeded [ limits ] since we opened .
" At the end of the process we 're left with about 30 % ash . "
Ash , the only by - product , could be used to make concrete
He said the firm was looking into ways of using the ash in the future .
" We do n't want it to go to landfill and one thing we are looking at making with it is concrete " , he said , showing a small test block he " made earlier " .
He said they were also toying with the idea of using the fat in the toilet sludge to make lipsticks and other cosmetics .
However a more likely use may be as fertiliser for farmers and gardeners .
" [ The sludge ] contains lots of nutrients and has a high calorific content .
" But you can see a difference during the school holidays and Christmas ; there 's less waste coming into the plant because people are away from the city .
" There is also a difference in the summer holidays in the calorific value of the sludge ; it 's lower because people eat more salads . "

Video editing on Linux has long gotten a bad rap .
A few years ago , the only real options for video editing were either deeply limited in features and polish , or incredibly complex to set up and use .
While Linux still lacks a direct competitor to tools like Apple 's iMovie or Final Cut Pro , the current crop of video editing tools are much more capable and easy to use .
Two tools in particular stand out : PiTiVi and Kdenlive .
Both suites are under active development and look promising .
In this article , we 'll take a look at what both of these tools can and can't do .
What a video editor needs
You should be able to count on a base set of features from any video editor that 's worth its salt .
At a bare minimum , any video editor should be able to import a wide range of formats , edit video and audio in a non-linear fashion , provide transitions and titling , allow multiple sources for video and audio , and be intuitive enough that it does n't require a week 's worth of training to become productive .
Ideally , an application would go a bit farther than that and also provide effects to adjust color balance , enhance the image , or just improve the raw video .
PiTiVi
PiTiVi is Gtk- based and uses the Gstreamer Multimedia Framework .
The goal for PiTiVi is to be intuitive for newcomers and suitable for professionals .
Intuitive it is , but suitable for professionals ?
Not just yet .
The latest version of PiTiVi is 0.13.3 .
As the version number suggests , it 's early on in development and not quite fully baked .
The version number reflects features implemented , however , and not stability .
In my time working with PiTiVi , it was stable and I did not encounter any serious bugs .
PiTiVi Interface .
Click for full size
Import works fairly well with PiTiVi , though some formats may be problematic depending on which Gstreamer plugins you 're using .
For instance , I grabbed RiP : A Remix Manifesto in Ogg Theora and in Apple Quicktime format ( H.264 ) .
PiTiVi happily imported both formats , but only recognized the video channel when importing from Quicktime .
This also was the case when importing movies from an iPhone .
Importing some of my Ogg tracks from Magnatune for audio worked just fine .
After doing a bit of detective work ( which is to say actually reading through the manual ) I found this was due to its use of the Fluendo Gstreamer codecs .
Apparently , the Fluendo Gstreamer plugins work well for playback , but not editing .
If you 're using the " ugly " Gstreamer plugins instead , MP3 import seems to work just fine , but still no luck with Quicktime .
PiTiVi Project Settings
The actual act of importing materials is dead easy .
Just drag a file into the PiTiVi Clip Library or use the dialog to snag them from your file system .
That is , if you have them on your system .
Right now , PiTiVi only supports importing from files — it does n't support importing video from a camcorder over Firewire ( IEEE 1394 ) connection .
This is rather unfortunate , as many users are going to expect and want to work with a comprehensive application to import and edit video .
If you 're using a flip cam that generates a usable file format , it 's not a problem , but if you have a camcorder , it 's a bit of a headache .
Support for this is planned for future releases , but is n't yet in stable versions of PiViTi .
One small thing PiTiVi does that is particularly useful when adding clips to a project — it shows the video and audio channels separately by default , and allows you to edit them separately .

I was trying to fetch some RSS feeds with Ruby the other day .
I just needed something quick ( but not dirty , I do n’t like dirty ) to validate a couple of things I was trying out with Rails .
It is not that difficult to fetch feeds , there is enough info around , but unfortunately I was behind a proxy at the time and this is where things went south quickly .
It just seems that the Ruby ecosystem has this natural hatred for corporate proxies , it ’s come to bite me time and time again .
This is something that really needs to be rectified if we want Ruby to penetrate further into the corporate world , but that ’s a story for another post .
Fetching Feeds Using Feedzirra
The first thing I tried to do was use Feedzirra , which I found out about from Railscasts .
At first sight everything seemed ok , it will respect the proxy settings you have configured in your environment ( i.e. the _httpproxy environment variable ) as it uses a fork of Curb ( libcurl bindings for Ruby ) .
However if you have n’t configured the proxy within your environment , everything falls over since there does n’t seem to be a way to supply your proxy settings to Feedzirra directly .
I would be happy to be corrected here !
I wanted to fetch feeds from within a Rails app , and Rails does n’t inherit your environment variables – no good ( I am sure there are ways to make Rails do so , but like I said – do n’t want dirty ) .
What was more frustrating was the fact that diagnosing this problem was a pain .
Normally to fetch a feed with Feedzirra you have to do the following :
ruby feed = Feedzirra:: Feed.fetch_and_parse( feed_url )
You can then iterate over the entries :
ruby feed .
entries .each do |entry | end
Without the proxy settings though , I was getting 0 ( zero ) as the return value of the initial call .
Not very intuitive !
Of course I suspected that the proxy was at fault , but still .
After reading the documentation a little more closely I came across the following bit :
ruby feed = Feedzirra:: Feed.fetch_and_parse( feed_url , :on_success => lambda {|feed| puts feed .
title } , :on_failure => lambda {|url , response_code , response_header , response_body | puts response_body })
This lets you define custom behaviour for successes and failures , this made everything simpler , since the failure block you supply gets invoked when the feed is not fetched successfully and the _responsecode parameter of the block contains the correct response code ( 407 proxy authentication required ) .
Still , diagnosing the problem does n’t provide me with a cure .
I am sure there must be a way to patch something to allow Feedzirra to take proxy settings directly .
I had a quick look at the code , but it seemed like I would need to patch multiple things in order to get it to work since Feedzirra hangs off several other libraries .
Instead I decided to take a lower level look at my feed fetching ( and parsing ) .
Fetching Feeds Using Open-uri
Apparently , there is a way to work with RSS feeds that is built into Ruby .
After a quick glance this looked pretty much as simple as Feedzirra so I decided to give it a go .
Guess what problem I ran into ?
Does n’t play nice with proxy – what a freaking surprise !
The Ruby RSS library relies on open - uri to actually fetch the feed which should pick up the proxy settings from your environment as well as give you the ability to pass the proxy configuration directly , but even a simple stand - alone script ( with the environment configured correctly ) refused to work for me .
After searching around for a bit I found this little tidbit .
Apparently open - uri has a bit of a bug / issue whereby the proxy username and password do n’t get picked up .
Long story short , if you want to get it to work you need to patch the OpenURI module slightly .
Fortunately this is easy to do with Ruby , just open up the module and go for your life .
Like so :
```ruby module OpenURI def OpenURI.open_http ( buf , target , proxy , options ) # : nodoc : if proxy raise “ Non-HTTP proxy URI : # {proxy} ” if proxy.class !=
URI ::HTTP end
if target.userinfo && “ 1.9.0 ” <= RUBY_VERSION
# do n’t raise for 1.8 because compatibility .
raise ArgumentError , “ userinfo not supported .
[ RFC3986 ] ” end
require ‘ net /http ’ klass = Net:: HTTP if URI ::HTTP === target # HTTP or HTTPS if proxy klass = Net:: HTTP :: Proxy( proxy.host , proxy.port , proxy.user , proxy.password ) end target_host = target .
host target_port = target .
port request_uri = target .
request_uri else # FTP over HTTP proxy target_host = proxy . host target_port = proxy . port request_uri = target.to_s end
http = klass.new ( target_host , target_port ) if target.class == URI ::HTTPS require ‘ net/https ’ http.use_ssl = true http.verify_mode = OpenSSL ::SSL::VERIFY_PEER store = OpenSSL ::X509 ::Store.new store.set_default_paths http.cert_store = store end
header = {} options . each {|k , v| header [ k ] = v if String === k }
resp = nil http.start { req = Net:: HTTP::Get.new( request_uri , header ) if options .
include ?
:http_basic_authentication user , pass = options [ :http_basic_authentication ] req.basic_auth user , pass end http.request( req ) { |response| resp = response if options [:content_length_proc ] && Net::HTTPSuccess === resp if resp.key ?(‘ Content - Length ’ ) options [:content_length_proc].call(resp [ ‘ Content - Length ’].to_i ) else options [:content_length_proc].call( nil ) end end resp.read_body {|str| buf << str if options [ :progress_proc ] && Net::HTTPSuccess === resp options [:progress_proc].call( buf.size ) end } } } io = buf.io io .rewind io.status = [ resp.code , resp.message ] resp.each { |name , value| buf.io.meta_add_field name , value } case resp when Net:: HTTPSuccess when Net::HTTPMovedPermanently , # 301 Net::HTTPFound , # 302 Net::HTTPSeeOther , # 303 Net::HTTPTemporaryRedirect # 307 throw :open_uri_redirect , URI.parse ( resp [ ‘ location ’ ] ) else raise OpenURI :: HTTPError.new(io.status.join ( ’ ‘) , io ) end end end```
All of that is just a big copy / paste from the actual open - uri.rb source file , all you really need to worry about is one line .
Completely off - topic , does anyone else feel like that method could use a bit of a refactor :) .
Back on topic , in the original open - uri , the line is :
ruby klass = Net:: HTTP ::Proxy( proxy.host , proxy.port )
we changed it to :
ruby klass =
Net:: HTTP :: Proxy( proxy.host , proxy.port , proxy.user , proxy.password )
After doing this the standalone script started fetching feeds without any trouble .
All you need to do is the following ( as per the link above ) :
ruby source = " feed_url " content = " " open ( source ) { |s| content = s.read } rss = RSS ::Parser.parse( content , false )
Now we just want the whole thing to work in Rails .
Getting It To Work In Rails
As I mentioned above , we do n’t want Rails to inherit our environment variables , so we need to be able to supply the proxy configuration directly .
This is fairly easy to do when you ’re fetching the contents of the feed url :
ruby open ( source , : proxy => " proxy_url " ) { |s| content = s.read } rss = RSS ::Parser.parse( content , false )
The actual proxy url will have to be in the correct format .
Assuming you ’re on Linux , something along the lines of :
The only thing left to take care of now , is to find a place for our open - uri monkey - patch and also get Rails to recognise the fact that we actually patched a module in the first place .
This is precisely what the :
RAILS_ROOT /config/initializers
directory is for .
You can put the open - uri monkey - patch here and Rails will auto - magically load it .
Alternatively you can put the patch file under :
RAILS_ROOT /lib
But you will still need to create a file under the initializers directory and then require the monkey - patch file from there .
Incidentally this file would also be a good place to put any of the other extraneous requires if you do n’t want to have them floating around your Rails controllers or models .
This whole ‘ fetching feeds from behind a proxy ’ thing ended up being a lot more complicated than it had to be , or at least that ’s how it felt .
On the positive side , at least I learned a lot , so there is always a silver lining .

It 's only Tuesday and already it 's been an interesting week for the world of digital rights .
Not only did the British government changed the wording around its controversial ' three strikes ' proposals , but the secretive anti-counterfeiting treaty , Acta , was back in the headlines .
Meanwhile , a US judge is still deliberating over the Google book settlement .
As if all that was n't enough , here 's another brick to add to the teetering tower of news , courtesy of Andres Guadamuz , a lecturer in law at the University of Edinburgh .
Guadamuz has done some digging and discovered that an influential lobby group is asking the US government to basically consider open source as the equivalent of piracy - or even worse .
What ?
It turns out that the International Intellectual Property Alliance , an umbrella group for organisations including the MPAA and RIAA , has requested with the US Trade Representative to consider countries like Indonesia , Brazil and India for its " Special 301 watchlist " because they use open source software .
What 's Special 301 ?
It 's a report that examines the " adequacy and effectiveness of intellectual property rights " around the planet - effectively the list of countries that the US government considers enemies of capitalism .
It often gets wheeled out as a form of trading pressure - often around pharmaceuticals and counterfeited goods - to try and force governments to change their behaviours .
Now , even could argue that it's no surprise that the USTR - which is intended to encourage free market capitalism - would n't like free software , but really it 's not quite so straightforward .
I know open source has a tendency to be linked to socialist ideals , but I also think it 's an example of the free market in action .
When companies can't compete with huge , crushing competitors , they route around it and find another way to reduce costs and compete .
Most FOSS is n't state - owned : it just takes price elasticity to its logical conclusion and uses free as a stick to beat its competitors with ( would you ever accuse Google , which gives its main product away for free , of being anti-capitalist ? ) .
Still , in countries where the government has legislated the adoption of FOSS , the position makes some sense because it hurts businesses like Microsoft .
But that 's not the end of it .
No , the really interesting thing that Guadamuz found was that governments do n't even need to pass legislation .
Even a recommendation can be enough .
Example : last year the Indonesian government sent around a circular to all government departments and state - owned businesses , pushing them towards open source .
This , says the IIPA , " encourages government agencies to use " FOSS " ( Free Open Source Software ) with a view toward implementation by the end of 2011 , which the Circular states will result in the use of legitimate open source and FOSS software and a reduction in overall costs of software " .
Nothing wrong with that , right ?
After all , the British government has said it will boost the use of open source software .
But the IIPA suggested that Indonesia deserves Special 301 status because encouraging ( not forcing ) such takeup " weakens the software industry " and " fails to build respect for intellectual property rights " .
From the recommendation :
" The Indonesian government 's policy ... simply weakens the software industry and undermines its long - term competitiveness by creating an artificial preference for companies offering open source software and related services , even as it denies many legitimate companies access to the government market .
Rather than fostering a system that will allow users to benefit from the best solution available in the market , irrespective of the development model , it encourages a mindset that does not give due consideration to the value to intellectual creations .
As such , it fails to build respect for intellectual property rights and also limits the ability of government or public - sector customers ( e.g. , State - owned enterprise ) to choose the best solutions .
Let 's forget that the statement ignores the fact that there are plenty of businesses built on the OSS model ( RedHat , Wordpress , Canonical for starters ) .
But beyond that , it seems astonishing to me that anyone should imply that simply recommending open source products - products that can be more easily tailored without infringing licensing rules - " undermines " anything .
In fact , IP enforcement is often even more strict in the open source community , and those who infringe licenses or fail to give appropriate credit are often pilloried .
If you 're looking at this agog , you should be .
It 's ludicrous .
But the IIPA and USTR have form here : in recent years they have put Canada on the priority watchlist .
Since Congress is suddenly so interested in discussing and regulating what other people make , let ’s discuss the financial condition of our hardworking , selfless Reps .
Take a guess what percentage of Congress are millionaires …
I ’ll give you a jumping off point : 1 % of the total US population are millionaires .
You probably figured that Congress probably had between 5 or 10 times the amount of millionaires as the rest of the country , that would make sense .
But you ’d be way wrong .
According to the Center for Responsive Politics , a whopping 44 % of Congress men and women are millionaires , that ’s a total of 237 of them !
So it ’s more like 44 times more millionaires .
Here ’s a quick rundown of the Fattest of Cats from Politico.com :
CRP says California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa is the richest lawmaker on Capitol Hill , with a net worth estimated at about $ 251 million .
Next in line : Rep. Jane Harman ( D - Calif. ) , worth about $ 244.7 million ; Sen. Herb Kohl ( D - Wis. ) , worth about $ 214.5 million ; Sen. Mark Warner ( D - Va. ) , worth about $ 209.7 million ; and Sen. John Kerry ( D - Mass . ) , worth about $ 208.8 million .
All told , at least seven lawmakers have net worths greater than $ 100 million , according to the Center ’s 2008 figures .
OK , so to sum up , only 1 % of Americans are worth a million or more , but almost half of our elected officials are – why , we ’re like peas in a pod !
Hard to believe there ’s such a disconnect between the everyday Americans and their duly - elected representative overclass .

237 Millionaires in Congress ( Politico )
Christopher C. Healy , the chairman of the Connecticut Republican Party , said Republicans were justified in blocking what he described as a drastic overreaching by Mr. Obama .
Still , Mr. Healy acknowledged that Republicans had to be careful about being seen as overly partisan and would now be under increasing pressure to offer a competing vision of governing .
“ We ca n’t be just about saying no , ” he said .
“ But we have not completed the transition yet from defeated incumbent party .
We have to position ourselves as an alternative and create enthusiasm for our positions . ”
Many of the obstacles facing Republicans were on display in Honolulu .
The party chairman , Michael Steele , is an unsettling figure within his own party , as became clear when Ms. Lingle offered a public reprimand to party members for criticizing Mr. Steele , if anonymously , to reporters .
“ Please do n’t do a rebuke in my home state of Hawaii , not to my friend Michael Steele , ” she said , as her audience rustled with discomfort .
Republicans have expressed concern about Mr. Steele ’s very high profile and often combative style , as well as his propensity to say intemperate things , like predicting that Republicans would not win the majority in the House this November .
Nick Ayers , the executive director of the Republican Governors Association , said he issued a plea similar to Ms. Lingle ’s to party members in a private session .
He said he was startled at how members were grousing about Mr. Steele , describing it as counterproductive when he was looking to make big gains in races for governor .
For his part , Mr. Steele defended his chairmanship and made clear that he intended to seek re-election when his term ended next year .
“ My style is not something you get used to very easily , ” he said .
“ I know that . ”
This took place at a sometimes contentious news conference 
“ Get your facts right , ” Mr. Steele instructed one reporter  that had Republicans wincing at this latest example of Mr. Steele ’s sometimes unvarnished ways .
With Mr. Obama seeking to strike a different tone at the beginning of his second year in office , Republicans back in Washington were responding with conciliatory phrases , if not yet substantive compromises .
Even a crazy girl gives it a try ... along with a ' stunt monkey '
Authorities are desperately looking for motives to help them find the suspected arsonists behind at least eight of 11 church fires in central and east Texas since the beginning of this year .
But a chief investigator of the Alabama church burnings in 2006 has some advice for his Texas counterparts :
Go slow , tune out the public din , and let the evidentiary crumbs lead the way .
“ It ’s like the old saying , expectation is greater than the realization , ” says Alabama State Fire Marshal Ed Paulk , who was the case manager during the investigation into the burning of nine Baptist churches in Alabama in 2006 .
“ Iinvestigators ] try to keep an open mind and allow evidence to steer where we go and what we look at … whereas the public tends to sensationalize what they perceive to be motive . ”
In the Alabama case , because several of the churches belonged to black congregations – a sensitive issue in the state , where church bombings were common during the civil rights era – it was widely assumed that white supremacists were responsible .
Instead , three white college students from the Birmingham suburbs were found to be behind the fires .
Officials said the fires were a “ joke ” that spun out of control during their deer hunting trips .
All three have nine more years left on their prison sentences .
No pattern to Texas arsons
So far , the apparent theft of nonreligious items from several of the Texas churches has given investigators from the US Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives ( ATF ) some clues as to motive .
ATF spokesman Thomas Crowley has also told news outlets that there ’s evidence that the fires were set by a group of people , not a single person .
And while the affected churches have been mostly in small towns , not all the fires were in out - of - the - way locales , Mr. Crowley said .
( See map of suspicious fires here . )
The arsonists have no set pattern , targeting a variety of different congregations , including Methodist , Baptist , Christian Scientist , and nondenominational churches .
" [ I ] would characterize the mood of our people as perplexed , " Randy Daniels , mayor of Athens , Texas , a town of about 12,000 that has seen three of the church fires , told CNN .
“ Most people consider it just incomprehensible and unconscionable that somebody could and would be doing this . "
“ Some blame Muslims for the east Texas church fires .
Some blame Palin- hating liberals , ” writes The Dallas Morning News ’ Brooks Egerton .
Church arson motives vary widely
But perpetrators of church arson , when finally apprehended , often do n’t fit the expected profiles , as shown by more than 1,000 church arson investigations conducted nationally since 1996 , when the National Church Arson Task Force was established .
“ We ’ve had situations where the motivation was covering up burglaries and theft , ... where it was acting out against people in revenge , and we ’ve had cases where it had to do with the occult , and cases where people are just making poor judgments , ” says Mr. Paulk , the Alabama fire marshal .
Racism , religious hatred , insurance fraud , and thrill - seeking are less common reasons for church arson , according to the Insurance Information Institute .
Whatever the motive , church burnings affect Americans deeply .
“ Our nation was built around religious freedom and any time someone damages a building relating to the faith of any group it tears at the fabric of our society , ” says Paulk .

I know not everyone is going to be excited by the news , but I for one am ecstatic !
In an interview earlier this week with BoxOffice , Joe Johnston ( director of the last Jurassic Park movie ) spoke mostly about his next project Captain America .
However for a brief moment the conversation veered towards information on the latest Jurassic Park film .
Rumors about a new film have been running rampant since 2001 , but in the past several months new tidbits have been coming out that make this film feel closer .
The fact that a new writer was hired to pen a script for it was probably the biggest .
However , official confirmation for this film has been … somewhat lacking .
Joe Johnston at long last is telling fans what they want to hear :
There is going to be a Jurassic Park IV .
And it ’s going to be unlike anything you ’ve seen .
It breaks away from the first three — it ’s essentially the beginning of the second Jurassic Park trilogy .
It ’s going to be done in a completely different way .
That ’s pretty much all I can tell you .
What ’s exciting about this is not only the confirmation , but this is the first news of more than one film .
Universal studios are wanting to start a new trilogy of films involving those deadly dinosaurs , presumably with an entire new cast of characters more than likely having nothing to do with the first set of films .
I loved the first three films , and cannot wait to see what they have in store next .
Do n’t get too eager now , for we probably wont ’ be seeing this in theaters any time soon .
If Joe Johnston is in fact directing , we ca n’t expect anything to happen until Captain America is released in Summer 2011 .
Despite this fact Universal seems to be using the time to rebuild the franchise , and reinvigorate the public , getting them excited for another outing .
You can see evidence of this in the fact that this year they have released an entirely new line of Jurassic Park toys , featuring all new sculpts and models for fans and kids to enjoy .
This reminds me of the early 90s when Kenner launched a new set of Star Wars figures and toys shortly before Lucasfilm announced the Special Editions , which of course was a prelude to the announcement for the Prequels .
To further this idea is the rumor going around that the original JP trilogy is set to release on blu - ray this year .
Take heart fans , while it may still be a few years away , I would not be surprised to see an official studio announcement on Jurassic Park IV … maybe even a release date before the end of the year .

a In 1984 only , an immediate credit of 0.3 percent of taxable wages was allowed against the OASDI taxes paid by employees , resulting in an effective employee tax rate of 5.4 percent .
The OASI and DI trust funds , however , received general revenue equivalent to 0.3 percent of taxable wages for 1984 .
Similar credits of 2.7 percent , 2.3 percent , and 2.0 percent were allowed against the combined OASDI and HI taxes on net earnings from self - employment in 1984 , 1985 , and 1986 - 89 , respectively .
b Beginning in 1990 , self - employed workers are allowed a deduction , for purposes of computing their net earnings , equal to half of the combined OASDI and HI contributions that would be payable without regard to the contribution and benefit base .
The OASDI contribution rate is then applied to net earnings after this deduction , but subject to the OASDI base .
c For 2010 , most employers were exempt from paying the employer share of OASDI tax on wages paid to certain qualified individuals hired after February 3 .
For 2011 and 2012 , the OASDI tax rate is reduced by 2 percentage points for employees and for self - employed workers , resulting in a 4.2 percent effective tax rate for employees and a 10.4 percent effective tax rate for self - employed workers .
These reductions in tax revenue due to lower tax rates are being made up by transfers from the general fund of the Treasury to the OASI and DI trust funds .
Beginning in 2013 , an additional HI tax of 0.9 percent is assessed on earned income exceeding $ 125,000 for each married individual filing separately , $ 200,000 for individuals filing as single , and $ 250,000 for married couples filing jointly .
This additional HI tax rate is not reflected in the tax rates shown in the table .
It ’s been a roller coaster ride for Jason Bay and fantasy owners over the past few years .
In 2007 it seemed like his days as a stud fantasy outfielder appeared were over ( .247 , 21 HR , 84 RBI ) , but a year and a half spent in Boston has clearly reinvigorated his value .
You do n’t have to look further than his 2009 campaign for proof :
531 At Bats
. 267 Batting Average ( 142 Hits )
36 Home Runs
119 RBI
103 Runs
13 Stolen Bases
. 384 On Base Percentage
. 537 Slugging Percentage
. 318 Batting Average on Balls in Play
That 2007 season clearly appears to be the anomaly :
He ’s had 31 or more home runs in four of the last five seasons
He ’s had 101 or more RBI in four of the last five seasons
He ’s scored 101 or more runs in four of the last five seasons
He ’s had double - digit stolen bases in four of the last five seasons
The exception for all of the above four statements ?
2007 … Each and every one of them .
So , there ’s no doubting his talents , but as he heads to CitiField you have to wonder if he should still be valued as a second round draft choice ( his current ADP is around 27 and he ’s the 25th player overall ) .
That ’s the seventh outfielder coming off the board , close enough to the eighth ranking that I gave him ( he ’s being selected before Grady Sizemore ) .
The Mets may say that Bay ’s swing is conducive to CitiField , but fantasy owners can not be so sure .
Just look at the teams offense last season as a prime example .
While there were injuries and other things at work , the ball clearly did not fly out of CitiField as much as other ballparks in the game .
It yielded 1.60 HR / game , more than just a handful of ballparks :
AT&T Park – 1.59
Busch Stadium – 1.48
Dodger Stadium – 1.57
PETCO Park – 1.59
Turner Field – 1.52
Just as further proof that the stadium will be an impact , notice that the five parks CitiField outperformed were in the NL .
While he may come close , drafting him expecting 30 + home runs would be a mistake .
How about the RBI and Runs ?
The Mets offense ca n’t be as bad as it was last season , though the injury to Carlos Beltran already throws a wrench into the Mets plans .
Still , hitting in the middle of the lineup should allow him to come extremely close to 100 RBI , especially with a healthy Jose Reyes hitting in front of him .
The runs could be a different story , but given his history we ’ll give him the benefit of the doubt .
He walks a lot ( career 12.6 % walk rate ) , meaning he should be on base enough to score some runs .
While he hit .306 once ( in 2005 ) , that ’s not the type of hitter he is .
He ’s proven that he ’s more of a .280ish hitter and that ’s what we should expect .
Let ’s take a look at my projection for him in 2010 :
.273 ( 150-550 ) , 29 HR , 100 RBI , 95 R , 12 SB , .316 BABIP , .378 OBP , .502 SLG
Those are still good numbers and ones any fantasy owner would like , but is it second round good ?
I just do n’t think so , not when Sizemore , Upton , Greinke , Felix Hernandez and Roy Halladay are all going immediately after him .
Those are all players I ’d draft before Bay .
I have him more as a late third / early fourth round draft choice , so it ’s not likely that I end up with him on any of my teams .
What about you ?
Is Bay someone you ’d take in the second round ?
What are you expecting from him in ’ 10 ?

BRUSSELS ( Reuters ) - The European Union condemned on Monday the use of fraudulent EU passports by the killers of a Palestinian militant in Dubai , showing its discontent with Israel without referring to it directly .
Israel 's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman arrives at the European Union council headquarters during a EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels , February 22 , 2010 .

In a short statement that European diplomats said was intended as a rebuke to Israel , EU foreign ministers said that the assassination was “ profoundly disturbing ” and that its citizens ’ rights were violated .
Dubai has accused Israel of being behind the killing of Hamas commander Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Israel has not denied or confirmed it played any role but its foreign minister , visiting Brussels , said there was nothing to link it to the killing .
“ The EU strongly condemns the fact that those involved in this action ( the killing ) used fraudulent EU member states ’ passports and credit cards acquired through the theft of EU citizens ’ identities , ” ministers said after talks in Brussels .
“ The EU welcomes the investigation by the Dubai authorities and calls on all countries to cooperate with it . ”
Diplomats said the statement was intended to put pressure on Israel , but no direct reference was made to it because there was no proof Israeli agents carried out the assassination .
The declaration is unlikely to have any long - term repercussions for EU - Israeli ties and Israeli officials have played down the possibility of a full - blown crisis .

Sami Abu Zuhri , a spokesman for the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip , said the EU statement lacked teeth and would tempt Israel to carry out “ more crimes of this kind . ”
“ Condemning the use of ( European ) passports was insufficient .
The statement did not indicate any condemnation of the crime , Mabhouh ’s assassination , ” he said .
FRENCH OUTRAGE , BRITISH CONCERN
Dubai authorities say they are virtually certain Israeli agents carried out the killing and have released the identities of 11 people who travelled on forged British , Irish , French and German passports to kill Mabhouh in a hotel .
Mabhouh was involved in smuggling weapons from Iran to the Gaza Strip , Hamas has said .
France and Germany have asked Israel for an explanation and President Nicolas Sarkozy spoke of France ’s “ irrevocable condemnation of what is nothing less than an assassination ” after talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Paris .
Prosecutors in Cologne are looking into whether one of the men acquired a German passport under a false pretext to engage in spying , and could refer the case to federal prosecutors for investigation , a spokesman said .
Six Britons with the same names as members of the alleged hit team live in Israel and say their identities were stolen .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband urged Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman to cooperate with a British inquiry into British passports could have been forged for use by the assassins .
Lieberman , who met Miliband in Brussels , said in a statement there was no proof Israel was involved in the killing , and later told reporters : “ I think you have all seen too many James Bond movies . ”
Israel has a policy of ambiguity on intelligence issues .
Hamas , which won 2006 legislative elections in the Palestinian territories , is shunned by the West for rejecting its calls to recognize Israel and renounce violence .
From healthcare to public debt , pundits are attacking President Barack Obama 's first State of the Union address from almost every conceivable angle .
When it comes to Obama transparency , Electronic Frontier Foundation privacy attorney Kurt Opsahl points out that the chief executive told the American public one thing Wednesday night and a federal appeals court another just a few weeks ago .
The issue at hand surrounds lobbying .
" It 's time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my administration or Congress , " the president said during his televised address .
But , before the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month , the Justice Department argued that it should not have to disclose the names of telecommunication industry lobbyists .
Those companies successfully lobbied Congress and President George W. Bush in 2008 to approve legislation that provided their companies with retroactive immunity to lawsuits accusing them of funneling , without warrants , all domestic electronic communications to the National Security Agency .
That legislation killed the EFF 's case against the telecommunication companies .
The EFF then sued the government , seeking the lobbyists ' identities .
A California federal judge agreed , and then the Obama administration appealed .
" There is no public interest in the compelled disclosure of the representatives ' identities " ( .pdf ) , the administration told the federal appeals court in San Francisco Dec. 14 .
Opsahl points out that there is no national security concern with disclosing the information .
" What they want to hide will not give some advantage to our adversaries , " Opsahl said in a telephone interview .
" They want to protect the telecoms and themselves from the embarrassment to be involved in lobbying to deny millions of Americans their day in court . "
It remains to be seen , Opsahl added , " whether the administration will file another paper with the court clarifying that their position has changed . "
In case you forgot , Obama , as a senator from Illinois , voted for the immunity bill that President George W. Bush signed .

PRESIDENT of the Islamic Council of Jamaica , Mustafa Muhammad , says he agrees with the Sharia law which prescribes death for people who openly flaunt homosexual behaviour .
Muhammad did not mince words as he lashed out against what he described as an unclean , unnatural lifestyle .
 It is illegal and in the Sharia law the punishment is death .
If you follow Christianity it is a crime in the sight of God .
He destroyed a whole city because of this thing .
It is an ungodly practice and I apologise to no one for this ,  Muhammad said .
Under Jamaican law , persons who practice buggery  the sexual penetration of the anus  can be sent to prison for up to 10 years .
Despite claims by local and international gay lobbyists that homosexuals are attacked and killed in Jamaica , police statistics show that most gays who are killed are victims of crimes of passion .
Muhammad made sure to state that he was against the killing of gays in Jamaica .
 This can only be done in a country that is being run by Islam ,  he said .
Muhammad was also critical of the gay lobbyists who are clamouring for Jamaicans to adopt a more relaxed attitude towards homosexuality .
 What is happening is that we are leaning towards the laws of man ,  he said .
 If a Muslim woman chooses to cover up herself it is seen as oppressive , but it is wicked to criticise homosexuals ?
I am not free to express myself as a Muslim but a homosexual is allowed free expression and protection from the law . 
The Sharia Law is interpreted differently in some Muslim jurisdictions and in some countries women are subjected to what western cultures describe as oppressive treatment .
Some Muslim cultures deny women education and enforce female circumcision , but Muhammad explained that this was not in keeping with the true teachings of the Prophet Mohammed and the Sharia Law , but should be attributed to cultural practices .
 Of course women must be allowed education .
The Koran says every Muslim must seek knowledge .
If there is a Muslim who denies a woman education , then it is not acceptable ,  he told the Observer .
 Female circumcision has been around for thousands of years and a lot of people come into Islam with this culture .
It is very important that we separate the teaching of Islam from the culture of the people . 
The more people know about the iPad , the less they want to buy one , according to a study released Friday .
But , are we expecting too much ?
The study seems to confirm the iPad as Apple 's least exciting announcement in years .
And the company is feeling the backlash that comes from not delivering on the hype .
Retrevo , an online marketplace for consumer electronics , surveyed 1,000 of its customers and found that the iPad 's Jan. 27 announcement did more to snuff out customer interest than to spark it .
That 's not surprising when all Apple introduced was just a supersized ( and superexpensive at the high end ) iPod touch .
My friend and fellow pundit Larry Magid described as the iPad as " underwhelming . "
I agree , the iPad is underwhelming , especially as a business device .
And the more people heard about the iPad , the less they wanted one , according to Retrevo .
" The word definitely got out as the number of respondents saying they had heard about the tablet rose from 37 % shortly before the announcement to over 80 % after the media frenzy on January 27th , " Retrevo said Friday in a blog post .
" Unfortunately for Apple , the number if respondents saying they had heard about the tablet but were not interested in buying one , doubled from 25 % before the announcement to over 50 % following the announcement . "
Of course , that 50 percent who are interested is plenty to make the product a success , provided many of them actually become buyers .
( Learn more about the study in this story by Greg Keizer ) .
I think we may be being a bit hard on the iPad .
I still do n't think it will become a big enterprise computing tool , even if it does " run " Windows 7 ( as a virtualized desktop ) .
I also do n't think traditional mobile line - of - business applications -- think your UPS driver -- will start carrying iPads .
But , entertainment , gaming , and e-reading , especially in education , could still make the iPad quite a winner .
Apple already has the ecosystem in place -- developers , content , shopping -- to make the platform immediately useful when it arrives .
The iPad appears to be an excellent e-reader , though I said that about the Nook before it shipped , too .
In this case , however , enough pre-production iPads have been around that I feel pretty confident .
I still do n't feel the need for an iPad , but I do expect to invest in an e-reader soon and am glad I did n't get a Nook for Christmas .
Now , I want to wait a bit and see how the devices , content pricing , and content availability shake - out .
At some future moment , the combination of e-reader features / content and interesting apps ( not available on my iPhone ) could convince me .
So , while I do n't see an iPad in my immediate future , I am closer to buying one -- or perhaps a competitor -- than I was before the announcement .
I still would n't say I want an iPad .
But , I see how I might be convinced in the future .

Enlarge By Binod Joshi , AP Khagendra Thapa Magar , who is 22 inches tall , is traveling to Europe to campaign for the Guinness World Record title .
KATMANDU , Nepal ( AP ) 
A man who is only 22 inches tall left his home country of Nepal on Sunday in a quest to be recognized as the world 's shortest man .
Khagendra Thapa Magar is traveling to Europe to campaign for the Guinness World Record title .
He applied to London - based group for a place in the record book in October , soon after turning 18 , but said he has not received any response .
Magar 's family initially filed a claim when he was 14 , but it was rejected because he was not an adult and there was a chance he might grow .
They say doctors in Nepal have not been able to explain why Magar is so small .
" We are going to Italy to try to record his name in the Guinness Book of World Records , " his father , Rup Bahadur Thapa Magar , told reporters in Katmandu .
They plan to appear on an Italian television show to talk about his bid for the title .
Once in Italy , Magar , his father and a supporter will decide on their next destination .
His supporters saw him off from the Nepalese capital on Sunday , offering flower bouquets and garlands .
The current record is held by He Pingping of China , who is 29 inches tall .

While Mutallab was poorly dressed , his friend was dressed in an expensive suit , Haskell said .
He says the suited man asked ticket agents whether Mutallab could board without a passport .
“ The guy said , ' He 's from Sudan and we do this all the time . ' ”
Mutallab is Nigerian .
Haskell believes the man may have been trying to garner sympathy for Mutallab 's lack of documents by portraying him as a Sudanese refugee .
The ticket agent referred Mutallab and his companion to her manager down the hall , and Haskell did n't see Mutallab again until after he allegedly tried to detonate an explosive on the plane .

Oddity 6 : Is there an Al Qaeda connection ?
A Yemini - based Al Qaeda group has claimed responsibility for the attack , praising Abudulmutallab's attempt to blow up Flight 253 with about 3 ounces of the powerful explosive PETN stashed inside a pair of specially - made underwear , reports CBS News chief investigative correspondent Armen Keteyian .
" We learned of him in November , when his father came to the U.S. embassy in Nigeria and sought help in finding him .
We did not have his name before then , " said Paul Gimigliano , a CIA spokesman .
Harold Demuren , the head of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority , says Abdulmutallab ’s ticket came from a KLM office in Accra , Ghana .
Demuren said Monday that Abdulmutallab bought the $ 2,831 round - trip ticket from Lagos , Nigeria , to Detroit via Amsterdam on Dec. 16 .
Oddity 7 : Instant mythology .
You read that right .
They were sent to Saudi Arabia to attend a Jihad rehabilitation center where they were given paint and crayons .
Is n’t that nice !
Oddity 8 : Is there a tape ?
Her daughter said that ahead of them was a man who videotaped the entire flight , including the attempted detonation .
" He sat up and videotaped the entire thing , very calmly , " said Patricia .
" We do know that the FBI is looking for him intensely .
Since then , we 've heard nothing about it . "

In the midst of passengers trying to subdue Abdulmutallab and flight attendants working to put out the fire , Taylor says he looked behind him and saw a man filming the situation about two to five rows back .
" I looked behind me as the flight attendant ran through , and I looked and there was a guy with a camera , " Taylor says .
Taylor says he notified the FBI of what he saw , in hopes of helping them to obtain footage of the foiled attack .
" There ’s definitely footage from the time it was mission critical , to the time they hauled ( Abdulmutallab ) to the front , " Taylor says .
" I told them 100 percent there was a guy filming . "
Oddity 9 : Travel arrangements .
Oddity 10 : The inevitable Israeli connection .
Guess whose main European HQ is based there !
I typed that before I confirmed who runs security there .
Not that that 's a surprise .
Six months prior to Reid 's near shoe bombing of American Airlines flight 63 from Paris to Miami in December 2001 , while memories of 9/11 were still fresh in everyone 's mind , Reid attempted to board an El Al flight from Schiphol to Tel Aviv .
Reid was taken aside by El Al security and identified as a terrorist suspect .
Reid paid for a one - way ticket with cash and would not reveal what he planned to do in Israel .
However , rather than turning Reid into Dutch security for further action , he was allowed to board the El Al flight by Israel 's Shin Bet security so his movements during his five days in Israel could be monitored .
Six months later , Reid attempted to ignite his shoe on the flight from Paris to Miami .
Israel had not informed British , American , or any other security agency of the concerns about Reid .
Reid 's aunt , Claudette Lewis who raised Reid in south London , was quoted as saying she believed her nephew had been " brainwashed . "
Reid later said El Al failed to detect that he had explosives in his shoes on the flight to Tel Aviv , an amazing revelation considering the Israeli airline 's tight security .
The ICTS mystery
Following the terrorist attack on DL / NW Flight 253 on 25 December 2009 , there have been incorrect reports linking ICTS Europe to the event .
We would like to make it clear that ICTS Europe Holdings B.V. is not connected in any way to the mentioned events .
ICTS Europe does not provide any security services , nor any other services , whether directly or indirectly , at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport and is not connected in any way to any of the companies that provide security services at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport .
ICTS International N.V. ( Nasdaq : ICTS ) announced today that it has formed a partnership arrangement with ICTS Europe Holdings BV , an unaffiliated party , to provide security services at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in The Netherlands .
The partnership named ICTS Netherlands Airport Services has been awarded two contracts having an aggregate value of $ 15,000,000 Euros a year or annually .
The contracts are for three years and relate to two sections of the airport to provide security , employees , guards and control in the airport , establishing a central check point and security arrangements for airport employees and other related services .
CTSN Netherlands , ICTS Europe subsidiary in The Netherlands , was awarded a new contract with OpenSkies airline , British Airways ’ premium carrier subsidiary , to provide High risk security operation services supported by technology at Schiphol Airport .

I do not have such a theory
In particular , I 'd like to know why ICTS lied .
Let 's start the New Year paranoid .
I 've tried to avoid writing about the Nigerian wanna - be terrorist Umar Farouk Abdul Mutallab ( known to his family as Farouk ) , the 23 year - old Islamic lonelyheart whose abortive effort to blow up Northwest flight 253 on Christmas Day ended with an intact jet and a charred genital region .
The lesson :
If you sew PETN into your underwear , you may put a damper on your sex life .
Not that the virginal Faroukone .
Correspondents seem to expect me to come up with a radical new conspiracy theory to explain this incident .
Alas , I do n't have such a theory .
The best I can offer is a summary of some of the unconventional claims which have popped up in various news and blog articles .
If you are the kind of nitwit who presumes thatan odd claim automatically equalsof such a claim , please dive head - first into a vat of fire ants .
The initial reports said that he did not .
We heard that he had boarded the Amsterdam - to - Detroit flight by impersonating a refugee from Sudan .
Later , we were told that hehave a passport :
See here for a picture of the thing .
But if he did have a passport , the following report becomes doubly inexplicable ... Kurt and Lori Haskell , of Newport MI , were on the flight .
At the boarding gate in Amsterdam , they saw Farouk arrive in the company of an as - yet unidentified man .
The " he - had- a- passport - all - along " reports did not come out untilthe Haskell account hit the headlines .
The sighting of an accomplice was thus effectively discredited .
As CBS puts it : Note that CBS suddenly places us in the realm of " theory , " as opposed to eyewitness testimony .
Note as well that the Washington Times ( linked above ) saw fit to mention the " impersonating - a- Sudanese " story without mentioning Haskell 's " accomplice " story -- even though the Haskells , as far as I can see , were the original source for the " Sudanese " bit .
Orthey ?
Kurt Haskell has asked the FBI about any security videos which would confirm his story , but the FBI has refused to answer .
These days , it would be silly to believe that Farouk wasphotographed at the airport .
This story from an African news journal contains a noteworthy paragraph : " Privileged people " ?
As Jerry Seinfeld used to say : " Whothese people ?
" Incidentally , this same report also mentions that Farouk may have a sister in New York , that he was in Lagos for his father 's retirement party ( even though other reports say that he was estranged from his family ) , and that the formerly loquacious paterfamilias has now ordered all family members not to talk to the media .
Farouk 's father , a very prominent banker in Nigeria , became concerned about his son's religious extremism and warned the American embassy .
It seems odd for a father to rat out his son .
And why did Farouk attend Dad 's retirement party if Dad was ratting him out ?
Farouk spent time in Yemen , where he seems to have associated with Al Qaeda militants .
The CIA apparently knew that someone called " the Nigerian " was in contact with Al Qaeda in that country .
In May , Farouk was blocked from re-entry into Britain .
Let 's repeat that : Farouk appeared on the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database , which is compiled by the good folks at the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center .
That database contains about half - a- million names .
Yet he was not placed on the " no fly " list .
So whoappeared on the list ?
ACLU attorney David Fathi , David Nelson offame , Army colonel and Democratic political candidate Robert J. Johnson , congressman John Lewis ( also a Democrat ) , Nelson Mandela and Ted Kennedy .
In 2007 , Princeton professor Walter F. Murphy could not board an airliner ; he was told that he was placed on the list because he had given speeches critical of George W. Bush .
I guess Farouk just did n't have what it takes .
The CIA says that Farouk was " the Nigerian " who communicated with Al Qaeda in Yemen .
He has confessed to training with an Al Qaeda bomb - maker .
Yet the Obama administration downplays all talk of a conspiracy .
Moreover Responding to this report , the CIA dropped a rather interesting piece of information :
The father 's warning was taken with sufficient seriousness to be passed along to the CIA .
And the CIA already knew of a person called " the Nigerian " who was palling around with Al Qaeda types in Yemen .
So the question is : Did the the CIA connect Farouk to " the Nigerian " in November ?
The careful wording of Gimigliano 's statement leaves the possibility wide open .
For what it is worth , Chris Wallace of Fox News says that the CIA had been tracking Farouk since August .
Yet he did n't make the " no fly " list .
In an " official " statement , an Al Qaeda group claimed responsibility for the attack , which was carried out ( supposedly ) in retaliation for bombing raids on an Al Qaeda base in Yemen .
As " Casual Observer " at FDL notes , those bombing raids took place on December 17 and 24 .
However : The chronology does n't work .
In right - wingerland , a bogus story is making the rounds .
According to this yarn , Farouk had two Al Qaeda helpers identified as Gitmo detainees released into the custody of Saudi Arabia for rehabilitation .
And the propaganda just never stops ... Previously , we mentioned the airport security videos which may or may not support the Haskell narrative .
But we also have persuasive accounts of an amateur videotape taken within the aircraft itself during the incident .
This report comes from passenger Patricia Keepman , who sat roughly 20 rows behind Farouk : Theflight ?
Whothat ?
See also here Taylor and Keepman place the videographer in the same location .
Their accounts are congruent and convincing .
So why have n't we seen the tape ?
Why have n't we heard from the person who did the filming ?
A
Dutch film - maker named Jasper Schuringa was on the flight , but he did no filming .
In fact , he helped to subdue the crotch - bomber .
Farouk came from a well - off family , but he had been estranged from his father for some time -- or so says the father .
So where did he get the cash for his travels ?
If his family had shut off the spigot , who provided his egg - and - cheese money ?
We can trace him going back and forth to the UK , Ghana , Yemen , Amsterdam and the U.S.
He paid for the final journey -- which should have been a tip - off .
Oddly enough , he bought a round - trip ticket -- an odd choice for a man who planned to blow up his flight .
The flight went from Lagos , Nigeria to Amsterdam .
Why did he purchase the ticket in Ghana ?
No -one has attempted to answer an obvious question :
Where did he put on the PETN - laden underwear -- Ghana or Lagos or Amsterdam ?
If Amsterdam , who was his contact ?
( I very much doubt that PETN is as easy to obtain as pot is in Amsterdam . )
Well , you knew that a link of some sort had to crop up sooner or later .
We can't have a conspiracy theory round - up without mentioning the Israeli security services .
Our reader b , in a comment appended to a previous post , found grounds for suspicion in the fact that Farouk boarded the jet -- with help from a well - attired Indian , or so we 're told -- at Schiphol airport .
The reference goes to the Israelis .
A Google query on " Schiphol Mossad " will turn up a number of interesting stories .
Before proceeding , perhaps we should review an interesting blast from the past , which reveals a little - known aspect of the 2001 " shoe bomber " incident .
The following example of a " controlled " security breach may be relevant to the more recent Christmas attack :
You may also want to read about the strange history of El Al flight 1862 , which crashed in 1992 after taking off from Schipol .
When Reid went on his next fateful trip -- the one where he tried to light his shoe -- he passed through a check from an Israeli - owned security service called ICTS .
ICTS employs a large number of Shin Bet veterans and has strong links to Mossad .
All of which brings us back to Farouk and the Christmas event .
Most of the conspiracy - oriented websites are now claiming that ICTS ran security at Schiphol -- for example , see here .
ICTS has offered this strong denial The ICTS disclaimer offers a startling contrast to this PR announcement from January 14 :
And then we have this announcement ( pdf ) from 2008 : Hm .
Looks to me like we 've caught ICTS in a clear fabrication .
Their denial of involvement with Schiphol should be rated C forApparently , ICTS is attempting to rely on an old dodge :
It was not ICTS but afirm which did business at Schiphol .
On the same company website where ICTS claimed to have nothing to do with Schipol , we read this For further confirmation , see the announcement here ( pdf ) .
Incidentally , ICTS ( through another subsidiary , named Huntleigh ) also runs the security at Detroit airport .
And who runs security at the airport at Lagos International Airport , a.k.a. Murtala Muhammed International Airport , a.k.a. LOS ?
This is where Farouk flew out to Schiphol -- presumably wearing , even then , his PETN briefs .
( Oddly , this airport was modeled after Schiphol . )
Farouk went through two checks ; KLM ( the carrier ) provided the second check , but I do n't know who conducted the first one .
Still another ICTS subsidiary -- MUSC -- provides maritime security services for the Nigerian government .
Nigeria restored relations with Israel in 1992 , after a 19 year break ; some accounts hold that the two governments are now quite close .
I am not attempting to provide a simple one - size - fits - all conspiracy theory to explain all of these anomalies .
Let me repeat :.
Undoubtedly , many of these oddities will soon be explained .
Still , at present , we have some reasonable questions that demand answers .
If the Israeli - run security firm had not denied the undeniable , the stories about that company would have stayed mired within the murky realms of the conspiracy blogs .
But now ...
This granola is a little bit more decadent than the granola I usually make , but it 's really quite a treat .
And all things considering , it 's not that bad for you .
The combination of peanut butter and chocolate is a clear winner , though I am dying to try it with hazelnut or almond butter next time .
This granola is great with any milk - dairy or non dairy .
Chocolate Peanut Butter Granola
2 cups rolled oats
1/2 cup peanut butter
1/2 cup maple syrup
1 tablespoon cocoa
Preheat your oven to 350F .
Spread the oats out in a baking pan .
Mix together the peanut butter , maple syrup , and cocoa .
If the peanut butter is n't blending , microwave the mixture for a minute .
Pour the maple syrup mixture over the oats , and stir well to coat .
Cook for 35 - 45 minutes , stirring every five minutes , until the granola is dry and crunchy .
Watch the granola carefully , because it can burn easily .
Variations :
As I mentioned above , any other nut butter would work well as a substitution .
Let me know if you play around with this one a bit !

New York , December 11 , 2009 — A Russian police officer who fatally shot an online publisher in government custody in 2008 was convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to two years in a low - security prison settlement today , Reuters and other news agencies reported .
The family of the victim , Magomed Yevloyev , told CPJ they would appeal the verdict because their own investigation showed that the officer purposely shot the editor .
Yevloyev , 37 , was publisher of the independent news Web site Ingushetiya , which had heavily criticized authorities in the restive republic of Ingushetia .
Yevloyev was shot in the head in August 2008 , shortly after Interior Ministry officers detained him at the Magas airport and placed him in a police vehicle headed to Nazran .
The Interior Ministry immediately declared the shooting an accident .
Officials alleged that Yevloyev had tried to grab a gun from one of three officers in the police vehicle , causing a second officer ’s gun to fire accidentally .
The fatal shot was fired by officer Ibragim Yevloyev , nephew of then - Ingushetia Interior Minister Musa Medov .
Ibragim Yevloyev , who is not related to the victim , did not attend today ’s hearing in Karabulak City Court , which was denounced as a miscarriage of justice by the victim ’s family and legal representatives .
“ There was no justice served today in court , ” Magomed Gandaur - Egi , a lawyer for the victim ’s family , told CPJ .
The victim ’s father , Yakhya , told the news agency Interfax that “ it was not an accident but a deliberate , planned , and organized murder . ”
CPJ urged the appellate court to order a new investigation .
“ President Dmitry Medvedev ’s promise to solve journalists ’ murders in Russia rings hollow after this verdict , ” said CPJ Deputy Director Robert Mahoney .
“ The Supreme Court of Ingushetia must overturn this ruling on appeal and launch a credible and thorough investigation into the killing of Magomed Yevloyev . ”
The official account of the shooting is riddled with questions and discrepancies , CPJ research shows .
The Ingushetia Supreme Court ruled in January that the editor was detained illegally .
Interior Ministry officers had no warrant for Magomed Yevloyev ’s arrest at the time they took him into custody ; an officer later acknowledged that he fabricated a warrant after the shooting had occurred .
Officers detained Magomed Yevloyev moments after his flight from Moscow had landed .
The editor had shared the flight with Ingushetia President Murat Zyazikov , and the two had reportedly argued on the way .
Ingushetiya , one of the few independent news sources in the tightly controlled republic , had reported on government corruption , human rights abuses , and a string of unsolved disappearances .
It had also called for Zyazikov ’s resignation .
About 20 of the journalist ’s friends and colleagues had been awaiting his arrival at the airport and had witnessed the initial detention , according to CPJ interviews .
One of them , Magomed Khazbiyev , told CPJ in 2008 that Yevloyev was not handcuffed and did not resist arrest .
Khazbiyev and others said they had tried to follow a police convoy but the vehicle carrying the publisher took evasive action .
Investigators failed to take a statement from Medov , the top Interior Ministry official , who was at the airport when the plane arrived and who reportedly approved the arrest , according to CPJ interviews .
Medov did not appear during court proceedings , and has not responded to CPJ inquiries .
Numerous other irregularities occurred from investigation through trial , said Gandaur - Egi , the lawyer for the victim ’s family .
After the Interior Ministry cleared its own officer , he said , top investigators in Moscow rubber - stamped the finding within weeks .
“ Within hours after the murder , Medov issued a report that said Magomed Yevloyev was killed by negligence .
The Investigative Committee accepted this document without questioning , ” Gandaur - Egi told CPJ .
Gandaur - Egi said investigators did not provide the victim ’s family with timely access and information as required by law .
Neither he nor the victim ’s family was invited to the crime scene re-enactment , he said , and they were not allowed to question the defendant in court .
Authorities failed to look into the disappearance of cash and a laptop that the publisher was carrying when he was killed , he said .
Gandaur - Egi said the two other officers present in the police vehicle at the time of the shooting could not provide a detailed description in court , saying they had forgotten the particulars due to stress .
One important witness did not testify at all in court : Dzhanbolat Shankhoyev , a Nazran - based officer .
He had acknowledged in a public statement in February that he had prepared a warrant for Yevloyev after the journalist had already been detained and shot , the independent business weekly Kommersant reported .
An officer who conducted an internal investigation did testify , Gandaur - Egi said .
Officer Salman Belkharoyev testified that Medov had pressured him to call the shooting justified , the lawyer said .
Zyazikov resigned as president in October 2008 and was subsequently named an adviser to President Dmitry Medvedev .
Medov was reassigned within the Interior Ministry , according to news reports .
Ingushetiya continues to publish .
In the months before the killing , authorities had filed more than a dozen lawsuits seeking to close the Web site .
The same month that Yevloyev was shot , the site ’s top editor had fled the country in the face of continuing threats .
CPJ research shows 19 journalists have been murdered in retaliation for their work in Russia since 2000 .
In September , CPJ published an investigative report covering 17 cases , including Yevloyev .
Editor ’s note :
The original text of this alert was modified in paragraph 11 to correct that it was a laptop , not a notebook , that went missing .

Homeopathy : The London Overdose
Simon Singh risks his life for science .
On Saturday morning , a hundred scientists , skeptics and rationalists gathered in Holborn to overdose on homeopathic medicine .
You wo n't be surprised to hear that no - one died , though most had a very pleasant sugar rush .
The overdose , organised by the 10:23 Campaign , set out to prove that homeopathic tablets are nothing more than sugar pills , and that any recovery after taking homeopathy is certainly not due to the contents of the tablets .
What is homeopathic medicine ?
Well , consider this novel cure for insomnia : dilute some caffeine ( stay with us , folks ) , and shake it vigourously against some leather .
Next , dilute that dilution , and shake it again .
Now , do that twenty - eight more times .
You 'll be left with 100 % water ; but as if by magic , the water will remember the caffeine - and the more you dilute it , the stronger the water 's memory gets .
Finally , drip your water onto a sugar tablet - and hey presto , you 've got yourself a homeopathic remedy !
The healing power of homeopathy is pure placebo .
Sadly , that has n't stopped it becoming a multi-million pound business .
The NHS spends £ 4 million a year on homeopathy , and Boots sell homeopathic pills alongside proper medicine , even though they admit there is no evidence to show they work .
The campaign hoped to raise awareness of this , and all the protesters made sure to take Boots own - brand homeopathic tablets .
The protest had support from some prominent personalities .
Simon
Singh gave a rousing speech reminding the campaigners of the dangers of letting people get away with selling sugar pills as medicine ; Evan Harris MP , a firm supporter of evidence - based medicine , talked about the excellent progress of parliamentary select committees in getting homeopaths to explain themselves ; and Dave Gorman said that after taking his overdose of homeopathic arnica , which allegedly cure bruises and aches , he 'll " never bruise again " , challenging anyone to punch him to put this to the test .
Never before have we seen a finer example of science in action .
Why is this campaign important ?.
Simply put , when people take sugar pills instead of life - saving medicine , they die .
The protest was fun , but the message behind the campaign is vitally important .
We must n’t forget that tragedy can befall people who shun evidence - based medicine in favour of unproven alternatives .
With any luck , the 100 % survival rates of the overdosers will go some way to showing people that homeopathic pills really are just sugar .
As the campaign says , " Homeopathy : there 's nothing in it . "

As the media spend the week memorializing Ronald Reagan , journalists are redefining the former president ’s life and accomplishments with a stream of hagiographies that frequently skew the facts and gloss over scandal and criticism .
Reagan ’s Popularity
“ Ronald Reagan was the most popular president ever to leave office , ” explained ABC anchor Elizabeth Vargas ( 6/6/04 ) .
“ His approval ratings were higher than any other at the end of his second term . ”
Though the claim was repeated by many news outlets , it is not true ; Bill Clinton ’s approval ratings when he left office were actually higher than Reagan ’s , at 66 percent versus Reagan ’s 63 percent ( Gallup , 1/10 –14/01 ) .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt also topped Reagan with a 66 percent approval rating at the time of his death in office after three and a half terms .
In general , Reagan ’s popularity during his two terms tends to be overstated .
The Washington Post ‘s lead article on June 6 began by declaring him “ one of the most popular presidents of the 20th Century , ” while ABC ‘s Sam Donaldson announced , “ Through travesty , triumph and tragedy , the president enjoyed unprecedented popularity . ”
The Chicago Tribune ( 6/6/04 ) wrote that “ his popularity with the electorate was deep and personal … rarely did his popularity dip below 50 percent ; it often exceeded 70 percent , an extraordinarily high mark . ”
But a look at Gallup polling data brings a different perspective .
Through most of his presidency , Reagan did not rate much higher than other post - World War II presidents .
And during his first two years , Reagan ’s approval ratings were quite low .
His 52 percent average approval rating for his presidency places him sixth out of the past ten presidents , behind Kennedy ( 70 percent ) , Eisenhower ( 66 percent ) , George H.W. Bush ( 61 percent ) , Clinton ( 55 percent ) , and Johnson ( 55 percent ) .
His popularity frequently dipped below 50 percent during his first term , plummeted to 46 percent during the Iran - Contra scandal , and never exceeded 68 percent .
( By contrast , Clinton ’s maximum approval rating hit 71 percent . )
Some in the media similarly emphasized Reagan ’s likeability .
CBS anchor Bob Schieffer asserted ( 6/6/04 ) , “ You could hate his policies , but it was hard not to like Ronald Reagan . ”
But Reagan ’s “ likeability ” numbers did not score much higher than other modern presidents , including Jimmy Carter .
( For more on Reagan polling myths , see Extra ! , 3–4/89 . )
No Time for Critical Voices
Mainstream media have relied heavily on Republicans and former Reagan officials to tell the story of Reagan and his accomplishments , which results in a decidedly one - sided version of events .
A June 7 article in the New York Times on Reagan ’s impact claimed that Reagan “ was almost always popular and , many now say , usually right . ”
The article stated that “ Reagan lived long enough to enable many of his old lieutenants , and some more dispassionate chroniclers as well , to argue that he had also been right on some of the bigger questions of his time . ”
Six of the eight sources the article quoted were former Reagan staffers or Republicans , one was longtime Reagan devotee Margaret Thatcher , and one was University of Chicago law professor Cass Sunstein , who gave no argument that Reagan was “ right ” about anything .
No other “ dispassionate chroniclers ” were quoted .
Should readers be surprised that Reagan ’s friends and former colleagues still think he was right ?
Television news has displayed an even more pronounced reliance on Reagan ’s Republican admirers .
The Sunday morning shows ( 6/6/04 ) almost exclusively featured Republicans ; former Reagan chief of staff James Baker appeared on all three networks , as well as Fox and CNN .
Fox News Sunday ( 6/6/04 ) featured , in addition to Baker , current national security advisor Condoleezza Rice , former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , and Sheila Tate , former press secretary for Nancy Reagan .
MSNBC ‘s June 6 Hardball program featured Republican Sen. Elizabeth Dole , Republican representatives David Dreier and Chris Cox , and Reagan strategist Richard Wirthlin .
Interviewing Reagan ’s admirers may have provided an intimate view of the former president , but it yielded virtually no acknowledgment of his flaws .
Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig , when questioned by CNN ‘s Anderson Cooper ( 6/6/04 ) to name Reagan ’s greatest weakness or failing , responded , “ I ’m not going to criticize the President .
And even if I wanted to , I would never do it on an occasion such as this .
We should be grateful that the world was a better place because of Ronald Reagan ’s presidency . ”
Even when potentially critical voices were included , the tendency was to soften any disagreements over Reagan ’s policy .
On NPR ‘s Morning Edition ( 6/7/04 ) , Susan Stamberg interviewed Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher along with Democratic strategist Paul Begala .
Clearly , though , this was no time for disagreement , as evidenced by one of Stamberg ’s questions to Begala : “ You once famously said that politics is show business for ugly people .
Ronald Reagan makes a liar out of you .
He was an extremely handsome , attractive man . ”
Begala ’s response : “ Boy , was he . ”
Reagan ’s Legacy
Reagan ’s influence over world politics and the direction of the Republican Party were important aspects of the media ’s Reagan tributes .
But more often than not , the more controversial aspects of Reagan ’s legacy were either downplayed or recast as footnotes .
Time magazine ( 6/14/04 ) cheered that “ the Reagan years were another of those hinges upon which history sometimes turns .
On one side , a wounded but still vigorous liberalism with its faith in government as the answer to almost every question .
On the other , a free market so triumphant — even after the tech bubble burst — that we look first to ‘ growth , ’ not government , to solve most problems . ”
As NBC ‘s John Hockenberry put it ( 6/5/04 ) , “ The Reagan revolution imagined the unimaginable .
When poverty and welfare were at crisis levels in the 1980s , Reagan declared war on government and turned his back on the welfare state . ”
The long - term impact of cuts in social spending , gutted environmental protections and other casualties of Reagan ’s “ war on government ” were relegated to passing mentions .
Reagan ’s fervent support for right - wing governments in Central America was one of the defining foreign policies of his administration , and the fact that death squads associated with those governments murdered tens of thousands of civilians surely must be included in any reckoning of Reagan ’s successes and failures .
But a search of major U.S. newspapers in the Nexis news database turns up the phrase “ death squad ” only five times in connection with Reagan in the days following his death — twice in commentaries ( Philadelphia Inquirer , 6/6/04 ; Chicago Tribune , 6/8/04 ) and twice in letters to the editor ( San Francisco Chronicle , 6/8/04 ; L.A. Times , 6/8/04 ) .
Only one news article found in the search ( L.A. Times , 6/6/04 ) considered the death squads an important enough part of Reagan ’s legacy to be worth mentioning .
The three broadcast networks , CNN and Fox did n’t mention death squads at all , according to Nexis .
Nor were any references found in the transcripts of the broadcast networks to the fact that Reagan ’s policy of supporting Islamicist insurgents against the Soviet - backed government of Afghanistan led to the rise of the Taliban and Al - Qaeda .
The Reagan administration ’s friendly policy towards Saddam Hussein was also a neglected media topic .
During the Reagan years , the U.S. offered significant support to Iraq , including weapons components , military intelligence , and even some of the ingredients for manufacturing biological weapons like anthrax ( Newsweek , 9/23/02 ) .
The rare opportunities for critical reflection about Reagan ’s policies were turned into additional evidence of his strength , as when Time magazine ( 6/14/04 ) suggested , “ Even when his views were most intransigent — when he wondered out loud whether Martin Luther King Jr. was a communist or failed for nearly all of his presidency to speak the word AIDS even once — Reagan gave Reaganism a human face . ”
Time followed that strange assessment with a comment from Bush adviser Karl Rove : “ He made us sunny optimists … .
His was a conservatism of laughter and openness and community . ”
Journalists seemed determined to show that any criticisms of Reagan could be turned upside down .
As Dan Rather explained on CBS ‘s 60 Minutes ( 6/6/04 ) :
The literal - minded were forever troubled by his tendency to sometimes confuse life with the movies .
But he understood , like very few leaders before or since , the power of myth and storytelling .
In his films and his political life , Ronald Reagan stood at the intersection where dreams and reality meet , and with a wink and a one - liner , always held out hope for a happy ending .
Even Reagan ’s contradictions were somehow construed as strong points .
As Time put it ( 6/14/04 ) :
So great was Reagan ’s victory in making his preoccupations into enduring themes of the national conversation that it may not matter that his record did n’t always match his rhetoric .
He insisted , for instance , that a balanced budget was one of his priorities .
But by the time Reagan left office , a combination of lower tax revenues and sharply higher spending for defense had sent the deficit through the roof .
The Iran - Contra scandal , which loomed too large to ignore , was often written off by journalists .
“ As we look back today , it ’s like just a speck in the eight years of his presidency , ” explained CNN ‘s Judy Woodruff ( 6/7/04 ) .
Meet the Press host Tim Russert ( 6/6/04 ) showed a clip of Reagan ’s famous response to the scandal , in which he stated , “ A few months ago , I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages .
My heart and my best intentions still tell me that ’s true .
But the facts and the evidence tell me it is not . ”
Russert described this tortured evasion of culpability as “ very believable . ”
Whatever reporters made of Iran / Contra , though , Reagan ’s triumph over such problems was more important than the incidents themselves .
CBS reporter Anthony Mason ( 6/6/04 ) explained : “ The deficit doubled during the Reagan years .
His second term was scarred by the Iran / Contra scandal , but he never lost that common touch … .
Ronald Reagan had an uncanny ability to make Americans feel good about themselves . ”
That bond with American citizens remained front and center throughout the media .
As CBS anchor Dan Rather put it ( 6/5/04 ) , Reagan
was the great communicator , yes .
But he was also a master at communicating greatness .
He understood that , as he once put it , “ History is a ribbon always unfurling , ” and managed to convey his vision in terms both simple and poetic .
And so he was able to act as a conduit to connect us to who we had been and who we could be .
Reagan and the Media
The overwhelmingly positive coverage of Reagan struck some as a significant change .
As Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz noted ( 6/7/04 ) : “ The uplifting tone with which journalists are eulogizing Ronald Reagan is obscuring a central fact of his presidency :
He had a very contentious relationship with the press . ”
Others would certainly disagree with Kurtz ’s assessment — Mark Hertsgaard ’s 1988 book , On Bended Knee : The Press & the Reagan Presidency , for example , characterizes the press corps as being basically uncritical during the Reagan years .
In any event , it would be hard to argue that current coverage of Reagan carries any lingering traces of that formerly “ contentious ” relationship .
If anything , some reporters now seem to think that the main lesson learned from the Reagan years was not to be critical .
As ABC ‘s Sam Donaldson put it ( 6/4/04 ) , “ Reporters over the years made the mistake of saying , ‘ Well , he made this mistake , he made this mistake .
He got that fact wrong . ’
The American public got it right .
It did n’t matter . ”
Finally , Tom Rosenstiel of the Project for Excellence in Journalism ( USA Today , 6/7/04 ) gave an interesting take on what he acknowledged were “ almost completely uncritical ” media reports on Reagan : “ For networks that are accused of being liberal , this is a way for them to show that they are fair . ”
One would hope that such an overwhelmingly uncritical assessment of important political and historical matters would not meet anyone ’s definition of “ fair ” journalism .
Whatever you thought of the original “ The Karate Kid ” , you ca n’t deny it was a definite crowd - pleaser – especially that final scene .
Now Entertainment
Weekly reports that the upcoming remake , which many have been suspicious of , achieved the second highest test screening score in Sony ’s history .
A score said to be in the ’ 97th percentile ’ ( essentially the entire audience loved it ) .
Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan star in the remake , a film which was on a lot of ‘ most dreaded of 2010 ’ lists before the trailer came out a few weeks ago and surprised many .
Hold your horses though , there ’s a caveat here .
If the new ‘ Kid ’ was # 2 , what scored the highest for Sony ?
2005 ’s tedious Will Smith comedy “ Hitch ” .
It goes to show these scores are useless in determining quality .
What it does mean though are its box - office chances are rosy .
“ Hitch ” opened to $ 370 million worldwide , ‘ Kid ’ wo n’t likely come close but could do far better than many are expecting when it opens June 11th .

What you ’ll learn :
Essential fish picking calisthenics to maximize your potential
Highly effective fish - picking strategies
The ideal way of steaming fish
When I go home to visit my Mom , I always ask for this dish , Chinese Steamed Fish .
Mom lives in Los Angeles , where there is an Asian market on every street corner .
Most have live fish tanks where you can choose which lucky fella gets to come home with you for a dinner date .
Steaming is the purest and the most delicious way to cook fresh fish .
We top it with soy sauce , cilantro , ginger , green onion slivers , and pour sizzling hot peanut oil all over the fish .
You ’ll taste the delicate , sweet flavor of the fish .
“ Pick out your own fish to slaughter ! ? ” you ask , squeamishly ?
Absolutely .
My Asian friends know the routine .
You arrive at the market early in the morning , when you are most alert and the fish are happy , having just eaten their breakfast .
Stand in front of the fish tank .
But hold it .
Before you even start looking at the fish , you must do some simple , but essential calisthenic exercises to maximize your fish - picking - potential .
Chinese Steamed Fish Picking Calisthenics
1 ) First , stand tall , feet shoulder - width apart .
Arms up over head and and stretch leeffffttttt .

Do a little John Travolta move .
This exercise help flex your pointer finger to point out desired fish to your fishmonger as the fish swims around trying to avoid you .
Yes , you ’ll look stupid , but you ’re a foodie and you ’ll do anything for the freshest fish .
Alright .
Now you are ready , my friend .
Chinese Steamed Fish - Picking Strategies
The best way to describe how to pick a good fish is to compare it to picking up a guy at a bar .
Rule # 1 .
Do n’t pick the ones that are passed out at the bar .
The upside down ones are deadbeats .
duh !
Rule # 2
Do n’t pick the super fast with jerky movements either , he ’s way too nervous , excited and will ( ahem ) too early .
The courtship will be over before you even know it and you ’ll be left totally unsatisfied .
Rule # 3
Do n’t pick out the biggest , most muscular fish .
He ’s too busy checking himself out in the reflection of the tank to even notice you anyways .
His muscles are too tough and you ’ll be chewing ’ til next November .
Rule # 4
Go for a fish that is relaxed , laid back , confident and having a good time .
Nice skin , not too flashy , no body piercings and kind eyes .
Because a happy fish is a good eating fish .
All them endorphins in its little body makes his meat sweet .
So , lets say you live in Florida , the sunshine state that is surrounded … not 1 … not 2 … but 3 sides with water that is abundant with seafood ….. but your markets do n’t have live fish tanks and all they sell is defrosted fillets .
No worries .
just use those fillets , but talk to your fishmonger to make sure those fillets have n’t been sitting in the case for days .
You want as fresh as possible … unless you ’re in Florida you ’ll just ask for “ just defrosted ” fillets .
Better yet , see if they have any fillets still frozen .
Look in the freezer case .
Ok , I know , I ’m bitching … but come on Florida – do n’t be squeamish about live fish !!
Print Recipe Chinese Steamed Fish Recipe Servings : Prep Time : Cook Time : A Modern Technique for Restaurant Quality Chinese Steamed Fish
If you 've ever steamed fish Chinese style before or have read about how to steam fish , here is a new technique for you that I 've learnt from my Mom and included a tip from Amy .
You 'll stuff the fish with scallions / ginger / cilantro and you 'll also lay the fish on a bed of the same .
After steaming , traditionally you would just serve the fish with its cooking juices and all of the cooked herbs .
However , the cooking juice tastes very fishy ( not in a good way ) and can be cloudy .
The herbs have lost all of its flavor during the cooking processes and just are n't very pretty to serve .
The secret for restaurant - quality , clean , fresh tasting steamed fish is to serve the fish with fresh herbs and clean sauce .
By far , the easiest way to do this is :
After steaming , discard the cooked herbs and cooking juices in the pan .
In a microwave - safe bowl , add cilantro , chilli , soy , sugar , wine , sesame oil , salt & pepper .
Microwave for 30 seconds to warm it up and release its flavors .
Pour this on top of the cooked , steamed fish .
In a small pan or wok , heat up some cooking oil until smoking hot .
Add scallion and ginger to the hot oil and fry for 10 seconds to " pop " the flavors .
Pour this hot oil over the fish just seconds before serving .
Another secret to restaurant - quality steamed fish is to steam on medium heat .
You want to delicately steam the fish .
A high rolling harsh boil will tear apart the delicate flesh of the fish and finished dish will not look as pretty ( plus you run the risk of over cooking the fish )
Ingredients : 1 pound whole fish ( or fillets 1 " or thicker ) yields the best results
( A)
4 stalks , scallions - cut into 3 " lengths
3 " piece of ginger - slice into " coins "
small bunch of cilantro
1 1/2 tablespoons Shaoxing wine to pour on fish prior to steaming ( or any cooking wine like dry sherry )
salt & pepper
( B)
2 tablespoons rough chopped cilantro
1 teaspoon sesame oil
2 tablespoons soy sauce
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt + 1/4 teaspoon white pepper ( or black pepper if you do n't have white )
fresh chilli - thinly sliced ( optional )
(C )
2 stalks , scallions - cut into 3 " lengths
2 " piece of ginger - finely julienned to the skinniest , thinnest strips you can possibly manage without a microscope
2 tablespoons cooking oil
Directions : Equipment : shallow pan to hold fish & large pot or wok for steaming .
If you do n't have a fancy steamer or steamer insert , take a shallow - ish bowl and invert to use as a stand .
Or ...3 shot glasses inverted .
1 . Clean & Stuff : Clean your fish , pat dry .
Season generously inside and out with salt and pepper .
Take half of ( A ) and stuff inside the fish .
If you are using fillets , skip this .
2 . Make your bed :
Take the other half of ( A ) and lay it in a shallow pan .
If using fillets , just use all of ( A ) for the bed .
Lay the fish on top of the bed .
If fish is too long , cut in half .
Pour 1 1/2 tablespoons
Shaoxing wine on top of the fish .
3 . Steam : Add 2 " of water to your large pot , cover and boil .
When it is boiling , uncover and wipe the inside of the cover clean of any condensation ( all this condensation will drip back down on your fish , diluting the flavor )
Put your fish pan inside , propped up with a small inverted bowl .
Steam the fish on medium ( see below for cooking times ) .
Whole fish 1 lb : check at 12 minutes , add 2 minutes for every 1/2 lb
Fillets 1 " and thicker : check at 10 minutes , add 2 minutes for every 1/ 2 " more thickness
Fillets less than 1 " : check at 7 minutes
Super thin fillets : check at 5 minutes
Check to see if its done at the times indicated .
Poke your chopstick at the flesh near the top fin .
If flesh flakes easily near the top fin , then its done .
If flesh sticks together still , then add 1 - 2 more minutes to cooking time .
For fillets , just gently poke at the flesh in the middle .
Timing really depends on the thickness of your fish .
Also check to make sure you have n't run out of steaming water .
4 . Aromatics : Towards the end of the steaming process , you 'll want to start preparing the aromatics that garnish the finished dish .
Take a microwave - safe bowl , add ( B ) and microwave for 30 seconds .
Set aside .
When fish is done steaming , carefully lift the fish out onto a serving platter , discarding all of the cooked cilantro / ginger / scallions and the fish juice in the pan .
Pour the hot ( B ) over fish .
Now we 'll work with ( C ) :
In a separate pan or wok , heat up cooking oil until you see smoke .
Add the ginger and scallions , fry for 10 seconds to " pop " the flavors .
Pour this cooking oil + herbs over the fish .
You 'll hear a very satisfying sizzle !

Preparation :
Preparing the Spice Mix / Goda or Kala Masala mix :
Heat very little oil in a pan and very lightly fry the ingredients mentioned in the “ Light Fry ” at low heat for a couple of minutes .
Switch off the heat when they get fragrant .
Do take care and watch like a hawk , for they will burn very quick .
Dry roast the coconut and sesame seeds for a couple of minutes , till the coconut is very light brown .
Blend in a spice grinder or coffee grinder all the ingredients of the “ light fry ” and “ dry roast ” in a powder .
Note :
This spice mix is not exactly the kala / goda masala mix .
I did not have all the ingredients that the authentic mix asks for ; this was pretty close .
If you do not have all the ingredients , just skip them .
The taste of the curry might vary a bit but it is still going to be good if not 100 % traditional .
Marinating Chicken : Marinate chicken with yogurt , turmeric , salt , chili powder and spice mix for at least an hour ( I left mine overnight ) .
Cooking the curry : Remove the chicken pieces from the marinade and brown them in the heated oil on both sides .
they should be light brown ; does not need to be evenly brown .
Save the marinade .
Remove the chicken pieces and save the leftover oil .
Making the Sauce / Kolhapuri sauce Heat 3/ 4 cup oil and fry the onions , ginger , garlic , sugar and salt till the onions are brown and starts to caramelize .
Switch off the heat and transfer half of the onion mix from the pan to a blender or food processor along with the fresh cilantro , coconut , tomato paste , water and the left over marinade and blend till smooth .
In the remaining half of the fried onions in the pan , add the chicken and toss them and cook them for about 10 minutes at medium to high heat .
If the spices stick at the bottom of the pan , do not worry .
Just sprinkle some water and scrape it off .
Add half of the mix from the blender to the chicken and the leftover oil from frying the chicken if you have any ) in the pan and stir everything gently .
Cook / simmer for about 10 – 15 minutes at medium to high heat .
When you see the sauce reducing pour out the rest of the blended ingredients in to the pan .
Gently stir everything together for them to combine .
Cover and cook at low to medium heat till the chicken pieces are tender .
Uncover and increase the heat .
Add the coconut milk .
Cook till the oil separates ( you will see the sauce sizzling and bubbling and the little wells of oil on the sides and the top layer ) for about 15 minutes .
There should a considerable amount of sauce / gravy left ; it is going to be a thick sauce which readily coats a spoon .
The flavor of this dish matures with time .
Let it sit overnight if you can before you serve it .
Serve hot with Basmati rice or Indian Flat Breads .
Spicy , robust and delicious .
This is the kind of recipe that will make the aroma waft and dance around your home and linger in air , and the taste that makes you want more and go back and cook it again in a few days time … if you enjoy Indian food and strong flavors , this is for you .

So an SEC whistleblower contacts the agency , and is assured by the enforcement attorney working on JP Morgan that it's a " confidential " investigation .
The attorney then turns around and dimes the guy out to his employers .
Where do the Republicans find these candidates ?
Do they vet them carefully for moral and ethical problems , and then recruit the ones who do n't pass ?
More importantly :
Why did n't the SEC stand up for whistleblowers by throwing the book at this sleazebag ?
Maybe the answer lies in the description of Demos as a " politically wired " Republican attorney :

Last week a student in my MBA - level intermediate - macro seminar raised a provocative question .
We were discussing the various kinds of ( price ) deflation and which kinds , according to Austrians , are benign and accommodate consumer preferences , and which are malignant and conflict with consumer preferences .
In view of the Austrian emphasis on inflationary monetary policy as the primary cause of the business cycle and the current financial crisis in particular , the student asked if Austrians considered any kind of inflation as " good " for the economy .
I gave a short response in the affirmative and then thought about it more over the weekend .
Here is the note on the subject that I wrote up for discussion in class tomorrow .
( The last two paragraphs on free banking were not part of the original note . )
One kind of " good " inflation typically results when innovations and changes occur that permit people to economize on the amount of money they need to hold in their cash balances .
For example , the introduction and increasing availability of credit cards bring about a decrease in the demand for money , which , all other things being equal , causes a general rise in prices .
Credit cards operate as an alternative means of payment for many transactions and therefore reduce the amount of money people need to hold in currency and bank deposits in order to finance their anticipated exchanges at the prevailing level of prices .
These " excess " cash balances produce an increase in the demands for goods , the supplies of which have not increased .
The result is that overall prices rise .
But inflation here performs an important function : it reduces the buying power of the dollar to the point where money no longer is in excess supply , because people are now content to hold the total supply of money in existence in order to finance planned transactions at the new , higher level of prices .
Another way of putting this is that the " real " money supply , that is , its total purchasing power in terms of goods , has been reduced to exactly the level desired by consumers .
What we might call " cash - economizing " inflation tends to occur as a result of any financial innovation , including the invention of money - market mutual funds , ATM machines , PayPal accounts , and so on .
It may also result from organizational or technical innovations in business that promote vertical integration of operations , where capital goods previously exchanged between two independent firms are now produced and employed within the same firm .
Note that cash - economizing inflation is benign precisely because it is an outcome of individuals striving to optimize their property holdings through the voluntary exchange process .
It is also noteworthy that this kind of inflation involves a one - shot increase in prices : once the new payment method or invention becomes broadly adopted , the decline in the demand for money ceases and prices stop rising .
Lastly , inflation caused by people responding to opportunities to economize on their money holdings has no systematic effect on credit markets and the interest rate and therefore does not precipitate the business cycle .
" Note that cash - economizing inflation is benign precisely because it is an outcome of individuals striving to optimize their property holdings through the voluntary exchange process . "
A second type of good inflation is one that occurs as a result of a reduction in the supplies of goods and services caused by natural disasters , the depletion of natural resources , or increases in people 's preferences for leisure ( causing a decline in labor - force participation ) or for present consumer goods ( causing the nonreplacement or " consumption " of capital goods ) .
All of these events bring about , sooner or later , a greater scarcity of exchangeable goods in the economy .
The reduction in the supplies of goods in the market , all other things being constant , including the stock of money , causes an excess demand for goods to emerge .
Overall prices will naturally rise to restore equilibrium in goods ' markets .
This rise in prices both indicates the greater scarcity of available goods and ensures that they are allocated to the uses most highly valued by consumers .
Conversely , it may be said that there is a fall in the " exchange " demand for money , which is constituted by the goods offered for exchange .
The decrease in the demand for money in exchange , with the supply of money unchanged , initially produces a surplus of money , because at the low prices prevailing , the supply of money offered exceeds the supplies of goods brought to market .
Eventually , the buying power of the dollar adjusts downward , goods ' prices are bid up , and all dollars offered are absorbed in exchange for the now - higher - priced goods .
Once again we note that , unlike the ongoing price inflation that is typically caused by central - bank expansion of the money supply , the inflation generated by diminished supplies of goods is a one - shot affair .
Prices stop rising as soon as the supplies of goods and services stop decreasing and stabilize at the lower level consistent with the change in the economic data .
" Scarcity " inflation is thus socially beneficial because it facilitates economic calculation and smoothly operating markets in a situation in which people 's preferences or their production opportunities have undergone a radical change .
History has shown time and again — during wars , revolutions , sieges , and crop failures — that any attempt to repress scarcity inflation via price controls or centralized distribution of necessities results in calculational chaos , widespread poverty , and social disorder .
Our conclusion is , thus , that a rise in general prices driven by the demand for money always improves economic welfare as Austrians understand that term .
In the interest of full disclosure , I note that most modern Austrians who support free banking , while agreeing with me on scarcity inflation , would strongly disagree with me that cash - economizing inflation is benign .
Writers such as Larry White , George Selgin , and Steve Horwitz insist that any change in total spending caused by shifts in the demand for money must be promptly undone by a change in the supply of money in the same direction .
Thus under our current fiat - money system , if financial innovations occur that induce people to reduce their demand for cash balances and to exchange money more rapidly , then according to " free bankers , " the central bank must contract the money supply in order to prevent the increase in prices that corresponds to people 's voluntary choices .
" The free bankers claim to be in favor of a freely competitive monetary system , but presume to know in advance what outcome the entrepreneurs operating in this system will bring about . "
This is a direct implication of the free bankers ' " productivity norm , " according to which the central bank must actively suppress " meaningless " changes in prices .
Meaningless changes in prices include those caused by shifts in what free bankers characterize — misleadingly in my opinion — as " the velocity of money . "
Thus , free bankers become cheerleaders for a monetary deflation engineered by the central bank as a means of stifling a pattern of freely chosen exchanges of property that expresses consumer preferences for higher prices .
The position of free bankers is not only erroneous but paradoxical as well .
They accuse Austrians of the neo–Currency School , created by Mises and Rothbard , of viewing deflation and inflation asymmetrically , favoring deflation while condemning inflation .
But as I tried to demonstrate above , Austrians of the neo–Currency School are perfectly consistent in their attitudes toward rising and falling prices : both " inflation " and " deflation " are benign as long as they are in accord with the voluntarily expressed preferences of consumers .
Not so the free bankers , who claim to be in favor of a freely competitive monetary system , but presume to know in advance what outcome the entrepreneurs operating in this system will bring about , namely , complete stability of a particular macroeconomic variable .
Thus , the real point at issue between the free bankers and their neo–Currency opponents is whether the productivity norm should be invoked to encourage the central bank to use its power to manipulate the money supply in order to stabilize " total spending , " a meaningless , ex post macroaggregate .
The free bankers answer , " Yes . " Neo–Currency School Austrians accept Mises 's dictum that rising and falling prices per se are meaningless in assessing the soundness of a monetary regime .
As Mises wrote ,
Every New Year , I vow to drink more water .

Defense Claims Cannabis Poisoning Just a Joke ( Hash hospitality a prank ) Melbourne Australia Herald Sun 17Dec99 D2 http://www.news.com.au/news_content/state_content/4392027.htm
MELBOURNE , AUSTRALIA --
The lawyer for two men accused of poisoning two LDS missionaries with cookies laced with cannabis ( marijuana ) told the court that the prosecution could n't prove that the cookies had marijuana in them , and even if they did , giving them to the missionaries was an innocent prank .
First Lawyer Justin Hannebery told the court that the missionaries positive test results only proved that the missionaries were exposed to the drug , not that the cookies were the source .
He says that a third roommate of the accused was smoking cannabis , exposing the missionaries to its smoke .
" It does n't have to be the most rational or probable hypothesis to be consistent with innocence , " said Hannebery .
He then said that if the cookies had been laced with cannabis , it was only meant as a practical joke .
But prosecutor Russ Hammill skoffed at the idea that this was only a joke , saying that the men knew the LDS missionaries had n't used cannibis , but they were experienced users themselves .
" They only consumed three cookies themselves and knew that if they had more they would have ended up on the hospital trolley ( gurney ) next to them , " he said .
" They encouraged the victims to have 12 each and did n't stop them .
" This may well have been a joke ... but they certainly foresaw the probable consequences of pushing cookies on religious missionaries . " said Hammill .
While one of the defendants , Douglas James Lynch , 40 , plead guilty to three charges of using , possessing and cultivating cannabis , both he and roommate Alexander McLean , 47 , plead not guilty to seven charges including administering a substance likely to interfere with bodily functions and recklessly causing injury .
Magistrate Margaret Harding is expected to rule in the matter today .
Washington ( CNN ) --
The seizure of the Afghan Taliban 's top military leader in Pakistan represents a turning point in the U.S. - led war against the militants , U.S. officials and analysts said .
The arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar represents the most significant Taliban capture since the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , a senior Obama administration official said Tuesday .
Baradar has been a close associate of Osama bin Laden 's and is seen as the No. 2 figure in the Afghan Taliban , behind Mullah Mohammed Omar .
" If anyone would know where the senior leaders are of al Qaeda and the Taliban , then Baradar is someone who would be privy to that kind of information , " said M.J. Gohel , executive director of the Asia - Pacific Foundation .
It 's " major success for the CIA " and " a major blow for the Taliban , " Gohel said .
The United States has tried to target Baradar for years , a senior U.S. official said .
The arrest also represents a " new level of cooperation " between Pakistani and American forces working to rout the Taliban , said U.S. Sen .
John Kerry , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-author of legislation designed to improve cooperation between Pakistan and the United States .
Described as a savvy and modern military leader , Baradar was arrested in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi several days ago , a senior Pakistani intelligence official said .
The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media .
Baradar is being held in joint custody and investigated by both the CIA and Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence agency , another senior Pakistani source said .
Qari Yousuf Ahmadi , a Taliban spokesman in Afghanistan , denied that Baradar had been captured .
He said Baradar is continuing his operations and is in Afghanistan .
Another Afghan Taliban spokesman , Zabiullah Mujahid , also denied Baradar had been arrested .
He said reports of his arrest are designed to demoralize the Afghan Taliban .
Despite confirmation of the arrest by Pakistani sources , Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said he could not verify reports of the capture .
He also denied reports the CIA and ISI conducted a secret raid that captured Baradar , saying the agencies share intelligence but that the CIA does not conduct raids on Pakistani soil .
Afghanistan Crossroads blog : More on Baradar and the Taliban
Several raids in Karachi last week netted dozens of suspected Afghan militants , and intelligence agencies are in the process of verifying their identities , Malik said .
Baradar 's arrest occurred as some 15,000 Afghan and NATO forces were battling the Taliban in the Marjah region of southern Afghanistan 's Helmand province in the largest NATO offensive since the U.S. - led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 .
It also comes weeks after the CIA ratcheted up its operations against the Taliban in apparent response to a December suicide attack that killed seven CIA officers in eastern Afghanistan .
And the arrest comes amid reports of major successes for the United States in its battle against the Taliban and associated militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Hakimullah Mehsud , died recently after reports that a suspected U.S. drone strike targeted him in January , according to Taliban and Pakistani intelligence sources .
The previous leader of the Pakistani Taliban , Baitullah Mehsud , also died in a suspected U.S. drone strike .
CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen called Baradar 's capture a " huge deal , " saying he is " arguably more important than Mullah Omar from a military point of view , because Mullah Omar really is more of a religious figure than an operational commander of the Taliban . "
" This guy also is the No. 2 political figure in the Taliban .
The fact that he was discovered in Karachi is very significant .
Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan .
It 's a long way from where the war is being fought , " Bergen said Monday on CNN 's " Anderson Cooper 360° . "
The capture " indicates that the Pakistani intelligence services and CIA [ are ] cooperating very closely on a very high - value target . "
A number of high - value targets , including Omar , have moved into Karachi from a region near the Pakistan - Afghanistan border , where the Pakistani military and suspected U.S. drones have battled Taliban militants , a senior U.S. official said .
Bergen said the operation suggests the Pakistanis are willing to move not only against the Pakistani Taliban but also against the Afghan Taliban , which has its headquarters in Pakistan .
Baradar also would have been in regular contact with Omar , Bergen added .
Robin Wright , a fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace , called the move a " huge catch in terms of understanding the organization , " but she also said the " Taliban is in many ways a decentralized force , and it's not necessarily that he is going to be involved in knowing what every single unit on the ground is doing . "
" The critical issue is how much will he talk and provide information on where other assets are , potentially where the Taliban in Pakistan are , and , of course , the United States would love to know where Osama bin Laden himself is , " Wright said on " AC 360 . "
Wright also raised the issue of what will happen to Baradar when the interrogation concludes .
" One of the big questions , of course , is , what are they going to do with him ? "
Wright asked .
" They can't take him to Guantanamo Bay .
Are the Pakistanis going to prosecute him ? "
According to Interpol , Baradar was born in 1968 in Weetmak village in the Dehrwood District of Uruzgan province in southern Afghanistan .
Bergen said Baradar and Omar run the Quetta Shura , which operates in southern Afghanistan .
" In terms of the information about the southern Afghanistan operations of the Taliban , this guy is potentially a gold mine , " Bergen said .
" I suspect he 's not being read his Miranda rights by these Pakistani people who are interrogating him . "
Muhammad Amir Rana , director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies , a Pakistani think tank , called Baradar " basically the de facto leader " of the Taliban .
" With Mullah Omar staying out of the scene , Baradar was running the operations of the Taliban . "
Baradar and Omar " started the Taliban together .
He was in the movement since the very beginning , " Rana said .
" He is a very skilled military tactician .
When the Taliban were in government in Afghanistan , he was the supreme commander of the army and was heading the charge against the Northern Alliance holdouts at that point in time . "
Rana said the setback is significant because Baradar was directing the Taliban 's activities in Afghanistan at the time of his arrest .
" His capture would be a severe blow to the Taliban morale at a time when the operation in the Helmand province is under way . "
Rana said Baradar and Afghan President Hamid Karzai hail from the same Popalzai tribe .
Karzai has talked about reaching out to some Taliban members , and a Newsweek profile of Baradar last year said that " Baradar once authorized a Taliban delegation that approached Karzai with a peace offer " and that he approved peace feelers to Karzai 's brother .
Those efforts did n't go anywhere , the magazine said .
Reva Bhalla , director of analysis at the Stratfor think tank , said Baradar has been representing Omar at some of the peace talks going on behind the scenes with the Saudis and describes his capture as a big catch .
Bhalla said the Pakistanis did n't do this for free ; they want concessions from the United States , and it's a shift in the strategy on how it 's dealing with the Afghan Taliban in its own territory .
The Pakistanis have launched offensives against the Pakistani Taliban , and now the move indicates they might plan to get tough on the Afghan Taliban .
" It 's not like you have one guy , and that immediately opens the door to everyone else .
It 's hard to believe that this will lead to this huge intelligence coup .
But if the Pakistanis are shifting their mode of cooperation , that is significant . "
CNN 's Ed Henry , Richard Greene , Kiran Khalid , Barbara Starr and Joe Sterling contributed to this report .
About three years ago , one of the most notorious online message board communities decided to create an unusual video game .
It would be a Japanese - style erotic dating simulator starring girls with disabilities , a topic not unfamiliar to the 4 chan group .
Advertisement
The genesis of Katawa Shoujo , an erotic visual novel set on a private campus for disabled high schoolers , can actually be traced back to a phenomenon that began several years ago on the 4 chan /b/ board , where posters enjoy some of the Internet 's strangest images and subject matter under cover of anonymity .
What started then , a seemingly sexualized interest in disabled girls by a fervent online community , could have just been twisted or shocking , as could the game that seemed to emerge from that interest .
But what really happened involved more sadness and sentimentality than one might expect .
Advertisement
In 2006 , stories began appearing from a poster claiming to be a male nurse who had just received as a patient a half - Japanese seven - year - old girl missing an eye and all her limbs save one arm , injuries from a car crash that had also left her orphaned .
The poster seemed aware that this situation would entertain the board users , an anonymous collective notorious for their often - shocking culture of extreme imagery and offensive humor .
As one might expect of this group , the board users quickly made an occasion for pedophilic jokes and snark about the child 's injuries .
Less expected was the genuine sentiment that emerged as more stories and updates on the tragic patient from the ostensible nurse began to appear .

The story may not even have been true .
At first , the board users were as interested in attempting to verify whether the poster , whom they dubbed " Nurse - kun , " and his patient , to whom they widely referred as " ampu- chan , " were real based on scant details .
Eventually , however , many stopped being concerned with verity as they became immersed in the updates on the child 's difficulty coping as she recovered in the care center .
Readers were captivated by glimmers of positivity – such as Nurse - kun 's stories of the girl learning to play DS one - handed with her nurse 's help .
They became indignant on the child 's behalf when she was the victim of a racist rant from an elderly World War II veteran receiving care in the same center .
They closely followed the Nurse 's growing investment in her well - being – which , despite the initial joke , he maintained was non-sexual .
If the posts are to be believed , Nurse - kun ultimately succeeded in adopting the orphan whose plight had touched him so deeply , and then stopped writing .

The board users never stopped making sexual jokes .
They were accustomed to the puerile body forms common in anime and gaming and to expressing themselves within an anonymous internet culture that thrives on extremes .
It 's clear at least some of them found , or pretended to find , an element of the erotic in the vulnerability of the amputee child .
But the nurse 's story certainly had its sincere followers , those who claimed to be moved and who offered well - wishes .
They pressed for contact information so that they could send donations and gifts ( the nurse understandably declined ) .
The reason was probably muddled and a bit backward , but still the " saga of Nurse - kun " had struck a chord .

" Disability Girls "
4 chan's /b/ board and the anime - focused / a/ board consider themselves separate culturally , although there 's plenty of obvious overlap .
Both boards saw a major surge of interest in artwork of injured girls around the time of the " Nurse - kun " saga , although " wheelchair girls " have been something of a trope in spheres of anime and gaming for some time – and the image of a bandaged and eye - patched " Neon Genesis Evangelion star Rei Ayanami is practically iconic to anime fans .
Advertisement
The boards began more regularly spawning fetish threads devoted to eroticizing girls and women with prosthetics and eye - patches , complete with glib text about " damaged goods " or " ampu-chans . "
But it was a single image on the /a/ board that sparked the idea for a gaming project : a sketch by a doujin artist called RAITA proposing several characters for a fictional dating game based on disabled Japanese schoolgirls .
The board 's anonymous users wanted the RAITA - inspired game concept to be real so badly that they decided to make it themselves .
It 's surprising on its own that there is such a polished result , but maybe it should n't be ; despite being entirely anonymous and dispersed all over the Western world , 4 chan users have mounted highly effective group efforts in the past , like making sure founder Christopher " moot " Poole was crowned Time Magazine 's Most Influential Person Of The Year in 2008 , or launching several widely - documented protests against Scientology .

Now , the society widely reputed as the internet 's strangest , saddest shut-ins has managed another major feat : since late in 2007 , they 've assembled themselves as an international team of amateur game developers and producing a highly - polished demo .
The project , still in progress , is called Katawa Shoujo , or " Disability Girls " , and is a visual romance novel in the Japanese eroge mold – an interactive story with branching plot arcs depending on player choices .

What It's About
As with any title in the genre , the Katawa Shoujo player must choose whom to pursue from among several female characters within the story .
Although the demo , the first version of which was released in April 2009 , does n't contain any sexual content , the creators confirm on their blog that it will become part of the game further down the line .
Erotic gaming — Eroge — is not so left - of - center in and of itself , but Katawa Shoujo is unique in that all the major characters are physically disfigured or disabled .
Advertisement
The player character is a young male high schooler named Hisao , who after spending most of his life without medical incident , is revealed to have a dangerous heart condition .
It 's a stark change in his formerly healthy life when he must start taking a daily litany of medications .
He also has to transfer to a school for students with varying special needs and a full - time nursing staff on site .
There , he meets five different potential romantic partners among his classmates : Shizune , who is deaf and mute ; Hanako , whose face was burned in a childhood tragedy ; Emi , whose legs are amputated below the knee ; Lilly , who is blind , and Rin , who lost both her arms to a birth defect .
More interesting than the quality of the fan - made game — which in terms of its looks and the depth of its writing can rival commercial titles in Japan – is its sincerity .
4 chan users may be a perverted collective , and the way in which they objectify a wide range of people from the safety of anonymity can be shocking to many .
But unlike the threads on the message boards , Katawa Shoujo is , perhaps against all odds , deeply respectful of its subject matter .
Advertisement
The Sexualization Of Empathy ?
The focus seems to remain on the personalities of the girls in the story and the way they cope with their unique challenges , rather than lavishing unnecessarily on their disabilities .
Judging by the demo , the theme is Hisao 's struggle to accept his condition , and the ways relationships with his disabled classmates help him accept himself .
That level of sincerity , or at least the aim at it , is not uncommon in visual novels , although attention to narrative does n't usually satisfy critics of the erotic material .

Another better - known eroge that combines the sincere with the unsettling is the well - known Kana : Little Sister , which sexualizes the relationship that develops between a young girl and her brother as she battles a kidney disease that appears certain to be fatal .
Kana : Little Sister was widely received by fans as poignant and emotionally rich ; from a critical standpoint , I agreed .
As Katawa Shoujo has some things tonally in common with Kana , one could theorize that some eroge games fixate on morbidity in order to emphasize the fragility of life .
Acts of sexuality could be seen as an affirmation of life , and the presence of illness or damage in eroge becomes a device to bestow gravitas on sexual narratives .
The fetishization of medical conditions in teenage girls , as seen in Katawa Shoujo , may be a very extreme way to evoke emotion , to trigger empathy of the same breed the users felt for Nurse - kun 's young patient .
Advertisement
But perhaps those who become accustomed to a wholly anonymous culture of alternately sexualizing and mocking everything need extremes to be engaged .
" I think it 's rare to find a 4 channer who is completely emotionless , a true ‘ internet hate machine ' as they say , " says ‘ W.T. Snacks , ' a 4 chan user and a former administrator of the site until 2005 .
" They just put on a façade with their anonymity , " he adds .
" Sexuality is totally overblown in that culture , but it's all fake , " says Snacks .
By his estimation , the sexualization of anything and everything – including empathy – is simply a mode of expression on the boards that bears little relation to actual human interaction .
And in many cases , the most vocal and devoted users of 4 chan are those who struggle socially in their offline lives , says Snacks .
As a site admin and friend of moot , he received a high volume of attention from the community and cites personal experience .

Perhaps in these fictional girls facing painful challenges , the legion of Anonymous users sees people with genuine disability .
They see real setbacks more serious than the simple social aversion that keeps them hiding behind crude image - board humor .
Perhaps they experience emotional and sexual desire for these characters because of either the desire to play a protector to them as " Nurse - kun " does , or the desire to learn from their strength , as Hisao does in Katawa Shoujo .
The amateur collective developing Katawa Shoujo now calls itself 4LS , or Four - Leaf Studios .
The developers aim to identify themselves as an entity not dependent on 4 chan nor associated with it by necessity .
Still , the studio name remains a nod to its 4 chan heritage and the culture that inspired the game 's creation .

But though the existence of Katawa Shoujo is comprehensible – even worthy of praise , if only for its bootstrapping origins and high quality – does that make a dating game about disabled girls " okay ? "
A Gamer's View
Alex Bannister is a lifelong gamer who was born without a left hand .
I explained to him Katawa Shoujo 's premise and showed him several gameplay videos to see how he reacted to its portrayals .
" It is always nice to see disabled people , whether they are deaf or have no legs , as the focus of a love interest , " he says , although he admits he finds the idea of fetishizing disability to be " creepy . "
Advertisement
" I think it ultimately comes down to if the protagonist falls for these girls because of their disability or falls for them and they just happen to have whatever condition they have , " he says .
Bannister hopes that as Katawa Shoujo progresses , the developers will explore the relationship difficulties that can arise because of a disability .
It would be a chance to show people that " no matter if a person has a disability they still need love , possibly more so than a non-disabled person due to the revulsion that a lot of people subconsciously have . "
" Even if this game ends up being some twisted view of having a disability , there is always hope that it may somehow inspire others to make games with disabled characters playing a prominent role , like Joker in Mass Effect , " he suggests .

As with any game , whether the material is appealing or repellent , and whether its aims are tender or horrific , depends to some extent on one 's own personal opinion .
But it 's clear that this polished , surprisingly compassionate and complex love letter to disabled girls and the strange community that idealizes them is far more nuanced and thought - provoking than one would ever expect .

Poof : Another 800,000 jobs disappear
Since April 2008 , the Labor Department estimated that business openings created thousands of more jobs than were lost from employers closing in every month but one .
But those gains may end up being a mirage .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As bad as the government 's jobs readings numbers have been during the Great Recession , we 'll soon find out the real situation likely was worse .
Much worse .
Job losses during the recession may have been underestimated by close to a million jobs .
So instead of employers cutting just over 7 million jobs from their payrolls since the economic downturn began in December 2007 , it 's expected that the Labor Department 's new estimate will be a loss of 8 million jobs .
" It 's an enormous understatement of the severity of the crisis , " said Heidi Shierholz , labor economist with the Economic Policy Institute , a union - supported think tank .
" It confirms that things were actually worse on the ground than what the reports suggested . "
The new reading will come when the economists at the department 's Bureau of Labor Statistics release their annual revision of U.S. payrolls from April 2008 through March of 2009 Friday , using data that was n't available as the monthly readings were being estimated and reported .
Typically the revision results in only a slight change in the previous estimate -- about 0.1 % to 0.2 % of the total number of jobs .
But there was nothing typical about the twelve month stretch that ended last March .
That period included the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers , the seizing up of financial markets and the U.S. economy toppling close to the brink of another depression .
The government 's current readings show that 4.8 million jobs were lost in those twelve months , more than twice the jobs lost during any comparable April - March period going back to 1939 , when the numbers first started to be compiled .
But the department has already given a preliminary look at this Friday 's revision , and it says it believes it will show 824,000 fewer workers on payrolls than the current estimates .
That would be the biggest downward revision in the 30 years for which comparisons of those adjustments is possible .
" There 's certainly a disconnect between economists like myself who say the recession ended in May or June and the person on the street who says the recession has n't ended , " said John Canally , economist LPL Financial .
" This report is only going to widen that gap . "
Canally said the big revision is one reason that it 's difficult to estimate what Friday 's report will show about the labor market in January , or how investors will react to the report .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com are forecasting a net gain of 13,000 jobs in January , following a loss of 85,000 jobs in December .
The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 10 % .
Economists say it should n't be a surprise that there is such a big revision this time , given the severity of the economic downturn .
" Most of the time it 's reasonably accurate .
But when there are very sharp changes in the economy , they tend to miss and it becomes a big problem , " said Dean Baker , co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
The problem is that BLS models appear to have grossly overestimated the number of new businesses that opened during the recession .
The payroll number is created through a monthly survey of employers , but that survey misses employers who start a business during the course of the year , as well as those who have gone out of business .
So every month BLS uses what is known as a birth - death adjustment to estimate the number of jobs created or lost from that turnover in business .
During the April 2008 - March 2009 period , that adjustment added jobs to the overall payroll number in 11 of the 12 months , resulting in a net gain of 717,000 jobs .
" When the numbers were coming out , the idea that we had a significant number of businesses being created did n't make sense , " said Baker .
There is a concern that this problem did n't end in March of 2009 .
In fact , the adjustment added even more jobs -- 990,000 -- in the nine months reported since then .
So another big revision in the payroll numbers could be looming a year from now .
That means this Friday 's report should give pause to anyone who is depending on the official numbers to signal real improvement in the economy .
" The numbers might be showing some pick - up in hiring , but I have n't seen much evidence of it , " said Mark Vitner , senior economist with Wells Fargo Securities .
This Perler piece comes way of my inbox .
Artist Brandy Cooke ( Pixel Me This , on deviantART ) used glow in the dark beads for the moon and to highlight the clouds .
Looks fantastic .
David Rosenberg had another good report on Friday trashing the jobs numbers as I and others did .
He also had some choice commentary on investor complacency .
Please consider Snack with Dave .
INVESTOR COMPLACENCY RUNNING HIGH
According to Investors Intelligence , there are now three times as many bulls as there are bears .
Almost everyone is a performance chaser .
Market Vane sentiment on equities has firmed to 57 % , higher than it was in September 2007 when the market was beginning to crest .
We did n’t see a number this strong in the last cycle until September 2003 when the recession was already two year ’s behind us .
By way of comparison , at the March lows , it was sitting at 32 .
Not one of the 12 seers polled by Bloomberg sees a down - market for 2010 .
The median increase in the S&P 500 is +11 % .
The VIX is down to 19 , right where it was at the market peaks back in October 2007 .
The S&P 500 dividend yield is back below 2 % for the first time in over two years .
Corporate bond spreads and CDS credit default swaps have collapsed to levels not seen since two years ago .
Based on the Shiller normalized P/E ratio , which is based on the 10 - year trend in real corporate earnings , the S&P 500 is trading with a 20 x multiple versus the long - run average ( back to 1881 ) of 16 x .
This market , in other words , is more overvalued now ( 25 % ) than it was in heading into October 1987 .
To be sure , the average ‘ overvaluation gap ’ at a market peak is 50 % so the argument can certainly be made that the market can go even higher from here until it rolls over .
That may well be the case .
But investors should be aware that at this stage , they are buying into a very expensive market and the ability to time the exit strategy is more than just an art .
Those buying stocks in hopes of catching a classic blow - off to a bubble peak — remember , this market is already 25 % overvalued based on the most tried , tested and true valuation metric .
MORE COMMENTS ON MARKET VALUATION
We should add here that on a Shiller real 10 - year “ normalized ” earnings basis , the S&P 500 is now trading at 20x , which is 25 % above the historical average of 16 x .
This is the same level of overvaluation heading into October 1987 , though at the bubble peak in October 2007 , the overvaluation gap was 70 % .
At the average of prior market peaks , the extent of the overvaluation is 50 % .
We are not saying that equities as an asset class is in a bubble but they certainly have moved to an overvalued extreme .
Moreover , as we have pointed out recently , what is “ normal ” is that every percentage point of nominal GDP growth translates into 2.5 percentage points of profits growth .
Most economic forecasters see nominal GDP growth at 4 % for this year .
But strategists see , on average , 36 % profit growth .
But that 4 % growth in nominal GDP is only enough to boost profits by 10 % , if the normal relationship holds up .
To see such low nominal growth and such strong profit growth is a 1 - in - 50 event .
Maybe the economist and strategist at the Wall Street research houses should sit down with each other .
We are labeled as being “ bearish ” because we see profit growth coming in at +10 % for the coming year .
That is hardly bearish .
On average , profits in any given year typically rise 7 % .
The challenge is what is currently being discounted .
Market participants seem to agree that we will see something close to $ 77 of operating EPS this year .
It is fascinating that this precisely what the consensus view was this time last year for 2009 , and what we will get is something close to $ 56 .
Nice call .
All the consensus seemed to do is just fast - forward that projection into 2010 — what skated the market onside last year was the surge in the P/E multiple that occurred alongside a halving of the VIX index to 20 … is it going to go 10 in 2010 ?.
That would be a 36 % increase from the 2009 level .
Never before — never — have we seen a 4 % nominal GDP performance translate into anything remotely close to a 30 % earnings profile , let alone a figure higher than that .
There was a time when our forecast of $ 62 on operating EPS would have been viewed as wildly bullish but that was at least six months ago .
But you know a lot of good news is priced into the equity market when an 11 % profit growth forecast is considered as being outright negative .
In January and March 2009 , astronomers using NASA 's Hubble Space Telescope took advantage of a rare opportunity to record Saturn when its rings were edge - on , resulting in a unique movie featuring the nearly symmetrical light show at both of the giant planet 's poles .
It takes Saturn almost thirty years to orbit the Sun , with the opportunity to image both of its poles occurring only twice during that time .
The 2009 Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys data used in this movie have allowed astronomers to monitor the behavior of Saturn 's poles in the same shot over a sustained period of time and to analyze the planet 's northern and southern lights simultaneously .
UPDATED : Snow removal workers threatened in Prince George 's , official says
County drivers working to plow the roads in Prince George 's County were accosted Thursday around 10 a.m. by several residents , who told them that if their streets did n't get plowed they were going to " throw them out of their trucks and beat them up , " said Susan Hubbard , spokeswoman for the county 's Department of Public Works and Transportation .
The incident happened in the southern part of the county , outside the Beltway , but Hubbard declined to name a specific neighborhood .
She said police were notified and have responded to the area to make their presence known , though Hubbard did not believe any arrests were made .
A call to county police officials for more information was not immediately returned .
" We had reports that three or four of the drivers in this one particular area , " were threatened , Hubbard said .
" It 's ridiculous .
... Men and women are working as hard as they possibly can .
... I understand people are frustrated .
...
It 's not just here in Prince George 's County , it is everywhere .
... Obviously we know we have work to do and we 're trying to just as hard as we can .
We want to go home . "
UPDATE : Prince George 's County police did indeed respond to a call of a threatened plow truck driver this morning in the 5600 block of Devon Court in Camp Springs , a county police spokeswoman confirmed .
Lt. Tammy Sparkman said the driver called in the complaint to the county 's command center , which in turn forwarded the message to police .
" When we got on the scene the snow truck driver was n't there , " Sparkman said .
" We spoke to the alleged suspect , and he was upset because his street was not plowed at the time . "
Another county official said earlier that several truck drivers were threatened , but police only received a call about one driver , Sparkman said .
Sparkman said the man did not admit to making threats , and there were no arrests or injuries .
Police " stayed behind for a little while to make sure everything was OK , " she said .
" Cabin fever , " she added .

The Viking landers carried four instruments designed to search for signs of Martian life : a gas chromatograph / mass spectrometer , as well as experiments for gas exchange , labeled release , and pyrolytic release .
The iguanas of the Galapagos Islands have evolved manyunique characteristics due to their isolation from mainland iguanas .
Becausethey can't swim long distances , biologists believe that the first Galapagosiguanas arrived on natural rafts made from vegetation .
The same thing may have happened across the ocean of space .
Some researchers speculate that lifeon Mars ?
if there is any ?
may be composed of " island species " that were carried away from Earth on interplanetary meteorites .
Or perhaps both planets were seededby life from an even more distant " mainland . "
" Earth may not be the center of the DNA - baseduniverse , " says Gary Ruvkun , professor of genetics at Harvard MedicalSchool and Massachusetts General Hospital .
The idea is n't too crazy .
We already have evidence that somebiologically important molecules , such as the ingredients for amino acids , aredelivered by comets .
And we know that around 3.5 billion years ago , meteoriteimpacts often kicked up rocks from the Earth 's surface and launched them intospace .
Microbes and / or bio-molecules may have hitched a ride on onethese cosmic " rafts . "
To test this theory ?
called panspermia ?
Ruvkun and his colleagues have started a project called the Search forExtraterrestrial Genomes ( SETG , as a play on SETI ) .
They are putting togetheran instrument that could go to Mars and search soil or ice samples for thepresence of DNA .
If the device finds any , it could then analyze the geneticcode to see if the " Martians " are related to us .
A SETG prototype will have its first field test this year with funding from NASA 's AstrobiologyScience and Technology Instrument Development program .
DNA detection
Some argue that it is too soon to be thinking about DNA onMars .
" If there were other signs of life , more specificallybiomass , I would applaud DNA analysis , " says Norman Pace of the Universityof Colorado , Boulder .
" Without even trace target biomass , talking aboutDNA sequences seems premature to me . "
But Ruvkun argues that his team 's technique can detect asingle DNA molecule in a sample , whereas other tests for biology ?
such asidentifying chemical constituents with mass spectrometry ?
are not nearly assensitive .
" It 's very hard to detect a single molecule withchemical analysis , " concurs Harry Noller from the University of Californiaat Santa Cruz .
" But you can uniquely amplify DNA , " so that its signalclearly stands out .?
Immutable DNA
In order to amplify small traces of potential alien DNA , Ruvkun and his collaborators have looked for a stretch of DNA that would likelybe conserved in both Martians and Earthlings .
They believe this common thread should be in the 16 Sribosomal RNA gene , which is vital to the protein - making process in cells .
Thisgene has regions of its sequence that have barely changed over billions ofyears of evolution .
In fact , short segments in the 16S ribosomal RNA sequenceare exactly identical in more than 100,000 species that have so far had theirribosome genes analyzed .
" There 's no way to have a mutation here and live totell about it , " says Noller , who is not part of the SETG team .
As a consequence , any Martians that share our geneticheritage will presumably carry the 16S ribosomal RNA gene with the sameconserved pieces that all of us Earthlings have .
A primer for life
The proposed strategy is for the SETG instrument to receivea Martian sample and add small extracts from the 16S ribosomal RNA gene as " primers " for DNA replication .
If the sample contains DNA and if somepart of that DNA 's genetic code matches the primer 's , then a suite of chemicalreactions will produce a million or so copies of the sample 's DNA .
The amplified DNA can be detected with special markers andpart of its code can be sequenced in order to identify what sort of life - formis the owner of this DNA .??
If the sample were contaminated by Earthling DNA , then theSETG researchers should be able to recognize signatures in the sequenced codethat will pinpoint whether the contamination comes from a human or a bacteriaor something else familiar to us .
But if nothing on Earth matches the observed sequence , Ruvkun and his colleagues will claim to have found our long - lost Martiancousins .
Ruvkun and his colleagues have built a prototype of theirDNA analyzer and are in the midst of calibrating it .
The team will travel toArgentina 's Copahue Volcano , which is considered to be one of the mostMars - like environments on Earth .
There , they will test whether the prototypecan sequence the DNA of some of the hearty microbes that live in the acidicrunoff from the volcano .
Millions of Old Tires Spark Recycling Frenzy
January 15th , 2010 by Tina Casey
It ’s like finding money on the street : the average tire contains the same energy as seven gallons of oil , and it has a heat content up to 16 % higher than coal .
That ’s one reason why tire recycling is starting to catch on in a big way .
It ’s finally starting to put a dent in the notorious tire dumps in the U.S. , many which are illegal .
[ social_buttons ]
Large scale tire recycling mainly consists of chipping or crumbing the tire so the rubber can be used in highway surfaces , or burned to provide power for manufacturing .
Whole tires are also used in civil engineering projects .
But the future of tire recycling may belong to a slew of companies that are coming up with new ways to recover more valuable resources from the mountains of “ black gold ” that dot the U.S. landscape .
InfoSpi Inc. and Tire - to - Oil Recycling
InfoSpi ’s contribution to tire recycling is an ambitious plan .
The company expects to build up to ten “ Tire to Oil ” recycling facilities that will recover practically all of the oil in a tire , along with steel and carbon black .
The company has just announced that its first plant should be up and running at Pompano Beach , Florida early in 2011 .
The carbon black angle is especially significant from a recycling point of view , because of its potential for reuse .
Carbon black is used to reinforce rubber products ( including tires ) , and it is also used in paints , inks , toner , and the like .
Carbon black is a high value product and the U.S. EPA has been actively soliciting research into cost - effective ways to recover carbon black from recycled tires .
More Products from Recycled Tires
Magnum D’Or is another company digging deep into the nation ’s tire dumps .
It is specializing in recycling tire crumb into a high quality product that can be used to manufacture new tires .
PMGI / Productive Recycling is recycling scrap tire with concrete to form blocks that can be used in wetlands reconstruction and other environmental projects .
Meanwhile , Carbolytic Materials Co. L.L.C. recently opened a facility that will recycle tires into a “ green ” carbon black , which can be used in hoses , gaskets , roofing , and other materials .
The Growing Mountain of Tires
One reason why more companies are becoming more comfortable investing in tire recycling is the fact that used tires are a ubiquitous , seemingly endless resource stream in the U.S.
It ’s also a resource that is bound to grow as the U.S. car driving population grows .
The introduction of inexpensive electric cars in the near future could also lead to an increase in rate of car ownership , and consequently a greater volume of tires in the recycling stream .
The introduction of alternative “ green tire ” products could also provide additional revenue opportunities for recycling plants that can adapt to new materials .

A San Carlos woman has been sentenced to more than two years in federal prison for stealing more than $ 240,000 from her company 's retirement plan .
Cynthia Curran , 54 , must spend 30 months behind bars and pay full restitution for stealing from Barrington Systems ' 401 ( k ) over a nine - year period , U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton said during a hearing this week in Oakland .
Curran pleaded guilty last year to two counts of theft from an employee benefit plan and two counts of making a false statement .
From 1997 to 2006 , Curran misappropriated $ 241,208 in employee contributions and vested employer contributions for her own use while she was vice president of the company and trustee of its 401 ( k ) plan , authorities said .
The company , which she founded with her husband , developed software for climate - control systems until it went out of business in 2006 .
Investigators at the U.S. Department of Labor learned of the crime after employees who were laid off by the company were unable to recover their retirement accounts because their contributions had been stolen .
Curran lied to department investigators about the balance in the 401 ( k ) account to cover up her theft , authorities said .
She also suggested that computer hackers may have stolen the money , which Assistant U.S. Attorney Owen Martikan wrote in a sentencing memorandum was " implausible . "
" The undisputed evidence shows that no one else but Curran had access to that money , " Martikan wrote .

Health and Nutritional Benefits from Coconut Oil : An Important Functional Food for the 21st Century
Presented at the AVOC Lauric Oils Symposium , Ho Chi Min City , Vietnam , 25 April 1996
Abstract
Coconut oil has a unique role in the diet as an important physiologically functional food .
The health and nutritional benefits that can be derived from consuming coconut oil have been recognized in many parts of the world for centuries .
Although the advantage of regular consumption of coconut oil has been underappreciated by the consumer and producer alike for the recent two or three decades , its unique benefits should be compelling for the health minded consumer of today .
A review of the diet / heart disease literature relevant to coconut oil clearly indicates that coconut oil is at worst neutral with respect to atherogenicity of fats and oils and , in fact , is likely to be a beneficial oil for prevention and treatment of some heart disease .
Additionally , coconut oil provides a source of antimicrobial lipid for individuals with compromised immune systems and is a nonpromoting fat with respect to chemical carcinogenesis .
I. Introduction
Mr. Chairman and members of the ASEAN Vegetable Oils Club , I would like to thank you for inviting me to participate in this Lauric Oils Symposium .
I am pleased to have the opportunity to review with you some information that I hope will help redress some of the anti-tropical oils rhetoric that has been so troublesome to your industry .
I will be covering two important areas in my presentation .
In the first part , I would like to review the history of the major health challenge facing coconut oil today .
This challenge is based on a supposed negative role played by saturated fat in heart disease .
I hope to dispel any acceptance of this notion with the information I will present to you today .
I will show you how both animal studies and human studies have exonerated coconut oil of causing the problem .
In the second part of my talk I will suggest some new directions where important positive health benefits are seen for coconut oil .
These benefits stem from coconut oil ’s use as a food with major antimicrobial and anticancer benefits .
I will present to you some of the rationale for this effect and some of the supporting literature .
The health and nutritional benefits derived from coconut oil are unique and compelling .
Although the baker and food processor have recognized the functional advantages of coconut oil in their industries , over most competing oils , for many years , I believe these benefits are underappreciated today by both the producer and the consumer .
It is time to educate and reeducate all t hose who harbor this misinformation .
Historically , coconuts and their extracted oil have served man as important foods for thousands of years .
The use of coconut oil as a shortening was advertised in the United States in popular cookbooks at the end of the 19th century .
Both the health - promoting attributes of coconut oil and those functional properties useful to the homemaker were recognized 100 years ago .
These same attributes , in addition to some newly discovered ones , should be of great interest to both the producing countries as well as the consuming countries .
II .
Origins of the Diet / Heart Hypothesis
Although popular literature of epidemiological studies usually attribute an increased risk of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) to elevated levels of serum cholesterol , which in turn are thought to derive from a dietary intake of saturated fats and cholesterol .
But , saturated fats may be considered a major culprit for CHD only if the links between serum cholesterol and CHD , and between saturated fat and serum cholesterol are each firmly established .
Decades of large - scale tests and conclusions therefrom have purported to establish the first link .
In fact , this relationship has reached the level of dogma .
Through the years metabolic ward and animal studies have claimed that dietary saturated fats increase serum cholesterol levels , thereby supposedly establishing the second link .
But the scientific basis for these relationships has now been challenged as resulting from large - scale misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the data .
( Enig 1991 , Mann 1991 , Smith 1991 , Ravnskov 1995 )
Ancel Keys is largely responsible for starting the anti-saturated fat agenda in the United States .
From 1953 to 1957
Keys made a series of statements regarding the atherogenicity of fats .
These pronouncements were :
“ All fats raise serum cholesterol ; Nearly half of total fat comes from vegetable fats and oils ;
No difference between animal and vegetable fats in effect on CHD ( 1953 ) ;
Type of fat makes no difference ;
Need to reduce margarine and shortening ( 1956 ) ;
All fats are comparable ; Saturated fats raise and polyunsaturated fats lower serum cholesterol ; Hydrogenated vegetable fats are the problem ; Animal fats are the problem ( 1957 -1959 ) . ”
As can be seen , his findings were inconsistent .
What was the role of the edible oil industry in promoting the diet / heart hypothesis ?
It is important to realize that at that time ( 1960s ) the edible oil industry in the United States seized the opportunity to promote its polyunsaturates .
The industry did this by developing a health issue focusing on Key ’s anti-saturated fat bias .
With the help of the edible oil industry lobbying in the United States , federal government dietary goals and guidelines were adopted incorporating this mistaken idea that consumption of saturated fat was causing heart disease .
This anti-saturated fat issue became the agenda of government and private agencies in the US and to an extent in other parts of the world .
This is the agenda that has had such a devastating effect on the coconut industry for the past decade .
Throughout the 1960s , the 1970s , the 1980s , and the 1990s , the anti-saturated fat rhetoric increased in intensity .
What are some of the contradictions to the hypothesis blaming saturated fat ?
Recently , an editorial by Harvard ’s Walter Willett , M.D. in the American Journal of Public Health ( 1990 ) acknowledged that even though
“ the focus of dietary recommendations is usually a reduction of saturated fat intake , no relation between saturated fat intake and risk of CHD was observed in the most informative prospective study to date . ”
Another editorial , this time by Framingham ’s William P. Castelli in the Archives of Internal Medicine ( 1992 ) , declared for the record that
“ … in Framingham , Mass , the more saturated fat one ate , the more cholesterol one ate , the more calories one ate , the lower the person ’s serum cholesterol … the opposite of what the equations provided by Hegsted at al ( 1965 ) and Keys et al ( 1957 ) would predict … ”
Castelli further admitted that
“ … In Framingham , for example , we found that the people who ate the most cholesterol , ate the most saturated fat , ate the most calories , weighed the least , and were the most physically active . ”
III .
Coconut Oil and the Diet / Heart Hypothesis
For the past several decades you have heard about animal and human studies feeding coconut oil that purportedly showed increased indices for cardiovascular risk .
Blackburn et al ( 1988 ) have reviewed the published literature of coconut oil ’s effect on serum cholesterol and atherogenesis and have concluded that when ...[ coconut oil is ] fed physiologically with other fats or adequately supplemented with linoleic acid , coconut oil is a neutral fat in terms of atherogenicity .
After reviewing this same literature , Kurup and Rajmohan ( 1995 ) conducted a study on 64 volunteers and found … no statistically significant alteration in the serum total cholesterol , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , HDL cholesterol / total cholesterol ratio and LDL cholesterol / HDL cholesterol ratio of triglycerides from the baseline values …
A beneficial effect of adding the coconut kernel to the diet was noted by these researchers .
How did coconut oil get such a negative reputation ?
The question then is , how did coconut oil get such a negative reputation ?
The answer quite simply is , initially , the significance of those changes that occurred during animal feeding studies were misunderstood .
The wrong interpretation was then repeated until ultimately the misinformation and disinformation took on a life of its own .
The problems for coconut oil started four decades ago when researchers fed animals hydrogenated coconut oil that was purposefully altered to make it completely devoid of any essential fatty acids .
The hydrogenated coconut oil was selected instead of hydrogenated cottonseed , corn or soybean oil because it was a soft enough fat for blending into diets due to the presence of the lower melting medium chain saturated fatty acids .
The same functionality could not be obtained from the cottonseed , corn or soybean oils if they were made totally saturated , since all their fatty acids were long chain and high melting and could not be easily blended nor were they as readily digestible .
The animals fed the hydrogenated coconut oil ( as the only fat source ) naturally became essential fatty acid deficient ; their serum cholesterol levels increased .
Diets that cause an essential fatty acid deficiency always produce an increase in serum cholesterol levels as well as an increase in the atherosclerotic indices .
The same effect has also been seen when other essential fatty acid deficient , highly hydrogenated oils such as cottonseed , soybean , or corn oils have been fed ; so it is clearly a function of the hydrogenated product , either because the oil is essential fatty acid ( EFA ) deficient or because of trans fatty acids ( TFA ) .
What about the studies where animals were fed with unprocessed coconut oil ?
Hostmark et al ( 1980 ) compared the effects of diets containing 10 % coconut fat and 10 % sunflower oil on lipoprotein distribution in male Wistar rats .
Coconut oil feeding produced significantly lower levels ( p=< 0.05 ) of pre-beta lipoproteins ( VLDL ) and significantly higher ( p=< 0.01 ) alpha-lipoproteins ( HDL ) relative to sunflower oil feeding .
Awad ( 1981 ) compared the effects of diets containing 14 % coconut oil , 14 % safflower oil or a 5 % “ control ” ( mostly soybean ) oil on accumulation of cholesterol in tissues in male Wistar rats .
The synthetic diets had 2 % added corn oil with a total fat of 16 % Total tissue cholesterol accumulation for animals on the safflower diet was six times greater than for animals fed the coconut oil , and twice that of the animals fed the control oil .
A conclusion that can be drawn from some of this animal research is that feeding hydrogenated coconut oil devoid of essential fatty acids ( EFA ) in a diet otherwise devoid of EFA leads to EFA deficiency and potentiates the formation of atherosclerosis markers .
It is of note that animals fed regular coconut oil have less cholesterol deposited in their livers and other parts of their bodies .
What about the studies where coconut oil is part of the normal diet of human beings ?
Kaunitz and Dayrit ( 1992 ) have reviewed some of the epidemiological and experimental data regarding coconut - eating groups and noted that the available population studies show that dietary coconut oil does not lead to high serum cholesterol nor to high coronary heart disease mortality or morbidity .
They noted that in 1989 Mendis et al reported undesirable lipid changes when young adult Sri Lankan males were changed from their normal diets by the substitution of corn oil for their customary coconut oil .
Although the total serum cholesterol decreased 18.7 % from 179.6 to 146.0 mg/dl and the LDL cholesterol decreased 23.8 % from 131.6 to 100.3 mg/dl , the HDL cholesterol decreased 41.4 % from 43.4 to 25.4 mg/dl ( putting the HDL values below the acceptable lower limit ) and the LDL / HDL ratio increased 30 % from 3.0 to 3.9 .
These latter two changes would be considered quite undesirable .
As noted above , Kurup and Rajmohan ( 1995 ) studied the addition of coconut oil alone to previously mixed fat diets and report no significant difference .
Previously , Prior et al ( 1981 ) had shown that islanders with high intake of coconut oil showed no evidence of the high saturated fat intake having a harmful effect in these populations .
When these groups migrated to New Zealand however , and lowered their intake of coconut oil , their total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol increased , and their HDL cholesterol decreased .
What about the studies where coconut oil was deliberately fed to human beings ?
Some of the studies reported thirty and more years ago should have cleared coconut oil of any implication in the development of coronary heart disease ( CHD ) .
For example , when Frantz and Carey ( 1961 ) fed an additional 810 kcal / day fat supplement for a whole month to males with high normal serum cholesterol levels , there was no significant difference from the original levels even though the fat supplement was hydrogenated coconut oil .
Halden and Lieb ( 1961 ) also showed similar results in a group of hyperchole - sterolemics when coconut oil was included in their diets .
Original serum cholesterol levels were reported as 170 to 370 mg / dl .
Straight coconut oil produced a range from 170 to 270 mg / dl .
Coconut oil combined with 5 % sunflower oil and 5 % olive oil produced a range of 140 to 240 mg /dl .
Earlier , Hashim and colleagues ( 1959 ) had shown quite clearly that feeding a fat supplement to hypercholesterolemics , where half of the supplement ( 21 % of energy ) was coconut oil ( and the other half was safflower oil ) , resulted in significant reductions in total serum cholesterol .
The reductions averaged - 29 % and ranged from - 6.8 to - 41.2 % .
And even earlier , Ahrens and colleagues ( 1957 ) had shown that adding coconut oil to the diet of hypercholesterolemics lowers serum cholesterol from , e.g. , 450 mg / dl to 367 mg/dl .
This is hardly a cholesterol - raising effect .
Bierenbaum et al ( 1967 ) followed 100 young men with documented myocardial infarction for 5 years on diets with fat restricted to 28 % of energy .
There was no significant difference between the two different fat mixtures ( 50/50 corn and safflower oils or 50/50 coconut and peanut oils ) , which were fed as half of the total fat allowance ; both diets reduced serum cholesterol .
This study clearly showed that 7 % of energy as coconut oil was as beneficial to the 50 men who consumed it as for the 50 men who consumed 7 % of energy as other oils such as corn oil or safflower .
Both groups fared better than the untreated controls .
More recently , Sundram et al ( 1994 ) fed whole foods diets to healthy normo- cholesterolemic males , where approximately 30 % of energy was fat .
Lauric acid ( C12:0 ) and myristic acid ( C14:0 ) from coconut oil supplied approximately 5 % of energy .
Relative to the baseline measurements of the subjects prior to the experimental diet , this lauric and myristic acid-rich diet showed an increase in total serum cholesterol from 166.7 to 170.0 mg/dl ( +1.9 % ) , a decrease in low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL - C ) from 105.2 to 104.4 mg/dl ( - 0.1 % ) , an increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL - C ) from 42.9 to 45.6 mg/dl ( +6.3 % ) .
There was a 2.4 % decrease in the LDL - C / HDL - C ratio from 2.45 to 2.39 .
These findings indicate a favorable alteration in serum lipoprotein balance was achieved when coconut oil was included in a whole food diet at 5 % of energy .
Tholstrup et al ( 1994 ) report similar results with whole foods diets high in lauric and myristic acids from palm kernel oil .
The HDL cholesterol levels increased significantly from baseline values ( 37.5 to 46.0 mg/dl , P< 0.01 ) and the LDL - C / HDL -C ratios decreased from 3.08 to 2.69 .
The increase in total cholesterol was from 154.7 ( baseline ) to 170.9 mg/dl on the experimental diet .
Ng et al ( 1991 ) fed 75 % of the fat ration as coconut oil ( 24 % of energy ) to 83 adult normocholesterolemics ( 61 males and 22 females ) .
Relative to baseline values , the highest values on the experimental diet for total cholesterol was increased 17 % ( 169.6 to 198.4 mg/dl ) , HDL cholesterol was increased 21.4 % ( 44.3 to 53.8 mg/dl ) , and the LDL - C / HDL - C ratio was decreased 3.6 % ( 2.51 to 2.42 ) .
When unprocessed coconut oil is added to an otherwise normal diet , there is frequently no change in the serum cholesterol although some studies have shown a decrease in total cholesterol .
For example , when Ginsberg et al provided an “ Average American ” diet with 2 - 3 times more myristic acid ( C14:0 ) , 4.5 times more lauric acid ( C12:0 ) , and 1.2 times more palmitic and stearic acid ( C16:0 and C18:0 ) than their “ Mono[ unsaturated ] ” diet and the National Cholesterol Education Program “ Step 1 ” diet , there was no increase in serum cholesterol , and in fact , serum cholesterol levels for this diet group fell approximately 3 % from 177.1 mg % to 171.8 mg % during the 22 week feeding trial .
It appears from many of the research reports that the effect coconut oil has on serum cholesterol is the opposite in individuals with low serum cholesterol values and those with high serum values .
We see that there may be a raising of serum total cholesterol , LDL cholesterol and especially HDL cholesterol in individuals with low serum cholesterol .
On the other hand there is lowering of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in hypercholesterolemics as noted above .
Studies that supposedly showed a hypercholesterolemic effect of coconut oil feeding , in fact , usually only showed that coconut oil was not as effective at lowering the serum cholesterol as was the more unsaturated fat being compared .
This appears to be in part because coconut oil does not drive cholesterol into the tissues as does the more polyunsaturated fats .
The chemical analysis of the atheroma shows that the fatty acids from the cholesterol esters are 74 % unsaturated ( 41 % is polyunsaturated ) and only 24 % are saturated .
None of the saturated fatty acids were reported to be lauric acid or myristic acid ( Felton et al 1994 ) .
Should coconut oil be used to prevent coronary heart disease ?
There is another aspect to the coronary heart disease picture .
This is related to the initiation of the atheromas that are reported to be blocking arteries .
Recent research is suggestive that there is a causative role for the herpes virus and cytomegalovirus in the initial formation of atherosclerotic plaques and the recloging of arteries after angioplasty .
( New York Times 1991 )
What is so interesting is that the herpes virus and cytomegalovirus are both inhibited by the antimicrobial lipid monolaurin ; but monolaurin is not formed in the body unless there is a source of lauric acid in the diet .
Thus , ironically enough , one could consider the recommendations to avoid coconut and other lauric oils as contributing to the increased incidence of coronary heart disease .
Perhaps more important than any effect of coconut oil on serum cholesterol is the additional effect of coconut oil on the disease fighting capability of the animal or person consuming the coconut oil .
IV . Coconut Oil and Cancer
Lim - Sylianco ( 1987 ) has reviewed 50 years of literature showing anticarcinogenic effects from dietary coconut oil .
These animal studies show quite clearly the nonpromotional effect of feeding coconut oil .
In a study by Reddy et al ( 1984 ) straight coconut oil was more inhibitory than MCT oil to induction of colon tumors by azoxymethane .
Chemically induced adenocarcinomas differed 10 - fold between corn oil ( 32 % ) and coconut oil ( 3 % ) in the colon .
Both olive oil and coconut oil developed the low levels ( 3 % ) of the adenocarcinomas in the colon , but in the small intestine animals fed coconut oil did not develop any tumors while 7 % of animals fed olive oil did .
Studies by Cohen et al ( 1986 ) showed that the nonpromotional effects of coconut oil were also seen in chemically induced breast cancer .
In this model , the slight elevation of serum cholesterol in the animals fed coconut oil was protective as the animals fed the more polyunsaturated oil had reduced serum cholesterol and more tumors .
The authors noted that “ … an overall inverse trend was observed between total serum lipids and tumor incidence for the 4 [ high fat ] groups . ”
This is an area that needs to be pursued .
V. Coconut Oil Antimicrobial Benefits
I would now like to review for you some of the rationale for the use of coconut oil as a food that will serve as the raw material to provide potentially useful levels of antimicrobial activity in the individual .
The lauric acid in coconut oil is used by the body to make the same disease - fighting fatty acid derivative monolaurin that babies make from the lauric acid they get from their mothers= milk .
The monoglyceride monolaurin is the substance that keeps infants from getting viral or bacterial or protozoal infections .
Until just recently , this important benefit has been largely overlooked by the medical and nutrition community .
Recognition of the antimicrobial activity of the monoglyceride of lauric acid ( monolaurin ) has been reported since 1966 .
The seminal work can be credited to Jon Kabara .
This early research was directed at the virucidal effects because of possible problems related to food preservation .
Some of the early work by Hierholzer and Kabara ( 1982 ) that showed virucidal effects of monolaurin on enveloped RNA and DNA viruses was done in conjunction with the Center for Disease Control of the US Public Health Service with selected prototypes or recognized representative strains of enveloped human viruses .
The envelope of these viruses is a lipid membrane .
Kabara ( 1978 ) and others have reported that certain fatty acids ( e.g. , medium - chain saturates ) and their derivatives ( e.g. , monoglycerides ) can have adverse effects on various microorganisms : those microorganisms that are inactivated include bacteria , yeast , fungi , and enveloped viruses .
The medium - chain saturated fatty acids and their derivatives act by disrupting the lipid membranes of the organisms ( Isaacs and Thormar 1991 ) ( Isaacs et al 1992 ) .
In particular , enveloped viruses are inactivated in both human and bovine milk by added fatty acids ( FAs ) and monoglycerides ( MGs ) ( Isaacs et al 1991 ) as well as by endogenous FAs and MGs ( Isaacs et al 1986 , 1990 , 1991 , 1992 ; Thormar et al 1987 ) .
All three monoesters of lauric acid are shown to be active antimicrobials , i.e. , alpha- , alpha ’- , and beta - MG .
Additionally , it is reported that the antimicrobial effects of the FAs and MGs are additive and total concentration is critical for inactivating viruses ( Isaacs and Thormar 1990 ) .
The properties that determine the anti-infective action of lipids are related to their structure ; e.g. , monoglycerides , free fatty acids .
The monoglycerides are active , diglycerides and triglycerides are inactive .
Of the saturated fatty acids , lauric acid has greater antiviral activity than either caprylic acid ( C - 10 ) or myristic acid ( C - 14 ) .
The action attributed to monolaurin is that of solubilizing the lipids and phospholipids in the envelope of the virus causing the disintegration of the virus envelope .
In effect , it is reported that the fatty acids and monoglycerides produce their killing / inactivating effect by lysing the ( lipid bilayer ) plasma membrane .
However , there is evidence from recent studies that one antimicrobial effect is related to its interference with signal transduction ( Projan et al 1994 ) .
Some of the viruses inactivated by these lipids , in addition to HIV , are the measles virus , herpes simplex virus - 1 ( HSV - 1 ) , vesicular stomatitis virus ( VSV ) , visna virus , and cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) .
Many of the pathogenic organisms reported to be inactivated by these antimicrobial lipids are those known to be responsible for opportunistic infections in HIV - positive individuals .
For example , concurrent infection with cytomegalovirus is recognized as a serious complication for HIV + individuals ( Macallan et al 1993 ) .
Thus , it would appear to be important to investigate the practical aspects and the potential benefit of an adjunct nutritional support regimen for HIV - infected individuals , which will utilize those dietary fats that are sources of known anti-viral , anti-microbial , and anti-protozoal monoglycerides and fatty acids such as monolaurin and its precursor lauric acid .
No one in the mainstream nutrition community seems to have recognized the added potential of antimicrobial lipids in the treatment of HIV - infected or AIDS patients .
These antimicrobial fatty acids and their derivatives are essentially non-toxic to man ; they are produced in vivo by humans when they ingest those commonly available foods that contain adequate levels of medium - chain fatty acids such as lauric acid .
According to the published research , lauric acid is one of the best “ inactivating ” fatty acids , and its monoglyceride is even more effective than the fatty acid alone ( Kabara 1978 , Sands et al 1978 , Fletcher et al 1985 , Kabara 1985 ) .
The lipid coated ( envelop ) viruses are dependent on host lipids for their lipid constituents .
The variability of fatty acids in the foods of individuals accounts for the variability of fatty acids in the virus envelop and also explains the variability of glycoprotein expression .
Loss of lauric acid from the American diet
Increasingly , over the past 40 years , the American diet has undergone major changes .
Many of these changes involve changes of fats and oils .
There has been an increasing supply of the partially hydrogenated trans - containing vegetable oils and a decreasing amount of the lauric acid-containing oils .
As a result , there has been an increased consumption of trans fatty acids and linoleic acid and a decrease in the consumption of lauric acid .
This type of change in diet has an effect on the fatty acids the body has available for metabolic activities .
VI . Lauric Acid in Foods
The coconut producing countries
Whole coconut as well as extracted coconut oil has been a mainstay in the food supply in many countries in parts of Asia and the Pacific Rim throughout the centuries .
Recently though , there has been some replacement of coconut oil by other seed oils .
This is unfortunate since the benefits gained from consuming an adequate amount of coconut oil are being lost .
Based on the per capita intake of coconut oil in 1985 as reported by Kaunitz ( 1992 ) , the per capita daily intake of lauric acid can be approximated .
For those major producing countries such as the Philippines , Indonesia , and Sri Lanka , and consuming countries such as Singapore , the daily intakes of lauric acid were approximately 7.3 grams ( Philippines ) , 4.9 grams ( Sri Lanka ) , 4.7 grams ( Indonesia ) , and 2.8 grams ( Singapore ) .
In India , intake of lauric acid from coconut oil in the coconut growing areas ( e.g. , Kerala ) range from about 12 to 20 grams per day ( Eraly 1995 ) , whereas the average for the rest of the country is less than half a gram .
An average high of approximately 68 grams of lauric acid is calculated from the coconut oil intake previously reported by Prior et al ( 1981 ) for the Tokelau Islands .
Other coconut producing countries may also have intakes of lauric acid in the same range .
The US experience
In the United States today , there is very little lauric acid in most of the foods .
During the early part of the 20th Century and up until the late 1950s many people consumed heavy cream and high fat milk .
These foods could have provided approximately 3 grams of lauric acid per day to many individuals .
In addition , desiccated coconut was a popular food in homemade cakes , pies and cookies , as well as in commercial baked goods , and 1 - 2 tablespoons of desiccated coconut would have supplied 1 - 2 grams of lauric acid .
Those foods made with the coconut oil based shortenings would have provided additional amounts .
Until two years ago , some of the commercially sold popcorn , at least in movie theaters , had coconut oil as the oil .
This means that for those people lucky enough to consume this type of popcorn the possible lauric acid intake was 6 grams or more in a three ( 3 ) cup order .
Some infant formulas ( but not all ) have been good sources of lauric acid for infants .
However , in the past 3 - 4 years there has been reformulation with a loss of a portion of coconut oil in these formulas , and a subsequent lowering of the lauric acid levels .
Only one US manufactured enteral formula contains lauric acid ( e.g. , Impact7 ) ; this is normally used in hospitals for tube feeding ; it is reported to be very effective in reversing severe weight loss in AIDS patients , but it is discontinued when the patients leave the hospital because it is not sufficiently palatable for oral use .
The more widely promoted enteral formulas ( e.g. , Ensure7 , Nutren7 ) are not made with lauric oils , and , in fact , many are made with partially hydrogenated oils .
There are currently some candies sold in the US that are made with palm kernel oil , and a few specialty candies made with coconut oil and desiccated coconut .
These can supply small amounts of lauric acid .
Cookies such as macaroons , if made with desiccated coconut , are good sources of lauric acid , supplying as much as 6 grams of lauric acid per macaroon ( Red Mill ) .
However , these cookies make up a small portion of the cookie market .
Most cookies in the United States are no longer made with coconut oil shortenings ; however , there was a time when many US cookies ( e.g. , Pepperidge Farm ) were about 25 % lauric acid .
Originally , one of the largest manufacturers of cream soups used coconut oil in the formulations .
Many popular cracker manufacturers also used coconut oil as a spray coating .
These products supplied a small amount of lauric acid on a daily basis for some people .
How much lauric acid is needed ?
It is not known exactly how much food made with lauric oils is needed in order to have a protective level of lauric acid in the diet .
Infants probably consume between 0.3 and 1 gram per kilogram of body weight if they are fed human milk or an enriched infant formula that contains coconut oil .
This amount appears to have always been protective .
Adults could probably benefit from the consumption of 10 to 20 grams of lauric acid per day .
Growing children probably need about the same amounts as adults .
VII .
Recommendations
The coconut oil industry needs to make the case for lauric acid now .
It should not wait for the rapeseed industry to promote the argument for including lauric acid because of the increased demand for laurate .
In fact lauric acid may prove to be a conditionally essential saturated fatty acid , and the research to establish this fact around the world needs to be vigorously promoted .
Although private sectors need to fight for their commodity through the offices of their trade associations , the various governments of coconut producing countries need to put pressure on WHO , FAO , and UNDP to recognizes the health importance of coconut oil and the other coconut products .
Moreover , those representatives who are going to do the persuading need to believe that their message is scientifically correct — because it is .
Among the critical foods and nutrition “ buzz words ” for the 21st Century is the term “ functional foods . ”
Clearly coconut oil fits the designation of a very important functional food .

A new website nicknamed UCubed aims to unite over 31 million unemployed Americans to get organized , build power and fight together with the labor movement for jobs and economic recovery .
The website , http://www.unionofunemployed.com/, also known as Ur Union of Unemployed , is a community service project of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ( IAM ) .
It hopes to reach millions online in an effort to unify and connect the country ’s unemployed and underemployed in a unique and useful way .
Resources on the site include social networking , resume building , job listings , ways to take action on important legislative campaigns and much more .
“ Have you lost your job ?
Well you ’re not alone , 31 million Americans face the same challenges , ” says the website .
“ Do you want your job back ?
Do you want your life back ?
But you ca n’t do it alone .
Neither can anyone else .
You all need each other .
That ’s what UCubed is here to do . ”
The current economy has harmed us all , says UCubed – salary and hourly , manufacturing and construction , finance and service , union and non-union , college educated and high school dropouts , inner city and suburban residents .
Only by working together can we put an end to the current economic turmoil , says the website .
After registering and logging on , the site allows users to connect with others according to your zip code into cubes of six people .
UCubed then organizes those cubes into neighborhoods of nine cubes , and then builds them into blocks .
Eventually the goal is to build a community of “ jobs activists ” to support one another and build a power base to fight on behalf of the unemployed and help put people back to work .
“ There is strength in numbers , ” writes IAM International President R. Thomas Buffenbarger in a welcome letter on UCubed .
“ There is even more strength when those numbers work in unison , ” he continues .
Buffenbarger notes those struggling given the country ’s current grave recession will work together on UCubed , each displaying a unique set of skills , talents and experiences that can be shared in a network of mutual support .
As the numbers increase , site users will become a force to pressure the federal government to respond faster and more effectively to the current job crisis , says Buffenbarger .
“ The new jobs bill , expansion of unemployment compensation , extension of the COBRA subsidy , food stamp appropriations , tax relief – all are issues that demand immediate action .
And both Congress and the White House need to hear from UCubed activists like you every single week , ” he writes .
Buffenbarger says the website was created because more than 35,000 members of the machinists union have been laid off .
Others are working fewer hours each week because their employers simply do not have orders to fill , he adds , and the real recovery , not the false one on Wall Street , still seems years away .
“ We desperately want jobs now !
Not just for our members , but for all Americans , ” he writes .
UCubed and the Ur Union of Unemployed is a way to help the jobless become active during those dreary and sleepless nights , says the IAM international president .
“ Everywhere we turn we see the personal devastation this grave recession has caused .
And we hope UCubed provides a measure of relief – an end to the sense of being all alone , a chance to build something useful and unique , and an opportunity for the unemployed to change things for the better . ”
NEW YORK – Despite the early date on the political calendar , Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand , D - N.Y. , appointed to fill the seat vacated by now - Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , has already picked up a spate of endorsements from labor , progressives , leaders of the African American and Latino communities , Democratic Party leaders and others .
Former New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson , who with a campaign budget of less than $ 10 million was able to come within five points of beating out billionaire mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2009 , was the latest to offer his seal of approval .
Gillibrand , according to Thompson , has been “ putting more New Yorkers back to work and fighting for justice , fairness and equality for every single New Yorker . ”
Many are saying that , for a Democrat holding a statewide federal office , Gillibrand has strong progressive credentials .
Indeed , a campaign has been organized by health care activists to call Gillibrand ’s office to thank her for taking a lead in the fight for health care reform .
Gillibrand recently signed a letter urging Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to , despite the recent defeat in Massachusetts that took the Democrats ’ filibuster proof majority , ensure that real health care reform - with a public option - is passed .
The letter advocates using the budget reconciliation process , which requires only 51 votes .
While 119 House Democrats have signed the letter , as have 300,000 grassroots activists , only a few Senators have added their names .
The early endorsements are necessary , many argue , because Gillibrand will likely face a stiff Republican Party challenger in November , and she ’s also likely to be targeted by African American conservative Democrat Harold Ford , a former member of Congress from Tennessee and current and vice chairman of Merrill Lynch .
While Ford ’s policies favor Wall Street over Main Street , Gillibrand has “ worked every day to pass health - care reform that protects New York workers , covers the uninsured and makes health care affordable for working families , ” Raglan George , leader of AFSCME District Council 1707 , the first citywide union to endorse Gillibrand , said .
“ And she ’s been working hard since day one to make sure every worker receives the fair and equal pay they deserve . ”
Ford , a leader of the conservative Democratic Leadership Council has sought to portray himself as a moderate , but his past has put progressive organizations on edge .
On national security he ’s said , “ We ’ve got to get tough on ‘ illegals . ' ”
While a member of Congress , Ford voted for restrictive measures sought by anti-choice advocates : parental notification laws banning late term abortions .
NARAL Pro-Choice New York ’s Kelli Conlin , after meeting with Ford for forty minutes , said that while he ca n’t be classified as “ pro-life , ” he also ca n’t be classified as pro-choice .
Consequently , NARAL ’s national and local organizations endorsed Gillibrand , who has established herself as a pro-choice candidate .
Even back in 2006 , while campaigning for Congress , Gillibrand told the national conference of the National Organization for Women that the extreme right was undermining democracy and women ’s rights to choice in particular .
Many have argued that they will support Gillibrand because she has a proven ability to beat Republicans , even on their home turf .
In 2006 , Gillibrand was able to win the seat representing New York ’s 20th Congressional district , an area with a much larger number of registered Republicans than Democrats .
A number of commentators have openly wondered why Ford is running :
Is he backed by Republicans , they ask , in order to weaken Gillibrand in the general election ?
Others who have endorsed Gillibrand make up a broad cross-section of New Yorkers : the vast majority of Democratic Party county chairs , Rep. Nydia Velzques and a number of other members of New York ’s Congressional delegation , Emily ’s list , the pro-GLBT rights Human Rights Campaign , the Rev. Al Sharpton , the New York State United Teachers , the Public Employees Federation , as well as numerous other leaders and groups .
Also , the White House has made clear that it supports Gillibrand .

WASHINGTON  President Obama met with the Dalai Lama on Thursday , welcoming the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader to the White House for a low - profile meeting that nonetheless raised the hackles of China .
The two men spoke about democracy , human rights and the need to preserve Tibet ’s religious identity and culture  all issues that , predictably , irritated Beijing .
In a written statement , the White House said Mr. Obama had expressed support for the preservation of Tibet ’s “ unique religious , cultural and linguistic identity and the protection of human rights for Tibetans in the People ’s Republic of China . ”
The meeting , which the White House put off last year so as not to interfere with Mr. Obama ’s trip to Beijing in November , is the latest evidence of the more muscular posture that the Obama administration has been adopting with China , after a year in which China has taken a firm stance in its relations with the United States on a number of issues .
Legal defeat plunges Security Service into crisis over torture evidence , and it is revealed that judge removed damning verdict after Foreign Office QC 's plea
MI5 faced an unprecedented and damaging crisis tonight after one of the country 's most senior judges found that the Security Service had failed to respect human rights , deliberately misled parliament , and had a " culture of suppression " that undermined government assurances about its conduct .
The condemnation , by Lord Neuberger , the master of the rolls , was drafted shortly before the foreign secretary , David Miliband , lost his long legal battle to suppress a seven - paragraph court document showing that MI5 officers were involved in the ill - treatment of a British resident , Binyam Mohamed .
Amid mounting calls for an independent inquiry into the affair , three of the country 's most senior judges – Lord Judge , the lord chief justice , Sir Anthony May , president of the Queen 's Bench Division , and Lord Neuberger – disclosed evidence of MI5 's complicity in Mohamed 's torture and unlawful interrogation by the US .
So severe were Neuberger 's criticisms of MI5 that the government 's leading lawyer in the case , Jonathan Sumption QC , privately wrote to the court asking him to reconsider his draft judgment before it was handed down .
The judges agreed but Sumption 's letter , which refers to Neuberger 's original comments , was made public after lawyers for Mohamed and media organisations , including the Guardian , intervened .
They argued that Neuberger had privately agreed with Sumption to remove his fierce criticisms without giving then the chance to contest the move .
In his letter , Sumption warned the judges that the criticism of MI5 would be seen by the public as statements by the court that the agency :
• Did not respect human rights .
• Had not renounced participation in " coercive interrogation " techniques .
• Deliberately misled MPs and peers on the intelligence and security committee , who are supposed to scrutinise its work .
• Had a " culture of suppression " in its dealings with Miliband and the court .
Sumption described Neuberger 's observations in his draft judgment as " an exceptionally damaging criticism of the good faith of the Security Service as a whole " .
His letter also refers to the MI5 officer known as Witness B , who is understood to have interrogated Binyam Mohamed in Pakistan in 2002 .
Witness B gave evidence in the hearings and is now at the centre of a Scotland Yard investigation .
Sumption 's letter implies that Neuberger did not believe that Witness B was acting alone and that the judge believed that Witness B's conduct was " characteristic of the service as a whole " .
The court 's final ruling forced the Foreign Office to publish a seven - paragraph summary of 42 classified CIA documents that were handed to MI5 before Witness B travelled to Pakistan to interrogate Mohamed .
These show that MI5 was aware that Mohamed was being continuously deprived of sleep , threatened with rendition and subjected to previous interrogations that were causing him " significant mental stress and suffering " .
If administered in the UK , the summary says , it would clearly be in breach of undertakings about interrogation techniques made by the British government in 1972 .
The three judges referred to a recent case in a US court where the judge found Mohamed 's claims about how he was tortured to be truthful .
This vindicated his assertion that " UK authorities had been involved in and facilitated the ill - treatment and torture to which he was subjected while under the control of the USA authorities " .
There were renewed calls tonightfor an inquiry into MI5 's involvement in torture overseas and into government policies after the 9/11 attacks .
Miliband told MPs that the ruling was leading to a " great deal of concern " in the US .
In a statement to the Commons he said he had fought to prevent the release of the information to defend the " fundamental " principle that intelligence shared with the UK would be protected .
The Foreign Office claimed tonightthat the criticisms in the draft judgment had been " unsubstantiated " , and denied that Sumption 's approach to the court had been intended to suppress criticism of MI5 .
Nevertheless , the court is to convene tomorrow to reconsider whether to publish all or parts of the 21 - line paragraph from the draft judgment in which the criticisms appear .
The editor of the Guardian , Alan Rusbridger , wrote to the court after the Sumption letter came to light on Monday night .
He said today : " It is good news that – after a challenge from the Guardian and other news organisations – the courts have finally ordered the government to reveal evidence of MI5 complicity in torture .
This is a watershed in open justice in an area in which it is notoriously difficult to shine a light .
But it was extremely disturbing that the government 's lawyers made a successful last - ditch attempt to get the master of the rolls to rewrite his judgment . "
Six million in the US with no income but food stamps
7 January 2010
Some six million Americans — one in 50 people in the US — are living on no income other than $ 100 or $ 200 a month in food stamps , according to an analysis of state data by the New York Times .
The number of people who reported that they are unemployed and receive no cash aid — neither welfare , nor unemployment insurance , pension benefits , child support or disability pay — the newspaper reported , has jumped by 50 percent over the last two years , as the recession has taken hold .
According to the January 3 article , the number of people reporting no income tripled in Nevada over the past two years , doubled in Florida and New York , and increased nearly 90 percent in Minnesota and Utah .
In Wayne County , Michigan — which includes Detroit , where half the population is unemployed or underemployed — one out of every 25 residents reports an income of only food stamps .
In Yakima County , Washington , the figure is one out of every 17 .
The figures reveal the vast scale of human suffering in the US as the new decade begins and puts the lie to talk of an economic “ recovery . ”
The 6 million people in households reporting no income — which includes 1.2 million children — is equivalent to the entire population of Indiana or Massachusetts , or the combined populations of Los Angeles , Philadelphia and Boston .
Such a social catastrophe underscores the indifference of the Obama administration , which has done virtually nothing to provide relief to those who have lost their jobs , homes and livelihoods — even as it spares no expense to shore up the fortunes of the financial elite and fund its ongoing wars .
The number of people without an income has been on the rise since 1996 , when Democratic President Bill Clinton and the Republican Congress ended welfare as a universal entitlement , a status the federal relief program had enjoyed since its inception in the 1930s .
Pledging to “ end the cycle of dependency , ” the Democrats and Republicans imposed lifetime limits on benefits , drastically reduced the level of cash assistance , and imposed restrictive “ workfare ” and other requirements on further aid .
Despite the increased need for relief , Obama has opposed any additional funding for what remains of the welfare program , called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families .
Since their peak in the 1990s , welfare rolls are down nearly 75 percent , the Times reported .
“ Many of those who would have received cash assistance in past recessions are not getting it now , ” Judy Putnam , a spokesperson for the Michigan League for Human Services , told the World Socialist Web Site .
“ Only a third of the state ’s children living in poverty are getting cash assistance compared with two - thirds before ‘ welfare reform ’ in 1996 .
People in Michigan are heavily dependent on food stamps . ”
With jobless benefits covering only half of the unemployed , food stamps — which provide an average of $ 1 per meal per person , or around $ 100 per person each month for individuals or families earning up to 130 percent of the official poverty level — have become the safety net of last resort .
A record 36 million people — one in eight people and one in four children — now rely on the food stamp program .
The joint federal - state Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) is expanding by 20,000 people per day , but is still estimated to serve only two - thirds of those who qualify .
An earlier Times study showed there are more than 200 US counties where food stamp usage shot up by at least two - thirds , including Riverside County , California , most of greater Phoenix and Las Vegas , a ring of Atlanta suburbs , and a 150 - mile stretch of southwest Florida from Bradenton to the Everglades .
The study found there are over 800 counties where food stamps feed one third of all children .
Late last year , researchers at Washington University in St. Louis released a study showing that 50 percent of all children and 90 percent of African American children will receive food stamps at some point before their 20th birthday .
“ Rather than being a time of security and safety , ” said Mark Rank , Ph.D. , one of the authors of the report , “ the childhood years for many American children are a time of economic turmoil , risk , and hardship . ”
The January 3 Times report focused on Florida , where the number of people with no income beyond food stamps has doubled in two years and more than tripled along the southwest coast , where a housing boom turned into a bust of foreclosed and abandoned homes .
According to state data , those without income were split evenly between families with children and individuals .
Those affected were also racially mixed — about 42 percent white , 32 percent black , and 22 percent Latino — with whites making up the fastest growing segment during the recession .
This plunge into destitution has affected wide layers of the population .
The Times article cites a middle - aged mother of two , Isabel Bermudez , who moved from a Bronx housing project to sell real estate in Florida .
Once enjoying a six - figure income , a house with a pool and investment property , she lost her job and home and ran out of unemployment benefits .
Ms. Bermudez ’s sole income is now $ 320 a month in food stamps .
“ I went from making $ 180,000 to relying on food stamps , ” she told the newspaper , adding that without the program she would n’t be able to feed her children .
The increasing reliance on meager food stamp allowances exposes the absence of anything that can properly be called a social safety net in the US .
The situation will only get worse , as both the Democrats and Republicans prepare to slash what remains of publicly funded programs in order to pay for the multi-trillion dollar Wall Street bailout and expansion of US military action around the world .
The theme of Obama ’s State of the Union address — expected early next month — will be long - term deficit reduction and a further demand that the American people reduce their consumption .
The White House is backing a bipartisan commission to recommend major cuts in basic social programs along with regressive taxes on consumption , and Obama ’s budget director , Peter Orszag , has said the administration will take measures to reduce the deficit in its next budget due out in February .
Such actions will throw millions more into poverty .
The social crisis facing working people — depression levels of unemployment , home foreclosures , the growth of hunger , poverty and homelessness — is the most graphic expression of the failure of capitalism , an economic system that benefits the wealthy few at the expense of the vast majority .
In the midst of this worsening situation for the working population , it was reported last week that the top three banks — Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley — which received tens of billions in public funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program — will hand out $ 49.5 billion in end - of - year cash bonuses and stock awards .
All told , US banks will dispense an estimated $ 200 billion in total compensation .
The Obama administration is continuing and accelerating the transfer of wealth from working people to those who are responsible for precipitating the worst economic breakdown since the Great Depression .
Nearly a year after his inauguration , President Obama has demonstrated he is nothing but a tool of the financial oligarchy .
The very future of the working class depends on the development of a mass socialist movement against this administration , both big business parties , and the profit system which they defend .

As the L.A. Times health blog reports , the Food and Drug Administration recently issued a warning advising consumers not to use “ ear candles ” — fabric that is soaked in either paraffin or beeswax , set on fire and deliberately placed in the ear .
These candles , which allow wax to drip into the ear canal ( if you do n’t set your hair on fire first ) , supposedly help with a range of ailments including ear infections , sinus infections and sore throats .
For those ear candle devotees , warm olive oil poured into the ear is a good home remedy for getting out some excess wax build - up , and does n’t involve flame near your lobes .
Sheesh , and doctors thought they had to worry about their patients shoving Q - tips in too far .

Travel guru Rick Steves has been flying higher than we might have thought all these years .
He 's gone public his use of marijuana and support for legalizating the drug .
And he makes his case , in part , as a faithful Lutheran who finds activism more " Christlike " than conforming .
Amy Frykholm recently interviewed Steves , prolific guidebook author and Public Television travel show host , about his book , Travel as a Political Act , and his faith for Christian Century .
But she saved the dope news for one of blogs that CC hosts , Theolog .
Steves tells her that people should take a " courageous " stand against drug laws that do n't work .
In the blog , Steves says ,
For me , marijuana is not a harmful substance .
I consider using it to be a civil liberty and have used it responsibly as an adult for creative purposes .
I used to write a popular monthly column in World Concern Magazine , ( a great Christian relief organization here in Seattle ) and just for fun , I would write the article high .
It helped me see things differently .
Steves says he's not pro-drugs he says , or overlooking to the problems drugs cause for kids or the dangers of driving , not just typing , while high .
I am saying that drug abuse is a painful and expensive problem in our society , and we are tackling it the wrong way .
There are 80,000 people in jail for marijuana possession ...
They get caught in that whole destructive and criminalized world .
There are constructive and creative ways to help people , without locking people up , driving up the street value and enriching organized crime ...
My pastor knows about my activism , and while he may not agree with me , he respects me for it .
The church council supports some de-criminalization activities in Seattle .
It is not at all incongruous to being a Christian or a Lutheran .
It is a little odd , because most Christians are mindless conformists when it comes to these issues .
I do n't think mindless conformity is very Christlike .
I was mighty surprised by all this .
I traveled in France with Steves himself and interviewed him often during my time as USA TODAY travel writer .
I found him to be thoughtful , intellectually astute , culturally sensitive and fun .
High ?
Not as I could tell but , having never smoked , ( I may have been the original " designated driver " in the ' 60 s )
I probably would n't have known .
Still , his judgmental line on Christians who do follow the drug laws , even if they might vote to change them , does n't seem so very Christlike to me .
Does reading these quotes make you less interested in Steves ' advice , on travel or politics or marijuana -- or more interested ?
What does your religion tell you about smoking marijuana ?
Betty White , 88 , is having a moment .
She has movie roles , a Facebook campaign , and a popular ad when most actresses her age only have cataracts .
Why do we support this comeback ?
Because it is free of irony and nostalgia .
You can't swing a handbag these days without hitting Betty White .
Aside from a wonderful supporting turn in rom-com hit The Proposal , she also has a Facebook group 125,000 people strong trying to convince the powers that be she should host Saturday Night Live .
Then her Snickers ad during the Super Bowl scored the best numbers in the important corporate competition during the big game .
More people are talking more about her than Drew Brees — whoever that clown is .
We could n't be happier for this bawdy dame .
That 's right , the love for Betty White is an actual , real , sincere thing .
Usually these types of comebacks are rooted in the irony of great things gone by like , " Oh , man , let 's get Eric Estrada to make a cameo in our movie because his show is old and was cool when we were kids , but he 's such a bad actor that it will make this thing awesome , dude . "
That 's not the case with Betty .
Of course people remember her from her hit shows like The Golden Girls and The Mary Tyler Moore Show , but that is not why she 's being trotted out for a second go - round .
The reason she has connected to modern audience is that she is the grandmotherly type that we all love , but she 's happy to subvert that by telling dirty jokes at the William Shatner roast , playing a bitchy version of herself on Ugly Betty , and calling herself a whore on George Lopez .
These recent feats are why everyone wants more Betty — not to relive her past glories but because she is doing something totally hip and now .
Like many good things in pop culture , this something that the gays have known about for years but everyone else is finally getting hip to .
It 's like the great new neighborhood we discovered and cleaned up and the straights come in and pay too much money for apartments after we have replaced all the " checks cashed " parlors and pawn shops with cute restaurants and boutique home decor stores .
The gays have a special place in their hearts for both the show The Golden Girls and the actresses that played them and we have single - handedly kept the reruns on the air all this time .
Not only have the girls always supported their causes , but we always knew that they were still rife for great comedy .
Unlike when our neighborhoods are taken over , we 're happy that the rest of the world has discovered this little treasure with a blonde perm , an infectious smile , and the mouth of a truck driver on his second day of sobriety .
Yes , Betty White would be a brilliant choice to host Saturday Night Live .
Not only is she a comedic veteran with excellent timing and a wonderfully daffy new persona , but she is two things we rarely see these days : game and in on her own joke .
We have a feeling that she would do just about anything from pretending to smoke weed with Andy Samberg to checking out Justin Timberlake 's dick in a box .
And can you imagine what she would do in a skit with Kristen Wiig ?
Amazing !
Please give Betty this gig , and any other jobs out there Hollywood can dream up .
The world is lousy with ironic posturing and snide resurgences , but this bit of sincere goodwill toward a star is refreshing .
We do n't have many years left with Ms. White , but maybe if we keep her busy , she 'll stick around for a bit longer .

A new laser system can kill mosquitoes without harming other insects , as shown in slow - motion video .
It 's all part of the effort to combat malaria .

Unedited Transcript :
Scientists have developed a hand - held laser that can kill mosquitoes in high volume .
And they ’re hoping that this will help combat one of the world ’s most deadly diseases .
A high - speed video camera that captures up to 6,000 frames per second was used by a company called Intellectual Ventures to show the invention in action .
But first , to study the flight dynamics of mosquitoes , the scientists recorded their flight movements .
In this video , tiny suspended water droplets , illuminated by a green laser , show the movement of air around the mosquito ’s wing .
In this video , a mosquito ’s flight was recorded , and we ’re seeing it in extreme slow motion .
To get this footage , the mosquito was placed in a custom designed chamber that sensed when the mosquito flew through the focal plane of the camera .
Later , after studying the data , and setting up the system , the mosquitoes are struck and killed by lasers .
Here ( 3rd video , 2nd clip ) you can see the laser strike… parts of the mosquito breaking off … and the body falling to the ground .
If played in real time , these segments would be about one - tenth of a second long .
The goal of this research is combating malaria , a disease spread through tropical regions of the world by mosquitoes .
Nearly a million people die of the disease each year .
Intellectual Ventures says their involvement began with a challenge from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation .
To set up their system , the scientists created what they call a Photonic Fence , which , in the field , ( photo ) would have a beam of infrared light between fence posts .
The system detects mosquitoes and shoots them down .
The inventors claim all the laser parts came from inexpensive consumer electronics .
They also claim the system can distinguish between different insects .
It would only target mosquitoes , and let others , such as butterflies and bumblebees , to pass through unharmed .
Animals have become an important part of many families .
But should parents be more careful about the way their children interact with their pets ?
Several times every year there are reports and photos in the media of children who have been bitten by dogs .
Are there steps that parents can take to eliminate any risks ?
Most children have a natural adoration of animals .
From a child ’s perspective , puppies are living , breathing , fluffy toys , and they loves to spend time with them , petting them and talking to them .
There has been copious research that demonstrates wide - ranging benefits to children from pets .
The psychological benefits are well proven .
Studies have shown that children who grow up around animals develop into more confident , socially adept individuals .
Animals can help to teach children valuable social skills during a critical time in their psychological development .
Children treat pets as their friends , and in the absence of verbal communication , they learn to use body language to understand each other .
If a child learns to understand the body language of their pet , they will naturally extend that knowledge to have a better understanding of human body language in other situations later in life .
Pets also act as useful friends in difficult times for children .
Animals are non-judgemental , and will always love their young owners .
If the humans in the house are angry with a child , they can retreat to a quiet space with the pet .
It can even seem as if a pet understands a child ’s feeling of unhappiness .
Some psychiatrists deliberately use animals to improve communications with children who may be troubled and may have difficulties communicating with humans .
So what about the risks ?
Dog bites do represent a serious health issue associated with pet - keeping .
For example , in Belgium , one percent of the general population each year requires medical attention following a dog bite .
And surveys suggest that around 50 per cent of dog bites are not reported to the medical authorities .
Unfortunately , children do represent the most “ at risk ” section of the population .
Young children tend to “ treat ” their dog as a friend , and the most common physical interactions include touching , kissing , and hugging their pet .
Children can have difficulty in recognising the difference between a friendly dog , and one that is irritated and may be about to bite .
A young child is likely to carry on approaching a dog where an older person would realise that the dog was telling them to “ back off ” .
Research shows that the majority of bites are triggered by an interaction initiated by the child .
The majority of dog bites occur in the home environment during everyday activities .
They typically involve younger children ( 5 years of age on average ) and their own dogs during times of no adult supervision .
Any breed of dog can bite a child , but obviously , if a dog is bigger and stronger the consequences of a bite will be more severe .
There are some well - known high risk situations that include approaching a dog while it is eating or sleeping .
So what can parents do to minimise the risk to their children ?
Adult supervision of child - dog interactions is very important .
Parents should never leave young children completely alone with dogs .
Children should be given firm guidelines about interacting with their pets .
They should be taught that dogs have private space and private time .
They should learn to leave dogs alone when they are sleeping in their beds , and when they are eating food .
Experts in the field have recognised that it can be difficult for parents to teach young children about the correct way to behave with dogs .
An international initiative has recently developed an interactive computer story , known as the “ Blue Dog ” .
This has been designed to assist children between the ages of 3 and 6 years , and their parents , in learning the principles of safe interaction with a dog in the home setting .
The Kennel Club has also been proactive on this front , with an excellent interactive website known as “ Safe and Sound ” .
Dogs and children can mix well together , but it ’s up to adults to make sure that they do : when problems happen , there ’s no doubt where the finger of blame is pointing .
A homeowner shot at two people trying to break into her Scottsdale home after one kicked through the door , according to Scottsdale police Wednesday .
The 47 - year - old woman heard the doorbell ringing continuously Tuesday morning while she was sleeping at her home on the 10000 block of North 74th Place .
She looked through a peephole and did not recognize the person .
She then went to her room to get her cell phone and handgun , according to a press release .
When she returned , the first person , whose face was hidden by a hooded sweatshirt , backed away as another person kicked the door , knocking a hole through it .
The woman was knocked down and received some facial injuries , police said .
The woman then placed her gun through the hole and fired two rounds .
They fled in a dark Nissan Maxima , police said , and that 's when the woman called the police .
The woman , who did not require medical treatment , said she was unsure if either of the two suspects were wounded .
The case is under investigation .
In the north of Burkina Faso , not far to the east of one of the best - known backpacker destinations in West Africa , the Bandiagara Escarpment in Mali , lies the town of Koumbri .
It was one of the places where the Burkina Ministry of Health began a mass campaign five years ago to treat parasitic worms .
One of the beneficiaries , Aboubacar , then an eight - year - old boy , told health workers he felt perpetually tired and ill and had noticed blood in his urine .
After taking a few pills , he felt better , started to play soccer again , and began focusing on his schoolwork and doing better academically .
An international research team has studied the distribution of plant species in mountainous environments .
The study shows that mountain plant communities are not particularly resistant to invasion by exotic species .
The scientists also warn that these may become more aggressive as global warming gets a grip .
In 2005 , scientists from various science centres in Spain , Germany , Switzerland , Australia , the United States and Chile created the Mountain Invasion Research Unit ( MIREN ) in order to study the distribution of exotic species in high mountain species and to design experiments to confirm the invasive capacity of certain species in high mountain environments .
" These plant communities in Alpine environments have until now not been thought particularly vulnerable to this kind of environmental disturbance , " José Ramón Arévalo , one of the authors of the study and a researcher at the Department of Ecology of the University of La Laguna , said .
However , the experiments show clearly " that the beliefs about this supposed protection and mountain species ' resistance to invasive species is erroneous , " he adds .
The study , published recently in Frontiers in Ecology and The Environment , and which is part of the work done by MIREN , has made it possible to identify the factors that make plants in these areas more vulnerable to invasion by other species .
Among other factors , the scientists stress the ease of movement of propagules ( plants which can reproduce asexually in order to produce new plants ) as a result of human activity and the increase in environmental disturbance , the low levels of biological resistance of invaded plant communities , the increase in transport between high mountain areas that are far apart from each other , and the risks according to climate change models , " which will make it easier for invasive plants to establish themselves and reproduce , " the ecologist explains .
A work agenda to stem invasions
The work carried out over the last five years shows that " invasions may be a factor in more extensive and serious disturbance than had ever been thought , " says Arévalo .
The scientists also say there is a need to establish a work agenda to evaluate " not only current invasions , but also those that could happen in the future in mountainous environments , " warns the researcher .
Protecting against and above all preventing invasions could be done by means of experimental and modelling work .
Arévalo says " biological invasion is not a fact , but rather a process of species overlapping within a habitat , which means prevention is much more effective and viable than eradication . "
Watts has also found examples overseas , such as the weather station at Rome airport , which catches the hot exhaust fumes emitted by taxiing jets .
A weather station at Rome airport was found to catch the hot exhaust fumes emitted by taxiing jets .
The following is a popular picture used by climate change skeptics to attempt to show that there 's something seriously wrong with the the surface temperature record which is used to show that the world is getting hotter .
It appears to show that two weather stations with Stevenson screens are situated right at the end of the runway of Rome Ciampino .
It 's not hard to put two and two together and see that the wash from the engines of departing jets would cause the temperature indicated by the thermometers to be much too high .
Between the two Stevenson screened boxes is an automated weather observation station used by the airport .
So it too would be affected by aircraft wash .
Now , any pilot will tell you that knowing the barometric pressure at the airport ( as reported by the QFE code ) and the local temperature are vital data in setting the altimeter correctly when landing .
Aircraft altimeters work on atmospheric pressure and when approaching the airport the pilot is told the current pressure so they can set their instrument correctly .
The temperature also matters because it can affect the altimeter reading when the weather is cold .
Pilots need to know both accurately to land safely .
So does it seem likely that at Rome airport the weather station is heated by aircraft wash ?
Of course not , and if you zoom out from that picture and orient it North / South ( rather than South / North ) you 'll see a different picture :
You can make our the stations near the top left - middle of the picture .
They are far from the runway and positioned near an aircraft parking area .
If you are going to be a skeptic go with the Wikipedia definition : .
One picture does not a systematic investigation make .
That picture was alluded to in a Sunday Times article this weekend :
And The Daily Telegraph has a similar story : That statement is inaccurate .
The weather station is not near a taxiway , it 's near a parking area .
And not even a parking area next to the terminal building .
And even if it was , one bad thermometer does n't mean climate change can be thrown out the window .

When you sat down to illustrate The Ramayana , were you influenced by what you learned when you were storyboarding movies like A Bug 's Life or Monsters , Inc . ?
Of course .
In particular , I was influenced by something that happened when I was working with Brad Bird on The Incredibles .
I was storyboarding a scene where the family is finally reunited in the jungle after being separated .
It 's a really neat moment because throughout the movie , they never all get to use their superpowers together as a family , and it 's something you 're just dying to see .
Brad Bird told me , " Play around and see what kinds of visual ideas you can come up with . "
And so I did — it turned into this long , sprawling thing .
So Brad looked at all the material I presented him , and he sat me down and said , " Sanjay , these are great ideas .
But the problem is that if we do all of them , we slow down the movie to give the audience a big meal .
What I 'm trying to do is to make each one of these scenes feel like an appetizer .
We need to make this feel light and leave the audience wanting more . "
That 's the way I approached telling this immense epic , probably one of the longest stories put to page .
I took it as my job to create a small appetizer in each moment : he meets the monkey king , he confronts the demon .
If you research it , there 's so much depth in each of these moments .
But in each case , I had to choose one thing I could give to the audience .
The hardest part was paring it down without losing the essence .
And since this book is n't an animation , each image has to convey so much .
For instance , there 's the moment when Rama 's stepmother sends him into exile .
There 's so much going on in that picture : the queen 's finger pointing and the bracelets on her arms and the soldiers holding their spears and Rama bowing at her feet .
Those are all things I was definitely trying to convey .
I start out with a title — the title , in that case , was " Exile . "
From there , I think of a storytelling image .
I do n't think of multiple images — I just think about one iconic image .
When you think about Titanic , for instance , you think of the two of them on the bow of the ship .
There 's one image so potent that it burns into your memory .
Once I think of that image , I try to think the way we think when we 're creating an animated sequence — we ask ourselves , " If the sound was turned off in that scene , would the audience still get what we 're trying to convey ? "
Pictures are the fastest way to convey information .
They 're way faster than words .
So if someone was just flipping through my book in a cursory way , I wanted them to be able to say , " Things are good now , things are not so good now , the colors are bright , the colors are stripped down and he 's just using blues . "
And if they found that engaging , they might want read my little paragraph .
I thought that in that way , maybe I could get the audience interested in this ancient story .
The Court of Appeal has been urged to overturn a ban on the use of Irish in the courts in Northern Ireland .
Caoimhin Mac Giolla Cathain is challenging the dismissal of a legal case he took after being informed his application in Irish for an occasional drinks licence could not be considered .
Under the Administration of Justice ( Language )
Act of 1737 , all proceedings in NI courts must be in English .
The appeal was adjourned until Tuesday .
Mr Mac Giolla Cathain was seeking a liquor licence in connection with a musical concert in the Culturlann arts centre on the Falls Road in west Belfast .
Last summer , a High Court judge rejected his contention that the 1737 Act was incompatible with the European Charter for Regional and Minorities Language and secondly that the Act contravened his human rights .
His lawyers argued on Monday the legislation has already been repealed in Scotland and Wales .
Michael Lavery QC told a three - judge appeal panel headed by Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan that the government 's attitude had been " evasive and avoiding the issue " .
' Translation facilities ' Paul Maguire QC , for the Secretary of State , said Mr Mac Giolla Cathain 's ability to speak English was not in question .
" If this was a case of necessity it is highly likely , certainly in the criminal sphere and possibly also in the civil sphere , arrangements would have to be made to ensure proceedings were conducted in English but with the assistance of translation facilities , " he said .
" What distinguishes this case is this is not a case of language of necessity .
" In essence what the applicant seeks to do is express a preference to go to the courts and conduct the proceedings in the Irish language . "
A spokeswoman for Pobal , the umbrella group for Irish speakers , said the case is a litmus test for the Hillsborough Agreement .
Speaking ahead of the hearing , Chief Executive Janet Muller said the continued use of the " outdated law " was a key issue in light of an agreement over policing and justice .
" There is no excuse for keeping this discriminatory blanket ban and the decision of the court will give a clear indication of what priority equality for Irish speakers has within the current political climate , " Ms Muller said .
" Pobal has raised the issue of the 1737 Act with the Council of Europe , following meetings between the organisation and the committee overseeing the Charter for Regional or Minority Languages .
" The committee has been highly critical in the past about the 1737 Act and we expect that they will make further comments in their next report , due out in April , " Ms Muller added .

Imagine water freezing solid even as it's heating up .
Such are the bizarre tricks scientists now find water is capable of .
Popular belief contends that water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0 degrees Celsius ) .
Surprisingly , if water lies in a smooth bottle and is free of any dust , it can stay liquid down to minus 40 degrees F ( minus 40 degrees C ) in what 's called " supercooled " form .
The dust and rough surfaces that water is normally found in contact with in nature can serve as the kernels around which ice crystals form .
Now researcher Igor Lubomirsky at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot , Israel , and his colleagues have discovered another way to control the freezing point of water — via what are called quasi- amorphous pyroelectric thin films .
These surfaces change their electrical charge depending on their temperature .
When pyroelectic surfaces are positively charged , water becomes easier to freeze , and when they have a negative charge , it becomes harder to freeze .
The researchers saw that supercooled water could freeze as it's being heated , as long as the temperature changes the surface charge as well .
For instance , when supercooled water is on a negatively charged lithium tantalate surface , it will freeze solid immediately when the surface is heated to 17.6 degrees F ( minus 8 degrees C ) and its charge switches to positive .
Curiously , positively charged surfaces inspire supercooled water to freeze from the bottom up , while negatively charged surfaces cause it to freeze from the top down .
This likely has to do with how water molecules orient themselves — the negatively charged oxygen atoms in water molecules naturally point toward positively charged surfaces , while the reverse is true with hydrogen atoms .
" The difference between the positive and negative charge was unexpected , " Lubomirsky said .
The ability to better control the freezing temperature of supercooled water could be critical for a variety of applications , including the survival of cold - blooded animals , the cryo-preservation of cells and tissues , the protection of crops from freezing , and the ability to understand and trigger cloud formation .
The scientists detailed their findings in the Feb. 5 issue of the journal Science .
Conan O'Brien has a live tour in the works in which he will perform several shows in cities across the U.S. , according to The Wrap ,
According to his exit with NBC settlement , Conan is banned from hosting a new show until September .
But it did n't say anything about the comedian performing live .
It is not yet official , but O'Brien hitting the road is a great idea .
The tour will surely be a hit with his army of die hard fans who were enraged over the Late Night fiasco and will give O'Brien a few extra months in the limelight before he returns to TV , perhaps on Fox .
You must be thinking I ’m either crazy about brain , cupcakes , or both .
Actually is the brain - cupcake combination that intrigues me .
I ca n’t help it , I love brain cupcakes !
This time I found some crazy looking cupcakes made by Alicia Traveria , inspired by the popular TV show Futurama .
The vanilla cupcakes are made from scratch , the green slugs from gum paste with royal icing eyes and the pink brains are buttercream icing with a slight grenadine flavor .
Alicia baked the Brain Slug Cupcakes for a friend ’s birthday , but I ’m sure any Futurama fan would pay serious cash for a chance to feast on these babies .

President Obama called on Tuesday for repealing the health insurance industry ’s exemption from federal antitrust laws , escalating his attack on insurers as he tries to revive his stalled effort to overhaul the nation ’s health care system .
The White House sent Congress a statement throwing its weight behind a House bill to overturn parts of the McCarran - Ferguson Act of 1945 , which granted insurance companies broad protection from federal monopoly oversight and left regulation of the industry largely to state governments .
The president ’s move came a day after he proposed a new effort to crack down on insurers that are raising premium rates dramatically , part of a comprehensive health care plan that he posted on the White House Web site before a bipartisan summit meeting on Thursday .
But the antitrust repeal was not included in Mr. Obama ’s overall plan on Monday ; it was instead left to the separate House legislation .
“ Removing this exemption will allow appropriate enforcement and examination of potential policies that might prove uncompetitive , might stifle competition , ” said Robert Gibbs , the White House press secretary .
“ And we think this better promotes affordability and innovation through greater choice and less market concentration . ”
The proposed repeal has strong support among House Democrats , who included a version of it in the broader health care bill passed by the House last year .
But the fate of the repeal remains uncertain in the Senate , where Democrats did not incorporate it into their health care legislation .
Critics noted that mergers and some business practices were already subject to federal oversight and said that repealing McCarran - Ferguson provisions would do nothing to lower health care costs .
“ The rhetoric surrounding repeal of McCarran - Ferguson does not match the reality of the situation , ” said Karen Ignagni , president of America ’s Health Insurance Plans , an industry group .
“ Health insurance is one of the most regulated industries in America at both the federal and the state levels . ”
Mr. Obama signaled last October that he was interested in the issue when he said in a weekend radio and Internet address that Congress was right to study a possible repeal .
At the time , he complained that insurers were gouging customers and executives were “ earning these profits and bonuses while enjoying a privileged exemption from our antitrust laws . ”
His statement on Tuesday represented the first time he had taken a formal position .
Mr. Gibbs said the idea was not put into the overall health care plan posted on Monday because strategists believed there could be a bipartisan majority for repealing the exemption , separate from the main legislation .
The standalone repeal bill was devised as the first salvo in a dual - track strategy by Representative Nancy Pelosi , the California Democrat and House speaker , to advance elements of a health care overhaul one by one in case the comprehensive effort ultimately does not go forward .
Ms. Pelosi and Representative Louise M. Slaughter , Democrat of New York , pressed Mr. Obama for support during a private meeting last month , according to Congressional aides .
“ This industry has enjoyed a big giveaway for far too long , ” Ms. Slaughter said in a statement after the president ’s announcement Tuesday , “ and it ’s about time that it plays by the same rules as everyone else . ”
The Democratic leadership allowed the latest version of the bill to be introduced on Monday by Representatives Tom Perriello of Virginia and Betsy Markey of Colorado , two freshman Democrats who voted on opposite sides on the larger health care legislation last year .
Under the bill , health insurers would no longer be protected from liability for price - fixing , bid -rigging or dividing up market territories , according to the sponsors .
But after industry lobbying , the new version would not affect medical malpractice insurers .
About 95 percent of health insurance markets in the nation are “ highly concentrated , ” meaning that customers have only one or a few insurers to pick from .
Proponents of repealing the antitrust exemption argue that such concentration has created an anticompetitive situation permitting huge premium increases .
But the Congressional Budget Office , a nonpartisan agency , reported in October that repealing the antitrust exemption for health insurers would not make a huge difference in premiums , in part because state laws generally already barred the activities prohibited by the federal bill .
In terms of premiums , the report said , “ the magnitude of the effects is likely to be quite small . ”
Moreover , a Congressional Research Service report last month said that repealing the exemption could open the door to a flood of lawsuits challenging various insurer practices and could harm smaller insurers that share data because they do not have large pools of information of their own .
If the result is that small insurers can no longer share information , the report said , “ further consolidation in the insurance industry ” would be “ a likely , albeit ironic , possibility . ”
Michael Perelman teaches economics at California State University at Chico and is the author of fifteen books , including Manufacturing Discontent : The Trap of Individualism in Corporate Society ( Pluto Press , 2005 ) and Railroading Economics : The Creation of the Free Market Mythology ( Monthly Review Press , 2006 ) .
This essay is from his forthcoming Fouling the Nest : How Right - Wing Extremism and Business Incompetence Destroy American Prosperity .
Education is an essential part of modern economic progress , yet in recent decades , the right wing has consistently been unfriendly to public education .
For example , the Walton family ’s donation of $ 20 billion to help conservative causes was weighted toward the privatization of public education .
The right wing expresses a number of objections to public education .
Some religious conservatives protest that public education collides with their most cherished theological beliefs .
The most public examples are sex education and the gap between the scientific explanation of evolution and a fundamentalist religious belief about God ’s creation of the world .
The financial community looked forward to the establishment of educational maintenance organizations , so named to suggest that profit oriented schools would prosper in an education market , much like the health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) that have taken over much of the medical care in the United States .
Given the abominable reputation of the HMOs , the publicists for privatized education , with their eyes on skeptical public opinion , strategically renamed the educational maintenance organizations as educational management organizations .
Public education made an equally inviting target for politicians , who enthusiastically scored points with their constituents by expressing deep concern for the children left behind .
The same business and political leaders who cynically decry the sorry state of public education are largely responsible for the problem that they now call upon private education to solve .
They callously starved public education of needed support .
Some continue to do so with glee .
Because schools that serve blacks tend to be substantially inferior to schools that serve affluent whites , many blacks have understandably lost faith in the public school system .
The appeal to some blacks of the privatization of education is understandable .
Although segregation is unconstitutional in the United States , it remains embarrassingly common in schools .
This separation is more economic than racial , but black populations tend to be concentrated in poor areas .
Public schools largely depend upon local property taxation .
Because schools that serve the poor are generally located in areas with low property values , poor children rarely get the same educational opportunities as children from more affluent families .
For example , in 1989 , Chicago spent some $ 5,500 for each student in its secondary schools , compared to some $ 8,500 to $ 9,000 for each high school student in the highest spending suburbs to the north .
In New York during 1986 – 87 , funding per student was $ 11,300 in the upper - middle - class Long Island suburbs of Manhasset , Jericho , and Great Neck ; $ 6,400 in the largely working - class suburb of Mount Vernon ; and $ 5,600 in the high - minority New York City public schools .
Three years later , the figures were $ 15,000 , $ 9,000 , and $ 7,300 respectively .
Although the proportionate change was equal , the absolute changes favored the already rich districts .
Even if poor , urban schools within a particular school district were to receive nearly equal funding , they still must spend their resources differently .
Schools that service poor students have more need for special education , counseling , security , and so on .
To make matters worse , because teaching in poor schools is frequently more challenging than teaching in more affluent settings , many more experienced teachers prefer to teach in suburban schools , leaving impoverished schools with a greater proportion of less qualified instructors .
For example , teachers in schools with a large share of minority students are less likely to have a master ’s degree .
Higher salaries could attract more qualified teachers to those schools , but such funding is nowhere on the horizon .
Suburban schools are generally newer , while inner city and , to a lesser extent , rural schools are often in a state of disrepair .
As a result , the poorer school districts face higher costs of operating their physical plant than the more affluent suburban schools .
For example , a General Accounting Office report to Congress noted that “ one third of the nation ’s 80,000 public schools are in such poor repair that the fourteen million children who attend them are being housed in unsuitable or unsafe conditions . ”
Jonathan Kozol described a rather extreme instance : the Martin Luther King Junior High School in East St. Louis , Illinois , where sewage repeatedly backed up into the school , including the food preparation area .
In California , a state often equated with perpetual prosperity , many students have appallingly limited educational opportunities .
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a suit , Williams et al. v. State of California ( 1999 ) , which charged :
Many students lack textbooks of any kind .
Other students must rely on illegible or incomplete photocopies provided by teachers when and if teachers have time and the individual resources to make the copies … .
Sometimes three or four students to a book with no opportunity to take the book home and study for homework … .
Sometimes as few as 13 percent of the teachers have full non-emergency teaching credentials … .
Some California public schools …simply do not provide enough basic supplies , such as pencils , crayons , paper , and scissors .
These educational inequalities are inexcusable .
Rather than immediately addressing these inequities , for years the state wasted scarce resources in fighting the suit .
The children of the poor lack virtually every conceivable advantage over and above those already mentioned .
Poor children are more likely to grow up amidst greater family tensions , have poorer nutrition , and suffer from serious health problems , including lead poisoning , which affects mental abilities .
Their connections and their role models all fall well short of those of the well - to - do .
Where children grow up with the disadvantages of poverty , go to impoverished schools , and get virtually no feedback , they are unlikely to develop the sort of skills that legal market forces will reward .
Obviously , conventional roads to success are unlikely to be open to them .
A simple psychological experiment illustrates the deep inequities built into the educational system .
A pair of psychologists gave teachers the results of a test that supposedly predicted which students would be “ late bloomers . ”
The test proved remarkably accurate , except that there was no test at all .
Instead , the psychologists just chose students at random .
The teachers ’ acceptance of these results strongly affected the way they treated their students .
The students , in turn , responded positively , and this helped lead to educational success , except for the majority of students who were not predicted to succeed .
Class background creates something analogous to the fictitious test that purported to measure children ’s ability to improve in the near future .
Teachers immediately recognize the stigmas of lower - class life in their students , especially if the children entrusted to their care are not white .
Teachers have little reason to expect such children to succeed .
After all , relatively few of such children have succeeded in the past .
The children , in turn , are likely to perform according to the teachers ’ low expectations , confirming what the teachers believed all along .
Even the successes , such as those resulting from the “ late bloomer ” experiment , may only be temporary .
Herbert Kohl ’s heart wrenching book , 36 Children , tells the story of how a gifted teacher recognized students ’ potential and inspired them to excel .
The rest of the educational system then worked to snuff out the children ’s earlier successes , possibly making them worse off than if they had been consigned to failure all along .
Critics of public education ignore the lost potential of young people destroyed by such inequities ; instead they berate the educational system for bloated administrative structures that do little to promote education .
They never mention that a never ending flow of mandates accounts for a good part of this administrative bureaucracy .
For example , the cynically named No Child Left Behind Act requires that schools spend inordinate amounts of money for testing .
The estimated annual direct costs of testing are $ 400 million .
Because of the penalties that schools face for poor test performance , school systems have little choice but to spend even more money for services that are supposed to improve test results .
The money spent on these tests of dubious value could easily be spent on more productive activities .
However , from another perspective , this diversion of funds into nonproductive channels is welcome .
By deflecting schools from education , the emphasis on testing undermines public education and further fuels those calling for outright privatization .
Given the disastrous conditions of public education for the poor , conservatives piously call for the privatization of education without any suggestion that once they have achieved their goal they would follow up their victory with tax increases sufficient to give the new system a chance to work .
Instead , these politicians pretend that the imagined savings supposedly made possible by the supreme managerial efficiency of private business will be more than enough to finance the improvement of education — a promise similar to those once made by advocates of health maintenance organizations .
Other promoters of privatized education relish a tactical opportunity to create a divide between blacks and teachers ’ unions , whose members reliably vote Democratic .
In an answer to the question : “ What do you look for in an issue to go after or to recommend to the Republican Party to pursue ? ” Grover Norquist , head of Americans for Tax Reform and one of the most influential Republican strategists in Washington , responded :
Does it divide the left ?
School choice reaches right into the heart of the Democratic coalition and takes people out of it .
It divides the left because the teachers ’ unions are on one side and all the parents of poor children are on the other and it makes Bill Clinton choose between poor parents and teachers ’ unions .
Barbara Miner cited a number of other right - wing leaders and organizations who echoed Norquist ’s sentiments , including Terry Moe , a senior fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution and coauthor of the book , Politics , Markets , and America ’s Schools :
[ The issue comes down to ] a matter of power … .
[ The National Educational Association and American Federation of Teachers ] have a lot of money for campaign contributions and for lobbying ….
They also have a lot of electoral clout because they have many activists out in the trenches in every political district … .
No other group can claim this kind of geographically uniform political activity .
They are everywhere .
[ School vouchers are a way to diminish that power . ]
School choice allows children and money to leave the system , and that means there will be fewer public teacher jobs , lower union membership , and lower dues .
Not surprisingly , “ conservative foundations that also support taxpayer funded vouchers for private school students and charter schools operated independently of traditional school district supervision ” have begun to fund rival teacher ’s organizations , such as the Alabama Conference of Educators .
Supporters of the privatization of education insist that school vouchers that allow students to purchase education in the free market will eliminate the inequities in education .
However , if the right - wing gambit to finance education through vouchers succeeds , the debate will quickly shift .
The first step will be to make vouchers means tested , meaning that people earning above a certain income will no longer be eligible .
In the process , education will become redefined as an entitlement , like other welfare programs .
Programs for the poor inevitably become poor programs .
Soon , taxpayers will protest having to subsidize the undeserving ; they will demand that schools eliminate their “ frills . ”
The outcome will be that the politicians will relieve the rich of much of the tax obligation of supporting education , while the poor will see their educational opportunities degrade even further .
Privatization will add to the profits of corporations that fund the conservative initiatives , while , as Grover Norquist and Terry Moe have noted , dividing those who suffer most under the current system from the teachers ’ unions .
Teachers ’ unions oppose privatization of education on several grounds .
They question that the state will be able to monitor and control the quality of private education .
Private providers will have the advantage of being able to cherry pick by excluding difficult students or students with special needs .
Because public education will have to service most of the physically and emotionally disabled students , they will have difficulty matching the results of the private providers , unless the latter prove to be absolutely incompetent .
Finally , even though schoolteachers are already underpaid , private providers will be freed from union contracts and will be able to make employment conditions much less favorable .
For service workers , such as custodians , the switch to private employers will be even harsher .
When teachers ’ unions highlight how teachers will suffer economically with these changes , the right wing portrays teachers as just another special interest group , who put their own selfish needs ahead of those of the poor , especially black , students in their care .
Teachers , of course , bear little responsibility for the inequities of the public school system , but the right wing has been very effective in painting teachers ’ unions as public enemies .
The rhetoric has become so heated that on February 23 , 2004 , Secretary of Education Rod Paige actually went so far as to call the teachers ’
National Education Association a “ terrorist organization . ”
Lost in these debates is the sad fact that no major political party seems ready to come to the aid of public education , which has long been a mainstay of the U.S. economy .
The economic effects of privatization will not be felt immediately .
Over time , however , as a larger share of the workforce suffers the handicap of inferior education , the negative effect on all aspects of society will be unmistakable .

John Murtha was re-admitted to the hospital after undergoing gall bladder surgery .
Murtha in stable condition
Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha is in stable condition in the intensive care unit of a Virginia hospital because of a serious complications related to gall bladder surgery last week .
The 77 - year - old Democrat underwent scheduled laparoscopic surgery to remove his gallbladder at Bethesda Naval Hospital last Thursday but then , after his release , sought care at the Virginia Hospital Center over the weekend .

The congressman ’s spokesman declined to say Tuesday what led him to be hospitalized again .
But responding to questions Wednesday , he said that Murtha was in stable condition .
Two persons said it appeared Murtha ’s intestine had been cut inadvertently during the gall bladder removal .
The Hospital Center , located in Arlington , confirmed that Murtha was a patient in its intensive care unit but referred all questions about his condition to his family .
A powerhouse in the House Appropriations Committee and close friend of Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D — Cal. ) , Murtha was hospitalized for in December as well when he suffered an infection in his gall bladder .
The doctors then decided that it should be removed once the infection had been tempered , and that set up the surgery last week at Bethesda .
In the interim , Murtha has been back in the Capitol and active in the House .
In his familiar style , he returned quickly from Bethesda in December — with IV bandages still on him — so as to oversee passage of his defense appropriations bill .
Last week , prior to the surgery , he was voting on the House floor , meeting on Haiti relief , and laying the groundwork for handing the administration ’s new request for war funding related to the war in Afghanistan .
Details of that request were spelled out in President Barack Obama ’s budget Monday and include a footnote of sorts to Murtha ’s own career .
Along with funds for the Defense and State Departments , the White House confirmed it will also be asking for $ 13.4 billion to pay veterans claims arising from the use of the herbicide Agent Orange in the Vietnam War — where Murtha served as a Marine .
Pelosi , who spoke with Murtha ’s chief - of - staff John Hugya , said Tuesday evening that her sense was the medical situation was under control , but that the chairman faced a long recovery that could keep him sidelined until after the President ’s Day recess .
“ I think it will be a few weeks before he is back , ” the speaker old POLITICO .
“ It ’s serious that he needs to recover … .
We ’re praying that he is comfortable .
We know he will get up . ”
WASHINGTON — Hours before Democrats passed a historic cloture motion to advance the health care bill , one of its critical backers announced that his vote remains conditional on a set of demands .
It had better not tax the rich , Sen. Ben Nelson ( D - NE ) said Sunday in an appearance on CNN ’s State of the Union , or he could withdraw his support .
CNN paraphrased Nelson as saying , “ Imposing a tax on wealthier Americans , a funding mechanism employed in the House health care reform bill , could also cause him to withhold his vote for the final version of the bill . ”

A surtax on the wealthiest Americans is one method Democrats have considered to pay for the bill ’s $ 871 billion price tag over 10 years .
But in the series of cloture votes ahead , Democrats ca n’t afford to lose the support of a single member , so Nelson ’s demand is likely to be be taken seriously .
“ I ’m an independent - minded sort of person , ” Nelson said .
“ And I think that ’s demonstrated .
I do n’t take my marching orders from a party or a group or any other entity . ”
The legislation currently contains a 10 percent excise tax on indoor tanning services , according to the CBO , which was added in lieu of a 5 percent tax on cosmetic surgery .
Nelson did not address either of these specifically , but they could fall under the purview of a tax on rich Americans .
A November poll conducted by the Associated Press found that Americans are largely supportive of taxing the wealthiest to pay for health care reform .
ADVERTISEMENT
The House health care bill , which passed in November , slaps a 5.4 percent income tax surcharge on individuals making more than $ 500,000 annually , as well as families making more than $ 1 million .
Nelson also reiterated his earlier stance that restrictions on abortions must be strong , or else he could back out .
This position led to a series of 11th hour negotiations with the Democratic leadership that ultimately won his approval .
Finally , Nelson insisted there be no public option in the final bill — which was scrapped last week due to recalcitrant senators — or Democrats could lose his vote .

“ I suppose putting in a public option would do it , ” Nelson said on CNN .

“ Close on the heels of the inconclusive end to the Copenhagen Accord , the US government has stepped up pressure on the World Bank not to fund coal - fired power plants in developing countries .
In a letter sent to the World Bank , a copy of which is with TOI , United States Executive Director Whitney Debevoise said , “ The Obama Administration believes that the Multilateral Development Banks ( MDBs ) have a potentially critical role to play in the future international framework for climate finance , and , in particular , to assist developing countries in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and strengthening their economies ’ resilience to climate risks . ”
Referring to the guidelines as a product of “ internal US government deliberations ” , Debevoise has advised MDBs to “ remove barriers to and build demand for no or low carbon resources ” .
Though the US Treasury Department ( USTD ) is a statutary body and its recommendations are not binding on the World Bank , the move , the first - of - its - kind , is believed to have created pressure on the bank . …
Following Debevoise ’s controversial guidelines , the axe has already fallen on Pakistan ’s Thar Coal and Energy Project on the grounds that “ the limited financing available from the Bank should be directed toward investments that address energy supply shortfalls in an environmentally sustainable manner ” .
According to sources , the next coal - fired power project to be affected will be one from South Africa . ” “ US to World Bank : Do n’t fund coal - fired plants ” h/t Energy Tribune
MUMBAI : Had it not been for the seven - centimetre - long tumour in Ashok Shivnani 's right kidney , doctors at Lilavati , who were scheduled to operate on him , would never have stumbled on a case that is rarer than rare in medical history .
Suspecting that something was not quite normal when they viewed the scans and X - rays of the tumour , the medicos ordered a two - dimensional echocardiogram and angiogram of the 64 - year - old patient .
It was then that they realised , to their shock , that most of his abdominal organs and blood vessels were either reversed or misplaced .
Shivnani's case comes closest to a rare congenital disorder called ' situs inversus ' , in which the organs of the chest and abdomen are arranged in a mirror - image reversal of normal positioning .
Doctors say that he is , in all probability , the only person in the world to have such a haphazard abdominal structure .
The echocardiogram revealed that the positions of Shivnani's IVC ( inferior vena cava , which brings impure blood to the heart and is on its right ) and aorta ( which takes pure blood from the heart and is on the left ) were reversed .
" When I first saw the reports , I actually thought I was holding them wrong .
Along with the reversed position of the aorta and IVC , the scans also showed that Shivnani had a second IVC coming out from the tumour - infected kidney , which joined the original IVC at the bottom of his abdomen .
It would have been most difficult to proceed with the surgery under these circumstances , " said Dr Anoop Ramani , the uro-oncologist surgeon , who performed the surgery on Shivnani .
" Not only was there a duplication of the IVC , but the IVC above the kidney was totally closed .
While operating , we are supposed to know the exact location of everything we are going to touch .
But in this case , we were not sure which veins were entering where , " said Dr Prakash Sanzgiri , cardiologist from Lilavati .
Hence , it became necessary to reschedule the surgery from January 29 to February 4 , as the doctors needed more time to decide how to deal with the problem .
But that was not all .
During the course of the surgery to remove the infected kidney , the doctors came across more startling facts about Shivnani 's organ structure .
There were three blood vessels which took blood to his infected kidney .
He had no small intestine , and his large intestine was very small .
His liver had also split into two parts , one on each side .
" We generally perform surgeries laparoscopically for renal cancer .
It is difficult to perform the surgery even without the strange organ structure .
Thankfully , we did a laparoscopic surgery , in which we could see everything ten times the actual size on the screen , " said Dr Ramani .
" It is the first time I have seen such a case in my 15 - year career , " he added .
However , the doctors maintained that Shivnani did not need any treatment for his abnormal organ structure .
" Generally , people suffering from situs invertus lead a fairly asymptomatic life .
This is also the case with Shivnani .
He will not need any surgery to change the positions of the organs and veins , " said Dr Desai .

What is it with these Republicans who constantly pretend they want to clean up a system , but when it comes to the specifics , they really just want to keep the status quo .
While discussing what needs to be done to fix Wall Street , David Frum expresses his concern for throttling " the creativity of the system " .
As Naomi Klein and Eliot Spitzer point out to him , it was exactly that " creativity " that got us into the mess we 're in now .
ZAKARIA : On that note , we are going to take a break and come back , and discuss all of this and more .
We will be right back .
What we need is adherence to very simple principles of ethics and transparency in the marketplace .
And then , it would work .
We have had for 15 or 20 years an absence of enforcement , except with a few nodes of activism , which gets beaten down over time .
SPITZER : Well , let me respond .
I got it .
Not to make this partisan , but ...
And then , be careful about doing too much , because you can throttle something that I think is precious to everybody , which is the creativity of the system .
FRUM : The fix is here .
There 's a -- let 's do -- there are technical fixes , the kinds of things I 've said about the way banks hold their securities .
[...]
ZAKARIA : And we are back with our star - studded panel -- Eliot Spitzer , David Frum , Naomi Klein and Steve Dubner .
What should be the purpose of financial regulation moving forward ?
KLEIN : And this is n't a free market system .
That 's what 's been revealed in this crisis .
It 's a classic , crony capitalist system , where favors are traded amongst the elites .
And , you know , I have to -- this idea that we are going to squelch creativity , you know , I think there 's definitely been too much creativity in the realm of derivatives trading .
I mean , we would all do with them being a little less creative , and maybe go into the arts , you know , take up creative writing .
( LAUGHTER )
This is not helping .
But the idea ...
ZAKARIA : Because the bonuses are huge in the arts .
( LAUGHTER )
KLEIN : But the idea that we suffer from an under-reaction ...
SPITZER (? ) : If you ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) long enough they are , if you have possession of the tapes ( ph ) .
KLEIN : The idea that we suffer from an under-reaction to this crisis -- an over - reaction to this crisis -- to me is absurd .
I mean , this has been the most incredible under-reaction , if we look at what we have some consensus about in terms of what caused the crisis .
The over - leveraging of the banks , the fact that derivatives are not regulated , the fact that the banks are too big to fail , the fact that they 've become so intermingled -- we have not dealt with a single one of them , a single one of them , a year - and - a - half later .
We have not reacted .
And in the meantime , we 've put around $ 14 trillion on the table and used none of the leverage .
And the whole premise of banking is that , when you 're handing out money , you can put conditions on it .
You can ask for all kinds of things .
And it is just extraordinary that they blew that moment of leverage .
DUBNER : Can I ask you a question ?
So , you seem to -- I may interpret this wrong -- but you seem to feel that government is kind of handcuffed in this situation .
You feel that -- you three have very different views -- I 'm sorry .
I do n't mean to be jumping in your chair .
( LAUGHTER )
It 's just that there 's interesting perspectives .
We all have -- we have some very , very different views of how and why and to what end government should be regulating , intruding , whatever we want to call , in all these different realms .
My question to all of us is , however , no matter what you want and think is not being done , no matter what you 're afraid may be done , to me the question is the larger one , which is , government right now in Washington is at this bizarre place -- we were talking about this earlier -- where , if it 's not paralyzed or broken , it 's pretty darn close .
It 's really hard to -- it 's really hard for me , as someone who does n't really traffic in the political realm willingly or all that often , to see , where 's a good outcome here from a political perspective , because I do n't see it .
ZAKARIA : And by the way , on any issue , if you look at , you know , immigration , energy , it 's just -- it 's paralyzed , in general .
FRUM : The United States government does n't govern all that well .
We 'll concede that .
But the American private sector does deliver unbelievable things .
And we 're sitting here at the end of a period of extraordinary technical innovation .
And not just -- I mean , the Internet , we 're all familiar with .
But all kinds of products , and products that people want .
The ability of people to tap the equity in their homes when they face a financial crisis , that is a good innovation .
The availability of more than one -- lots of kinds of mortgage to people in different kinds of circumstances .
There are a lot of reasons why a rational person might intelligently want an interest - only mortgage .
That can be a useful instrument .
We have the ability to raise capital to finance development all over the planet .
And the idea that ...
( CROSSTALK )
... you say , well , let 's give it to the poets , I mean , I 'm all for the poets .
But what we -- to be at the end of this period , it 's like being in one of the railway crises of the middle 19th century and saying , eh , nothing real was accomplished .
Something real was accomplished over the past 20 years .
( CROSSTALK )
SPITZER : ( UNINTELLIGIBLE ) very effectively to then beat it down .
All of us here -- I 'll talk for myself .
I do n't want to speak for others .
I am a devout capitalist .
I believe in the creativity , the innovation , the conflict that emerges -- let me finish .
The reality is that we have an economy right now that has tremendous innovative capacity , but also , over a 10 - year period , has not created any net jobs .
And the distribution of those proceeds is getting less and less equal .
And our position vis -a - vis the rest of the world in terms of debtor - creditor situation , our world power -- 100 different metrics you could use -- we 're on the losing end .
And therefore , we have to step back and say , how do we extend those benefits , and both continue them and make sure we create an environment where they can ...
( CROSSTALK )
ZAKARIA : But do you worry that you 're ...
SPITZER : And that 's where we are not ...
( CROSSTALK )
FRUM : I 'm not going to dispute with you on that .
And it 's true .
I mean , not enough of this came through to the typical worker during the years from 2001 to 2007 .
That was a big problem .
And there a lot of things we can talk about to fix that , including getting control of health care costs , which has been the great burden on the incomes of middle income people .
But let us not crush the creativity .
And let us not look for a financial solution to economic problems .
ZAKARIA : On that note , thank you all very much .
We will be back right after this .
The United Nations climate panel faces a new challenge with scientists casting doubt on its claim that global temperatures are rising inexorably because of human pollution .
In its last assessment , the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) said the evidence that the world was warming was " unequivocal . "
It warned that greenhouse gases had already heated the world by 0.7C and that there could be 5C - 6C more warming by 2100 , with devastating impacts on humanity and wildlife .
New research casts doubt on such claims , however .
Some even suggest the world may not be warming much at all .
" The temperature records can not be relied on as indicators of global change , " said John Christy , professor of atmospheric science at the University of Alabama in Huntsville , a former lead author on the IPCC .
The doubts of Christy and a number of other researchers focus on the thousands of weather stations around the world , which have been used to collect temperature data over the past 150 years .
These stations , they believe , have been seriously compromised by factors such as urbanization , changes in land use and , in many cases , being moved from site to site .
Christy has published research papers looking at these effects in three different regions : east Africa , California and Alabama .
" The story is the same for each one , " he said .
" The popular data sets show a lot of warming but the apparent temperature rise was actually caused by local factors affecting the weather stations , such as land development . "
The IPCC faces similar criticisms from Ross McKitrick , professor of economics at the University of Guelph , Canada , who was invited by the panel to review its last report .
The experience turned him into a strong critic and he has since published a research paper questioning its methods .
" We concluded , with overwhelming statistical significance , that the IPCC 's climate data are contaminated with surface effects from industrialization and data quality problems .
These add up to a large warming bias , " he said .
Such warnings are supported by a study of U.S. weather stations co-written by Anthony Watts , an American meteorologist and climate change sceptic .
His study , which has not been peer reviewed , is illustrated with photographs of weather stations in locations where their readings are distorted by heat - generating equipment .
Some are next to air - conditioning units or are on waste treatment plants .
One of the most infamous : a weather station next to a waste incinerator .

Did you know that slave women could ( and would ) have their children just taken away from them ?
Families were split apart .
A child sold here , a husband or wife sold there .
On any given day you could be snatched from the street without notice , or sold to another plantation .
Black people were chattel , not people .
We had no rights .
We could n't walk down the street without a damn pass from our " masters . "
Blacks in the North who were FREE were stolen and SOLD into slavery because they so - called matched a description of a missing slave .
Black women were regularly raped by their " masters " and abused by their jealous wives , they were forced to " mate " with Black men that they may not have even KNOWN for breeding purposes .
We were n't even allowed to read , we could be PUNISHED for reading .
We could n't even go to school .
We had no vote , no voice , and were not even considered a FULL person .
And that 's just the people who managed to survive the trip over on the ships where they were packed in like sardines .
And all of this is preferable to abortion ( and this is just scratching the surface ) and giving a woman the right to choose ?
And I have n't even started on the EFFECTS of slavery ( which are arguably still being felt today )

A study has found babies delivered during a home birth are seven times more likely to die from complications than during a planned hospital birth .
The study , published in the Medical Journal of Australia , compared all births in South Australia between 1991 and 2006 .
The study 's author , Professor Marc Keirse , says there was no difference in mortality rates overall , but the risk of babies suffering from a lack of oxygen during a home birth delivery was 27 per cent higher .
" What we found out was of the babies who died during labour from shortage of oxygen and that kind of thing , the risk was substantially higher in home births than in hospital births , " he said .
" The second thing we found was that whereas the risks of babies dying during labour decreased over a number of years , it had not in home births . "
Professor Keirse says home births only accounted for about 0.4 per cent of all South Australian births during the 16 - year period .
He says most of the complications arose when women took risks with home births .
" It was mostly due to women who really should not give birth at home , such as women with a breach presentation , women who have a pregnancy who goes beyond term , or women with twins just determined to give birth at home , " he said .
The Australian Medical Association ( AMA ) says the study should prompt more thought about expanding public funding for home births .
The national president of the AMA , Dr Andrew Pesce , believes there is political pressure to expand the availability of home births , but the study provides evidence to consider first .
" If the Government is thinking about home births and expanding or improving access for home births then it should be done within a system which recognises the risks and is set up to deal with those risks , " he said .
" Otherwise we 'll continue to have preventable deaths of babies in Australia . "
Editor 's note : ( February 24 )
This story should have featured balancing comment from home birth advocates on the particular issues raised in the study .
These views have been canvassed in other reports , two of which are available here and here .
BJ Penn ’s Vicious Leg Kick Cuts Diego Sanchez ( GIF )
BJ Penn proved why he ’s the best lightweight in the world .
Coming into a match up that was said to be a competitive match up , pitting the number one contender Diego Sanchez against the champ , but nothing of the sort happened Saturday night .
Penn destroyed Sanchez en route to a 5th round TKO stoppage due to a vicious cut .
Sanchez who is known for his unlimited gas tank , and tremendous heart had no answer for the boxing , and take - down defence of Penn .
Sanchez attempted an astounding 27 take - downs and was not successful in securing one .
Another telling stat of the domination of Penn was the measly 8 punches landed by Sanchez during the entirety of the fight .
Penn was able to come out in a blister and rock Sanchez early in the first round , but to Sanchez ’s credit he was able to weather the storm .
But do n’t mistake this for him doing anything offensive , Sanchez was merely holding on the entire fight and posed no offensive threat .
It almost looked like BJ let up after rocking Sanchez just in order to fight more .
Penn has long been questioned for his cardio and dedication to the sport but with the showing last night , all these questions were answered .
With a vicious head kick in the 5th Penn cut Sanchez wide open , with blood spraying out .
The doctor was forced to stop the bout .
The question now becomes where Penn goes from here .
With no clear contenders left , one would think another venture into the welterweight division might be warranted .
Not the MMA math means anything , but , Sanchez gave both Josh Koshchek and Jon Fitch very close fights , although losses .
One would think Penn would fare much better just simply based on the method in which he beat Sanchez down .
So to me the best thing for BJ and his fans is to move up and work his way to a welterweight title shot against Georges St. Pierre .
GSP - Penn III anyone ?

The documentary The People Vs. George Lucas takes the most revered and most reviled director to geek court .
Neil Gaiman , Gary Kurtz and droves of Star Wars fans and experts weigh in on film .
Lucas : great man or giant monster ?
Advertisement
Premiering at the SXSW film festival is this amazing little documentary that shows the everyday battle we all fight in our love / hate relationship with George Lucas .
Diving deep into expert opinion and fandom rage and love the directors analyze the deep dark relationship we all have with Lucas and Star Wars .
THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS explores the titanic struggle between a Godlike filmmaker and his legions of fans over the most popular franchise in movie history .
" At its core , PvsG is the examination of a high - profile , dysfunctional love story " , says Philippe .
" George created this humongous and intricate sandbox for us to play in ; but is he the sole owner of it , or does it now belong to the ages ?
And what happens to your role as a creator when your audience claims it owns your art ?
We basically looked at the conflicted dynamic between George and his fans from a cultural perspective , and asked ourselves those questions . "
The SXSW film festival runs from March 12th to the 21st , in Austin , Texas .
Item # : SCP-008
Object Class : Euclid
Special Containment Procedures : SCP -008 samples have been deemed Class V extreme biological hazards , and all related protocols apply .
Incineration and irradiation measures will be deployed in the event of political or military action which may result in the facility being dismantled ; a power failure ; or zero communications from operatives or outside channels during any given eight hour period .
The quarantine period for operatives leaving the facility is four months .
If a breach has occurred , incineration and irradiation measures shall be deployed .
It should be the policy of all G2 sites to not prepare an evacuation procedure .
Description : SCP -008 is a complex prion , samples of which are stored in each of the known G2 sites .
Research into SCP -008 is highly classified and primarily aimed at preventing research which may lead to the synthesis of SCP - 008 in the distant future .
Traits of the SCP - 008 prion include :
100 % infectiousness .
100 % lethality .
Transmission through exposed mucous membranes and all bodily fluids .
Not airborne or waterborne .
Symptoms of infection with SCP - 008 manifest no more than three hours after exposure , and include :
Flu - like symptoms with high fever , plus severe dementia in later stages .
Coma onset approximately 20 hours after first symptoms appear and 12 hours after noticeable dementia .
Coma onset will be considered onset of death .
A period of sporadic cellular necrosis occurs which comes to resemble gangrene .
Surviving tissue assumes its original function and is highly resilient .
Red blood cells greatly increase oxygen storage capacity , resulting in slower blood flow and increased muscle endurance and strength .
Nervous and muscular systems are unaffected by total organ failure for several hours .
Metabolism may decrease to extremely low levels , allowing subject to survive for over 10 years without nutrition .
High blood viscosity results in negligible blood flow from gunshot , puncture , and slashing injuries .
Conditioned behavior , motor controls , and instinctive behavioral mechanisms are damaged , and cognitive abilities are severely retarded and erratic .
Animals experience excessive brain necrosis and are inactive .
Subject can adapt to its damaged nervous systems but is limited to basic physical activities , including standing up , balancing on two legs , walking , biting , grabbing , and crawling .
Subject will energetically move towards sights , sounds , and smells it associates with living humans .
Subject will attempt to ingest living humans if physical contact is made .
Neutralizing fully - infected subjects requires significant cranial trauma .
There is strong evidence to suggest SCP - 008 itself did not form naturally on Earth , since variants of similar complexity would have displaced much of the ecosystem .
In 1959 , a short collaborative effort with the USSR to locate G2 sites and eliminate SCP - 008 was negotiated following their discovery .
The status of SCP - 008 in Russian custody since collaboration ended is unknown .
Addendum 008-1 : SCP - 500 has been found to be able to completely cure SCP - 008 even in the advanced stages of the disease .
Medical equipment used for diagnosis of patients with heart disease and cancer could be a key weapon in stopping nuclear waste seeping into the environment , according to new research .
A team of scientists from the Universities of Manchester and Leeds have joined forces with experts in nuclear medicine at Manchester Royal Infirmary , using medical gamma-ray cameras to track radioactive isotopes in soil samples from a US civil nuclear site .
This is the first time the technique , which is used in hospitals for heart , bone and kidney scanning , has been used to study the environmental behaviour of nuclear waste -- and its success could help scientists find new ways of using bacteria to control the spread of radioactivity .
Radioactive isotopes of the element technetium ( Tc ) are produced in bulk by nuclear facilities , while a specific isotope of Tc with a very short life is routinely used as a medical tracer in human bodies .
Nuclear fission of Uranium has released tonnes of Tc from nuclear facilities over the past decades , with the element remaining radioactive for thousands of years .
But although the short lived medical isotope is chemically indistinguishable from that in long lived waste , it can be used safely in tests .

In the study researchers from The University of Manchester , led by Prof Jon Lloyd , took soil samples from the Oak Ridge nuclear facility in the United States and successfully tracked the movement of medical Tc through the soil .
Scientists at The University of Leeds were then asked to verify the observations using a special microscope technique called Transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) .
With the help of DNA analysis the Manchester team confirmed that certain microbes -- and particularly some that use ferric iron for energy -- can fix Tc in place in soils .
Researchers found that nearly all the Tc remained fixed when ferric iron was present with these ' iron - reducing ' bacteria .
This finding itself is not new -- Professor Lloyd and his colleagues had previously reported that microbes in laboratory cultures could perform this role in fixing Tc .
advertisement
But the researchers ' success in using the gamma camera could see the technique being used to probe how Tc and ferric iron move together in far more complex soil systems more representative of the ' real world ' -- helping develop future remediation techniques .
Prof Jon Lloyd from the School of Earth , Atmospheric and Environmental Science ( SEAES ) at The University of Manchester , said : " Using this medical scanning technique we were able to explore , in real time , the mobility of one of the most problematic and mobile radionuclides in sediments .
" Our success will allow scientists to accurately monitor the success of new biological methods in trapping radioactive elements in sediments and stopping them spreading further into the natural environment . "
The findings coincide with the opening of a new Research Centre for Geological Disposal at The University , supported by a £ 1.4 m endowment from BNFL , while a new Nuclear Medicine Centre recently opened at the Manchester Royal Infirmary , as part of the £ 500 m Central Manchester Hospitals development .
Prof Lloyd added : " Investment in these two diverse but important areas of scientific research has helped bring about interesting and unexpected research findings that could ultimately have great benefit for society . "
The research was published in a special edition of the American Chemical Society journal Environmental Science and Technology .

A US and another NATO soldier were killed in Afghanistan on Tuesday .
On the other side of the border , Pakistani Taliban sources announced that their leader , Hakimullah Mahsud , had died of wounds inflicted by a US drone attack .
Mahsud was allegedly behind a wave of bombings in Pakistan , and played a role in the suicide attack against a US base in southern Afghanistan , in which three CIA field officers were killed along with four private security contractors .
Many US analysts see Mahsud ’s death as a dire blow to the Pakistani Taliban .
But in my exprience Americans put too much emphasis on the CEO and not enough on the ordinary workers .
Another leader of the Pakistani Taliban will emerge .
Most insurgents in Afghanistan are from the Pashtun ethnic group , and Pashtuns for the most part are organized into small clans that are not very hierarchical ( i.e. the tribesmen think they ’re every bit as good as the chief and his uncle . )
So they know how to operate by using small cells and avoiding a corporate organization chart .
And revenge is a more common Pashtun attribute than admitting defeat .
Back in Afghanistan , McClatchy ’s Saeed Shah reports that only about 1200 residents have fled the Afghan city of Marjah in Nad Ali district , ahead of a major NATO / Afghan invasion planned for later this week .
The city of 80,000 is controlled by some 2000 Taliban fighters and there are many heroin labs , the profits of which help to support the Taliban .
The lucrative poppy crops grown in this region are all that is left of a 1950s & 1960s US irrigation scheme that went bad , and Marjah and environs were nicknamed “ Little America . ”
The refusal of locals to leave in any large numbers may be what prompted US commanders to begin telling the people of Marjah to ‘ stay inside their homes ’ and stay out of the way of the fighting .
This message is a 180 degree reversal of the earlier message , that locals should leave .
CBS News reports embedded with the US Marines outside Marjah , to the southwest of the Helmand capital of Lashkar Gah .
This report gives the impression that substantial numbers of civilians have left or are leaving , but this assertion appears not to be true .
The NATO / Kabul plan is to chase the Taliban out of Marjah , win local hearts and minds , and garrison it with Afghan army troops in the aftermath to ensure that the Taliban do not return .
This plan requires that the operation not do so much damage to the city and kill so many locals that they are alienated in the long term .
It also requires trustworthy Afghan troops who wo n’t just abuse their authority and who are good enough war fighters to fend off a Taliban return .
Local police in Halmand , at least , are proving a disappointment to NATO because of their high rates of drug use .
Troops found using heroin are immediately drummed out , but a local police commander admits that he cannot be so severe with the hashish users , since if he fired them all , nobody would be left .
Radio Azadi reports in Dari Persian that Mohammad Gul Mangal , the governor of Helmand said in an interview that the operation is designed to bring Marjah back under central government rule , after which a rebuilding and development program will be launched .
The question hanging over the Marjah campaign is whether it will allow a winning of hearts and minds .
But if it is highly destructive of local homes and the lives of locals , no amount of US PR will prevent an outpouring of grief and resentment .
And remember the Pashtun dedication to the vendetta and revenge .

I do n’t even know what to make of this :
The problem is the “ Medicare buy - in ” they are talking about might not at all resemble the Medicare buy - in that Dean wants .
A permanent , real Medicare buy - in for everyone between the ages of 55 - 64 would be a very positive development .
Even if eligibility were restricted to only 55 - 64 year - olds on the exchange ( self insured , uninsured , employees of small businesses ) , that would still be a step in the right direction .
My greater fear is that this “ Medicare buy - in ” has already been gutted or will soon be gutted of all value .
Kent Conrad is pushing to decouple this Medicare buy - in from Medicare .
Conrad wants to make it fake Medicare .
He wants people in this fake Medicare to pay much higher reimbursement rates .
and be placed in a separate risk pool .
The people in fake Medicare might not even be able to use the Medicare provider network .
This will make the premiums for Medicare buy - in dramatically higher , and might make the entire fake Medicare program unworkable .
Already , the Federal Association of Hospitals is pushing for something like this change to gut the proposal .
Look , I know legislation is always more complicated than it sounds , but how do you “ decouple ” a “ Medicare buy - in ” from “ Medicare . ”
That would seem to me to suggest that the “ medicare buy - in ” really is n’t , and instead is some sort of nonsense like “ Medicare Advantage , ” which was just a direct line from the treasury to insurance companies .

Taking a page from Broadway and George Lucas , Scholastic Inc. , the children ’s book publisher , is trying for a revival  with a prequel attached .
In April the company plans to reissue repackaged and slightly revised versions of the first two volumes in one of its most successful series , “ The Baby - Sitters Club , ” in the hopes of igniting enthusiasm in a new generation of readers .
And just as Mr. Lucas brought “ Star Wars ” back with a whole new arc of stories that began before the original series , Scholastic is publishing a newly written prequel , “ The Summer Before , ” by Ann M. Martin , the original author of “ The Baby - Sitters Club ” books .
The move follows Scholastic ’s 2008 resuscitation of “ Goosebumps , ” another of its most popular series .
For now Scholastic and Ms. Martin only have plans for the one prequel , although the publisher will release three more reissues of the original series later next year .
“ The Baby - Sitters Club , ” which ran from 1986 through 2000 , garnered an ardent following among preteenage girls throughout its run of 213 titles , with the publisher ultimately printing 176 million copies .
The series , which followed the baby - sitting adventures and friendships of four 12 - to - 13 - year - old girls  Kristy , Mary Anne , Claudia and Stacey ( the cast expanded to eight main characters later in the series )  spawned several spinoffs , including a mystery series and a collection of books about Kristy ’s little sister .
All of the books are now out of print .

11:03 am - Welcome to Not Racist Atoll
This morning I heard a car pulling into the driveway .
Looking out the window over the sink , I saw an entirely unfamiliar Cadillac being parked by a goblin in a suit .
I went outside , mug of dewspark in hand , to find out what he wanted .
The goblin appeared to be getting a briefcase or laptop case of some sort out of the passenger seat .
What ?
Yes , it 's relevant to the story that he was a goblin .
" Good morning ...
Can I help you with something ? "
He leaned out to look me over .
" No , " he gurgled somewhat dismissively .
" I do n't think so . "
Then he ...
Yes , I mean gurgled .
Oh , come on .
It 's not just an accent .
You 've heard them talk .
They f'ing gurgle .
Anyway , case in hand , he closed the door and locked it with his little key - fob , and was about to walk away .
" What the hell , dude ? " I said to him .
He stopped and looked back with his good eye .
" I 'm sorry ? " he asked .
Oh , let 's not pretend that they do n't have a potent eye and a cursed eye .
If he'd looked at me with his cursed eye , this would have become a different kind of story and you know it .
" Why are you leaving your car in my driveway ? " I asked .
" Driveway ?
This is my personal parking space at work , " he sniffed .
" My office is right over here . "
" Your what ...?
Bullshit .
Wait ...
Where 's your office , exactly ? "
He waved his arms ( and the briefcase ) around to sort of indicate the entire neighborhood , and the old - fish stank hit me .
What ?
What ?
I know they do n't all smell like old fish but this one most certainly did and you know what it means when they do .
It 's totally relevant .
I 'm not just bringing it up because I do n't like them .
" Okay , buddy , I think ... "
I started to say in as calm a voice as I could , but then he suddenly made the little devil - flick sign with his free hand .
The last of the dewspark in my mug magically superheated into explosive steam , blasting up at my ...
I 'll call it what I damn well want to , and I damn well want to call it magic .
It 's * not* superstitious of me !
It 's not like you know how they do it either , do you ?
No. Nobody does .
Probably they do n't even know how they do it .
That 's f'ing magic .
Anyway , once he threw a flick at me , the gloves were off .
I tossed the hissing mug onto the lawn hastily and got out my cold iron taser .
The shock of recognition flared in his good eye about two seconds later , but before he could glare a curse into me , I shot him full of juice and he exploded in a puff of smoke .
Given the reek and the obvious encroachment of insanity , he was n't long for the world anyway ; his glamour , the glamour that had no doubt enabled whatever career had bought that expensive Cadillac , was on its way out .
Oh , really ?
Name one goblin you know in a serious professional career who got there through being qualified and not through night - glamour .
In fact , name one f'ing goblin you actually know , personally , well enough to spend time with .
That 's what I thought .
I 'm no racist where people are concerned - elves are elves , whether sky or sea or forest or cave - but let 's not kid ourselves : goblins are something else entirely .

In a famous passage from “ Ulysses , ” James Joyce recapitulates the development of the English language in 45 pages — from the archaic and formal ( “ Deshil Holles Eamus ” ) to the conversationally casual ( “ Pflaap ! Pflaap !
Blaze on ” ) .
Over the past decade , as more people have spent more time writing on the Internet , that same evolution has not only continued , it feels like it ’s accelerated .
With so much discussion about how the Internet is changing journalism and media , there ’s surprisingly little said about how writing itself has transformed .
But it has changed in a dramatic if subtle way .
[ digg=http://digg.com/educational/How_the_Internet_Changed_Writing_in_the_2000s_2]
Nine years ago , I remember being one of 100 or so journalists gathered to listen to a veteran writer speak .
I do n’t remember the topic , just that when he asked how many of us enjoy writing , I was surprised that only a few hands went up .
Today , so much of the typical day is taken up with writing emails , tweets , updates , text messages , chat sessions , blog posts and the occasional longer form writing .
And few complain how onerous it all is .
On balance , all of that practice is making online writing better .
Which is not to say that all online writing is good .
Much of it ’s terrible – see the average YouTube comment for an example of how bad it can be .
But it ’s been said that excellent writing is a matter of good thinking – if you ’ve got the thinking part down , that ’s most of the battle .
And many of the thoughtful people I know are producing some great stuff on the web .
The Internet is n’t just prompting us to write more , its open structure pressures us to write in a way that ’s at once more concise and flexible .
One problem newspapers and magazines never could fix is that articles are assigned arbitrary lengths .
Pay writers per word and they ’ll write as many as they can .
Assign a 12,000 - word story and you ’ll get just that , even if 1,000 are all that ’s necessary .
On the web it ’s different .
Back in 1997 , Jakob Nielsen looked at how people read web content ( basically , they scan it ) and argued web writing should
– highlight keywords ( often using hypertext links )
– use straight , clear headlines and subheads
– deliver one idea per paragraph
– cut word count to half that of conventional writing
– employ bulleted lists .
Many web writers , whether they ’ve read Nielsen ’s advice or not , use these practices because readers respond to them .
The impulse to scan is a good thing because readers ’ impatience inspires economy among writers .
At the same time , people are mastering more kinds of writing .
Other technologies that grew more popular this decade required a different mode of expression : Instant messaging invited a breezy , fast - thinking tone ; blog comments ( again , the thoughtful ones ) sharpened our debate skills ;
Twitter enforced even more economy onto our words .
In all of these , we were nudged toward something all writers aspire to : a strong , distinct voice .
Having a clear voice has grown more important on the web , where writers worry about brand - building , news sites grow interactive and blog posts resemble conversations .
Some do n’t regard texting and chat as writing , while others argue that they ’re killing longer and more formal prose .
Both notions are wrong .
The informal writing we do on the web does n’t supplant formal writing , it complements and influences it — and is influenced in return .
Not all of the Internet ’s effects on writing have been positive .
Many bloggers tailor headlines and posts so that they ’ll surface at the top of search results , making them at once easier to find and less enjoyable to read .
And this decade , a lot of other bloggers mistook a strong writing voice for caustic irreverence .
But most eventually learned that writing with snark is like cooking with salt — a little goes a long way .
On the other hand , concerns about the Internet hurting writing feel overblown .
Some educators worry that the Internet is making teenagers way too casual in their writing , so that they never learn more formal composition .
I disagree .
The best way to learn good writing is to write a lot .
Besides , language is always evolving , and a more conversational English is n’t a bad thing .
“ Writing , when properly managed … is but a different name for conversation . ”
Laurence Sterne wrote that in Tristram Shandy 250 years ago .
Thanks to the Internet , it ’s more true now than ever .

So why do conspiracy theories flourish ?
Though some of the conspiracy - mongers described here appear to be simple crackpots or people out to make a fast buck with one of those laughably titled books that aspire to clutter up the best - seller lists ( “ Henry Kissinger : Soviet Agent , ” “ Diana : The Killing of a Princess , ” “ Rule by Secrecy : The Hidden History That Connects the Trilateral Commission , the Freemasons and the Great Pyramid ” ) , Mr. Aaronovitch tries to provide the reader with a carefully reasoned anatomy of the phenomenon in these pages .
He not only notes the appeal of narrative and causality in a frighteningly random world  something readers of Thomas Pynchon ’s novels well know  but also argues that overarching theories tend to be “ formulated by the politically defeated and taken up by the socially defeated . ”
These losers “ left behind by modernity , ” he writes , “ can be identified in the beached remnants of vanished European empires ; the doomed bureaucrats , the White Russians and the patriotic German petit bourgeois .
They are the America firsters , who got the war they did n’t want ; the Midwest populists watching their small farmers go out of business ; the opponents of the New Deal ; the McGovern liberals in the era of Richard Nixon ; British socialists and pacifists in the decade of Margaret Thatcher ; the irreconcilable American right during the Clinton administration ; the shattered American left in the time of the second Bush .
“ If it can be proved that there has been a conspiracy , which has transformed politics and society , then their defeat is not the product of their own inherent weakness or unpopularity , let alone their mistakes ; it is due to the almost demonic ruthlessness of their enemy . ”
It ’s not surprising , then , that conspiracy theories thrive in times of change , uncertainty and economic stress , and that the designated villains often conform to enemies in “ American populist folklore . ”
Of the era of McCarthyism and the venom aimed at supposed Communist sympathizers , Mr. Aaronovitch writes : “ They were East Coasters or Hollywooders ; they were educated ; they were city dwellers ; they liked art and fancy music ; they were separate from  and unsympathetic to  the daily travails of the American little man . ”

These days a similar sort of antipathy is directed at President Obama , the Democratic Party and the mainstream news media by the Tea Party movement and by so - called birthers , who question whether Mr. Obama was born in the United States .
Police in Dubai say some of the new suspects identified in the assassination of a senior Hamas member last month were travelling on Australian passports .
Dubai authorities have now identified 26 people suspected of involvement in the assassination of Mahmoud al - Mabhouh .
Of the 15 new suspects , most had European passports , but three of them were apparently travelling on Australian passports in the names of Adam Korman , Joshua Daniel Bruce and Nicole Sandra McCabe .
Mr Korman , 34 , is Australian - born but lives in Tel Aviv , where he sells musical instruments .
In an interview with Israeli media he has denied any involvement and says he is the victim of identity theft .
AM tried to contact him , along with a Bruce Daniel who lives near Haifa in Israel 's north , but neither was answering the phone .
But Mr Korman has told Israel 's biggest newspaper Yediot Aharonot he is shocked over what has happened .
" It 's identity theft , simply unbelievable , " he is quoted as saying .
" It 's a violation of human rights to do such a thing .
I have travelled all over the world but never visited Dubai or the United Arab Emirates . "
Mr Korman also told the paper he was perplexed as to how he could ever fly to Australia again , now that he is considered an international suspect .
" I have been frightened and shocked since receiving the news , " he reportedly said .
AM has confirmed that Australian Nicole Sandra McCabe also lives in Israel .
When contacted this morning , her family in Australia said they had no knowledge of her name being linked to the Dubai investigation .
A DFAT spokesman in Canberra says Dubai has informed Australia of the latest developments and Australian officials are cooperating with the police investigation .
Killed in hotel room
Mabhouh , a Hamas military commander , was killed last month in his hotel room in what Dubai police have said they are almost certain was an Israeli hit .
Dubai police have released new information about the movements of the 26 suspects before and after the assassination .
All had apparently travelled to Dubai from one of six European cities or Hong Kong and each left the country to various destinations , including Hong Kong and Iran , before making their way back to Europe , where they apparently abandoned the fraudulent passports .
Many had also used credit cards issued by the same US bank .
Police also released new vision from the hotel 's security cameras showing the man named as Mr Daniel with one of the French suspects inside the hotel .
Of the new suspects six carried British passports , three held Irish documents , three Australian and three French , the Dubai government 's media office said in an emailed statement .
Dubai authorities last week released the identities of 11 people whom they said travelled on fraudulent British , Irish , French and German passports to kill Mabhouh .
Two Palestinians suspected of providing logistical support were in custody .
" Friendly nations who have been assisting in this investigation have indicated to the police in Dubai that the passports were issued in an illegal and fraudulent manner , " the statement said .
The use of passports from European Union countries by the killers has drawn censure from the bloc .
Dubai has accused Israel of being behind the assassination , but the Israeli foreign minister has said there was no proof his country carried out the killing .

His political tendencies toward socialism and anarchism are a result of what he calls " the radical Jewish community in New York . "
Since 1965 he has become one of the leading critics of U.S. foreign policy .
He published a book of essays called American Power and the New Mandarins which is considered to be one of the most substantial arguments ever against American involvement in Vietnam .
Among his many accomplishments , he is most famous for his work on generative grammar , which developed from his interest in modern logic and mathematical foundations .
As a result , he applied it to the description of natural languages .
Noam Avram Chomsky was born in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on December 7 , 1928 .
He attended the University of Pennsylvania where he studied linguistics , mathematics , and philosophy .
In 1955 , he received his Ph. D. from the University of Pennsylvania , however , most of the research leading to this degree was done at Harvard between 1951 and 1955 .
Since receiving his Ph. D. , Chomsky has taught at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , where he now holds the Ferrari P. Ward Chair of Modern Language and Linguistics .
Question :
What are the major debates in linguistics ?
Noam Chomsky : Well , as in most sciences , especially the human sciences , almost every major question is open .
So , for example , take two obvious questions .
One is , how come there are any languages at all ?
The second question is , why are there apparently so many ?
These are pretty elementary questions , but they 're sensible questions .
Roughly , say one hundred thousand years ago , which is almost nothing in evolutionary time , the questions could n't be raised , because there were n't any languages — maybe two hundred thousand , but roughly that area .
So it 's a sensible question .
One is the question , how did languages suddenly emerge in the evolutionary record , and it 's pretty sudden by an evolutionary framework , the amount of time involved .
And then , how come they proliferated ?
How come there is n't just one ?
Well , there 's steps towards answering that .
There 's progress , I think , my own view , I should say is pretty idiosyncratic , it 's not widely held .
But I think we understand enough about the fundamental computational basis of language to see that — to develop kind of a plausible scenario for how there might have been a reasonably sudden emergence of the fundamental nature of language .
And also , of why the apparent diversity , is pretty superficial .
So that if , say a Martian was looking at humans the way we look at , say frogs , the Martian might conclude that there 's fundamentally one language with minor deviations .
And I think we 're moving towards an understanding of how that might be the case and it is pretty clear that it has to be the case .
The time of development is much too shallow for fundamental changes to have taken place and we know of no fundamental changes .
So a child from a hunter - gatherer tribe , a Stone Age tribe , in , say the Amazon , brought to Cambridge and raised here , will go on and be a quantum physicist at MIT .
There 's no known differences in relevant cognitive capacities .
So there 's something fundamentally the same about all of us , and it's whatever emerged pretty recently and we have to work out the —to show that the enormous apparent variety , is a kind of superficial variation and also to explain how it might have suddenly appeared in the evolutionary record .

A biblical expert at the University of Chicago , Margaret M. Mitchell , together with experts in micro-chemical analysis and medieval bookmaking , has concluded that one of the University Library 's most enigmatic possessions is a forgery .
The book , a copy of the Gospel of Mark , will remain in the collection as a study document for scholars studying the authenticity of ancient books .
Scholars have argued for nearly 70 years over the provenance of what 's called the Archaic Mark , a 44 - page miniature book , known as a " codex , " which contains the complete 16 - chapter text of the Gospel of Mark in minuscule handwritten text .
The manuscript , which also includes 16 colorful illustrations , has long been believed to be either an important witness to the early text of the gospel or a modern forgery , said Mitchell , Professor of New Testament and Early Christian Literature .
" The mystery is now solved from textual , chemical , and codicological ( bookmaking ) angles , " said Mitchell , who first became intrigued by the codex when she saw it as a graduate student in 1982 .
Comprehensive analysis demonstrates that it is not a genuine Byzantine manuscript , but a counterfeit , she said , " made somewhere between 1874 and the first decades of the 20th century . "
Mitchell said experts from multiple disciplines made the findings possible .
" Our collective efforts have achieved what no single scholar could do -- give a comprehensive analysis of the composite artifact that is an illustrated codex .
The data collected in this research process has given us an even deeper understanding of the exact process used by the forger , " said Mitchell .
" It will , we hope , assist ongoing scholarly investigation into and detection of manuscripts forged in the modern period . "
Since 1937 , when Edgar J. Goodspeed a University of Chicago biblical scholar , acquired the Archaic Mark , the manuscript has been an enigma .
As early as 1947 , scholars speculated about its authenticity .
Because it is the closest of any known manuscript to the venerable 4th - century Codex Vaticanus for the text of Mark 's Gospel , Mitchell said , it was believed to be " either a very important textual witness ( from the 14th Century ) or a forgery based upon some late 19th - century critical edition of the Greek New Testament incorporating the readings of the Vatican manuscript . "
The modern blue pigment in the illustrations , identified in 1989 , would support the latter , but Mitchell explained this finding was not definitive because the pigment could have come from a restoration effort on an earlier manuscript .
In 2006 , the University of Chicago Library digitized the Archaic Mark , making it available to scholars worldwide ( goodspeed.lib.uchicago.edu ) and stimulating renewed interest in it .
The following year , in response to that growing interest in the mysterious manuscript , Alice Schreyer , Director of the Special Collections Research Center , convened a committee to lead a complete and definitive examination of the material components of the Archaic Mark .

The Library commissioned materials analysis from McCrone Associates , and enlisted the aid of Abigail Quandt , a rare books expert and preservationist at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore .
Last January , Joseph G. Barabe , a senior scientist at McCrone , took 24 samples of parchment , ink and a range of paints used in illustrations .
Barabe analyzed the samples using an array of techniques -- polarized light ; energy dispersive X - ray spectrometry ; the scanning electron microscope for elemental analysis ; X - ray diffraction ; Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy ; and Raman spectroscopy .
Under microscopic analysis , Barabe and his colleagues found no evidence of retouching of any kind in the manuscript , disproving earlier suspicions of restoration attempts .
Barabe determined the Archaic Mark was created after 1874 -- using materials not available until the late 19th century -- on a parchment substrate dating from about the middle of the 16th century .
Carbon dating determined the animal hide was from some time between 1485 - 1631 .
The rest of the authentication team confirmed and helped interpret Barabe 's findings .
Quandt carefully reconstructed the steps the modern forger took to produce the manuscript , from preparing the parchment , to the painting of images and inscription of text , as well as the application of the modern coating , cellulose nitrate .
Quandt also identified specific ways in which its production defies usual Byzantine procedures , and she determined that the reused parchment contains no recoverable text underneath .
Mitchell completed the analysis with a study of the textual edition the forger had used .
She confirmed and refined Stephen C. Carlson 's proposal that the modern edition from which the forger copied the text was the 1860 edition of the Greek New Testament by Philipp Buttmann .
Mitchell identified telltale readings in the Archaic Mark that arose from the original 1856 edition of Buttmann 's critical text , reproducing errors later corrected in the flurry of collations of the famous manuscript Vaticanus between 1857 and 1867 .
Mitchell , Barabe and Quandt have detailed these findings in a paper scheduled for February publication in the journal Novum Testamentum .

Leafs defenceman Mike Komisarek announced Wednesday that his month - long attempt to come back from a shoulder injury has ended in bitter disappointment .
The popular blueliner , out since Jan. 2 with a shoulder injury , said he will undergo season - ending surgery .
“ Our team doctors have recommended this after a determined effort to rehab the injury without surgery , ” Komisarek said in a statement released to the media .
“ Having this done immediately is the right thing to do for the Leafs .
I am truly sorry that I will not be able to represent my country at the Olympics . ”
Indeed , the decision not only prematurely ends Komisarek ’s first season as a Leaf , it dashes his hopes to represent the U.S. at the upcoming Vancouver Games .
Komisarek returned to practice over a week ago and worked diligently towards a return .
But while he was able to skate and shoot at game levels , doctors could not clear him for physical contact .
Komisarek visited with Dr. James Andrews , a renowned shoulder surgeon in Birmingham , Alabama , two weeks ago and was presented with some grim news .
He was told he could attempt rehab and play through the pain .
But his shoulder would remain unstable and would not heal correctly without surgery .
The valiant attempt to play ended Wednesday hours after Komisarek visited with doctors in the afternoon in one final attempt to gain clearance for physical contact .
Komisarek was signed as a free agent July 1 and appeared in 23 games , collecting three assists and 40 penalty minutes .
He was named by Leafs GM and Team USA GM Brian Burke to the American squad Jan . 1 .
Sid Meier 's Civilization franchise returns this fall with a fifth installment , featuring hexagon tile maps , a new combat system , deeper diplomatic options , and a community hub where players can share content and compete without leaving the game .

Civilization marches on relentlessly in the fifth installment of the classic strategy series , published by 2 K Games and developed by the team at Firaxis .
Civilization V features a completely new game engine , allowing for lush , organic landscapes unlike anything seen in the series previously .
With the new engine comes a new combat system , which might separate the casual Civ player from the hardcore .
The new hexagon tiles scream war gaming to me , and that 's not traditionally a genre for the stay - at - home mom .
The new system promises more strategic options in battle , with new elements such as ranged bombardment sure to make combat much more interesting than it has been in the past .

More peaceful players should be pleased by the inclusion of fully animated leaders and deeper diplomatic options , while players seeking online interaction need look no further than the game 's player hub , where community - created content can be swapped and multiplayer matches launched .
" Each new version of Civilization presents exciting challenges for our team , " said Sid Meier , director of creative development at Firaxis Games .
" Thankfully , ideas on how to bring new and fun experiences to Civ players never seem to stop flowing .
From fully animated leaders and realistic landscapes , new combat tactics , expanded diplomacy and shared mods , we 're excited for players to see the new vision our team at Firaxis has brought to the series . "

It sounds rather intense , but what of the more casual Civ players ?
" In addition to Civilization V , Firaxis Games is also currently developing Sid Meier 's Civilization Network , a Civ game for Facebook .
With Sid Meier leading design , Civilization Network will offer yet another option for world domination to both the casual gamer and the biggest fans of the series .
It 's another way to access the famously addictive world of Civilization . "

It looks like Firaxis is going in two different directions with the Civilization franchise .
Which side will you be on ?
Oh , Norway , you guys are so silly .
If you missed it Tuesday morning , Norway competed in the men ’s curling round robin game against Canada at the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games .
Unfortunately , for them , all eyes were on their choice of flashy pants and not the game itself .
Twitter chatter was quick to ridicule the men , while others claimed their wardrobe was the best thing ever .
If you dare to replicate their unique look and go out in public , you can buy a similar pair online .
Kevin Martin and Team Canada beat the pants off the Norwegians to take the game 7 - 6 .

Home Verified Just - In - Time Compiler on x86 Verified Just - In - Time Compiler on x86
Magnus O. Myreen
This paper presents a method for creating formally correct just - in - time ( JIT ) compilers .
The tractability of our approach is demonstrated through , what we believe is the first , verification of a JIT compiler with respect to a realistic semantics of self - modifying x86 machine code .
Our semantics includes a model of the instruction cache .
Two versions of the verified JIT compiler are presented : one generates all of the machine code at once , the other one is incremental i.e. produces code on - demand .
All proofs have been performed inside the HOL4 theorem prover .
( To appear in next week 's POPL . )
I 've been enjoying this paper on my commute this week .
It 's a nice little distillation of some of the basics of the engineering structure of a JITted language and how the pieces fit together in a correct implementation .
As JIT compilers become more and more commonplace , I 'd like to see them presented in such a way that they 're no more scary or daunting -- at least in principle -- than traditional offline compilers .
Perhaps a chapter in EoPL4 ?

I have to call foul on a surprisingly foolish article in today ’s NYT .
Less than a month into 2010 , it is already a leading candidate for the dumbest article of the year .
It reads like it was written by the PR firm for a group of VCs and Palo Alto law firms .
There were numerous ignorant comments in the article , but this is the one that actually made me laugh out loud :
“ Newer restrictions , like those on executive compensation , have made I.P.O. ’s even less attractive to some entrepreneurs , said Doug Collom , a partner at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati , a Silicon Valley law firm .
“ Lawyers now have a profound significance in the boardroom , ” he said . ”
WTF is this idiot talking about ?
Last I checked , none of the Silicon Valley tech firms had received TARP money during the bailouts .
The exec comp restrictions this dimwitted Wilson Sonsini lawyer mentioned came with the nearly trillion dollar taxpayer bailout / subsidy for insolvent banks and the incompetent execs who ran them into the ground — not dot com start ups .
What a tool .
I cannot figure out who is more responsible for this brain dead exercise in ignorance and spin — the writer who ( re) typed it from a press release , or the editor who let this nonsense slide by .
Here ’s some more stupidity :
“ In the last two years , only 18 tech start - ups have gone public , compared with 143 in the two years prior .
The Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 , which tightened corporate governance and accounting rules , has taken a lot of the blame . ”
Astonishingly , the article fails to note the massive decrease in IPOs across all sectors due to the recent turmoil .
Even more amazingly , the author somehow fails to deploy so much as one single word regarding the total collapse in the markets , or the simple fact that investors have seen precisely zero gains over the past 11 years .
Quite bluntly , I am embarrassed that this is what passes for Journalism today .

UPDATE : January 18 , 2010 3:02pm
Here is a chart of IPOs going back about 3 decades .
Note after the 1987 and 2000 and 2008 crashes , the IPO numbers plummeted .
I do not know what the actual impact of Sarbanes Oxeley was on IPOs , but the data shows that after SARBOX passed , the number of new IPOs actually went up .
I am NOT suggesting there is a correlation between SARBOX and any subsequent increase in IPOs ; I am merely pointing out that blatherings of those mentioned above is factually incorrect , and belied by actual data .
Have a look at these two charts , courtesy of Jim Bianco .
They show the number , and the dollar amount raised in IPOs ;
There appears to be no correlation with SARBOX , but a huge correlation with market crashes .

Cuyahoga County 's new land bank , along with its partners , received nearly $ 41 million in federal stimulus funds to demolish blighted homes and renovate others in 20 targeted neighborhoods throughout the county .
Cities , counties and the state of Ohio received a total of $ 175 million out of $ 2 billion in awards the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development announced Thursday .
" Vacant homes have a debilitating effect on neighborhoods and often lead to reduced property values , blight , and neighborhood decay , " HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan the said in a statement .
" This additional $ 2 billion in Recovery Act funding will help stabilize hard hit communities by turning vacant homes into affordable housing opportunities . "
The investment is " helping to eliminate blight , stabilize our community and stop the cycle of abandonment that has occurred .
This program is truly helping to improve the quality of life in our region , " said Councilman Anthony Brancatelli , chairman of the community & economic development committee .
The new county land bank , along with the city of Cleveland , Cuyahoga County and Cuyahoga Metropolitan Housing Authority , put in a joint proposal this summer asking for $ 74 million for 20 targeted neighborhoods .
Fifteen of the neighborhoods are in the Cleveland , and the others include parts of five inner-rung suburbs -- East Cleveland , Garfield Heights , Lakewood , South Euclid and Shaker Heights .
Gus Frangos , president of the land bank said the money will go to acquire abandoned and foreclosed homes in those areas , as well as vacant property .
He said those that still have " good bones " will be rehabbed and financial help will be given to low and moderate income families to purchase the homes with down - payment and closing cost assistance .
Homes that can't be saved will be demolished .
The plan was to demolish more than 1,000 vacant homes .
One of the biggest challenges in Cleveland , now with about 380,000 residents , is what to do with the vacant land , Frangos said .
And the group 's proposal is to turn some of the land into community gardens , parks and even urban forests .
" By rebuilding neighborhoods devastated by the economic crisis , we will improve surrounding property values , create new jobs , and foster long - term economic growth , " Sen .
Sherrod Brown , said in a statement after joining Donovan in Columbus for the announcement of the awards .
" By putting vacant properties and lots to good use and targeting funds to the hardest - hit communities , we can rebuild our downtown 's and strengthen our communities . '
The HUD money awarded Thursday , part of the $ 737 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act plan , was a competitive process , and applicants such as counties , cities non-profits and others had to detail how they would tackle neighborhoods with high foreclosure or vacancy rates .
" Cleveland and the county have been hard hit by the global economic crisis and these additional ... funds will help to rebuild our neighborhoods , providing our residents with affordable homes in revitalized communities , " said Mayor Frank G. Jackson .

Hey Gumpbel , I am a white conservative that watches many sports .
My two fav 's are ACC basketball and Nascar , and I also watch pro football and base ball , but really do n't like hockey ..... what does that make me ?
Gumpbel , you appear to be a racist liberal with that statement .... Do you support Affirmitave Action ?
If so , should the NBA , NFL , NHL , NBL , NASCAR all have quotas ?
How would you like these organizations if they had representitive percentages of blacks , whites , hispanics etc ?
John Schappert , chief operating officer at Electronic
Arts used his time at DICE to talk about 20 years of technology transitions in the gaming industry .
Aside from the obvious technological advances , Schappert says that one of the big changes is the number of gaming platforms and the difficulty in tracking data on such a fragmented marketplace .
NPD information , one of the biggest tools that analysts and companies rely on , is largely incomplete .
It does n’t track big - box retail sales or online sales , leaving huge gaps in the data .
That leads to negative ( and inaccurate ) headlines in mass media and the gaming press .
Schappert says that the gaming industry is in the midst of a transition , and that the industry has survived them in the past .
It does n’t make it any easier , he says , but it ’s something that the industry can prepare for .
He then provided some suggestions and commentary .
First , consumers are more educated than ever .
He picked one of EA ’s games to illustrate his point .
The FIFA games spent too much of their focus on graphics over gameplay , and Konami took some of their market share by putting an emphasis on gameplay with its Winning 11 series .
EA adjusted its strategy over time , and FIFA ’s position was eventually restored .
Next , company ’s need to listen to consumers .
With Battlefield : Bad Company 2 , EA is taking on a giant in Activision ’s Modern Warfare 2 .
They created big environments , destructible environments and lots of vehicles , based on player feedback .
Schappert says good marketing can’t make a bad game any better , but good games deserve better support .
He called out Mirror ’s Edge and Dead Space as two examples that did n’t get a decent marketing push and also were put in a crowded release window .
Mass Effect 2 and Dante ’s Inferno are examples of how marketing can be successful , Schappert says , with both games having trailers broadcast during big football games , including the Super Bowl .
Companies need to create long - term relationships with consumers , in the form of DLC and other online content , Schappert says .
Social networking is certainly a part of EA ’s future , with the recent acquisition of Playfish , but Schappert says that he sees indications that those kinds of games are right on the edge of a bubble .
He expects to see more consolidation within that space in the near future .
As appealing as online and DLC is , Schappert says it ’s too soon to abandon retail releases .
He does n’t see physical formats being abandoned in the short , medium or even long term .
Retail releases are a gateway to DLC , he reminded the audience .
Finally , he said not to let cynics get you down .
There are arguably more opportunities in the gaming space than ever , he says , with new audiences and an abundance of places to play games .
While the formats might be fractured , there is room for expansion and growth in this new , evolving world .
" The point is made , ' We do n't waterboard anymore or use extreme interrogation techniques . '
Most of those extreme interrogation techniques and waterboarding were done away with in the Bush administration , " Powell said .
" They 've been made officially done away with in this current administration . "
" The Transportation Security Administration created by George Bush is still in action working in our airports ; they take care of me every day that I go to an airport , " Powell told moderator Bob Schieffer .
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was also created under President Bush , " and it is still under President Obama working hard , " he said .
" Our counterterrorism authorities and forces are hard at work .
Our law enforcement officials are hard at work .
We have gone after the enemy in Afghanistan with 50,000 more troops , more predators are striking al Qaeda and Taliban leaders in Pakistan .
We have continued the policies that President Bush put in place with respect to Iraq .
" The bottom line answer is the nation is still at risk .
Terrorists are out there .
They 're trying to get through .
But to suggest that somehow we have become much less safer because of the actions of the administration , I do n't think that 's borne out by the facts , " Powell said .
The facts are the Powell is absolutely correct , most of the so - called " Enhanced Interrogation " Techniques that Dick Cheney continues to call for were Ended by the Bush Administration in 2005 after the CIA Inspector Generals Report found that they were both Illegal and Ineffective .
The real trouble began on May 7 , 2004 , the day the C.I.A. inspector general , John L. Helgerson , completed a devastating report .
In thousands of pages , it challenged the legality of some interrogation methods , found that interrogators were exceeding the rules imposed by the Justice Department and questioned the effectiveness of the entire program .
The Torture Authorizing OLC memos by Yoo and Bybee were all recinded by 2005 - under Bush .
The program was scrapped .
( Although it should e noted that some elements of it were eventually revived by Bush in 2007 , use of water - boarding and nudity remained off the table )
Powell goes on to note that in 8 years have only been THREE successful prosecutions under the Military Commissions system setup by Bush , two of those men , including Salin Hamdan whose Supreme Court Case effectively gutted the Commissions System and established that the Geneva Conventions Do Apply to Detainees , have already been released for time served .
People in the Military Commissions still get Layers , like Hamdan 's Attorney Commander Swift .
Even Military Judges have found cases untenable because the detainee Mohammad Al= Qhatani was Tortured
The idea that the only way to keep America Safe is to continue the Criminal Conspiracy of Torture that was headed and Championed by Dick Cheney - is patently ridiculous .
This is n't a matter of " differences " unless your idea of a difference is a War Criminal vs NOT a War Criminal .
It 's clear that Powell is still a Republican as he attempts to blame the Gridlock in Washington on the " failure to Compromise " on both sides of the aisle , as if the Democrats have n't already Compromised on Single Payer , Medicare for All and the Public Option .
He suggests we should follow the example of the founding fathers on the Constitution , while ignoring that their failure to address and resolve the issue of Slavery rather than Kick the Can down the Road with clauses that prevented Congress from outlawing the importation of slaves until 1808 and ratified it 's practice with the Fugitive Slave Clause led directly to the Heinous Dred Scott decision and the Civil War .
Every other Country that had Slavery ( except Haiti and Cuba ) ended the practice without bloodshed .
Other than that - he 's pretty much on the money .

Update Meanwhile on Meet the Press General David Petreaus echoed that sentiment .
Via Huffpo .
Appearing on Meet the Press , the general made a compelling case against torturing terrorist detainees , saying he found it far more pragmatic and beneficial to stick to methods authorized by the army field manual .
" I have always been on the record , in fact , since 2003 , with the concept of living our values .
And I think that whenever we 've perhaps taken expedient measures , they 've turned around and bitten us in the backside .
We decided early on , in the 101st airborne division , we just said , we decided to obey the Geneva Conventions ...
" In the cases where that is not true [ where torture takes place or international human rights groups are n't granted access to detention sites ] we end up paying a price for it , ultimately , " he added .
" Abu Ghraib and other situations like that are non biodegradable .
They do n't go away .
The enemy continues to beat you with them like a stick ....
Beyond that , frankly , we have found that the use of interrogation methods in the army field manual that was given the force of law by Congress , that that works . "
Oh my , what will the Wingnut Sadistic Torture - Mongerers say about their Dearest HERO Petreaus now ?
Notice that the van 's right side light did n't work prior to the accident !

‘ He who pays the piper calls the tune ” : That old saying captures perfectly America ’s growing dependence on our No. 1 creditor in the world , Communist China .
By their carelessness Congress and the Obama administration are steadily handing over control of America ’s economic and financial future to a handful of Chinese officials and generals in Beijing .
Those who think the Chinese wo n’t use that control if they feel they have to are ignoring history — and the Chinese .
The ancient military strategist Sun Tzu said that the best strategy was to render an opponent ’s army helpless even before the battle began .
America may still have the biggest and best military in the world .
But many at the Pentagon are starting to realize that , thanks to our growing fiscal irresponsibility , we may be surrendering control of America ’s destiny to a rival superpower — and all without a shot being fired .
Consider the scale of the problem .
With President Obama ’s 2010 budget , 42 cents of every dollar the federal government spends will have to be borrowed .
In the last decade , foreign investors have wound up lending us roughly half of all federal debt — with just two countries , China and Japan , providing nearly half of that sum , or 44 percent , through the purchase of US Treasury securities .
China now tops Japan as our biggest lender by some $ 30 billion a year , at $ 789 billion .
( By comparison , our No. 3 lender , Great Britain , comes in at a measly $ 277 billion ) .
But that ’s not all .
As its booming economy becomes more global , China is also the world ’s largest holder of foreign - currency reserves .
Most of that is in US dollars .
Indeed , without most Americans realizing it , China has become the largest foreign holder of US dollars in the world .
How many dollars foreign exchange traders at the Bank of China decide to sell or buy on any given day is increasingly determining whether the dollars in our purses and wallets buy a little or a lot .
Seen from one angle , this dependence on China for the value of our national currency and the funding of our debt is like our dependence on inexpensive Chinese exports for our standard of living : the inevitable fruit of today ’s interlocking global economies — and poor planning on our part .
Seen from another , more strategic angle , it may spell disaster .
History shows that nations that can’t control their economic fortunes do n’t control much else .
Debt freezes destinies — as every credit - card holder knows .
Europeans discovered that after World War II , when they lost the power to make major decisions without first checking with their lender - in - chief , the United States .
At that time , we used our economic dominance to rebuild Europe , not reduce it to impotence .
On the other hand , If US - China relations continue to deteriorate — over arms sales to Taiwan , Internet freedom issues , Chinese industrial espionage and a Chinese military build - up that looks more and more like it ’s directed at challenging US power in Asia — our lenders - in - chief in Beijing may not be so scrupulous .
Indeed , back in 1999 , the Chinese literally wrote the book on how to use economic asymmetries as a blunt instrument , entitled “ Unrestricted Warfare . ”
It draws no meaningful distinction between military , economic and political force ( including using cyberspace ) as means to defeat an enemy .
Instead , it shows how a nation can dominate its opponents not with planes , ships and soldiers , but with foreign exchange rates , trade embargoes and armies of computer hackers .
Suppose that in retaliation for some slight China decides to stop buying Treasury bonds , forcing our debt to cost us even more .
A furious US Congress hits back with trade sanctions .
China then responds by driving up the price of the dollar , crippling US exports — or , alternately , it crashes the dollar by dumping its foreign reserves , even as Chinese computer hackers slow down our banks ’ ability to respond to the crisis .
No one will call this a war .
But it will certainly fit the classic definition of war as politics by other means .
And the Pentagon knows it .
Last March , the Pentagon held its first - ever economic - warfare war game , with China as the putative opponent and with economists and bankers ( including from UBS ) helping out .
Details of what unfolded are still classified .
However , sources told Fox Business News that the scenario played out as planned .
That was the good news .
The bad news is that China won .
Today , some experts argue that rational self - interest will prevent China from waging this kind of economic warfare , because crippling the US would also severely wound its own economy .
However , on an issue like Taiwan or Japan , rational judgment can take a backseat to national pride , and the desire to reverse old humiliations .
That war game was almost a year ago , when the Federal deficit was half of what it is today .
And China is moving out of its short - term debt positions — although slowly enough not to roil the credit markets .
In any case , Bracken and others argue that we need more coordination between the Treasury and the Pentagon on ways to deal with a vulnerability that seemed entirely theoretical then , but now seems all too real .
Still others are pushing for rules restricting the future sales of Treasury securities to foreign buyers .
All this , however , is only playing catch up .
The real issue is whether we get our fiscal house in order , and realize that a $ 12 trillion national debt and a crippled economy could leave us as vulnerable as we once were on a December Sunday morning 69 years ago , at Pearl Harbor in 1941 .
Arthur Herman ’s most recent book , “ Gandhi and Churchill , ” was a Pulitzer Prize finalist last year .
Arnold Schwarzenegger can't stand economic girlie men , and Republicans who accept stimulus money while posturing against the plan are behaving like girlie men .
Appearing yesterday on ABC News , the governor credited the stimulus with creating 150,000 jobs in California .
His sally against Republican colleagues begins around ( 0:43 ) : " Well , you know , to me I find it interesting that you have a lot of the Republicans running around and pushing back on the stimulus money and saying this does n't create any new jobs .
Then , they go out and they do the photo ops and they are posing with the big check and they say , ' Is n't this great ? ' "
AUCKLAND ( Reuters Life ! ) -
An advert for an airline competition that portrays older , single women as “ cougars ” who prey on young men at night is to close on Monday after incurring the wrath of both male and female rape victims in New Zealand .
Actress and executive producer Courtney Cox answers a question during a panel discussion at the Television Critics Association press tour in Pasadena January 9 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Gus Ruelas
“ Cougar ” has become a popular term for sexually aggressive older women on the hunt for younger men , with actress Courteney Cox recently starring in TV comedy “ Cougar Town . ”
But the term can be viewed either as misogynistic or a word of empowerment .
An online spoof documentary by Air New Zealand , promoting a competition for free tickets to a rugby tournament , tells of a so - called cougar starving herself during the day then “ hunting large slabs of meat at night ” by stalking young men at a bar .
The voiceover says despite men’s attempts to ward off the woman ’s advances , the cougar has “ not tasted fresh meat for days ” and drags her victims to her inner-city apartment , often forcing them to listen to “ Enya or the Eurythmics . ”
The promotion ( here ) by the airline 's Grabaseat discount airfare site encouraged women aged 35 plus to send in photographs of themselves to compete for tickets to next month 's Wellington Sevens .
Grabaseat Manager Duane Perrott said the campaign was designed as “ light - hearted humor to kick off the New Year ” and most people saw it as a celebration of the “ quirky sense of humor Kiwis ( New Zealanders ) are renowned for . ”
“ We ’ve been overwhelmed by entries and are closing the competition , ” Perrott said in a statement on Monday .
“ However , we are cognizant of the fact that some organizations have raised concerns about the promotion ’s content . ”
New Zealand ’s Rape Prevention Education has labeled the ad appalling , disgusting and degrading to women , adding that some Air New Zealand staff were also concerned about the promotion .
“ They find it degrading and that it is encouraging potentially harmful behavior , so my question is why is our national carrier promoting sexually predatory behavior ? ” director Kim McGregor told the NZ Herald newspaper .
“ We have also had complaints from male survivors who have been raped by women and they are very distressed that their situation is being laughed at and made out to be humorous . ”
Haiti , as a nation , has suffered violence , unrest , juntas , and natural disasters .
One thing it need not suffer anymore , given the earthquake ?
Its debt obligations .
This Times of London article explains how Haiti became so indebted in the first place .
The appalling state of the country is a direct result of having offended a quite different celestial authority — the French .
France gained the western third of the island of Hispaniola — the territory that is now Haiti — in 1697 .
It planted sugar and coffee , supported by an unprecedented increase in the importation of African slaves .
Economically , the result was a success , but life as a slave was intolerable .
Living conditions were squalid , disease was rife , and beatings and abuses were universal .
The slaves ’ life expectancy was 21 years .
After a dramatic slave uprising that shook the western world , and 12 years of war , Haiti finally defeated Napoleon ’s forces in 1804 and declared independence .
But France demanded reparations : 150 m francs , in gold .
For Haiti , this debt did not signify the beginning of freedom , but the end of hope .
Even after it was reduced to 60 m francs in the 1830s , it was still far more than the war - ravaged country could afford .
Haiti was the only country in which the ex-slaves themselves were expected to pay a foreign government for their liberty .
By 1900 , it was spending 80 % of its national budget on repayments .
In order to manage the original reparations , further loans were taken out — mostly from the United States , Germany and France .
Instead of developing its potential , this deformed state produced a parade of nefarious leaders , most of whom gave up the insurmountable task of trying to fix the country and looted it instead .
In 1947 , Haiti finally paid off the original reparations , plus interest .
Doing so left it destitute , corrupt , disastrously lacking in investment and politically volatile .
Haiti was trapped in a downward spiral , from which it is still impossible to escape .
It remains hopelessly in debt to this day .
So much has happened around the Toyota and Lexus accelerator safety recalls over the last week that it 's hard to keep it all straight .
So we 're taking our first stab at it by sorting out the impact of the recall on the many hybrids offered by Toyota and Lexus .
The full scope of the latest recall encompasses eight Toyota models , as well as one lone Pontiac model built by Toyota ( NYSE : TM ) .
But the latest recall does not affect any hybrid models .

Hybrids :
First recall , yes ...
However , certain Toyota and Lexus hybrid models were subject to the first recall in September , for floor mat problems that could trap the accelerator pedal .
That action encompassed 3.8 million cars among five Toyota and two Lexus models , including the 2004 - 2009 Toyota Prius and the hybrid models of the 2007 - 2010 Toyota Camry sedan .
The list of vehicles subject to that first recall was expanded beyond the initial list issued in late September , adding several new Toyota models , but no hybrids were added .
... but for the latest recall , no
Not one single Toyota or Lexus hybrid is included in the new recall .
The latest safety alert is for a potentially sticking throttle pedal , caused by corrosion in the accelerator mechanisms provided by one of the two companies that manufactured the part for Toyota .
This latest recall affect no Toyota hybrids at all , neither the second - generation Prius nor the Camry Hybrid sedans .
And while it does include the 2010 Toyota Highlander crossover , the 2010 Highlander Hybrid models are specifically exempted from the list .
Overall , the sticking - accelerator - pedal recall covers 2.3 million vehicles , 1.7 million of which are also affected by the first recall .
Here are the full lists of vehicles affected by both recalls :
NEW ( January 2010 ) : Models affected by sticking - accelerator - pedal recall
2009 - 2010 Toyota Corolla ( sedan )
2007 - 2010 Toyota Camry ( sedan ) - only some , but not Camry Hybrid models
2005 - 2010 Toyota Avalon ( sedan )
2010 Toyota Highlander ( crossover ) , but not Highlander Hybrid models
2009 - 2010 Toyota RAV4 ( crossover )
2008 - 2010 Toyota Sequoia ( sport utility )
2007 - 2010 Toyota Tundra ( pickup truck )
2009 - 2010 Toyota Matrix ( hatchback )
2009 - 2010 Pontiac Vibe ( hatchback )
PREVIOUS ( September 2009 ) : Models affected by pedal - entrapment recall ( floor mats ) :

What to do :
If your accelerator sticks while driving
If you need to stop immediately , step on the brake pedal with both feet using firm and steady pressure .
Do not pump the brake pedal as it will deplete the vacuum utilized for the power brake assist .
Shift the transmission to Neutral ( N ) , and use the brakes to make a controlled stop at the side of the road .
After you stop the car , turn off the engine .
If you can't put the vehicle in Neutral , turn the engine OFF -- even while moving .
Your steering and brakes will continue to work , but they will require more effort because power assist will be lost .
If your car has an Engine Start / Stop button , firmly push the button for at least 3 seconds to turn off the engine .
Do NOT tap the button .
If the vehicle has a conventional key - ignition , turn the key to the ACC position to turn off the engine .
Do NOT remove the key from the ignition as this will lock the steering wheel .

Three years ago , Massachusetts passed the most sweeping healthcare bill in the country , adopting a plan that closely resembles the proposals being considered by Congress .
It is a plan that now offers powerful lessons for the whole nation .
The state ’s system , like the proposals moving toward votes in the House and Senate , focused on three goals : making medical insurance almost universal , fostering competition through a regulated insurance exchange , and helping low - income workers pay for coverage .
Today , Massachusetts leads the nation with 96 % of its residents covered by insurance -- an even larger share than some of the plans before Congress would cover .
The employer - based insurance system remains intact despite fears that the state ’s healthcare overhaul might cause companies to pull back .
And at least some Massachusetts residents who buy coverage are paying less .
Advertisement
But insurance premiums for most residents are going up , not down .
Many middle - class people who had insurance before the overhaul see little change -- except that they ’re spending more .
They ’re seeing little or no difference in the quality of their care .
In crafting their plan , Massachusetts lawmakers ducked the tough issues of cost control , including how much public and private insurers would pay physicians and hospitals .
So the state still has some of the most expensive medical care in the U.S.
And costs are rising faster than the national average .
Far faster than wages too .
“ What we did was health insurance reform , not healthcare reform , ” said Massachusetts state Sen.
James Eldridge , a Democrat who regrets having voted for the bill .
Critics of the healthcare overhaul bill that passed the Senate Finance Committee this week say that it too does n’t do enough to control costs .
Advertisement
Robert Laszewski , a healthcare policy analyst and former insurance company executive , calls the finance panel ’s bill “ Massachusetts all over again . ”
Ralph Neas , of the National Coalition on Health Care , says that the few cost provisions focus too much on public programs , especially Medicare , and not enough on reducing what doctors , insurers and hospitals charge customers who get their coverage from the private market .
“ The long - term cost - control provisions are few , and they do not have adequate enforcement mechanisms , ” Neas said .
Other experts say there ’s still time to address the cost issue more forcefully as Democratic leaders hammer out the final Senate bill this month .
“ At the national level , there has not been an explicit decision to postpone cost containment , ” said Paul Ginsburg , who heads the nonpartisan Center for Studying Health System Change .
“ There ’s a lot of belief that we should deal with it now . ”

Among those who have trouble seeing the benefits of what Massachusetts did are 62 - year - old Joan Young and her husband , David , who live in a suburb west of Boston .
They pay more than $ 1,100 monthly for insurance , plus a $ 1,000 deductible each before coverage kicks in .
Their insurer , Blue Cross Blue Shield , like the others in the state , says it expects to raise the price of premiums by 10 % next year .
“ It ’s not helping people like us , ” Young says .
“ They forget about the middle class . ”
Because she has serious medical issues , the Youngs encountered another problem as well :
Advertisement
Massachusetts , like Congress and President Obama , shied away from anything that might interfere with the relationship between consumers and their existing healthcare insurance .
That left the Youngs free to choose the coverage they wanted .
But it also left them responsible for thousands of dollars in medical expenses not covered by their plan .
Now that these and other problems have surfaced , the Legislature is going back and trying again , this time fashioning policies to govern insurers ’ profits and doctors ’ pay -- entering a second phase of healthcare reform that many analysts think also lies ahead at the national level .
A special state commission established to tackle the cost problem said that the stakes were high .
Continued cost growth , it said in a report this summer , “ threatens the viability ” of the healthcare initiative .
The Massachusetts overhaul has made things better for the 430,000 residents who previously had no insurance .
The state mandated coverage for almost everyone , as Congress is moving to do nationally .
And as with the plans before Congress , it provided subsidies to help low - income individuals and families pay their premiums .
Advertisement
Individuals who make less than $ 32,496 a year , and low - to moderate - income families -- those making as much as $ 66,155 a year for a family of four , for example -- are eligible to buy state - subsidized plans .
That has made buying a policy possible for many -- 165,000 people are covered under such plans .
“ The subsidized plans , in terms of access for low - income people , have been a godsend , really , ” said Carol Pryor , policy director of the Access Project in Boston .
The state also created a regulated insurance exchange to help consumers compare and buy policies .
For some in the individual market who do n’t qualify for government assistance , the regulated exchange has produced policies with premiums as much as 20 % lower , the state says .
Advertisement
“ If you are buying insurance on your own and you want the insurance , you ’re in a much better position , ” said Jon Kingsdale , executive director of the state ’s insurance exchange , the Commonwealth Connector .
The price cuts have not been shared by all .
Because consumers can still be rated by age , insurers are free to charge higher premiums to older consumers who may be more likely to incur substantial medical bills .
A 55 - year - old could pay almost as much as before .
Beyond what it has meant to particular individuals , the overall cost of the program has soared -- for the state and for individuals .
Whereas the subsidized plans cover only about 3 % of the 5.4 million in the state who have health insurance , for instance , the subsidies are estimated to carry a price tag of $ 1.3 billion by 2011 -- double the 2007 cost .
Advertisement
One reason is that more residents applied for assistance than the state had projected .
Also , Massachusetts has always had exceptionally high healthcare costs , and it still does -- in part because it has some of the most advanced and costly medical centers in the world .
At the same time , in 2008 , yearly family premiums here averaged $ 13,788 , the highest in the nation .
Then there is the problem of underinsurance -- coverage by budget - minded plans that have high deductibles and leave consumers with a much larger share of their medical bills than the more expensive plans .
Moira Rioux , 45 , of Plymouth suffers from an immune deficiency that requires monthly treatments costing $ 6,560 each .
She ’s covered through her husband ’s employer - based insurance , but the policy pays only 40 % of the cost of her treatments .
Advertisement
Rioux now carries two policies -- her family plan and an individual plan that she bought through the government - regulated exchange .
The second policy has helped , she said , but not enough .
“ How am I going to manage these costs ? ” she asked .
“ It ’s nice that everybody in Massachusetts has care at this point , but there ’s still missing pieces to the puzzle . ”

Police are investigating allegations that teachers at an elite private school in Berlin sexually abused pupils during the late 1970s and early 1980s .
One suspect has admitted to his guilt in an open letter to the news magazine Spiegel .
Five former students , all male , at the Jesuit Canisius College had initially notified the institution 's director , Klaus Mertes , of the abuse .
Two teachers - both Jesuit priests who no longer work at the school - had been identified by their accusers , who would have been aged 13 - 17 at the time , Mertes said .
One of the men accused , a former sports teacher has already admitted to the abuse according to news magazine Spiegel .
According to the magazine , he had written an open letter to be published apologizing to his victims , which stated that he had abused children and teenagers for many years .
" I am sorry for what I have done to you .
If you are able to forgive me for this , I ask you to do so , " he wrote
The second suspect - a former religious studies teacher - reportedly denied the charges .
' Danger of new instances '
The original accusations prompted Mertes to send a letter to 500 alumni , encouraging them to write in about their own experiences at the time .
Replies from ex-students continued to arrive , he said , with the number of people claiming to have been abused reaching 20 by Friday .
Child abuse is not just an issue for the churches
In the newspaper Tagesspiegel am Sonntag , Mertes said the Catholic Church had to take measures to make sure such abuse did not happen again .
" Although the now well - known abuse happened a long time ago , the danger of new instances of abuse could not be ruled out , ” he said .
Mertes added that the church 's attitude to homosexuality was not helpful .
" The church suffers from homophobia , " he said .
" Homosexuality is hidden .
Clerics with this inclination are not sure that they will be accepted if they are honest about their sexuality . ”
It was unsurprising that the revelations came so late , Mertes had said on Friday .
" Everyone who has dealt with sexual abuse cases knows very well that there 's a lot of shame and pain involved on the part of the victims , " Mertes told reporters .
" And it often takes many decades until those affected are able to get their trauma under control and are willing to speak about it openly . "
He said that the scandal could not have remained undetected at the time , had a number of people in responsible positions not looked the other way .
Most of the cases would likely be difficult to prosecute because German law limits the statute of limitations on sexual abuse to 10 years after the victim has turned 18 , Mertes said .

I present here a few pieces of folklore , well known to those practiced in Haskell , that I 've found to be really useful techniques when analyzing code whose types do n't seem to make any sense .
We 'll build practical techniques for reasoning about types , to be able to derive the type of fmap fmap fmap by ourselves .
Note that you could just ask GHCI what the type is , but that would spoil the fun !
( More seriously , working out the example by hand , just like a good problem set , helps develop intuition for what might be happening . )
Currying and types .
Three type signatures that have a superficial similarities are a -> b -> c , ( a -> b ) -> c and a -> ( b -> c ) .
If you do n't have a visceral feel for Haskell 's automatic currying , it can be easy to confuse the three .
In this particular case , a -> b -> c which reads as " takes two arguments a and b and returns c " is equivalent to a -> ( b -> c ) read " takes a and returns a function that takes b and returns c .
These are distinct from ( a -> b ) -> c read " takes a function of a -> b and returns c " .
A visual rule you can apply , in these cases , is that parentheses that are flush with the right side of the type signature can be freely added or removed , whereas any other parentheses cannot be .
Higher - order functions .
If I pass an Int to id :: a -> a , it 's reasonably obvious that id takes the shape of Int ->
Int .
If I pass a function a -> a to id :: a -> a , id then takes the shape ( a -> a ) -> a -> a .
Personally , I find the overloading of type parameters kind of confusing , so if I have a cadre of functions that I 'm trying to derive the type of , I 'll give them all unique names .
Since id id is a tad trivial , we 'll consider something a little nastier : (. ) (. ) .
Recall that (. ) :: ( b -> c ) -> ( a -> b ) -> a -> c .
We 're not actually going to use those letters for our manipulation : since our expression has two instances of (. ) , we 'll name the first a and the second b , and we 'll number them from one to three .
Then :
(. ) :: ( a2 -> a 3 ) -> ( a1 -> a 2 ) -> a 1 -> a 3 (. ) :: ( b2 -> b3 ) -> ( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3
Slightly less aesthetically pleasing , but we do n't have anymore conflicting types .
Next step is to identify what equivalences are present in the type variables , and eliminate redundancy .
Since we 're passing the second (. ) to the first (. ) as an argument :
( a2 -> a 3 ) == ( b2 -> b3 ) -> ( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3
to which you might say , " those function signatures do n't look anything alike ! " which leads us to our next point :
Currying and type substitution .
If your function 's type is n-ary , and the type you 're trying to match it against is m-ary , curry so that your function is m-ary to !
So , if you have a -> b -> c , and you want to pass it as d -> e , then you actually have a -> ( b -> c ) , and thus d == a and e == ( b -> c ) .
A curious case if it's in the other direction , in which case d -> e is actually restricted to be d -> ( e1 -> e2 ) , where e == ( e1 -> e2 ) and the obvious equalities hold .
To go back to our original example , the second (. ) would be grouped as such :
(. ) :: ( b2 -> b3 ) -> (( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3 )
and we achieve the type equalities :
a2 == ( b2 -> b3 ) a 3 == ( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3
Now , let 's substitute in these values for the first (. ) :
(. ) :: (( b2 -> b3 ) -> ( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3 ) -> ( a1 -> b2 -> b3 ) -> a 1 -> ( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3
and drop the first argument , since it 's been applied :
(. ) (. ) :: ( a1 -> b2 -> b3 ) -> a 1 -> ( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3
You might be wondering what that monstrous type signature does ...
Interpreting type signatures .
A great thing about polymorphic types is that there 's not very much non-pathological behavior that can be specified : because the type is fully polymorphic , we can't actually stick our hand in the box and use the fact that it 's actually an integer .
This property makes programs like Djinn , which automatically derive a function 's contents given a type signature , possible , and with a little practice , you can figure it out too .
Working backwards : we first take a look at b3 .
There 's no way for our function to magically generate a value of type b3 ( excluding undefined or bottom , which counts as pathological ) , so there 's got to be something else in our script that generates it .
And sure enough , it 's the first argument , but we need to pass it a1 and b2 first :
(. ) (. ) w x y z = w undefined undefined
We repeat the process for each of those types in turn : where is a1 specified ?
Well , we pass it in as the second argument .
Where is b2 specified ?
Well , we have another function y :: b1 -> b2 , but we need a b1 which is z .
Excellent , we now have a full implementation :
(. ) (. ) w x y z = w x ( y z )
Pointfree style as operator composition .
So , we now know what (. ) (. ) does , but we do n't really have a good motivation for why this might be the case .
( By motivation , I mean , look at (. ) (. ) taking function composition at face value , and then realizing , " oh yes , it should do that . " )
So what we 'd really like to focus on is the semantics of (. ) , namely function composition , and the fact that we 're currying it .
One line of thought might be :
Function composition is defined to be ( f . g ) x = f ( g x ) .
We 're partially applying the composition , so actually we have ( f. ) g x , but g is missing .
( if the ( f. ) looks funny to you , compare it to ( 2+ ) , which is partially applied addition .
Note that addition is commutative , so you 're more likely to see ( +2 ) , which becomes ( x+2 ) when applied . ) f is actually another composition operator .
Since functional composition is single - argument oriented , we want to focused on the curried version of (. ) , which takes a function and returns a function ( 1 ) that takes another function ( 2 ) and a value and returns the first function applied to the result of the second function applied to the value .
Read out the arguments .
Since ( f. ) is on the outside , the first argument completes the curry .
The next argument is what will actually get passed through the first argument , and the result of that will get passed through f .
The return value of that is another function , but ( barring the previous discussion ) we have n't figured out what that would be yet .
Still , we 've figured out what the first two arguments might look like .
If we now cheat and look at the type signature , we see our hypotheses are verified :
(. ) (. ) :: ( a1 -> b2 -> b3 ) -> a 1 -> ( b1 -> b2 ) -> b1 -> b3
The first argument g :: a 1 -> b2 -> b3 completes the curry , and then the next argument is fed straight into it , so it would have to be a 1 .
The resulting value b2 -> b3 is fed into the next composition operator ( notice that it 's not a single variable , since the next composition forces it to be a 1 - ary function ) and is now waiting for another function to complete the curry , which is the next argument b1 -> b2 ( i.e. b1 -> b2 -> b3 ) .
Then it 's a simple matter of supplying the remaining arguments .
I find thinking of functions as partially applied and waiting to be " completed " leads to a deeper intuitive understanding of what a complex chain of higher order functions might do .
Putting it together .
It is now time to work out the types for fmap fmap fmap .
We first write out the types for each fmap :
fmap :: ( Functor f ) => ( a1 -> a 2 ) -> f a 1 -> f a2 fmap :: ( Functor g ) => ( b1 -> b2 ) -> g b1 -> g b2 fmap :: ( Functor h ) => ( c1 -> c2 ) -> h c1 -> h c2
Perform application and we see :
( a1 -> a 2 ) == ( b1 -> b2 ) -> g b1 -> g b2 f a 1 == ( c1 -> c2 ) -> h c1 -> h c2
Luckily enough , we have enough arguments to fill up the first fmap , so that 's one layer less of complexity .
We can also further break these down :
-- from the first argument a 1 == b1 -> b2 a2 == g b1 -> g b2 -- from the second argument a 1 == h c1 -> h c2 f == ( ->) ( c1 -> c2 )
The last equality stems from the fact that there 's only one reasonable functor instance for ( c1 -> c2 ) -> h c1 -> h c2 ; the functor for functions i.e. the reader monad , taking ( c1 -> c2 ) as its " read -in " .
We can do a few more simplifications :
h c1 -> h c2 == b1 -> b2 b1 == h c1 b2 == h c2
Substitute everything in , and now we see :
fmap fmap fmap :: ( Functor g , Functor h ) => ( c1 -> c2 ) -> g ( h c1 ) -> g ( h c2 )
Interpret the types and we realize that fmap fmap fmap does a " double " lift of a function c1 -> c2 to two functors .
So we can run fmap fmap fmap ( +2 ) [ Just 3 ] and get back [ Just 5 ] ( utilizing the functor instance for the outer list and the inner maybe ) .
We also notice that the f functor dropped out ; this is because it was forced to a specific form , so really fmap fmap fmap == fmap .
fmap .
This makes it even more obvious that we 're doing a double lift : the function is fmap 'ed once , and then the result is fmap 'ed again .

Producing Trance Mixing / Production By Mike Senior
Not content with being one of the most celebrated DJs in the world , Armin Van Buuren has also had a string of club and chart hits .
We asked him to talk us through the production of a top‑notch trance anthem .
" I make what they call underground dance music , ” remarks Armin Van Buuren , as we talk in a hotel prior to his set at London 's Ministry Of Sound .
You'd be forgiven for raising an eyebrow at the ' underground ' part of that description .
After all , this is a man who has been at pole position in DJ magazine 's list of the top 100 DJs since 2007 , and has produced a string of hits since bursting onto the scene with his track ' Blue Fear ' in 1995 .
His popular weekly radio show , A State Of Trance , also recently celebrated its 400th episode , so it 's probably fair to say that Armin 's particular brand of ' underground ' is about as well concealed as London Transport's .
Unlike the Tube , though , Armin shows no sign of stopping .
A variety of new remix and production activity is continuing apace at a newly constructed studio in his home town of Leiden in the Netherlands , where he frequently works alongside his studio partner Benno De Goeij , half of the production duo Rank 1 .
To begin with , I asked him how he typically sets about putting together a track from scratch ; unsurprisingly , it 's his wide knowledge of the music scene , built up through his DJ'ing , that informs the process from the earliest stages .
" Usually we start by listening to other records .
There 's a few records around at any given time that have this hype around them , so all the producers listen to these records .
A little while ago you had Deadmau5 , with his sound , then you had people copying Deadmau5 .
We were listening to Deadmau5 as well , so our sound was a little influenced by that .
And you can clearly feel the whole dance community shifting in response to the best new records .
" I'm a trance DJ , that 's what people know me for , but I try to follow the trends as well .
The bpm over the last couple of years went down , for example , and productions have a lot of influences from minimal and electro percussion right now .
If we 're making a track or a remix , we listen to the current sound a lot .
You have to go on iTunes and listen to a lot of other records .
That 's really , really essential .
You 're not copying them , you 're being inspired by them .
The Beatles listened to Bob Dylan — it 's that kind of thing .
You kind of go with the flow .
DJs wo n't play your record if it does n't sound enough like the other records , because they 're building a set and they 've got to rock the crowd .
So no matter how many hours of production you put into it , if it does n't sound a little like the previous record or the record after it , then it 's not going to fit , and they 're not going to play it because it 'll make their set sound really weird .
So doing research is extremely important . ”
The genesis of a new track is frequently a single main theme .
" Usually we start with an eight ‑bar main theme , with maybe a piano melody or some strings , and drums and a bass line going .
In the studio we 've sync'ed up the main Mac via MIDIoverLAN , which is a really quick way of working .
I can be sitting behind the keys making a melody , and my sequencer 's running , sending out a MIDI clock to Ableton or Logic .
Benno , with the headphones on , can have a laptop connected to the system making loops , while I 'm making a bass line or melody , and it 's always in tempo .
It saves us a lot of time because two people can be creative at the same time ; sometimes we make a track in half an hour !
In fact , the strange thing is that all my biggest tracks were written in under two hours . ”
If the main eight ‑bar theme is showing enough promise , the producers will create variations on it , as a precursor to building a longer arrangement .
" We 'll copy the drums to a new eight ‑bar section , and that 'll be where the bass line is more straight , almost like a ' verse ' .
So we have eight bars of ' verse ' and eight bars of ' chorus ' , and then we try to make some interludes for it , to make it interesting — we copy the drum track again and start doing some freaky stuff to make the build‑up to the ' chorus ' more interesting .
Once I 've created those three sections , I can start building from there , and the good thing about that is that you do n't forget how you want the ' verses ' to sound and you do n't forget how you want the climax to sound .
I 'll then give the track four , five , six different sections , deciding where I want it to go in each section , and that 's when I start arranging . ”
The arrangement and writing approach remains pretty fluid , though , especially when Armin 's working with vocalists , as he did so successfully on the recent album Imagine and is continuing to do while developing new material .
" For my new album , right now I 've got eight ideas going .
Some are ideas where my brother comes into the studio and plays some guitar stuff , and I just put some Chicane chords and some drums on it , and spend 10 ‑ 15 minutes if it's a nice melody .
Then I 'll MP3 a two ‑minute clip and send it to a couple of vocalists .
That 's how I did most of Imagine .
Just send them random melodies — they 're not even tracks yet , they 're not even demos yet .
Usually every singer will send back a vocal idea which inspires me again to go into the studio and maybe drop the guitar , add in a bass line , and mix the vocal on top before sending it back again .
Then she writes the chorus . ”
Of course , the quality and inventiveness of the sounds a producer uses is also crucial in this particular musical sphere .
" You almost have to be a sound designer right now , just as much as you have to be good at writing themes or good at producing beats .
I come from the MIDI age , where you 'd have a big mixer with all the S3000s and a big Atari running in the middle , but now everything 's changed .
You really have to know what you 're doing .
" I can think in terms of arrangements because I 'm a DJ , whereas Benno is a sound guy , he can think in sounds .
The guy 's crazy : if he hears a particular sound in a record that I really like , he knows how to make that sound .
Let me tell you something : ES2 in Logic can make almost any sound you want .
Maybe there 's a few analogue things it can't do , but you can always emulate those in other ways .
Benno has proved to me that you can make 95 percent of any synth sound you want with ES2 .
You do n't really need more than one synthesizer if you invest some time in learning how to work it .
I know it 's really boring , but read some articles or buy a book about synthesis .
It 's even good to go into your synth 's presets and see how they 're built .
Is it one oscillator or two ?
What does unison do ?
FM ?
Distortion ?
If I draw the envelope differently , what effect does it have ?
Listen to a record you really like and try to recreate the main lead .
How did they make it ?
Is it a saw wave ?
Is a little detune going on ?
Why does it sound so wide ?
" One of my biggest tips would be to restrict your gear choice , because there 's so much out there ; restriction is good !
The technological possibilities available are humungous , and they 're actually too big for your own good .
Twenty years ago your Juno 106 had just 32 presets , so you had to be much more creative with what you had .
Right now you can buy a Virus TI with 16 oscillators and 12 distortions , so you can press one note and it goes ' Reeeoh ' and arpeggios are going everywhere , but it can actually very much limit your creativity .
If I really look at the essential stuff that we use , it 's all about ES1 , ES2 and EXS24 , and that 's it !
It 's so amazing what you can do with stuff like that .
I 'm lucky enough to have a lot of other synthesizers here , but those are just for inspiration .
Just as it was in the hardware MIDI days , you really have to invest time in knowing your equipment , so choose your plug‑ins carefully and do n't buy too much .
Every day I 'm still learning , and I always read the Logic section in Sound On Sound .
I 'm just starting to use groups after reading one of the articles recently , for instance — I 'd never used groups ! ”
Despite the practical advantages of keeping a certain sonic consistency between a each new track and the stylistic flavours of the month , Armin warns against simply duplicating settings between tracks .
" You do n't want to make the same record every time , which is what you hear a lot of successful producers doing .
It 's sort of sad when people have just one bass drum they rely on and they use it for every track .
Fair enough , you know it works , so do n't touch it ; that 's one way to go .
But the other way to go is to solve the problem differently .
For example , if you decide to use a different bass line , and it does n't have the nice warm low end you need , just use a sine wave and put it underneath , layering it so that it sounds as warm as your other bass lines .
That way the impact of the bass line is the same , but it 's not the same bass line .
" We consciously do not want to use the same sounds all the time , and while I can understand that SOS readers want to know how I work and want to have some guidance on how to work , if you just recreate a track that 's already there , you 're not helping the scene .
You 've got to try and make a little difference , even if 90 percent of it is copies of other people 's ideas . ”
After the writing process is complete , mixing is typically tackled as a separate stage , stripping the track back to drums and bass and building from there .
However , Armin stresses that much of the success at mixdown hinges on careful selection and arrangement of the sounds during the writing process .
" Everything you do in your life is all about choices , and that goes for making tracks as well .
You have to be conscious of the fact that you are making a choice — choosing that kick drum , choosing that bass line — and that you should make the right one at every stage .
If you 're cooking in the kitchen , you 've got to use the right blend of ingredients .
The individual ingredients you have might be perfect , but when you put them together the dish may taste awful .
It 's all about finding the ideal combination of sounds .
It 's pretty boring to go through over 1000 kick drums and over 1000 bass lines , but it 's definitely worth it , and although we do get into side ‑chaining the bass line from the kick drum , that wo n't necessarily make the kick itself any better .
Sometimes people want to try to cram too much in , as well .
Stick to one idea and finish that .
Do n't try to put four or five ideas in one track . ”
One of the hallmarks of Armin 's productions is openness and clarity , despite the lush synth textures and extensive delay and reverb effects , so I was keen to find out how he dealt with this mixing challenge .
" How do you get your mix to sound open ?
Use your EQ .
You do n't want to know how many Channel EQs we 've got going on , cutting bits away !
Only use the sounds in the frequency ranges you want them to be active in .
For example , you obviously want the kick drum to be at around 60‑ 70 Hz with a little top ' tick ' going on .
You can get rid of the other bits , even if it seems to make the kick drum nothing more than a hint of a kick drum .
Delays as well : they work best in the mids and highs .
Everything that goes on at lower frequencies , just filter it out .
" Likewise , a hi‑hat should be a hi‑hat , not a mid‑hi‑hat , or it will clog up your main melody .
A lot of people love Kid Cudi vs Crookers ' ' Day & Nite ' at the moment , but it has a breakbeat that comes in which I can't stand because it's at the same frequency as the main vocal .
You can't hear what he 's singing any more , especially when a multi‑band compressor starts working on it .
I would never do that .
I want to hear what the vocalist is singing . ”
Listening to Armin 's latest album in particular , it 's striking how the textures constantly shift from moment to moment , continually revealing subtle new programming details which help draw you into the track .
" We do add a lot of hidden elements , because it 's all about layers , especially with trance music .
In Logic 8 you can create a new track with duplicate settings , which is great .
For example , if you have a bass line going , you can have the same track going underneath it and then increase the attack slider a little bit so it makes it seem like a reverse effect , or put a little Noise Gate on it .
That 's what we do with a lot of things — just duplicate a track and adjust it so that for a different section it sounds more interesting .
No part of the track can sound the same .
Everything has to grow .
We also use a lot of automation ; it 's essential . ”
Distortion is also becoming an increasingly popular processing choice .
" It 's a little bit the sound of ' now ' .
Trance used to be very much about the sound of Roland 's JP8080 — the very clean Super Saw , a little detune , a little delay , that was it .
Right now it 's all about distortion and the harmonics you create when you distort something .
We use Logic 's Guitar Amp a lot for that , even on bass lines . ”
While a lot of home producers aspire to Armin Van Buuren 's production values , few actually succeed .
Why ?
Well , judging by the frequency with which the subject arises during our conversation together , a major factor has got to be the seriousness with which Armin approaches the subject of monitoring .
" What a lot of the dance music guys do is set up their own studio in their mum 's attic and then go to the music store and buy monitors , and the crucial thing I found out while making my last record is that that approach is completely wrong .
Here I 've been able to build my studio completely from the ground up , and while everything was still on the drawing board we got the monitor builder Mischa Jacobi in with us to design the speakers for that room .
And it 's completely changed my life , because now I can finally hear what I 'm doing !
" People send me tracks where they say , ' I do n't know what to do .
I 've done this mix a thousand times ! ” , and I can just grab an EQ and the whole problem 's gone , because I can hear what I 'm doing here .
The problem is that a lot of these kids work not only with wrong monitors but they work in an environment that 's completely wrong too .
It 's like if you decide to take a holiday to Paris , but you decide to go by bicycle rather than by plane , and then you do n't take a map , so you do n't know where you 're going !
" Working with my music on NS10s does n't really make sense either .
A lot of pop records are obviously made for radio , but if you make dance music , 50 percent of what you 're doing is actually supposed to be for clubs , so it 's about low end . ”
However , although pride of place in his mix room now goes to enormous custom ‑built 200kg Royal Sound Systems monitors , I notice that he still has a familiar pair of off ‑the‑shelf active monitors up on stands too .
He laughs : " I 've mixed for years on the Mackie HR824s , so I still have them here .
They have way too much low end , but , hate 'em or love 'em , they just sound really good and you sort of get used to them ! ”
So how did Armin judge the low end of his mixes before he had such a precision system ?
" Trial and error !
For bass levels there 's the ' feel your woofer ' trick .
If it comes out too far you can feel it .
Listen to your record on as many different systems as you can .
It should sound good on your mum 's kitchen stereo , it should sound amazing in the club , and it should sound good in your studio .
At one point we were car‑testing constantly : we'd make a quick two ‑minute bounce , burn it onto CD , hop into the car , and listen to it there .
A / B'ing with other records can also help , especially for club music .
I compare a lot with other tracks in iTunes , and we have a special folder called ' This is how we want our records to sound ' .
That 's how you do it — just use your ears . ”
Speaking with Armin about his work , it 's clear that he has taken an extremely patient and methodical approach to building his now formidable production skills , but as work on his new album continues he still seems keen to absorb fresh new ideas through collaboration with other musicians .
" Every human being works in a different way .
No matter who I 've worked with , we 've always learnt stuff from each other .
There 's always something to learn from someone else . ”
And for the rest of us , there 's a lot to learn from Armin Van Buuren .
Mastering & Compression
Although a lot of electronic music producers seem tempted to master their own tracks , Armin is cagey about following this trend .
" I 'm too insecure about it , ” he admits , " so I leave it up to a mastering engineer . ”
He 's also disinclined to mix through mastering ‑style multi‑band processors .
" The problem with multi‑band compression over the main outputs is that it usually clogs up the mix very fast .
I get sent lots of promos , and now all these kids are using multi‑band compression to get their music to sound like my radio show .
But that goes through a broadcast compressor , and if you heard it that way in a club you 'd walk out of the club a half hour later screaming because there 's no dynamics in there .
It 's really important to have some dynamics left .
" So we do n't really use compression in that way .
If we use a compressor we use it for sound design rather than for the overall mix .
For example , I really like the Wave Arts multi‑band dynamics plug‑in — you can put some little noise in there and it really pulls out a lot of information .
Using compression to create the ducking effect on a bass line is really important too , to give the kick drum and the bass space .
We do a lot of side ‑chaining . ”
Entertainment Is Not Analogue Or Digital
" In my new studio I can use my outboard gear now as well within Logic , which is heaven .
Heaven !
But — and this is going to sound really bad to the analogue freaks —
I 'm otherwise mixing internally now , because it 's easy and you 've got total recall .
Computers are fast enough now , finally .
If people want an analogue mix , I have a Toft mixer and I can still do an analogue mix .
Sometimes I still do , but I 'd really say 95 percent of the people I 'm playing for do not care if it 's mixed analogue or digital .
Songs are much more important .
I do n't even hear the difference between a 192kbps and a 320 kbps MP3 , to be brutally honest with you !
What matters is the music , your ideas — you 're an entertainer . ”
Linux lovers and Windows haters everywhere are gonna love this !
Chinese company Ylmf ( an abbreviation for Yulinmufeng , or Rainforest Wind ) has released a Linux distribution that 's skinned to look exactly like Windows XP .
The company has even gone so far as to purchase the XP.com domain , for a reported US $ 100,000 , which currently redirects to their website .
Ignoring the legalities of blatantly replicating Microsoft 's user interface , one must admit that there 's a certain brilliance behind an OS such as this .
One of the biggest stumbling blocks for Windows switchers is that both Linux and Mac OS are much different experiences than they 're accustomed to .
A Linux distribution dressed up as Windows XP certainly solves that problem , as users would be presented with almost the exact same graphical interface as the old Microsoft OS .
The operating system is based on Ubuntu 9.10 , and comes complete with the following programs :
Open Office
Firefox Browser
Filezilla FTP
Client
Transmission Bit Torrent Client
Pidgin Instant Message Client
aMule P2P Client
Claws Mail
Sogou IME
SMPlayer
Wine
The Firefox browser comes with the Baidu search bar , an entry point to China 's dominant search engine .
And given the recent Google / China controversy , it 's safe to say that this was a wise choice .
While the legalities of this Windows copycat are surely dubious , it could potentially keep many Chinese users from installing pirated Windows .
That said , I would be surprised to see the Ymlf OS gain any momentum , except maybe on some Shanzhai machines .
The new English version on the other hand ( which I 'm downloading as I write this ) could potentially gain a cult following among Linux users hoping to trick their friends into switching to a more secure OS !
I hope to update with a look at the English version as soon as I install it .
Stay tuned !
If you have ever moved house before , you know just how much of a stressful time it can be .
This stress is only amplified if you have a family and there are a lot of people to consider when moving .
Having a family also means there is a lot more stuff that needs to be moved from one place to another .
Some people try to tackle the move themselves , but most of the time these days people look to the assistance of a professional removalist company .
Liverpool removalists , for example , are able to take care of the entire move , which can give you great peace of mind and free up some time for you to work through other important aspects of the move .
When you are moving , the good news is that there are a lot of different removalist companies that are able to offer their assistance .
But before you choose one , it is important that you ask them a few questions first .
It is always a good idea to engage with a couple of different businesses to compare what they are offering , as well as the all - important price !
So , have a read on below to find out more information on the types of questions you should be asking before hiring a removalist :
Do You Have Insurance ?
Probably one of the most important questions to ask , while a professional removalist company is experienced and knows the best way to pack items to limit and prevent damage , sometimes the damage of items does occur .
If this does happen you want to know that the removalist company is insured .
Another important thing to ask is if the insurance they have covers your belongings , or you need to get your own additional insurance .
How Much Experience Do You Have ?
Sometimes if you have unusual pieces that need to be moved or particularly valuable items , it is important to consider how much experience they have .
This is not just a general experience when it comes to removal , but specific experience in moving a particular item .
For example , if you have a lot of valuable artwork , it is important that you find a removalist company that understands how to properly move an artwork without it getting damaged .
How Will My Items By Moved ?
Every removalist company is slightly different , and your individual situation is going to be different as well , so there are a lot of different aspects that you and the removalists need to consider when it comes to moving your items .
For example , you may live in an apartment block , which makes it especially difficult to move items , especially larger ones , or you may be moving interstate , which means your items may be required to be moved from one truck to another .
How Is The Fee Calculated and What Is Included ?
There are a number of different ways that removalist companies calculate their fee , so make sure you ask and have a full understanding of what the fee is before you finalise your choice .
Something else you also need to consider is what is actually included in the fee .
For example , does the fee include removalists actually packing your items into boxes , or are they strictly just moving items on to the truck .
What Extra Precautions Are In Place For My Fragile Items ?
No matter who you are or the type of belongings you have , you are going to have fragile items .
Therefore it is important that you fully understand how the removalist company plans to protect your particularly fragile items , so that they do n’t get damaged in the move .

If you ever needed evidence that right - wingers have no boundaries -- in terms logic , ethics , or basic decency -- that they will not trample all over in the defense of conservative " values " and leaders , check out Pam " Atlas Wanks Shrugs " Geller earlier this week on the Joy Behar show ( along with Stephanie Miller ) , trying to tell Ron Reagan Jr. that his father would have been a big fan of Sarah Palin :
Behar : Ronald , let me ask Ron -- why do we pay attention to this woman ?
She has a point .
Reagan :
Well , indeed , and I think we do have to pay attention to her , unfortunately -- it 's sad that we have to pay attention to her , because she 's totally unqualified for high office .
Yet --
Geller :
Your father would love her .
Your father would love her .
Miller : First of all , his father did n't quit halfway through the term .
Geller : Neither did she .
Neither did she .
She did not quit .
The Lower 48 needed her , and she heeded the call .
She did not take the easy way out .
Reagan : No , she quit .
No , Pam , she quit .
When you leave the governorship halfway through your first term , it 's called quitting .
She quit .
Geller :
She came to lead the next revolution .
Reagan : Quit .
Quit .
Behar : Ron , Ron -- no , I want to hear from Ron .
Why would your father not like this woman ?
Reagan :
Because she does n't have a thought in her head .
That 's why .
Geller :
That 's what they said about your father .
Reagan :
My father knew what he stood for , you can agree with it or disagree with it , he knew how -- what he stood for , he could explain what he stood for .
He was conversant in domestic and foreign policy -- she 's neither !
She can't explain where she stands on anything !
Geller :
Your father would love her , and frankly I do n't think you can speak for your father , because you -- you do n't even espouse --
Reagan :
No , Pam , actually , have you ever met my father , Pam ?
Pam , did you ever meet my father ?
Geller : Did you ever meet the Founding Father .
I 've read everything he said .
I 've read everything he said .
Reagan : Did you ever meet my father ?
I 'm asking you a simple question .
You can't answer that because the answer is no .
So why do n't you rely on someone who knew him very well to tell you what he would think of Sarah Palin .
Behar :
It 's really hard for you to argue with the offspring of the guy and claim you know more than he does .
Geller :
He 's nothing like the father !
He does n't share the epistemology of the father .
He does n't have the nature of his father , the knowledge -- he has nothing in common with the father .
Look --
Behar :
He knows what his father would think rather than you .
[ Crosstalk ]
Reagan : Is Pam still blathering about me and my father ?
Oh , you are .
You still have n't met him , though , right ?
You still did n't know him , so you 're just sort of making things up as you go along , right ?
Geller :
You never met him either .
You know , you never met him either .
Do you think you 're making your father proud ?
Do you really think you 're making your father proud ?
Last month , the Minnesota State Prohibition of Genital Mutilation Act of 2010 was proposed in the Minnesota State Legislature by MGMbill.org .
The bill , intended to protect against non-consensual genital mutilation , specifically to bolster protection for minors .
The bill states that genital mutilation applies to anyone who âÄúknowingly circumcises , excises , cuts or mutilates the whole or any part of the labia majora , labia minora , clitoris , vulva , breasts , nipples , foreskin , glans , testicles , penis , ambiguous genitalia , hermaphroditic genitalia or genital organs of another person , who has not attained the age of 18 years , or on any non-consenting adult .
âÄ ù
I find it hard to imagine that even the morally mediocre among us would not agree that the infliction of such damage upon a child is morally repugnant .
Although genital mutilationâÄôs widespread infliction is usually confined to non-modernized people in the collective consciousness , the conscripted genital mutilation of children is commonplace in the United States .
It is not performed on strangers , but on family members , while ritual onlookers refrain from interference .
By the MGM BillâÄôs definition , genital mutilation doesnâÄôt occur merely in the derogatorily uncivilized form it is generally thought of , but in the much more socially acceptable form of religious circumcision .
Although the act does include exceptions for medical emergencies , it does not distinguish various forms of religious and cultural circumcision from genital mutilation .
The number of religions that routinely practice circumcision are not insignificant .
It is common practice within the Abrahamic religions ( Judaism , Christianity and Islam ) to circumcise male children within the first two weeks of birth as a symbol of the covenant between God and man , according to the book of Genesis .
In 2007 , the World Health Organization published that , in the United States , âÄúan estimated 61 percent of male newborns were recorded as being circumcised on hospital discharge sheets in 2000 , âÄ ù but it also indicates that the number is misleadingly low since âÄúpost - neonatal circumcisions for religious and medical reasons are not captured .
âÄù Undoubtedly , religious groups are going to object to the interpretation of genital mutilation defined by the MGM Bill .
But the devastatingly intense pain of bisecting the foreskin ( which contains 20,000 nerves ) with the glans or âÄúheadâÄù ( which contains around 4,000 nerves ) is absolutely unimaginable to me , as a male .
But the forced circumcision of minors is not exclusive to males .
Female genital mutilation is also practiced by some East - African subcultures , often by those who are not trained medically .
Female circumcision is not referenced in Jewish or Christian texts ; less popular Islamic traditions based on the controversial hadith literature state that a female must also be circumcised .
The process of genital mutilation is arguably even more physically and emotionally devastating for women .
It is not always performed during their first few weeks of living , when they have the chance to forget the trauma , but instead occurs from ages as young as 3 and beyond the teens .
Female genital mutilation also takes different forms based on tradition , from removal of the clitoris and labia coupled with sewing up of the vagina âÄî a process known as infibulation âÄî to the comparatively less severe but still atrociously painful removal of the tip of the clitoris .
Female genital mutilation can cause lingering psychological damage as well as infection and risk of death from shock and blood loss .
The First Amendment , which protects the free exercise of religion , is sure to ignite a controversial debate about the MGM Bill .
Unfortunately for objectors , Congress has already found that legal impediments upon female genital mutilation do not violate the First Amendment .
While it may not be politically popular to say so , the false dichotomy between the Abrahamic religions and cultural practices of female genital mutilation is merely an issue of popularity in the voting pool .
If the First Amendment doesnâÄôt cover traditional practices of some East Africans because they are less popular , then surely the constitutional obligation lies in revoking the First Amendment protections for Abrahamic circumcisions .
The debate surrounding health and circumcision isnâÄôt much of a debate either .
ItâÄôs clear that , for females , no health benefit is derived from genital mutilation , and the risks of infection and reproductive nullification greatly increase .
Circumcision for males has long been touted as having medical benefits , though on questionable evidence , such as decreased probability of urinary tract infection , decreased risk of sexually transmitted disease and easier hygiene .
The drawbacks of circumcision are the pain and possibility of a botched procedure , as well as the lingering effect of depriving the minor of his natural sensation and violating his choice in the matter .
The obsolete nature of circumcision for medical reasons ought to be apparent when considering that we no longer live in the Bronze Age Levant of Abraham but a medically - equipped 21st century where these problems are readily prevented and resolved by knowledge of diet and medical procedure .
The Minnesota Congress ought to consider and adopt the MGM anti-genital mutilation proposal as a bold proclamation that reaffirms human worth and individual choice above cruel cultural and religious traditions .

Trying to get an accurate portrait of the music of French drone composer Eliane Radigue via samples on the Internet is pointless .
It 's like looking at a splinter to reckon a table .
Her compositions are usually longer than 45 minutes and the effect of her music -- or , the effect it 's had on me -- is cumulative and requires patience .
If I want slogans or instant , searing gratification , I am more than happy to turn on " Born to Run " , and sometimes do .
If I want a warm , private rumble , I turn on Eliane Radigue and turn off my phone .
Not only is her music impossible to sample , it 's hard to grade -- something that Important Records ' John Brien underscored in an email to me recently by saying , " Good luck w/ that . "
Important -- a label Brien started in 2001 out of his apartment in Newburyport , Mass. , a coastal city 45 minutes north of Boston -- has played midwife to small - batch underground stuff ranging from Om live records to a 13xCD Merzbow set packaged in a handmade bamboo box .
( The label 's motto : " Because we love music even more than you . " )
By comparison then , their issuing of Triptych ( 1978 ) and Vice Versa , etc. ( 1970 ) , which have never been on CD , is one of their least esoteric , plainly noble gestures -- they 're just getting the music out there where it did n't exist before .
Both pieces came at pivot points in Radigue 's career .
Vice Versa is a tape - based drone recorded in 1970 , a year before Radigue started working with the ARP 2500 , a synthesizer that looks like a telephone switchboard with a keyboard and weighs about 60 pounds .
For decades after , she used it exclusively .
1978 's Triptych was Radigue 's first full composition after dropping out of music to dedicate herself to Tibetan Buddhism in 1974 .
( Though she did n't leave Buddhism behind -- her works through the 70s , 80s , and 90s are not only suffused with a sense of contemplativeness and unrepentant nowness , but they 're literally based on events and stories from Buddhist literature . )
Vice Versa is made from tape feedback , divided into four tracks played at different speeds , the shortest lasting 2:44 and the longest lasting 13:43 .
The set 's second disc is the same tracks , backwards .
Radigue 's intention was to let a listener mix and match ( which is unusual given that digital technology makes this infinitely easier than it would 've been 40 years ago , though this also explains why VV's first and only run was limited to 10 copies ) .
Unlike Triptych -- or most of what she wrote during the ARP years -- there 's not a lot of rise and fall to the composition .
It 's sensuous music ; it 's actually about sound .
Did I play the backwards tracks against the frontwards ones ?
Yes , and to great satisfaction .
My speakers quivered , my mind released .
But while the concept behind the music is elegant , it 's also the music 's driving force , and it ultimately makes the piece feel antiseptic compared to what came later .
[ For some good , honest writing on the dilemma of music designed to be listened to in specific , sometimes inconvenient ways , read Pitchfork managing editor Mark Richardson 's recent Resonant Frequency column . ]
Triptych , conversely , is wonderful .
Radigue 's music does n't just have depth , it has narrative : it rises and falls ; it dilates and contracts , utilizing pure sound rather than harmony for its development .
Watching Radigue work in the studio ( there 's documentary footage of this ) , it 's easier to understand how her music sounds as hand - hewn as it does :
She 's actually sitting there , sliding sliders , patching cables , turning dials .
It 's guided by human hands and feels that way -- enveloping , almost sweet .
Her stopwatch , which she uses to measure the duration of tones in a piece , is nicknamed " nounours " -- " teddy bear . "
Triptych works over long periods of time in weirdly magical ways -- 40 seconds of the piece might sound exactly the same , but skip ahead five minutes and it will sound completely different .
It 's subtle , but it keeps a dynamic .
This is the best defense it has against listeners who might just want to say that it bores them because " nothing happens " -- it 's right there ; things are happening constantly , they 're just almost imperceptible .
Whether or not you want this experience in your life -- of deep listening to quiet music that does more to facilitate thought and imagination than guide it -- is up to you .
Like rock climbing or marriage or anything else , all avocational arguments for it are slightly moral .
I do n't privilege Radigue 's music over other music , but I do privilege it over other music of its kind .
In a recent documentary by Austria 's Institute for Media Archeology , Radigue said , " In the beginning , there was a certain music that I wished to make .
It was this particular music and no other . "
It 's not an overstatement :
Hers is a particular music , but there 's nothing like it .
Jean - Christophe Lafaille was the most gifted mountaineer of his generation .
Small , strong and fearless , he ascended the world 's highest peaks without oxygen or back - up ; climbing alone because no one else could match his supernatural speed .
Then , three months ago , with the 8,000 m pinnacle of Makalu in his sights , he vanished .
Jason Burke his final steps
On his last morning alive , Jean - Christophe Lafaille woke up perhaps the most profoundly alone man on the planet .
His tiny tent , specially designed for ultra-high altitude , was perched on a small ridge at around 25,000 ft on an icy shoulder of Makalu , the world 's fifth largest mountain .
Either side of the tent , huge rock and snow cliffs and avalanching slopes swept down to the distant valleys of the high Nepalese Himalayas .
There was nothing above him except Makalu 's summit , some 3,000 ft higher .
Lafaille had slept through his alarm and woken around 5 am , when he called his wife Katia to tell her he was now up and moving .
Ahead of him was a day that few normal human beings could have survived for more than a few minutes .
Even by the standards of this most gifted and hardened mountaineer , the task Lafaille had set himself was almost unprecedented in modern mountaineering .
Outside it was around - 30C , still dark , with a light wind .
The summit of Makalu would take 10 hours of hard and dangerous climbing to reach ; up steep ice slopes , through crevasse - strewn glaciers and rocky cliffs , gasping in the thin air at an altitude at which passenger jets cruise .
No one had ever climbed the mountain in winter before - let alone without oxygen , or back - up .
Lafaille made himself a hot drink , ate a little , stuffed food and water in his rucksack , pulled on his boots and picked up his ice axes .
Before leaving his tent , he rang his wife again .
And then the finest climber in France , arguably in the world , disappeared .
It was late January this year and Lafaille , 40 , was climbing in the hardest way possible .
He had no rope mates , no porters , no rescue team .
At his base camp , 7,000 ft below , there were three local Nepali sherpas with a radio .
There were no other expeditions anywhere near him , and no one else on the mountain .
Lafaille , as he always preferred , had the huge expanse of rock and snow and ice , and the cold and the wind and the great arcing vault of the Himalayan sky all to himself .
His only link to the rest of mankind was a portable satellite telephone - which he had been using to call Katia and his four - year - old son several times a day .
This is a story of love and death , of the complex and often difficult relationship that a prodigiously gifted , driven man such as Lafaille can have with a sport - a sport which for him was a profession , a vocation and a passion .
It is a tale of his extraordinary relationship , framed by the world 's highest and most dangerous peaks , with his wife , lover , closest friend , professional partner and the mother of his child .
This is the story of the short , happy life of Jean - Christophe Lafaille .
Lafaille was born in Gap , in the foothills of the French Alps , in 1965 .
He started climbing at a young age , inspired by the books collected by his father , a keen amateur mountaineer .
He quickly proved to be an extraordinary talent , forcing new and spectacular routes on the rock cliffs near his home .
Such exploits were not particularly dangerous - climbers protected themselves with a system of metal bolts set into the rock - but they were extremely demanding .
Lafaille 's compact 5ft 3in , 8st 6lb frame did not hold him back .
He was not very interested in drinking and going to nightclubs as a teenager , he said later , almost apologetically .
Soon , he graduated to the high mountains of the Alps , where he quickly proved himself .
The fiercely competitive French mountaineering milieu began to take notice when the young upstart climber began ' repeating ' some of the hardest routes in the Mont Blanc massif .
Such routes sometimes took days , though Lafaille cracked them with an extraordinary speed and technical proficiency that was to become his trademark .
Lafaille first climbed the hardest existing routes and then spearheaded a new wave .
The climbs took him into a vertical universe where , under constant threat of rockfall or avalanche , he climbed overhanging ice with axes and crampons , and scaled walls of rock using metal pegs only slightly thicker than a coin , hammered into minuscule cracks as holds .
Many climbs he did alone , setting up complicated rope arrangements to protect himself or merely relying on his own ability to avoid a fall of several thousand feet .
In 1992 , one of France 's top mountaineers , Pierre Beghin , asked Lafaille if he would like to go to the Himalayas to attempt a complicated and extremely challenging new route on Annapurna , one of the 14 peaks in the world that are more than 8,000 metres ( 26,000 ft ) high .
He was 27 years old and could only accept .
The trip went horribly wrong .
After several days of climbing , high on a huge , exposed face of Annapurna , a mountain almost double the height of Mont Blanc , a storm erupted and the two men decided to descend .
To climb down a vertical wall of complex terrain the size of Annapurna is as dangerous as climbing up , if not worse .
The two men began to abseil , fixing their 150 ft - long rope to spikes of rock or lumps of ice , then sliding down it , before pulling the rope down and using it again to descend a little further .
Occasionally , when nothing else was available , they used metal pegs or a piece of equipment known as a ' friend ' , which expands and takes a hold in cracks when weighted , to fix the rope to the mountain face .
But such devices are not foolproof .
Beghin fixed a ' friend ' and had just began to abseil when the artificial anchor popped out .
Lafaille was watching his far more experienced rope mate from above , and looking straight into his face , when the rope slipped and Beghin fell backwards into space .
Any fall at that altitude is usually fatal .
Beghin , carrying the bulk of the two men's equipment , dropped the entire length of the face .
Lafaille was left alone , with no food , no water and almost no equipment , and with an arm broken by rock fall .
It took him five days to climb down the vertical mile or more of rock and ice to base camp .
Lafaille later described looking out from the wall as he descended and seeing the lights of the trekking lodges in the valley below , a world of security and comfort and human warmth that seemed impossibly distant .
Pictures taken of the young mountaineer after the ordeal show him almost destroyed , a terrible hunted look in his hollowed eyes .
Yet he did not give up climbing .
I know Chamonix well , but I still stop the car when I round the bend in the steep road and the vast white wall of Mont Blanc swings into sight at the end of the valley .
It is , as ever , a breathtaking sight .
I can see the ridge at 14,000 ft where I once bivouacked , 15 years ago , ill - clad in borrowed clothes .
To the young Lafaille , Mont Blanc was a testing ground and a playground .
He would have seen the possibilities of purer and purer routes , each taking the most natural , the hardest , the most direct line to a summit .
He would also have read - as commuters read newspapers or traffic reports and farmers read fields - snow conditions , rockfall danger and the weather .
I have come to Chamonix to interview people who knew Lafaille .
Everybody knew him in a way : as France 's best - known climber his face adorned the covers of dozens of magazines .
Climbers in France are major celebrities , household names , almost pin-ups ; their exploits are major news stories .
France even has a minister for mountaineering .
The reasons for this interest are manifold : the Alps , the Pyrenees and the sun-drenched crags of the south of the country are all an integral part of the image the French have of their own country , as important as cheese or wine .
The men and women who perform such extraordinary feats among these mountains represent something in the national spirit .
It is no surprise to see Lafaille 's sharp , elfin features on posters in half the outdoor gear shops in the country .
A number of journalists - many of them climbers - have told me how , after the Annapurna tragedy , Lafaille went on through the mid-Nineties to push back the barriers of modern mountaineering further and further .
Not content with simply climbing the great north faces of the Alps individually , he did nine of them , including the famous Eiger , one after another without pause in 15 days , skiing from one to the next .
When his work as a guide and instructor in Chamonix allowed , he returned to the Himalayas to complete a series of difficult new routes .
Instead of climbing with huge expeditions , with ropes fixed to allow easy ascent and escape , and porters carrying tonnes of equipment , Lafaille often climbed alone , almost always without any support , and certainly without any oxygen .
All the journalists who had interviewed Lafaille described him as eerily quiet , modest , unassuming , friendly and gentle .
' Very different , ' said one , ' from your average screwed up , egomaniac , hyper - sensitive top - flight French climber , or any ultra - high level athlete for that matter . '
But though many reporters praised Lafaille , they did not all rush to praise his wife , Katia .
I had expected Lafaille to be the classic driven climber who leaves his wife and family to single - mindedly pursue a selfish and irresponsible dream .
But the critics told another story : Katia cut him off from his friends and turned him into a media star .
One went further .
On Makalu , the final climb , it was the media pressure that eventually pushed him too far , he said .
His wife was in charge of the media ... draw your own conclusions , he implied .
Harsh words indeed about a widow , I thought , but wrote them down nonetheless .
Yann Geizendanner is Chamonix's Mr Weather .
He has worked at the local meteorological office for 30 years and is consulted by many of France 's top climbers .
He began working with Lafaille eight years ago , not for money , but for the sheer joy of helping an extraordinary climber enter the history books .
We meet in his flat on the slopes above the town .
Through the kitchen window I watch the thick clouds coiling around the Bossons glacier , a mile - wide jumble of vast ice - blocks - seracs - and crevasses ; gaping splits in the ice that could swallow a house .
The clouds descend as the light goes out of the sky and night falls .
' Who was Lafaille ? '
I ask Geizendanner .
' There was Lafaille , ' he says , ' but there was also the Lafaille couple .
If Katia had not existed Jean - Christophe could never have been able to do what he did .
It was a combination unique in the mountaineering world .
It was thanks to the money she was able to bring in that he could climb like he did .
We were a team , ' he explains .
' Katia handled the media , the commercial side and the logistics , I did the weather and Jean - Christophe trained and climbed . '
This is not , I think , the image the critics have sketched .
Nor is it the norm in the slightly bizarre world of professional climbing .
It is not often you find a top - flight mountaineer with anything that resembles a settled and happy private life .
The travel , the drive , the ambition , the danger , the fact that even the most successful climbers do not make a great deal of money , all conspire to make profound relationships in the world of climbing rare .
And there are even fewer mountaineers who , like Lafaille , have children and , for good or bad , a partner who is an integral part of their career .
Geizendanner was as close to Lafaille as anybody , other than Katia .
After all , Lafaille 's life depended on his judgment several times .
The most astonishing example of Geizendanner 's worth came on the most important mountain of all for Lafaille .
In 2002 , he and a team of four climbers , all of them among the best in the world , attempted an astonishingly audacious new route on Annapurna .
Two turned back , but Lafaille and a partner , trusting a forecast from Geizendanner , pressed on .
For five days they climbed along a knife - edge ridge from which the slightest wind or mistake would send them plummeting to their deaths .
There was no way they could have been rescued .
But Geizendanner 's forecast was correct , their strength held out and Lafaille reached the summit of Annapurna .
He sat with his legs dangling over the face he had down - climbed alone 10 years earlier , after Beghin 's fall , and wept for the man who had died there .
It was one of the most incredible climbs of modern mountaineering .
Why did Lafaille climb ?
I ask Geizendanner .
' He told me that at altitude he would feel independent , autonomous .
He would feel his survival instincts alive .
He used to say that it was a pleasure for him to be up there .
But more and more he liked to be in Vallorcines with Katia and the kids .
He had nothing left to prove - to himself or anyone else .
Why did he climb alone ?
' Because there was no one as fast or as strong as him , ' says Geizendanner .
' Anyone else would have held him back - and in the mountains moving fast is safest . '
What about the supposed media pressure ?
Geizendanner shakes his head .
' There was no media pressure .
Katia knew exactly what she was doing .
She was careful to protect him .
In fact , she might have gone too far the other way .
The problem was that JC became a bit isolated from his old friends and colleagues .
Katia wanted him to focus on training , to not be distracted or worried by the groupies , the criticism , the jealousy .
She was the only one to whom he would really listen .
Alone , Katia would have done nothing ; alone , JC would have been a good alpinist .
But together they became a legend . '
How many of the climbers you know are dead ?
I ask .
' Quite a lot , ' Geizendanner replies .
' But they were not madmen or crazies .
They did n't have death wishes .
It was the need to be up high , and to prove something .
And , of course , they did it to earn a living .
If Lafaille had been the first Frenchman to climb all 14 of the world 's 8,000 m peaks he and his family could have lived off it for the rest of his life . '
Seven years ago , in the last serious climbing I did , I climbed to over 7,000 m on a mountain in the Himalayas .
At that altitude , every step was an enormous effort , and was followed by great rasping breaths .
My brain , starved of oxygen , took ages to cope with the easiest tasks .
It took me 20 minutes to put on my double - layered ice boots , dully wondering what the L and the R I had marked on them meant .
I had no appetite ( eating just granola bars or dried fruit , despite the intense physical effort ) but a desperate thirst - the need to irrigate my lungs and to offset my altitude - thickened blood .
Melting snow for lukewarm soup or tea took hours .
I slept in five or 10 - minute apnoea - ridden snatches , awakening each time panting like a dog dying in the dark .
And then there was the cold .
Lafaille plunged his hands and feet into buckets of ice cubes to prepare them for freezing temperatures before his climb .
I did n't .
I woke with ice on my eyelids .
The cold was intense enough to become a nauseating physical pain , the kind you feel when you bark your shins against a low table .
When three climbers on another expedition died after making an elementary error of navigation in a fog a few hundred metres from our top camp , I decided to turn back .
I have barely climbed since .
I was at around 7,000 metres for a day or so on an easy mountain .
Lafaille spent weeks of his life at altitudes much higher , often climbing extraordinarily difficult terrain that most experienced mountaineers would not be capable of even at oxygen - rich lower altitudes .
It is difficult to give an impression of quite how fit and mentally strong someone like Lafaille has to be .
Ed Viesturs , the first American climber to scale all the world 's 8,000 m peaks , was one of the few mountaineers with whom Lafaille was prepared to share a rope .
Viesturs , a lean and laconic 44 - year - old , was one of those who turned back on Annapurna in 2002 when the French climber went on to complete his extraordinary high - altitude high - wire act on his ascent of the mountain .
' I thought it too risky to continue , but JC went on and succeeded , ' he says .
' It 's a very personal thing .
There 's no right and no wrong .
He was a little guy but phenomenally strong , very , very fast and absolutely gifted .
He was technically the most talented all - round climber in the world .
He could climb anything .'
After the expedition , Viesturs and Lafaille became close friends , climbing together the following year on two other major 8,000 m peaks in Pakistan , Broad Peak and Nanga Parbat .
Even though the two men barely shared a common language , Viesturs said they ' could always communicate .
He had similar values .
He loved his family as well as climbing .
I like being with my wife , my three kids , my home here in Seattle . '
I ask Viesturs , who has been on more than 30 expeditions , how he reconciles a family life and his career .
' I have always been a professional climber , ' he says .
' My wife knew what she was getting into and I have always told her that I would be as safe and as conservative as I can be .
You can manage a risk .
A lot of people cause their own problems .
They disregard the conditions and go for the top .
The art of mountaineering is walking away .
Crevasses do n't care if you are famous . '
Viesturs rarely climbs alone , but did so on Everest ( which he has climbed six times ) in 1993 .
' It was a psychological journey , ' he tells me .
' It 's tough , you have nobody to talk to , but uplifting , too .
There are not many places on this planet where you can be so alone . '
We talk a little more - about the bitchiness of the Chamonix climbing scene , about how Lafaille was something of an outsider there and about those who accuse mountaineers , especially those with wives and children , of being selfish , egotistic , irresponsible .
' People who criticise are ignorant or stupid .
They should go out and climb fourteen 8,000 m peaks and then we 'll talk . '
Lafaille lived in Vallorcines , a small village set high above Chamonix .
To reach it , I drive out of the town , along the base of a valley flanked by huge mountains .
It is a dozen degrees below zero .
The clouds have cleared and the sky is a crystalline clear blue .
A thin plume of cloud is being driven off the summit of Mont Blanc .
Katia Lafaille is 36 , small , slim , lightly tanned and strikingly pretty .
We shake hands and I say , ' How are you ? ' and , as people do after a bereavement , she says , ' Fine , thanks ' automatically .
And then adds , ' Well ... not really fine at all ' and leads me into the old school house that she and her husband were in the process of converting into a family home when he set off for Makalu three months before .
We walk through a storeroom packed with the blue plastic drums used by climbers to transport equipment .
There is a set of skis next to the door .
Katia and Lafaille knew each other for several years before they got together ; she was a climber , too , her boyfriends were climbers .
' We were just friends , ' she says , ' but there was always a good feeling .
We finally got together on New Year 's Day 1998 .
It was a very powerful , very profound love . '
She recalls how , ' His eyes sparkled when he spoke about the hills .
Other climbers I knew just tried to prove things , to deal with their own issues through climbing ; but he just loved their beauty , their purity , being among them , he loved the people who lived among them . '
I ask why Lafaille climbed alone .
Katia 's answer is different from those of Geizendanner and Viesturs .
' Because he did not want to see another climbing partner get killed like on Annapurna , ' she said .
' He preferred to be completely autonomous . '
But like Geizendanner , Katia stresses , too , that such autonomy also meant safety .
There was no one else , less talented , weaker , to endanger him .
Quite early on in their relationship , Katia , who had worked in PR , took over the commercial side of things .
' Before , Jean - Christophe was just interested in earning a bit of cash to keep climbing .
He negotiated his sponsorship contracts with a quick conversation over a coffee .
He was an artist , not interested in material things . '
One of the criticisms levelled at Katia was that she had encouraged Lafaille to try and ' tick off ' the world 's 8,000 m peaks .
Mountaineering purists often sneer at the ' commercial gimmickry ' of the list .
Such criticism conceals two very harsh charges levelled against Katia .
The first is that Lafaille was ' ticking the list ' for sordid financial reasons .
The second is that if he had not been ticking the list - he had done 11 of the 14 ' 8,000 - ers ' - he might not have been on Makalu , and therefore might still be alive .
' Yes , ' Katia says , ' I suggested doing the 8,000 m peaks .
He said he did not want to get involved in a list , but I pointed out that each year he kept setting off to do another 8,000 m peak so he was up on these mountains anyway .
I tried convincing him to climb smaller peaks , but he said there was something special on the bigger ones .
He loved being up there alone , with the beauty and the emptiness and just him , his strength and skill .
So I thought , " OK , if you are going to do it anyway , we might as well do it properly , " get everything organised and get enough sponsorship so that he could climb with everything he needed . '
The point is quite simple and silences all the criticism .
Yes , Katia made sure Lafaille did what brought in the cash .
But she did it so her husband would be safer .
I tell Katia that I had heard that her husband was getting tired of the big mountains .
' To an extent , ' she says .
' When Ed [ Viesturs ] finished his 8,000 - ers , Jean - Christophe said that he wished he had finished his .
I said : " Fine .
Stop then .
Stop if you want to . "
But then he said that he was just interested in Makalu as a project .
He said he wanted to do it anyway .
It was , in all simplicity , just what he loved to do . '
And in her view , even the attempt on Makalu was very much feasible .
' He originally wanted to do a new route .
I said , " A new route ?
In winter ?
Alone ?
No way . "
And he agreed and switched to a route that has been climbed many times before . '
I think of something Geizendanner had said , about it being ' the couple Lafaille ' who climbed .
When he was high on the mountain , Lafaille used a small Thuraya satellite phone - it meant that he and Katia talked incessantly .
' Katia was in his head as he climbed , ' Geizendanner had said .
' They almost climbed together .
She could tell exactly how he was feeling from his voice , how strong he was . '
During the climbs , Katia counselled and coached him .
She motivated him when he was exhausted and , on several occasions , she got him to retreat when he wanted to go on .
On others , such as on the famous ridge at Annapurna , she was at the base camp of the mountain , and she kept him going .
' We were living a love that was extremely strong , ' Katia says .
' And he told me : " I have a dream life , I have a wonderful wife , a wonderful son , and I do what I love to do . "
We complemented each other perfectly .
He spent two months a year away on expeditions , but other than that he was at home or with us .
We grew an enormous amount together .
We had so many adventures to live , but we lived something that , if you are lucky , you know once in your life ... and at least now I have known it .'
We are sitting at the kitchen table .
There are children 's drawings on the fridge .
Lafaille and his four - year - old son Tom , were , Katia tells me - for the first time having trouble talking - extremely close .
I am suddenly aware of how raw all this must be .
Lafaille died only six weeks earlier .
' It 's hard for the little one , ' she is saying .
' He says , " Where 's Dad got to ? " '
When there 's bad weather he thinks it 's the storm that has stopped his father coming home .
I 've told him that Dad is not coming home . '
She pauses .
' I thought about what it would be like if he was killed many times , of course , but I never imagined the void , the emptiness .
The emptiness is terrible .
We had so much ahead of us . '
It is unlikely that anyone will ever know what happened to Lafaille on Makalu .
Katia recently flew over the mountain in a helicopter to see if there was any trace of her husband , but it is now very doubtful that his body will ever be recovered .
The probability is that he fell into a crevasse shortly after leaving his tent , not long after pulling on his boots , making a final phone call home and stepping out into the cold .
There would , of course , be no hope of rescue .
Just the silence of the high , high mountains an hour before dawn .
