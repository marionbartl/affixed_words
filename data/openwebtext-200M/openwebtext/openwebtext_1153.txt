“ This was a very typical time .
I was single .
All you needed was a cup of tea , a light , and your stereo , you know , and that ’s what I had . ” – Steve Jobs
This is rather iconic , is n’t it ?
Something about that picture captures the minimalist aesthetic that Apple successfully translated to the digital age , with our iPhones and Macs .
Quite an amazing picture and quote , both of which come from Diana Walker , who photographed Steve Jobs on several occasions .
You may have seen this picture before made into black and white , which makes the rounds from time to time , again capturing the minimalism of Jobs and therefore Apple known under Jobs .

A bit retro , but great , is n’t it ?
Makes for a good wallpaper too .
Everywhere in the world , people both rich and poor struggle to save and invest for tomorrow rather than splurging on the things they want today .
From text messaging reminders , to providing piggy banks , to giving away little motivational presents , IPA investigates ways to help people meet their financial goals and avoid temptation .
However , Research Affiliates Abhijit Banerjee and Sendhil Mullainathan have a new paper that suggests we may need to rethink the economics and psychology of temptation .
In the past , economists have offered two basic explanations for why the poor may fail to save or invest as much as they might .
The first is that they are simply impatient : consumption today is worth much more to them than consumption tomorrow .
The second explanation is that people have inconsistent preferences about consumption over time .
For instance , a person might prefer a Snickers bar today over a Snickers tomorrow , but be pretty indifferent between Snickers 20 days from now and 21 days from now – even though both comparisons are between one day and the next .
The problem is that when that 20 days from now arrives , 21 days from now becomes tomorrow , and the person reverts to their today vs. tomorrow preferences .
We let ourselves get away with indulging today , naively thinking that in the future we ’ll be more restrained .
In this way , we always save less than our reflective “ long - term self ” would want .
Either approach – impatience or inconsistent impatience – could explain why we see low savings among the poor .
It might also explain willingness to pay for short term loans that finance consumption today at the cost of a very steep interest rate .
The problem is that these explanations require that the poor be naturally much more impatient or inconsistent than the rich .
Banerjee and Mullainathan offer a different explanation , one which shows how temptation might interact in a unique way with poverty .
Suppose , they argue , that there are certain goods that people are tempted by , such as candy , or coffee , or cigarettes .
Then suppose that as people get richer , they spend a decreasing proportion of their income on these goods ; not a smaller absolute amount , but a smaller proportion .
( There ’s only so much money you ’re likely to spend on cigarettes , no matter how rich you get . )
Finally , suppose you ’re realistic enough to know that you ’ll be just as tempted in the future by these items as you are today .
In sum , your “ long term self ” knows that you will spend money on temptation goods in the future , but places no value on that spending .
( Your long term self does n’t like the fact that you ’ll spend money on cigarettes , even though your today self wants it . )
Knowing that you will spend this money amounts to a “ temptation tax ” on future wealth .
This is a disincentive to save for the future .
Why save today ?
After all , your future self will just squander the money on cigarettes !
But as you get wealthier , the effective “ tax rate ” is lower , because temptation goods are a smaller proportion of your income .
With a lower tax rate , your disincentive to save shrinks .
Perversely , if you expect to be wealthier in the future , you have a greater incentive to save and invest !
Banerjee and Mullainathan show that this can create a poverty trap .
When you expect to be poor in the future , you are less likely to save and invest , which keeps you in poverty .
When you expect to be wealthy in the future , you are more likely to save and invest , which makes you wealthier still .
This new model of temptation represents a pretty fundamental shift from the old economic explanations .
Rather than assuming that people are inconsistent and naïve about their spending preferences , it assumes that they are foresighted and realistic .
The researchers argue that it can explain much of the seemingly myopic behavior we observe among the poor : lack of savings , borrowing again and again at high interest rates , and turning down high return but small investment opportunities .
It also offers an explanation that does n’t rely on the assumption that the poor are inherently different in some way from the rich – they ’re just reacting to different circumstances .

Haunted Springs , Falcadia
Dear Mr. Keeper :
Thank you for your recent loan application .
Your request for 6500000 gold was ( again ) carefully considered , and we regret that we are ( still ) unable to approve your application .
And while we admire your perseverance , we here at BANK are in agreement that , without major revisions to your business plan , further requests for funds will be denied .
Please do not apply again until the following issues are addressed , at the very minimum .
For starters , we have grave concerns about your inventory .
Typically a fledgling business focuses on a single commodity or a few related lines of merchandise .
Your proposal to sell “ weapons , armor , shields , headgear , footwear , gloves , cloaks , robes , belts ( seriously , belts ? ) , rations , potions , scrolls , spellbooks , amulets , gems , maps , and torches ” strikes us as overly broad , to say the least .
You should look to “ Bracers , Bucklers , and Beyond ” as an example of a store that has found great success with a limited range of wares .
Also , we ’re pretty sure that “ lockpicks and other equipment for rogues ” cannot be legally sold in this province , just FYI .
Secondly , the word most commonly used to describe your choice of location has been “ insane ” ( my supervisor went so far as to call it as “ nuttier than a golem made from crazy ” ) .
Earlier this cycle we rejected the loan application of an entrepreneur wishing to open a tavern in Haunted Springs as simply too risky a proposition .
As you presumably know , the town has for years been terrorized by the lichs and other undead that have taken up resident in the nearby “ Well of Cantankerous Souls . ”
So when we saw that you were proposing to set up shop inside the WoCS … let ’s just say that eyebrows were raised .
Have you even been to the Well of Cantankerous Souls ?
Are you aware that , in addition to the aforementioned undead , the catacombs are host to no less than 350 classes of monster , all of which fly into murderous rages at the sight of Men ?
Thinking that you might be talking about a different “ Well of Cantankerous Souls , ” or that the dungeon might have recently become vacant , we sent our intern Trevor to scout out the location ; he did n’t even make it to the entrance before being beset by sentient dagger - wielding toadstools .
Furthermore , you say you are going to establish storefronts on “ every third level . ”
Setting aside the fact that the WoCS is infinitely deep ( true fact , look it up ) , how do you intend to staff all these shops as the sole employee ?
You will have one open for business at any given time , while the rest are unattended ?
And how long do you think the shuttered stores will remain unplundered given the packs of Master Thieves and Gremlins that roam the tunnels ?
But despite all the above , we ’re finding the “ Projected Clientele ” portion of your application the most puzzling .
Your customer is described as “ The Hero , ” “ The Adventurer , ” “ The Character , ” and we ca n’t help but notice that these are all singular nouns .
Are you suggesting that your place of business will only have one patron ?
That hardly seems like a sustainable model .
And we ’re disturbed that your hypothetical customer will , according to you , “ obtain the funds necessary to make purchases by killing the creatures and peoples native to the dungeon and stealing their loot . ”
Surely this kind of behavior is not something we want to encourage , much less abet .
And really , why would this “ hero ” ( your word ) kill the inhabitants , take their gold , and then spend it on your merchandise , when it would be quicker to simply kill and rob you ?
( Even if he does n’t murder you out of greed , he may do so in rage when he discovers how little you are willing to pay him to buy back items . )
We just ca n’t help but wonder if you thought this plan through to its logical conclusion .
One last point we ’d like you to consider .
The denizens in the Well of Cantankerous Souls all carry gold in copious quantities , despite the fact that they do not mint it , they do not use it as currency , and they have little contact with the outside world .
Indeed , the WoCS is essentially a closed ecosystem .
One would have to conclude , therefore , that some external agent is introducing gold into the environment , where it quickly finds its way into the hands , claws , talons , and tentacles of the indigenous species .
The question of who would be fool enough to willingly walk into a dungeon carrying sackfuls of bullion we ’ll leave as an exercise to the reader .
Suffice to say , we have no interest in increasing the number of gold coins in that particular system by 6500000 , if you catch our drift .
We understand that , with a name like “ shopkeeper , ” you feel this line of work is your destiny .
And we agree that your CHA of 17 would prove a great asset in such a career .
But , to be blunt , your current business plan has us openly questioning your INT .
( And while this has no bearing on your loan , and is frankly none of our business , we are in agreement that the working name for your business , “ SHOP , ” is almost completely bereft of pizazz .
Even “ SHOPPE ” would be an improvement , albeit marginally . )
Sincerely ,

Roughly a billion years from now , the ever - increasing radiation from the sun will have heated Earth into inhabitability ; the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that serves as food for plant life will disappear , pulled out by the weathering of rocks ; the oceans will evaporate ; and all living things will disappear .
Or maybe not quite so soon , say researchers from the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) , who have come up with a mechanism that doubles the future lifespan of the biosphere — while also increasing the chance that advanced life will be found elsewhere in the universe .
A paper describing their hypothesis was published June 1 in the early online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
Earth maintains its surface temperatures through the greenhouse effect .
Although the planet 's greenhouse gases — chiefly water vapor , carbon dioxide , and methane — have become the villain in global warming scenarios , they 're crucial for a habitable world , because they act as an insulating blanket in the atmosphere that absorbs and radiates thermal radiation , keeping the surface comfortably warm .
As the sun has matured over the past 4.5 billion years , it has become both brighter and hotter , increasing the amount of solar radiation received by Earth , along with surface temperatures .
Earth has coped by reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , thus reducing the warming effect .
( Despite current concerns about rising carbon dioxide levels triggering detrimental climate change , the pressure of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has dropped some 2,000 - fold over the past 3.5 billion years ; modern , man -made increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide offset a fraction of this overall decrease . )
The problem , says Joseph L. Kirschvink , the Nico and Marilyn Van Wingen Professor of Geobiology at Caltech and a coauthor of the PNAS paper , is that " we 're nearing the point where there 's not enough carbon dioxide left to regulate temperatures following the same procedures . "
Kirschvink and his collaborators Yuk L. Yung , a Caltech professor of planetary science , and graduate students King - Fai Li and Kaveh Pahlevan , say that the solution is to reduce substantially the total pressure of the atmosphere itself , by removing massive amounts of molecular nitrogen , the largely nonreactive gas that makes up about 78 percent of the atmosphere .
This would regulate the surface temperatures and allow carbon dioxide to remain in the atmosphere , to support life , and could tack an additional 1.3 billion years onto Earth 's expected lifespan .
advertisement
In the " blanket " analogy for greenhouse gases , carbon dioxide would be represented by the cotton fibers making up the blanket .
" The cotton weave may have holes , which allow heat to leak out , " explains Li , the lead author of the paper .
" The size of the holes is controlled by pressure , " Yung says .
" Squeeze the blanket , " by increasing the atmospheric pressure , " and the holes become smaller , so less heat can escape .
With less pressure , the holes become larger , and more heat can escape , " he says , helping the planet to shed the extra heat generated by a more luminous sun .
Strikingly , no external influence would be necessary to take nitrogen out of the air , the scientists say .
Instead , the biosphere itself would accomplish this , because nitrogen is incorporated into the cells of organisms as they grow , and is buried with them when they die .
In fact , " This reduction of nitrogen is something that may already be happening , " says Pahlevan , and that has occurred over the course of Earth 's history .
This suggests that Earth 's atmospheric pressure may be lower now than it was earlier in the planet 's history .
Proof of this hypothesis may come from other research groups that are examining the gas bubbles formed in ancient lavas to determine past atmospheric pressure : the maximum size of a forming bubble is constrained by the amount of atmospheric pressure , with higher pressures producing smaller bubbles , and vice versa .
advertisement
If true , the mechanism also would potentially occur on any extrasolar planet with an atmosphere and a biosphere .
" Hopefully , in the future we will not only detect Earth - like planets around other stars but learn something about their atmospheres and the ambient pressures , " Pahlevan says .
" And if it turns out that older planets tend to have thinner atmospheres , it would be an indication that this process has some universality . "
Adds Yung : " We can't wait for the experiment to occur on Earth .
It would take too long .
But if we study exoplanets , maybe we will see it .
Maybe the experiment has already been done . "
Increasing the lifespan of our biosphere — from roughly 1 billion to 2.3 billion years — has intriguing implications for the search for life elsewhere in the universe .
The length of the existence of advanced life is a variable in the Drake equation , astronomer Frank Drake 's famous formula for estimating the number of intelligent extraterrestrial civilizations in the galaxy .
Doubling the duration of Earth 's biosphere effectively doubles the odds that intelligent life will be found elsewhere in the galaxy .
" It did n't take very long to produce life on the planet , but it takes a very long time to develop advanced life , " says Yung .
On Earth , this process took four billion years .
" Adding an additional billion years gives us more time to develop , and more time to encounter advanced civilizations , whose own existence might be prolonged by this mechanism .
It gives us a chance to meet . "

Sicherheitsmängel bei AKW : Aus für Biblis B rückt näher
Regierungsgutachter bescheinigen dem AKW Biblis B 53 gefährliche Sicherheitsmängel .
Eigentlich müsste das Atomkraftwerk abgeschaltet werden .
BREMEN taz | Hessens Umweltministerin Silke Lautenschläger ( CDU ) gerät unter Druck : Nach Informationen der Ärzte gegen den Atomkrieg ( IPPNW ) haben Reaktorsicherheitsexperten der Bundesregierung mindestens 53 Sicherheitsmängel in Biblis B als schwerwiegend eingestuft , weitere könnten folgen .
Für Biblis B könne das nur das Aus bedeuten , urteilen die IPPNW .
Das dürfte Hessens Ministerpräsident Roland Koch ( CDU ) nicht gefallen .
Er fordert unbegrenzte Laufzeiten für AKWs , nicht zuletzt für die im südhessischen Biblis .
Hintergrund des Expertenurteils ist eine von IPPNW unterstützte Klage von AnwohnerInnen des Atomkraftwerks .
Diese beantragten im September 2005 , die Betriebsgenehmigung für Biblis B umgehend zu widerrufen .
Dazu legten sie eine Mängelliste vor , die zunächst rund 160 Punkte umfasste - die Basis für die Stellungnahme der Experten - und die inzwischen auf 210 Punkte angewachsen ist .
Alle Angaben stammen aus offiziellen Unterlagen der Atomaufsicht , des TÜV und der Gesellschaft für Reaktorsicherheit .
Das Umweltministerium in Wiesbaden lehnte den Stilllegungsantrag im April 2008 ab , die AtomkraftgegnerInnen zogen vor Gericht .
Bis Ende des Jahres muss die Landesregierung nun zu den Mängeln schriftlich Stellung nehmen .
Nach den jüngsten Erkenntnissen der Experten hegt man im Ministerium offenbar Zweifel , ob die lapidare Begründung , Biblis B sei sicher , vor Gericht Bestand haben werde .
Jedenfalls kündigte die Behörde dem Hessischen Verwaltungsgerichtshof nun an , den ursprünglichen Antrag der AnwohnerInnen auf Stilllegung des Reaktors neu zu bescheiden .
Die IPPNW werten das Einlenken als Etappensieg .
Nach dem Willen insbesondere der CDU soll die Laufzeit der AKWs künftig allein von " Sicherheitsanforderungen " bestimmt werden .
Biblis B liegt seit Monaten still , weil bei einem kleinen Leck losgelöstes Dichtungsmaterial den Kühlkreislauf verstopfen und damit eine Kernschmelze auslösen könnte .
In der bundesweiten AKW - Pannenstatistik steht der Meiler , der noch nicht einmal gegen den Aufprall eines kleinen Verkehrsflugzeugs geschützt ist , auf Platz 4 .
Und in einem internen Vermerk räumte selbst das Ministerium ein , dass Biblis B " selbstverständlich " nicht dem Stand von Wissenschaft und Technik entspreche .
" Damit genügt der Reaktor nicht dem vom Atomgesetz geforderten Sicherheitsstandard " , fasst IPPNW - Atomexperte Henrik Paulitz zusammen .
Er verwies auf ein Urteil des Bundesverwaltungsgerichts , wonach selbst eine Kernschmelze in einem AKW beherrschbar sein müsse .
" Die Kernschmelzfestigkeit von Biblis B ist jedoch katastrophal " , so Paulitz .
Selbst unter Berücksichtigung von Nachrüstungen habe man bei Auswertung der Unterlagen noch 14 schwerwiegende Sicherheitsmängel in diesem Bereich festgestellt .
Greenpeace wies im Frühjahr mit aktualisierten Ausbreitungsrechnungen nach , dass die radioaktive Kontamination vieler AnwohnerInnen nach einer Kernschmelze in Biblis bereits innerhalb weniger Stunden den behördlichen Grenzwert für eine Evakuierung bis um das Tausendfache überschreiten würde .
Die Dosis käme über die Luft und würde auch in geschlossenen Räumen aufgenommen .
Das hessische Umweltministerium sah sich am Wochenende außerstande , zu den Vorwürfen Stellung zu nehmen .
Noch im August hatte Ministerin Lautenschläger allerdings explizit betont , das AKW Biblis sei " technisch sicher " .
Mit Blick auf die laufenden Koalitionsverhandlungen bot IPPNW - Atomexperte Paulitz fachliche Unterstützung an : " Wir stellen den Fachleuten von Union und FDP gern alle relevanten Dokumente zur Verfügung . "

That , and $ 1.75 , will get you a cup of coffee .
One with about a 10 per cent chance of being socially responsible , says Gavin Fridell , an assistant professor at Trent University who specializes in fair trade products .
" It 's all very complicated , " Fridell says as he dives into a pile of printouts from the Starbucks website .
Ethical shopping , it seems , comes with fine print .
And it's in that fine print , Fridell says , that shoppers can see the limits of trying to make the world a better place through consumption .
The trick , he says , is to sort the hype from the reality .
For Starbucks , the reality is that the company needs high - quality coffee – and lots of it .
Categories such as organic or fair trade and even shade - grown coffee are recognized by most customers as living up to tough environmental and social standards , but simply do n't produce enough coffee for a company the size of Starbucks , says Dennis Macray , director of business practices .
" They have limitations in scale and scope , so we were going to need to go beyond that , " he says in a telephone interview from the company 's headquarters in Seattle .
Fair trade , for instance , requires that coffee be grown on small farms or co-operatives .
Plantations and large farms with hired labour , which make up a much of the Starbucks supply chain , are not allowed , Macray says , so the company had to set up its own sustainability system .
" We had the real potential to do something different that had n't been done in the industry before – which is to really link performance to purchasing around sustainability , " he says .
" That does n't mean we 're not buying those other coffees . "
About 6 per cent of Starbucks ' coffee last year was certified as fair trade .
The company buys almost 300 million pounds of coffee a year .
Marketing expert Susan Sommers says it 's no surprise that companies want to be seen as being socially responsible in any way they can – customers are demanding it .
" Social responsibility and green marketing are huge right now , " says Sommers , a marketing consultant who also lectures at the University of Toronto .
Brenda Plant , co-director of the Montreal - based Responsible Consumer Network , says studies in the U.S. have found that the market tops $ 227 billion ( U.S. ) a year and that 30 per cent of customers said they would favour socially responsible products .
The problem , she says , is that people can often have a tough time figuring out who is living up to the hype and who is not .
Most people have felt let down by other past advertising promises , so often approach ethical shopping with some skepticism .
" That kind of lack of trust can lead to inaction , " says Plant , whose agency runs ethiquette.ca to advise shoppers on companies that live up to their socially responsible promises .
" It can be very difficult to discern what is responsible and what is not . "
Fridell , author of Fair Trade Coffee : The Prospects and Pitfalls of Market - Driven Social Justice , has been trying for the last few weeks to parse what socially responsible coffee means at Starbucks , the world 's largest coffee chain .
He 's got a folder full of computer printouts for his troubles and is now sifting through the pages of reports , footnotes and side reports generated by his effort .
To sort it all out , he 's written a two - page " cheat sheet " summarizing the main points .
" I get paid to do this sort of thing , " says Fridell , leafing through the pile .
" No ordinary customer is going to go through all this . "
Macray , however , says the majority of Starbucks customers care more about the quality of the coffee than where it comes from .
" It 's not a top priority , " he says .
" Our business model is built around a great experience for our customers . "
Fridell says companies jumping on the social responsibility bandwagon are making genuine efforts to be better corporate citizens .
But their efforts , while certainly better than doing nothing , tend to be limited and structured to meet the corporation 's needs at least as much as the social justice goals , he says .
" Starbucks is the leader of this sort of thing , " he says .
Seattle - based Starbucks set up a program called CAFE , or Coffee and Farmer Equity , to encourage suppliers by giving them a price premium if they adhere to environmental and social responsibility standards .
The company boasts that 53 per cent of its beans , or 155 million pounds , are now certified under the program .

But with a little digging , Fridell found there are three tiers to the CAFE program .
The first includes suppliers who met at least 80 per cent of the CAFE criteria .
About 19 per cent of the 53 per cent fell into that category , or 10.7 per cent of the company 's total bean purchases .
Twelve per cent fell into the second category , achieving between 60 and 80 per cent of the targets .
More than two - thirds , or 69 per cent , of the beans certified under Starbucks ' ethical shopping program met less that 60 per cent of the targets set .
" By most measures , that 's a failing mark , " says Fridell .
While more than half of Starbucks ' beans are certified under its ethical guidelines , Fridell says he was amazed to realize that the majority were , in fact , certified as not living up to the stated goals .
" It 's Orwellian , " he says .
Macray bristles at such criticism , saying farmers in the third category have made a commitment to the program 's highest standards and are working with the company to achieve them .
They deserve recognition for the work required just to get into CAFE and will get increasingly better prices as they move up .
" Just getting verified is no small feat , " he says .
" It sets them up to improve . "
Starbucks has set a goal for 2007 of buying 225 million pounds of coffee under the CAFE program , a jump of more than 30 per cent , Macray says .
It 's tough to gauge , he says , just how much information to provide to customers on such programs .
" We 've erred on the side of never providing enough information , because the depth and the context can be overwhelming , " he says .
" Perhaps we 've been too humble . "
Plant has sifted through the fine print of many companies billing themselves as ecologically and socially responsible .
She remembers a shoe company trying to get listed on ethiquette.ca as a supplier of eco-footwear .
She was keen to include them , since many people had asked her for socially responsible shoes .
She confirmed that the rubber was from an ecologically friendly source .
The cotton for the uppers was organic .
Good .
But then came questions about the manufacturing .
It was done in China and the company was vague about the factory conditions .
" We would not include them ( on the website ) , " Plant says .
The site lists dozens of companies selling everything from coffee ( Starbucks is not listed ) to clothing to cosmetics to toys .
For Montreal - area shoppers , it also lists specific stores to find the products .
The fine print has been checked for all the listings , Plant says , saving shoppers that hassle .
Plant and Sommers warn it can be disastrous for a company to make ecological or social responsibility claims and then fail to live up to them or to include so much fine print that it feeds consumer cynicism .
" People expect companies to stand behind their claims , " says Sommers .
But too much fine print , Plant warns , can make matters worse by feeding consumer skepticism and driving shoppers away .
It can even be worse than doing nothing at all .
" If people feel deceived , that trust is lost , and it 's very , very , very , very hard to get back . "

Connelly and Barker are expected to be given new identities on their release
The three people jailed over Baby Peter Connelly 's death have been denied leave to appeal against their sentences .
The 17 - month - old boy died in Haringey , north London , in August 2007 .
His mother Tracey , 28 , and her partner Steven Barker , 33 , were given minimum terms of five and 12 years for causing or allowing the baby 's death .
Barker 's brother Jason Owen , 37 , was jailed for three years .
He has asked for a court hearing to renew his appeal application , the Court of Appeal said .
The option is also open to Barker and Connelly .
Lynne Featherstone , the MP for Hornsey and Wood Green , said : " Everyone will breathe a collective sigh of relief that they were refused leave to appeal and that no more public money and no more time needs to be spent on this .
New identities " These three people have been found guilty and now need to serve their punishment . "
Peter had more than 50 injuries , including fractured ribs and a broken back , when he was found dead in a property in Penshurst Road , Tottenham .
Barker and Connelly 's names were made public in August following the expiry of an anonymity order .
A judge had ordered none of the defendants could be named because the other children were still being placed with alternative carers .
Due to publicity surrounding the case , it is thought all three individuals convicted are likely to be given new identities upon release to protect them from vigilante attacks .
Critics have suggested there would be public anger if taxpayers ' money was used to protect these individuals .
In a separate court case , Barker was also given a life sentence for raping a two - year - old girl .

This is a guest post by miss Annette O’Neil who runs Clever Ginger Creative and who splashes her colorful prose all over the carpet , walls , ceiling , etc. at her blog , Here There Be Tygers .
Take a look at her work and be inspired : I ’m a big fan .
It ’s a lot like the first day of school , actually .
Someone helps you put on a heavy backpack , gives you a bit of grave advice , cheerfully wishes you luck , and watches you climb the stairs to get into the vehicle .
You squeeze into a seat among the jostling crowd , every member of which is much , much cooler than you are .
You fold your hands in your lap , and you look out the window .
And then you take off .
Skydiving is a funny thing .
The first time you manage to convince yourself to go near the door ( basically , a gaping maw of sky that ’s roaring with what seems to be hurricane - force wind ) , you have to speculate to yourself why you ’re standing there .
After all , you were the one who ambled up to the counter at the dropzone below , slapped your credit card on the desk , listened to the safety briefing , strapped yourself into the gear , and showed the nice instructor how nicely you arch your back for aerodynamics .
You did these things because you knew that somewhere between this plane – thirteen thousand feet over a bit of very hard ground – and the aforementioned very hard ground , there was something you wanted .
So now you ’re here , and there are some pairs of eyes looking at you ( and the little green light by your head ) rather expectantly .
So you line your toes up to the edge , give the handle on your pilot chute one more little tap , and here goes nothin . ’
Whoosh .
The first few times you do it , it ’s much the same .
You think about it before you drift off ( that thing that happened to that guy , when his gear acted up and his reserve did n’t quite take and they had to scrape him up with a spatula and a wet / dry vacuum ) , but you wake up wanting to jump .
And soon , you always wake up wanting to jump .
‘ Cause you and that guy – well , you ’re different .
And if your gear acts up , you ’re pretty sure you ’ll get it sorted before they have to break out the spatulas .
And if you do n’t ?
Well , you sure as hell got on that plane .
And that ’s saying something .
Radical lifestyle design is like that , too .
When you start out , it ’s a lark .
When you realize it ’s not a silly fancy and you start taking steps , it has all the playful look - what - I ’m - doing fun of playing dress - up in a skydiving jumpsuit and wiggling into a rig .
Most of us in the LIP community actually get on a plane to seal the deal , and it ’s much like that first jump : suddenly , every glorious / badass / wet - dry - vacuum - manifesting aspect of the thing becomes critically evident .
It ’s at the door that you get to make your choice .
Do I live this , right now , and embrace everything that it actually is ?
Or do I step back , and live vicariously ?
Here ’s the thing about living vicariously : you can watch Indiana Jones a thousand times , but it ’ll always end the same way .
And you , I ’m sorry to say , are never in it .
I have an idea .
Jump .
Update : May 30 , 2016
Was still accepting guest posts at this point .
All I ’ll add is that I never really wanted to skydive , but I finally did while in New Zealand .
I ’ll save the commentary for that until later —
I ’m pretty sure I wrote something about it shortly after the dive .
V Was Only Waiting for This Moment to Arise
In an industry known for its planned obsolescence , few technologies have lasted three decades and continue to grow more powerful with each passing year .
The few that are out there , like DRAM and Motorola 's 68000 processor , are chip - based .
Add to that list the x86 architecture , which stands alone in the broader computer market now that Sun Microsystems '
Sparc processor is on life support .
There have been many attempts to knock off the x86 , from Sparc to HP 's PA - RISC to SGI 's MIPS to DEC 's Alpha .
But resistance proved futile ; many PA - RISC and Alpha engineers now work for Intel on the Itanium , which was also supposed to retire x86 .
Intel 's only real competitor any more is another x86 company , AMD ( NYSE : AMD ) .
Meanwhile , the x86 keeps humming along ; it now powers everything from the fastest supercomputers on Earth down to handheld music and Internet devices and PCs and servers in between .
Soon it will be in phones .
Name another architecture that spans eight - core processors to smart phones .
Still , Intel ( NASDAQ : INTC ) itself has tried to put the x86 out to pasture more than once and could n't do it .
There was the iAPX - 432 in the 1980s , the i860 in the early 1990s and then Itanium .
" If you were going to bet on an architecture that would be around in 20 years , which would you pick ?
I could think of only two , the IBM mainframe , which has been around 45 years and counting , and x86 .
All these other guys came and went , " said Martin Reynolds , research vice president and fellow with Gartner .
The reason , he argues , is that x86 as an instruction set is mature and fully baked .
Anything that comes along is in addition to what is already there , but there is no changing of the fundamentals .
This helps maintain backwards compatibility that would in theory allow Windows 95 to run on a Core 2 Quad machine and have more driver problems than instruction problems .
" When we were debating multi- core internally , all the focus seemed to be on rewriting these apps and I said to management , ' stop .
What you should assume is no apps will be rewritten .
They simply have to run . '
What we 're all about is making sure the new apps take advantage of this capability without a loss of compatibility , " said Intel CTO Justin Rattner .
Preserving that legacy was Intel 's smartest move , argued the analysts .
" They are changing x86 architecture , but when they do it 's always additive and always backwards compatible , " Reynolds told InternetNews.com .
" Every x86 has a different implementation .
It may have a different microarchitecture but it has the same instruction set . "
Because x86 is a cumulative technology that keeps the old along with adding new , this allows it to keep the old while adding new technologies .
It has created a scenario where x86 can literally go on forever , adding enhancements while supporting its legacy , until something knocks it off the perch .
Many have tried .

The Bulldog Cafe is allowed to sell marijuana for medicinal purposes
In 1996 , voters in California approved a referendum that made it legal for the first time in decades in the US for people to consume cannabis for medicinal purposes .
More than a dozen states have followed suit since and several others - the most recent of which is Massachusetts - have approved laws decriminalising the possession of small amounts of the drug .
Now , there are moves afoot in California to go further to fully legalise marijuana .
Evidence of the impact that the approval of medicinal marijuana has had on some areas of California is clear in Oakland .
Across the bay from San Francisco , it has come to be known as Oaksterdam , in a nod to the symbolic global capital of marijuana deregulation , Amsterdam .
The relaxed approach to marijuana use in this part of Oakland has led to the opening of several marijuana dispensaries .
They are establishments in this once deprived area of town which sell a broad array of cannabis related products , from food products such as brownies and cereal bars laced with cannabis to traditional marijuana for smoking .
Oaksterdam University
" This is where it all started , " says Richard Lee , a leading advocate of the legalisation of cannabis , pointing to a building where the first ever dispensary was opened in 1996 .
His sense of excitement is palpable as he shows me around Oaksterdam , which is also home to a facility where state residents can get the ID needed to establish their right to use cannabis for medical purposes .
Richard Lee runs Oaksterdam University which opened in 2007
The area is also home to the Oaksterdam University , which Mr Lee runs .
He shows me around the student union of the university , which he describes as a trade school for all of those interested in finding a place in the thriving cannabis trade that medicinal marijuana has spawned .
Mr Lee tells me that making cannabis use legal would make economic sense but would also help in the fight against the Mexican drugs cartels .
" According to some estimates , the Mexican cartels get 60 - 70 % of their money - their profit - from cannabis , " he tells me .
" So if we cut that out of the equation then theoretically 60 - 70 % of the violence they perpetrate would be cut out , because they'd have less money for the guns and weapons and ammunition to kill people and to spend on bribing officials and all the rest , " Mr Lee says .
Trailblazing
That perspective , along with the fact that California state authorities estimate marijuana could bring in nearly $ 1.5 bn a year in much needed tax revenue if it were legalised , has led to increased support among the state 's voters for the full legalisation of the drug .
Politicians like Tom Ammiano , who represents one of the most liberal districts of San Francisco in the California state assembly , have been paying close attention .
Mr Ammiano came into politics as a trailblazing gay rights activist in the 1970s and has long advocated greater tolerance of cannabis use .
Earlier this year , he took that approach one step further and introduced a bill in the California state assembly which , if approved , would grant cannabis the same legal status in the state as alcohol and tobacco .
We like to say prohibition is chaos and regulation is control
Tom Ammiano
California State Assemblyman
That would put California ahead of even Amsterdam , where marijuana use is tolerated but not altogether legal .
Sitting with him in his office in the state government building in San Francisco , with its sweeping views of the city , it becomes clear that his proposal is far from a flight of fancy .
He tells me he has been finding that more and more of his colleagues in the state assembly are coming around to seeing why moving towards legalisation makes perfect sense .
' Lighten up '
" People across the board , whether they 're conservative or liberal , have come to realise that the so - called war on drugs has failed and failed miserably , " Mr Ammiano says .
" In fact , it 's costing us money instead of saving us money .
This new approach would be a way for the policing efforts to be focused on the big bad guys , the cartels , with their violence and murder , and lighten up on the more minor offences .
We like to say prohibition is chaos and regulation is control , " he adds .
" On the streets , a drug dealer does not ask a kid for his ID before selling him cannabis , " he concludes with an acerbic , humorous tone that serves as proof that he has , beyond politics , also had some success in his other career as a stand - up comedian .
But , despite his optimistic tone , Mr Ammiano says he knows that those who oppose his proposal , including key figures in the medical and law enforcement community , are armed with statistics pointing to the damaging long - term effects of the drug and have the stamina and resources to wage a major fight to ensure that the bill never gets signed into law .
One of those opponents is Ronald Brooks , president of the National Narcotic Officers ' Associations ' Coalition , which represents more than 70,000 narcotics enforcement officers in the US .
We meet in the town of Redwood City , south of San Francisco and , as I get in his car , we drive past what appears to be a nondescript office building .
' Seriously flawed '
However , he tells me that in the 1980s it was a bank - the place where his partner on the police force was killed in front of him by a ruthless marijuana dealer , who was carrying out a bank robbery to fund his drug business .
He says experiences like that have strengthened his resolve that America can't allow itself to take a more lenient approach to marijuana .
" This argument of freeing up law enforcement so that we can take on the cartels is seriously flawed , " he tells me .
Ronald Brooks is firmly against the proposed change in the law " This is really a hoax being perpetrated on the voters of California to authorise their political agenda - that is to legalise marijuana as one step to legalise drugs in America because they simply do n't think the government ought to control drugs , " he adds .
" The people who are going to lose if this gets approved are the taxpayers , because we 're going to have increased costs associated with this , both healthcare and law enforcement costs , and the people who have to drive on the state 's highways who are going to be in danger from being hit by someone intoxicated from using cannabis .
This is simply a reckless public policy , " he concludes .
Back across the San Francisco Bay in Oakland , specifically Oaksterdam , the patrons of the Bulldog Cafe are enjoying their legally sanctioned right to consume marijuana for medicinal purposes .
Emerging industry Gary has travelled from Texas for the weekend to attend a seminar on the cannabis trade at the Oaksterdam University across the street .
He is in his 50s , but says he is hoping to take the information he has picked up in his course on the cannabis business and make a life - transforming move in the coming months to California .
" My girlfriend and I are interested in moving to California from Texas to become a part of this here .
We 're not quite sure where we fit in but we want to get into the business itself .
We feel it's an emerging industry , and this is where I feel compelled to come , " he tells me as the smell of cannabis wafts through the room .
Like Gary , there are hundreds of others participating in the courses at the Oaksterdam University on any given week .
Beyond that , there are more than 200,000 people in the state registered as consumers of marijuana for medicinal purposes .
As for Mr Ammiano 's proposal to legalise marijuana in the state , that is still making its way through the California state assembly and it is difficult to say whether it will succeed or not .
What is clear , however , is that whatever the outcome of the legalisation proposal , the medical marijuana law and the multi-million dollar industry it has spawned appear to be here to stay in California .

In a heavily populated world of finite resources we have long become accustomed to the idea that the cost of living will inevitably rise .
Which makes it all the more depressing to hear that dying has also become an increasingly expensive affair .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Thanks to a lack of competition amongst funeral homes and a series of anti-pollution measures that crematoria have had to install , the average price of a funeral in Britain has risen by 42 per cent over the past five years – considerably beyond the standard rate of inflation .
The total average cost of saying goodbye to a loved one – including legal costs , the price of the funeral and additional extras such as flowers – has now crept up to £ 7,098 .
And researchers estimate that costs will continue to rise by a third over the next half decade leaving many low income families struggling to find money during a time of intense bereavement .
Whilst the cost of a standard funeral is now £ 2,733 ( in London the figure jumps to £ 4,600 ) , a whole host of " hidden " costs such as venue hire , catering and the cost of the coffin or pall bearers often pushes the overall price far beyond people ’s initial expectations .
The funeral industry , which was worth £ 1.3bn in Britain in 2006 , says the rising costs of burial plots and filters that stop dangerous mercury compounds leaking out from crematoria , have led to the above inflation rises .
But others believe the industry is simply more able to cash in on customers at a difficult time in their lives when they are often less likely to haggle or shop around for a better deal .
Paul Dwyer , who has worked a consultant on the funeral industry for 25 years , said that although satisfaction rates were high there was evidence that the unique circumstances of its work allowed prices to rise more rapidly than in other services .
" A funeral is a purchase that is often made suddenly – it is very much a distress purchase , " he said .
" The overwhelming majority of people just go to one funeral director and take the price they are given .
People are uncomfortable with shopping around .
Customer surveys show that the industry does a fine job - 75 per cent rate the service at eight out of ten or above – but there is just not the commercial pressure , which in turn means that prices creep up . "
And while mercury filters have made cremations more expensive to carry out , some have questioned whether such a steep rise can solely be blamed on third party costs .
One industry source said : " There is no doubt that those extra costs , such as crematoria fees or burial plots have risen but if you look at it in detail , they are adding no more than 10 or 15 per cent to the overall cost of a funeral .
It is difficult to square that with a 42 per cent rise in five years . "
Jeremy Smith , a 49 - year - old funeral director who runs Green Endings in Tufnel Park , which specialises in environmentally friendly ceremonies , says there are a number of ways to cut down the overall cost of a funeral .
" I find families are becoming much more willing to talk about money and reduce the overall cost of a funeral , " he said .
" When people do n’t have a lot of cash to spare we try to help them save money by suggesting things like re-usable coffins , using friends or family to conduct a service rather than a paid professional , and booking early morning slots at crematoria which are often much cheaper . "
But Denise Kantor , from Cruse Bereavement , the country ’s largest bereavement charity , said people should not overly worry about whether they can afford a funeral .
" Most funeral directors will bend over backwards to accommodate your needs because they understand this is not shopping in M&S , they 're dealing with real and raw emotions , " she said .
BAGHDAD  Iraqi and American troops seized a rocket launcher loaded with about a dozen Iranian - made rockets aimed at an American base in the southern city of Basra , Iraqi officials said Tuesday .
The United States military said in a statement that Iraqi and American forces conducted a search operation on Basra ’s outskirts after hearing explosions near the base Monday night .
The American statement said that Iraqi security forces confiscated 16 rockets and arrested three in connection with the operation without giving further details .
No casualties were reported .
A spokesman for the Basra police force , which took part in the operation , said that a rocket launcher loaded with 13 Grad rockets , positioned on the back of a pickup truck , was found in the Shatt al Arab district northeast of Basra .
There was no explanation for the discrepancy in the number of rockets .
“ They came from a neighboring country , ” said the spokesman , Lt. Col .
Rafie al - Jawad , but he refused to specify which one .
" If you had an exclusive Windows - only shop then possibly Disk2VHD could be useful .
This tool can run from a USB stick and will churn through a hard disk on an operational system , producing a VHD disk image out of it .
" VHD is the virtual hard disk file format used by Microsoft 's Virtual PC and Hyper - V software .
This means a legacy Windows 2000 server , say , could be captured and restored as a virtual machine on a modern Windows Server 2008 system ultimately reducing hardware and power consumption . "
OVER the past few weeks Renault has been giving politicians , journalists and big commercial customers across Europe the chance to drive a slightly odd - looking battery - powered vehicle based on its Kangoo , a small van .
Like most of the latest electric - vehicle prototypes , the Kangoo Be Bop ZE , as it is called , drives briskly and quietly .
Unlike most of them , it is a thoroughly practical proposition .
It provides plenty of space for five people and their luggage , has a range of about 160 kilometres ( 100 miles ) — and , crucially , when it goes on sale in less than two years ' time , it will not cost a fortune .
Renault 's roadshow is part of a vigorous campaign to prepare the market for the electric vehicles on which its boss , Carlos Ghosn , is staking the future of both the French firm and its Japanese ally , Nissan .
Mr Ghosn believes that by 2020 purely electric , zero-emission vehicles will take 10 % of the global car market .
What is more , he wants such vehicles to account for 20 % of Renault - Nissan 's sales by then .
Mr Ghosn 's fervour is missionary .
He argues that with the world facing an unprecedented environmental crisis “ those of us who make cars need to be part of the solution ” and become “ pioneers of sustainable mobility ” .
He is certainly putting Renault 's and Nissan 's money where his mouth is , committing € 4 billion ( $ 5.9 billion ) and ring - fencing more than 2,000 engineers to work on the project .
How big a gamble is Mr Ghosn taking ?
At last month 's Frankfurt motor show almost every big carmaker could boast of new hybrids in the pipeline , some of them plug-ins , and prototype all - electric vehicles were all over the place .
Even hydrogen fuel cells still have their supporters .
The German carmakers in particular , with their huge research - and - development budgets , are dabbling in all manner of different low - emission vehicles .
Not Renault .
At Frankfurt , Mr Ghosn presented what he described as a complete range of affordable purely electric cars .
There was a largish family saloon ( the Fluence ) , a supermini - sized hatchback ( the Zoe ) , the Kangoo Be Bop ZE and a wacky two - seat urban runabout ( the Twizy ) .
These were not mere show cars intended to test the reaction of potential customers .
All are destined for production within two or three years .
Mr Ghosn made no apologies for the silly names , but he promised that the cars would cost no more to buy than similar diesel - powered cars — after factoring in government tax breaks for zero-emission vehicles that in many European countries will be worth about € 5,000 .
Their expensive lithium - ion battery packs will be leased .
As long as owners drive at least 12,000 km a year , overall running costs will be equivalent to , or lower than , a petrol or diesel - powered car .
Within the industry , the adjective most often used to describe Mr Ghosn 's plan to make the Renault - Nissan Alliance the first big manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles is “ bold ” — in other words , somewhere between very risky and certifiably mad .
In particular , most analysts consider Mr Ghosn 's forecasts of demand for electric cars to be wildly optimistic .
The French carmaker aims to be the first big producer of zero-emission vehicles
Tim Urquhart of IHS Global Insight , a research firm , reckons that purely battery - powered cars will command only about 0.6 % of world sales in 2020 , with plug - in hybrids accounting for a further 0.7 % .
Volkswagen , Europe 's biggest carmaker , talks of 1.5 - 2 % .
The main obstacles , according to Mr Urquhart , are the comparatively short range of electric vehicles and the lack of places to charge them .
Renault 's chief operating officer , Patrick Pélata , disagrees .
With a range of 160 km at launch the cars will , he says , satisfy the requirements of most people most of the time .
In urbanised western Europe , 80 % of journeys are below 60 km , and 20 % of cars in Europe — about 20 m vehicles — never go any further .
He adds that battery technology is undergoing a revolution , with more than 20 big companies worldwide competing to produce smaller , tougher and more powerful batteries .
One reason for Renault 's leasing model is to allow vehicle owners to upgrade their batteries as and when the technology improves .
Mr Pélata also thinks the problems with infrastructure are exaggerated .
Initially , the majority of private owners are likely to be suburbanites , who will charge their cars overnight using domestic sockets , or fleet operators with predictable journey patterns .
But Renault is also spending a lot of time talking to and doing deals with power companies and governments ( which are under intensifying pressure to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide ) .
He says that the money and the political will are there to install fast charging - points ( which can deliver an 80 % charge within 20 minutes ) in car parks , workplaces and city streets .
Renault is also planning to set up “ quick - drop ” stations that can swap a depleted battery for a full one in a few minutes .
Renault 's commitment and attention to every detail is impressive , but Mr Ghosn 's bet depends on three things working in his favour that he cannot control : the eager co-operation of governments ; a rising oil price ; and the willingness of drivers to change their habits .
It is the last of these that is hardest to predict .
While many debate whether religion is a good thing or not , for many people religion is a way of coping with life and living it in a positive manner to the best of their ability .
Historically speaking , religion has been the cause of many wars , murders , invasions and social unrest over the years , but at the same time religion has created many benefits to society .
The legal system
Many aspects of the legal system we know today are based on religious teachings .
Religion tells us that killing people is a sin , as well as stealing .
It is these ideals that the law aims to duplicate and enforce to ensure we have a pleasant experience in life .
Society needs these rules and laws in order to function properly .
While we may not agree with all of the laws , the legal system allows us to feel safer in our day to lives .
The afterlife
Many people look to their religion for comfort in times of grief , such as the death of a close friend or family member .
Human beings as a whole are afraid of death because they have no way of knowing for sure what happens after they die .
Many religions or belief systems cover this topic in detail and the follower of that particular religion can therefore find comfort in their belief that their religion is correct .
While many people are born into religion , many others convert to a religion of their choice , mostly based on their own beliefs and which aspects feel the most comfortable to them .
It can be a great help for many people suffering from grief to believe in their religious views on the matter and therefore cope with the situation more effectively .
Other big questions
Aside from the afterlife , there are a variety of other big questions in life that may never be answered .
Some of these include “ why should I lead a good life ” , “ where do we come from ” or “ what is the meaning of life ” .
Many religions try to answer these questions in a generalized way to try to fill in the information that are missing .
The human brain may never know the true answers to these questions , but as a species we need to believe that the answers exist .
This is where religion can provide stability and reassurance by helping to answer some of these big questions .
Our current political structure
Whichever country you reside in , the political structure of that country has at some point been altered or determined by religious views .
In America , the first pilgrims to settle on America did so because their religious views were not accepted in other countries at that time .
In England , the standpoint on divorce changed dramatically thanks to King Henry VIII and the disassociation of England from the Roman Pope creating today ’s “ Church of England ” denomination of Christianity .
Sometimes these changes were for the worse but they have all helped to shape the countries we know today , and that ’s why religion is highly important in that regard .

PLATTSBURGH , N.Y. --
The rise of conservative " tea party " activists around the country has created a dilemma for Republicans .
They are breathing life into the party 's quest to regain power .
But they 're also waging war on some candidates hand - picked by GOP leaders as the most likely to win .
In upstate New York , Dede Scozzafava , 49 years old , is the choice of local party leaders to defend a Republican seat in the U.S. House of Representatives , an abortion - rights candidate who could appeal to independents .
Doug Hoffman , 59 , is a local accountant backed by tea-party activists who has jumped into the race declaring himself the real conservative .
Mr. Hoffman has siphoned so much support from Ms. Scozzafava that their Democratic rival has vaulted into the lead , according to a poll released Thursday .
The election is Nov. 3 .
" I am not your run -of - the - mill politician , and maybe that 's why the Republican bosses did n't like me , " Mr. Hoffman told a recent health - care forum sponsored by the Upstate New York Tea Party .
In an interview , Ms. Scozzafava acknowledged her discomfort at the event .
" I knew it was n't going to be an easy audience for me , " she said .
Nasa has discovered what could be evidence of life on other planets , in chemicals found in the dust cloud of a comet .
The Stardust spacecraft collected material containing a protein essential for the formation of life from Comet Wild - 2 , when it was millions of miles away from Earth in 2004 .

As many were outside Sweden and unaware of the problem , this may have taken some time .
Not since the days of Henry Kissinger ’s Mid-East shuttle diplomacy in the 1970s has America ’s foreign policy toward Israel been characterized by such an attitude of unsentimental realism .
After eight years of fighting , the stalemate in Afghanistan and the loss of 4,000 American troops in Iraq – not to mention the deaths of perhaps hundreds of thousands of Iraqis – has rendered the search for stability , rather than democracy , paramount , and created a climate in which interests are to be valued far more than friends .
Indeed , having sacrificed so much for the sake of the Middle East ’s future , America will not think twice about asking its friends — especially the one it bankrolls , and which is occupying densely Arab - populated land — to sacrifice , too .
Many , both in the Administration and in the wider Washington establishment , have simply lost patience with what they see as Israeli intransigence over settlements in occupied territories .
This may not be fair , or even wholly logical , for the issue of settlements is highly complex .
But the reality is that Washington ’s quiet passions have turned decidedly against Israel .
Israel ’s supporters believe that because both the U.S. and Israel are democracies , the two countries share identical national interests .
But Israel is half a world away from America , virtually surrounded by enemies on land , while America is an island nation bordered by two vast oceans .
Because a nation ’s interests are governed to a great extent by its geographical situation , it ’s simply impossible for the two countries ’ interests to neatly overlap .
Take the dilemma of Iran ’s nuclear program .
Iran threatens Israel much more than it does America .
It may very well be in Israel ’s best interest to attack Iran .
But it is probably not in America ’s for Israel to do so , given America ’s exposure in Iraq .
And an Israeli attack could destroy President Barack Obama ’s efforts to reach out to the Muslim world .
If you think the tension between the U.S. and Israel is high now , just wait until there ’s a significant spike in casualties in Iraq following an Israeli strike on Iran .
A poster has been spotted in North Korea hinting at progress in the succession question .
It indicates that the name of the third son of North Korean leader Kim Jong - il might be more accurately transliterated " Jong - eun , " not " Jong-un . "
MBC on Thursday showed images of a propaganda poster taken near Wonsan by a Taiwanese photographer on a recent visit to the country .
The poster read , " Kim Jong -eun , a young leader who succeeds the lineage of Mangyongdae and Mt. Baekdu , " along with the full lyrics of a song related to the succession .
MBC said the image shot was taken at a collective farm near Wonsan open to visits by foreigners on Sept. 19 .
Iran on Monday accused the United States , Britain and Pakistan of involvement in a devastating suicide bombing which killed more than 40 people and struck at the heart of its security apparatus .
The Islamic republic ’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pointed a finger of blame at US intelligence , ISNA news agency reported .
“ This terrorist crime revealed the evil face of enemies of security and unity who are supported by intelligence organizations of some arrogant governments , ” he said , using Iran ’s term for the United States .

Israeli publication YNet News reported that the Iranians vowed to retaliate , adding : “ A commentary by the official news agency called on Iranian security forces ‘ to seriously deal with Pakistan once and for all . ' ”
Washington has denied any involvement while condemning Sunday ’s attack and loss of life as an act of terrorism .
An Iranian general accused Pakistan , Britain and the United States of aiding Sunni rebels behind the suicide attack near the Pakistani border that counted seven military commanders among the 42 dead .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in a telephone conversation with his Pakistani counterpart Asif Ali Zardari , separately charged that those behind the bombing were in Pakistan and needed to be “ quickly confronted . ”
The suicide bomber blew himself up at a meeting of Iran ’s elite Revolutionary Guards and local tribesmen in Iran ’s restive Sistan - Baluchestan province , a hotbed of Sunni insurgency .

Tehran said he attack at a gymnasium in the town of Pisheen was claimed by Sunni militant rebel leader Abdolmalek Rigi , whose Jundallah ( Soldiers of God ) group has for years been waging war against the Shiite rule of Iran .
The head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps , General Mohammad Ali Jafari , said Monday that an Iranian delegation would head to Pakistan to deliver “ proof ” that Islamabad was supporting Rigi .
“ The delegation will ask for him ( Rigi ) to be handed over , ” Jafari was quoted as saying by ISNA .

Jafari also charged that Rigi takes orders from the intelligence services of Britain , Pakistan and the United States .
“ The group of Rigi has direct contact with the American and British intelligence services and unfortunately the Pakistani intelligence service , ” Jafari said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ He is supported by them and without doubt he is acting under their orders and plans . ”
Jundallah itself , in a statement posted on the Internet , said the operation ’s aim was to avenge “ the wounds of the Baluch people which have been bleeding for years without end . ”
It named the bomber as Abdul Wahid Muhammadi Sarawani and said Iranian intelligence officials were among the dead .

“ During the past year alone , this regime killed hundreds of ( Baluch ) youths of this province who together died either by firing squad , execution or martyrdom under torture , ” it said .
“ The Baluch people … are determined to stand against injustice and to obtain their freedom till the last drop of their blood , ” the group said .
General Mohammad Pakpour , the head of Guards ’ ground forces and whose deputy was killed in the powerful blast , also said Washington and London were backing those who launched the attack against Iran ’s prestigious military force .
“ The terrorists were trained in the neighbouring country ( Pakistan ) by the Americans and British , ” Pakpour said on state television .
ADVERTISEMENT
Britain , like the United States , denied the allegations that it aided the rebels .
“ We reject in the strongest terms any assertion that this attack has anything to do with Britain , ” a Foreign Office spokeswoman said in London .
Ahmadinejad reiterated that the assault was plotted in Pakistan and urged Zardari to confront the Jundallah rebels .
Jundallah has in recent years repeatedly attacked the Guards , the elite military force set up after the 1979 Islamic revolution to protect the Islamic regime from internal and external threats .
A senior judiciary official in the province , Hojatoleslam Ebrahim Hamidi , said that “ more than 30 Sunni tribal chiefs ” were among the dead and questioned Jundallah ’s claims to be promoting the Baluchi cause .

UN chief Ban Ki-moon on Monday issued a statement in which he “ strongly condemns yesterday ’s terrorist attacks . ”
Sistan - Baluchestan ’s deputy governor , Jalal Sayyah , meanwhile , said Iran has identified the bomber but no arrests have yet been made .
“ It is likely that those who supported the bombing have fled ” to Pakistan , he said .

An Inexpensive X-ray Machine
From an old radio tube , some copper wire , and other inexpensive materials  total cost : roughly $ 20  you can construct an X - ray machine that will make good pictures through an inch of wood .
SAFETY MEASURES THAT YOU MUST OBSERVE .
Notes on Röntgen 's invention .
Highlights of X - ray theory .
Harry Simons of 118 Windsor Street , Kearny , N.J. , is a lonely amateur scientist .
 For 23 years ,  he writes ,  I have been dabbling in the X - ray portion of the electromagnetic spectrum without once coming across a fellow amateur .
Thousands of enthusiasts can be found in the region of radio waves , of light and of gamma rays .
But none of them come to play in my back yard .
If the prospect of exploring fresh electromagnetic territory sounds interesting to any of these amateurs , I can promise good hunting in the 10 - 8 - centimeter region  and for a total investment of less than $ 20 . 
As a lure Simons offers the collection of radiographs reproduced in Figures 225 , 226 , 227 and 228 .
He takes special pride in the one which shows screws embedded in an inch - thick block of wood .
This shot resulted from his first experiment with X - rays and illustrates what can happen when a fellow with a sharp eye follows a happy hunch .
225 Simon 's radiograph of two screws imbedded in an inch - thick block of wood
226 Radiograph of the plug from an electric flatiron
227 bones of fish revealed by homemade X - ray machine
228 Effectiveness of Simon 's X - ray machine in penetrating the steel leaves of a thickness ranging from .002 to .010 of an inch thick
During a rainy weekend back in 1933 Simons was fiddling with an Oudin coil .
This almost forgotten gadget , a close relative of the Tesla coil , can step up low voltages 1,000 times or more .
High voltage generated in this way has an advantage for the amateur experimenter in that it is relatively harmless .
In the course of stepping up the voltage the Oudin coil also increases the frequency of the current , so that it tends to flow through the skin and away from vital organs such as the heart .
 My original Oudin coil ,  Simons recalls , was part of an ultraviolet lamp with which I tested mineral specimens for fluorescence .
For no particular reason I decided to replace the evacuated quartz bulb , which produced the ultraviolet rays , with an old radio tube of the 01 type .
The glass envelope of these tubes is coated inside with a silvery film of evaporated magnesium  the so - called getter  which helps clear the tube of stray gas during the evacuation process and absorbs any that may be liberated by the glass walls or metal parts after the seal - off .
I simply held the 01 in my hand and touched its prongs to the high - voltage terminal of the coil . 
Instead of filling with a lavender glow , like the quartz bulb , the inside of the tube remained dark but the glass in contact with the magnesium lighted with a pale greenish fluorescence that reminded me of the glow emitted by old style X - ray tubes of the gas type .
Was the radio tube producing X - rays ?
 To obtain the answer to this question I put a narrow band of tinfoil around the top of the tube and grounded it  as a substitute for the electrode previously represented by my hand .
I then fished a small block of wood , which happened to have two screws in it , from the trash box and placed it on a sheet of photographic film wrapped in black paper .
The combination was exposed to the energized tube for 15 seconds at a distance of seven inches .
When I had developed the film , I discovered a wonderful radiograph of the screws  plus a lifetime hobby that should appeal to anyone interested in physics . 
Why has Simons 's hobby failed to catch on ?
One reason is that commercial X - ray equipment is costly .
Even tubes of relatively low power are priced at $ 100 and up .
Many other commercial X - ray parts are also expensive and difficult to procure .
The apparatus supplying high voltage to conventional tubes , while no more complex than the power supply of a husky radio transmitter , calls for special rectifying devices , transformers and other components which are not regularly stocked by dealers in electrical supplies .
Moreover , X - rays have earned a bad reputation as playthings .
No distinction can be drawn between the danger of exposure to a high - powered X - ray machine and the fallout of an H - bomb .
It is a danger that extends not only to the experimenter but to his potential progeny .
Human evolution is the result of mutations caused by , among other agents , cosmic rays and the radiations of radioactive elements in the earth 's crust .
Any radiation added by man alters the rate of mutation , and is rightly a cause of deep concern .
Simons has solved the problem of equipment cost .
Protection against exposure to the rays is not difficult to arrange .
With these two considerations out of the way , X - rays open a range of experiments equaled by few other phenomena of physics .
In addition to providing a source of X - rays for radiographs , a generator of X - rays in combination with accessories enables you to measure the charge of the electron , to study the structure of crystals , to observe the wave - particle duality of matter and radiation , and to probe other microcosmic corners .
Like visible light , X - rays are a form of radiant energy .
Their ability to penetrate substances opaque to visible light , however , is neither unique nor particularly unusual .
Many substances opaque to light are transparent to other electromagnetic waves .
For example , long electrical waves , as well as the shorter ones of radio , pass freely through dry wood , plaster and other substances that do not conduct electricity and are opaque to light .
If this were not so , all radio and television receivers would need outdoor antennas .
On the other hand , a thick sheet of flint glass , which transmits radio waves and light with no appreciable loss , stops X - rays .
The ability of X - rays to penetrate substances like flesh and bone is merely their most publicized property .
However , this property provides a striking case of the immediate application of a scientific discovery .
Within weeks of the description of X - rays by Wilhelm Konrad Röntgen in 1895 , surgeons heralded them as a tool of the first importance .
They are characterized chiefly by extremely short wavelength  about one ten - thousandth the length of visible light waves .
Like light waves , X - rays can be reflected , refracted , diffracted and polarized .
The techniques by which they are manipulated differ from those employed with light , just as light techniques differ from those of radio .
The longest X - rays are indistinguishable from ultraviolet rays ; the shortest are identical with gamma rays .
The distinction between the two is largely a matter of definition .
When the emission accompanies the disintegration of a radioactive substance such as radium , it is called gamma radiation .
Identical waves generated by electronic means are called X - rays .
All radiant energy , including X - rays , has its origin in a disturbance of electrical charge .
Consider a point charge  an electron  surrounded by a symmetrical electromagnetic field and moving through space at constant velocity .
What happens to the motion of the field if the central charge is speeded up or slowed down ?
Experiments indicate that the field reacts much like a mass of jelly .
When the central charge is accelerated , the disturbance is communicated radially through the field as a wave motion  the outside parts of the field requiring an appreciable time interval to catch up with the center .
Work expended in accelerating the central charge is carried away by the wave as radiant energy , at a velocity which depends on the nature of the jelly . 
In a vacuum the wave attains a maximum velocity of slightly more than 186,000 miles per second .
The length of the wave depends upon the abruptness with which the central charge is either disturbed or made to change direction .
Violent disturbances require the investment of more work than gentle ones , and result in proportionately shorter and more energetic waves .
The waves radiated by electrical power lines , in which a stream of electrons changes direction only 60 times a second , measure about 3,900 miles from crest to crest .
It is possible to subject electrons to much faster oscillations .
Military radars , for example , are constructed around magnetron oscillators , small copper chambers that have been called electrical counterparts of the familiar police whistle .
The cavities are electrically tuned to frequencies on the order of four billion cycles per second , and streams of electrons forced into the cavities vibrate at this rate .
The resulting electromagnetic waves measure some three inches from crest to crest .
As the cavities are made progressively smaller , the pitch goes up and the wavelength goes down in obedience to the principle that the smaller the whistle , the shriller its note .
Where , then , can a whistle  be found that will accelerate charges rapidly or abruptly enough to create electromagnetic waves a mere 25 thousandths of an inch long  the wavelength of visible light ?
Nature provides such systems in the form of molecules and atoms .
The normal , stable atom emits no radiation unless it is acted upon by an external source of energy .
If a fast - moving electron encounters an atom in its normal state , the interloper may collide with one of the planetary electrons in the outer orbital shell of the atom .
The impact may cause the electron in the atom to jump to an orbit still more remote from the center of the atom .
A sufficiently energetic electromagnetic wave impinging on the atom can accomplish the same end , the requirement being that the frequency of the wave coincide with the period of the outer electron 's orbital motion .
In either case the atom gains energy from the encounter and thus becomes unstable .
The normal state is soon restored when the electron hops back into its home orbit .
This represents the shifting of a center of charge , and the excess energy is radiated into space by the accompanying electromagnetic wave .
The abruptness of the jump , and hence the length of the wave , depends upon the attraction of the positive nucleus for the planetary electron .
When weakly bound electrons occupying an orbit remote from the nucleus make such jumps , the length of the radiated wave measures on the order of 25 thousandths of an inch  the wavelength of light .
This same mechanism accounts for the origin of one kind of X -ray .
When a free electron , accelerated to a velocity of some 18,000 miles per second , collides with an electron occupying an inner shell of the atom , both the interloper and the innershell electron may carom into space , as shown in the upper diagram of Figure 229 .
The vacancy thus created is immediately filled by an electron from a shell more remote from the nucleus .
The attraction of the nucleus for this electron is much greater and the jump accordingly more violent .
The resulting wave measures on the order of 250 millionths of an inch  an X -ray .
This initial jump does not end the display .
A vacancy has been created in the adjacent orbit by the electron that moved inward .
Hence a series of jumps follow as electrons from orbits still more remote from the nucleus move in to fill the succession of gaps [ see lower diagram , Fig. 229 ] .
In the end the atom must capture a new electron to complete its outermost orbit .
In the meantime the atom has emitted a series of waves at progressively lower frequencies , beginning with X - rays and extending through ultraviolet radiation and visible light to heat .
229 Classical representation of X - ray origin in excited atom
The pattern of forces acting between .
the nucleus and orbital electrons responsible for the radiation is unique for each kind of atom .
Measure the radiation emitted at each frequency and you have an identifying tag for the atom .
This is the basis of spectroscopy .
The fundamental particles of the atom move in their orbits at rates fixed by these same forces .
In effect the atom is tuned ,  much as a group of radio receiving sets might be pretuned for a group of broadcasting stations .
Atoms low on the periodic table , such as carbon , hydrogen , oxygen and nitrogen  the stuff of living matter  are far out of tune with X - rays of extremely high , frequency .
When such waves impinge on protoplasm , they ignore the barrier and sail right through .
X -rays of the highest frequency , those used for making most radiographs and for the treatment of disease , are liberated when the bombarding electron crashes into the massive nucleus of a target atom .
The precise nature of such encounters is not fully understood , but it appears that when the bombarding electron collides with the nucleus head - on , and is stopped dead in its track , the onrushing field may consume the entire mass of the arrested particle and , in effect , transform the electron into an X - ray of very high energy and frequency .
Other electrons strike the nucleus glancing blows , and are thus decelerated .
The deceleration is accompanied by the emission of an X -ray of proportionate wavelength and energy .
Hence when a stream of bombarding electrons plays on a target composed of massive atoms , the emission of radiant energy includes : ( 1 ) X - rays liberated by the acceleration of planetary electrons , characteristic of the kind of atoms comprising the target , and ( 2 ) X - rays that span a continuous band of frequencies from the ultraviolet range to those of almost infinitesimal wavelength .
It was this continuous or white  X - radiation , arising from the bombardment of silicon nuclei in the glass of a Crookes tube , that led Röntgen to his discovery .
While studying the green fluorescence that appears at one stage in the evacuation of the energized tube , Röntgen observed a bright fluorescence among some nearby crystals of platinocyanide .
The crystals continued to glow even after he covered the energized tube with black paper .
He concluded that the tube was emitting a previously unobserved form of radiation .
The Crookes tube consists of a pear - shaped glass bulb that is partially evacuated and fitted with a cathode at the small end and an anode at the large end .
When a direct - current potential of about 20,000 volts is connected across the electrodes , positive ions , accelerated by the electric field , bombard the cathode and dislodge electrons from the metal .
Most of these are attracted to the anode , but some overshoot the mark .
The latter electrons continue to the end of the tube , where they collide with the glass target .
Soon after Röntgen 's discovery , the mechanism of white X - ray production was explained by experimental investigation that paved the way for improvements in the tube .
By shaping the cathode in the form of a paraboloid , for example , the electron stream could be focused sharply on the metallic target composed of atoms more massive than silicon .
X - rays liberated at the spot were more energetic and cast sharper shadows than those from the broad expanse of glass .
Electrostatic machines for the production of accelerating voltages grew in size until some featured a spinning disk of plate glass seven feet across , capable of generating 200,000 volts and currents up to five milliamperes .
All the early tubes contained some gas , the atoms of which were needed as a source of electrons .
The gas imposed an upper limit on the accelerating voltage .
The limitation was removed in 1913 when W. D. Coolidge of the General Electric Company succeeded in making ductile filaments of tungsten , which he substituted for the cold cathode of the gas tubes .
With this independent source of electrons , tubes could be evacuated to the limit of pumping techniques .
Accelerating potentials of 300,000 volts and more became practical .
Such power levels created another problem ; the heating of the anode or target .
This problem was first tackled by using tungsten , with its high melting temperature , at both ends of the tube , then by cooling the target with water , and finally by focusing the bombarding electrons in a small spot near the edge of a motor - driven disk made of tungsten .
Although Simons 's tube is not in the class with large X - ray tubes of the modern Coolidge type , it performs impressively well .
A number of years ago Simons shipped his first machine to George L. Clark at the University of Illinois who , after testing it , reported to the journal Radiology :  Simons 's apparatus proves that X - rays can be produced for experimental purposes by a unit which can be built for a very small fraction of the cost of an installation of standard commercial equipment .
The machine , when in operation , will produce a beam of X - rays easily detected for a distance of several feet in all directions .
With r meter measurements we determined the intensity of the rays to be three fourths of a Röntgen unit per minute at a distance of three feet . 
The explanation of this copious radiation , compared with that of a Crookes tube , appears to lie in the magnesium coating .
Unfortunately the old 01 and tubes of similar construction are currently in short supply because magnesium is no longer favored as a material to remove gases , except in certain types of mercury - vapor rectifying tubes which are unsuitable for X - ray production .
For this reason ( plus the fact that he is an inveterate experimenter )
Simons now designs his own tubes and has them manufactured by a local glass blower .
They cost about $ 15 each .
He rarely makes two alike , for the same reason that amateur telescope makers seldom build two identical instruments .
Each design is a new and exciting experience .
One of Simons 's latest designs is illustrated in Figure 230 .
This tube is equipped with a disk - shaped cathode of molybdenum and a magnesium target .
It is evacuated to a barometric pressure of .0001 millimeters of mercury .
The over - all length of the tube is about seven inches .
Its emission is substantially greater than that of the 01 tube .
Simons 's radiographs , with the exception of the one showing the screws in a block of wood , were made with it .
Such tubes can be made with a wide variety of target materials and cathode shapes .
230 X - ray tube designed and constructed by Simons
Almost any source of high voltage can be used for energizing X - ray tubes , including Van de Graaff electrostatic generators of the type described in this section .
Simons prefers to stick with Oudin coil .
It is easily constructed with hand tools .
The job is simplified if you can lay hands on a vibrator of the type used in the spark coil of a Model - T Ford .
As shown by Roger Hayward 's diagram , Figure 231 , and the general view in Figure 232 , the vibrator consists of a core of soft magnetic iron equipped with an armature of soft magnetic iron and a set of breaker points .
231 Circuit diagram of Simon 's X - ray apparatus
232 The source of high voltage for Simon 's X - ray machine
The core of the vibrator is wound with 3,800 turns of No. 24 magnet wire and connected in series with the breaker points as shown .
When bridged with the one - microfarad capacitor and connected to the power line , the self - inductance of the coil is sufficient to charge the capacitor to a potential of several hundred volts when the breaker points are adjusted to open at the peak of the current cycle .
The capacitor discharges through the five - turn primary winding of the Oudin coil .
The primary is wound with five turns of ¼-inch copper tubing on a 2 ¼ - inch plastic form three inches in diameter .
The secondary winding consists of 5,000 turns of No. 32 enameled magnet wire wound on a ½- inch rod of clear plastic .
Each layer of wire must be carefully insulated with a layer of varnished cambric that extends well beyond the end of the coil .
When the winding is completed , the secondary coil must be thoroughly doped with high - grade insulating varnish .
Both ends of the coil are insulated with a tube of varnished cambric .
The assembly is then slipped inside the plastic form on which the primary was wound .
The outside end of the secondary is brought out through a small hole in the form and soldered to one end of the primary winding .
The inner end of the secondary is threaded through a four - inch length of ½- inch plastic tubing and soldered to the inner face of a chromium - plated chair glide , which serves as the high - voltage terminal .
The ends of the primary form are then closed with disks of ¼-inch plastic and secured in place with screws at the edge .
A ½-inch hole in the center of one disk admits the tube support for the high - voltage terminal .
The chair glide is lifted temporarily and enough transformer oil or potting compound poured through the ½-inch tube to fill the interior .
When wired according to the diagram [ Fig. 231 ] and connected to the power line , the coil will produce some 50,000 to 75,000 volts continuously .
The power consumption at 110 volts and 60 cycles is 35 watts .
As shown in Figure 233 , all this apparatus must be housed in a well - grounded metal container .
The X - ray tube must be enclosed in an inner compartment of lead sheet at least 1/8 - inch thick .
An opening in the end of the double housings opposite the tube provides a window for the X -rays .

WARNING !
You must take these precautions
First , Oudin Coils are notorious emitters of radio waves that take the form of ragged noise .
They can black out radio and television reception for miles around .
Federal regulations prohibit the operation of such devices unless they are thoroughly shielded .
If any stray radiation can be detected on a nearby radio or TV receiver after the apparatus is assembled as described , it will be necessary to insert a low - pass filter at the point where the power cord enters the housing .
The design of such filters is available in standard radio reference texts .
Whenever the machine is in operation , the experimenter must wear a lead apron and stand well behind the orifice through which the rays are emitted .
Never turn your back to the machine so that you are between it and the apron !
It is also advisable to place a few exploratory samples of film around the room while the apparatus is in operation .
When developed , these will show the pattern of radiation and protective lead shielding can be installed accordingly .
Finally , resist the temptation to make X - ray examinations of the bones in your hands or other body parts .
A frozen fish makes a much safer test object .

If WordPress were a country , our Bill of Rights would be the GPL because it protects our core freedoms .
We ’ve always done our best to keep WordPress.org clean and only promote things that are completely compatible and legal with WordPress ’s license .
There have been some questions in the community about whether the GPL applies to themes like we ’ve always assumed .
To help clarify this point , I reached out to the Software Freedom Law Center , the world ’s preëminent experts on the GPL , which spent time with WordPress ’s code , community , and provided us with an official legal opinion .
One sentence summary : PHP in WordPress themes must be GPL , artwork and CSS may be but are not required .
Matt ,
You asked the Software Freedom Law Center to clarify the status of themes as derivative works of WordPress , a content management software package written in PHP and licensed under version 2 of the GNU General Public License .
We examined release candidate 1 of WordPress 2.8 , which you provided to us at https://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.8-RC1.tar.gz.
The “ classic ” and “ default ” themes included in that release candidate comprise various PHP and CSS files along with an optional directory of images .
The PHP files contain a mix of HTML markup and PHP calls to
WordPress functions .
There is some programmatic logic in the PHP code , including loops and conditionals .
When WordPress is started , it executes various routines that prepare information for use by themes .
In normal use , control is then transferred via PHP ’s include ( ) function to HTML and PHP templates found in theme package files .
The PHP code in those template files relies on the earlier - prepared information to fill the templates for serving to the client .
On the basis of that version of WordPress , and considering those themes as if they had been added to WordPress by a third party , it is our opinion that the themes presented , and any that are substantially similar , contain elements that are derivative works of the WordPress software as well as elements that are potentially separate works .
Specifically , the CSS files and material contained in the images directory of the “ default ” theme are works separate from the WordPress code .
On the other hand , the PHP and HTML code that is intermingled with and operated on by PHP the code derives from the WordPress code .
In the WordPress themes , CSS files and images exist purely as data to be served by a web server .
WordPress itself ignores these files [ 1 ] .
The CSS and image files are simply read by the server as data and delivered verbatim to the user , avoiding the WordPress instance altogether .
The CSS and images could easily be used with a range of HTML documents and read and displayed by a variety of software having no relation to WordPress .
As such , these files are separate works from the WordPress code itself .
The PHP elements , taken together , are clearly derivative of WordPress code .
The template is loaded via the include ( ) function .
Its contents are combined with the WordPress code in memory to be processed by PHP along with ( and completely indistinguishable from ) the rest of WordPress .
The PHP code consists largely of calls to WordPress functions and sparse , minimal logic to control which WordPress functions are accessed and how many times they will be called .
They are derivative of WordPress because every part of them is determined by the content of the WordPress functions they call .
As works of authorship , they are designed only to be combined with WordPress into a larger work .
HTML elements are intermingled with PHP in the two themes presented .
These snippets of HTML interspersed with PHP throughout the theme PHP files together form a work whose form is highly dependent on the PHP and thus derivative of it .
In conclusion , the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress ’s copyrighted code .
These themes , being collections of distinct works ( images , CSS files , PHP files ) , need not be GPL - licensed as a whole .
Rather , the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not .
Third - party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish .
Finally , we note that it might be possible to design a valid WordPress theme that avoids the factors that subject it to WordPress ’s copyright , but such a theme would have to forgo almost all the WordPress functionality that makes the software useful .
Sincerely ,
James Vasile

There is one exception .
WordPress does reads CSS and image files to create previews of templates for the template selection portion of the administrative interface .
Even in that case , though , nothing in those files calls any WordPress functions , is treated as a command by PHP , or alters any other WordPress data structure .
These files are read as data and used to create an image and display a miniaturized version of a webpage to the user .
For a time , in the 1990s and early 2000s , the prospects for unorthodox moviemaking in Hollywood appeared promising .
Prompted by the phenomenal success of “ Pulp Fiction ” in 1994 , the big Hollywood studios tentatively opened their gates ( and their wallets ) to a new generation of “ independent ” directors , among them Jonze and his friends David O. Russell and Alexander Payne .
In 2003 , when Jonze was just starting work on “ Where the Wild Things Are , ” Warner Brothers established a boutique division that went on to put out movies like “ Before Sunset ” and “ Good Night , and Good Luck . ”
But five years later , Warner Brothers Independent , like many other prestige units in Hollywood , was shut down by its parent studio , and “ Where the Wild Things Are ” began to feel a little like a relic , an artifact from some freewheeling , irretrievable past .
When I sat down with Jonze , I ’d just seen a rough cut of the movie , and although I ’d been expecting something unusual , I had n’t quite been prepared for either the Cassavetes - speak or the lack of any clear conflict or resolution .
I told Jonze I ’d imagined something more along the lines of a traditional children ’s fantasy film , something like “ Harry Potter , ” for example .

He looked at me as if I ’d let him down .
“ It ’s in the visual language of , like , some sort of fantasy film , and it is a fantasy film to some degree , ” he acknowledged , “ but the tone of it is its own tone .
We wanted it all to feel true to a 9 - year - old and not have some big movie speech where a 9 - year - old is suddenly reciting the wisdom of the sage . ”
He had n’t set out to make a children ’s movie , he said , so much as to accurately depict childhood .
“ Everything we did , all the decisions that we made , were to try to capture the feeling of what it is to be 9 . ”
When Spike Jonze was 9 , he was Adam Spiegel , a shy , sensitive kid growing up in Bethesda , Md. , a suburb of Washington .
His father , Art Spiegel III , the grandson of the founder of the Spiegel catalog company , lived in Manhattan , where he ran a multimillion - dollar health care consulting firm .
When Adam was 2 , his parents divorced , and his mother took Adam and his older sister first to New Jersey , then to Philadelphia , before finally settling in Bethesda .
At home , Jonze would later write , discipline was “ erratic . ”
At school , Adam fared poorly .
“ What they were teaching did n’t interest me , ” he told me .
What did interest him was BMX , or bicycle motocross .
The sport originated in the late 1960s , when 12 - year - old boys began racing their dirt bikes on motorcycle tracks , though by the time Adam bought his first bike , BMX was less about racing and more about emulating what skateboarders were doing — riding on half - pipes and quarter - pipes , doing tricks in the street .
Adam , by many accounts , was a very good trick rider , and he wound up with a job at a bike shop in a local strip mall , selling grips and cranks to other teenagers .
Except for the 19 - year - old owner ’s family members , who took occasional shifts behind the register , all of the employees were under 21 .
They all wore surf shorts , and they all had nicknames : Tinkerbell , Wild Bill , Rootgirl , Sweetness .
Because of his unruly hair , Adam became Spike .
In the summer of 1987 , the day after his senior - year final exams , Jonze and a friend packed their belongings into the trunk of a beat - up brown Plymouth Colt and struck out for the West Coast .
The college - application process had not gone as well as Jonze had hoped .
Of the six colleges to which he ’d applied , only Pratt Institute , in Brooklyn , accepted him .
The top film and art schools — U.C.L.A. , CalArts , N.Y.U. — turned him down .
Not that he particularly minded .
“ I was only going to go to college because that ’s what I thought you were supposed to do , ” he told me not long ago .
Fortunately , Jonze had a backup plan .
In high school , he wrote a handful of freelance articles for Freestylin ’ , a BMX magazine , and when he and his friend reached California , they steered the Colt to Torrance , the industrial city half an hour south of Hollywood where the magazine had its editorial offices .
The editors , Andy Jenkins and Mark Lewman , were 21 and 19 .
They had been looking to hire someone new — not a professional journalist but a BMX kid like themselves , a young person who knew the sport and loved it .
They chose Jonze .
One afternoon in February , Jonze drove me around Torrance in a white 1969 Porsche that he borrowed from Lance Acord , his cinematographer .
( When Jonze is by himself , he gets around on a Vespa . )
He was dressed stylishly , if a bit raffishly , in an untucked lavender dress shirt and a gray tie with lilac stripes .
There was a skateboard in the backseat .
For most of the ride , he was chatty but not particularly forthcoming , asking nearly as many questions as he answered .
We turned into the sprawling industrial park where the editorial offices of Freestylin ’ were once located , and he slowed the car and grew quiet .
A sign on a warehouse said “ Global Communication Semiconductors Inc . ”
Jonze pointed to the sun- bleached concrete building where he and his friends used to work .
“ There were so many amazing people , and we had such an amazing time , but it ’s the most banal place , ” he said .
Behind the warehouse , Jonze told me , was the low - rise , low - rent apartment complex where he lived after arriving in Torrance , sharing a living room with two other teenagers and a drum set .
The carpet was spotted with grease stains from people constantly tearing apart their bikes .
Kids drifted in and out , crashing on the floor for weeks at a time .
( “ There was a guy living in the dining room for a while , ” Jenkins told me . )
In the mornings , Jonze and his roommates would throw their skateboards over the wall in a back alley and glide to the office through a couple of parking lots .
After 5 p.m. , the members of the editorial team — none of them older than 21 — had the company warehouse to themselves .
“ We had a refrigerator full of film , ” Jonze told me .
“ We ’d skate ramps .
We ’d build rails .
We had everything .
It was , like , way better than any college . ”
Five years ago Pabst Blue Ribbon rose like a phoenix from the ashes to become the official beer of the sad modern “ counter - culture , ” effectively branding itself as the adult beverage of choice for urban 20 and 30 - somethings seeking to shed their pansy - ass realities and earn some hard street cred by creating a facade of being one with white - trash folk .
But do the cool kids realize that the folks at Pabst who make and market their beloved “ anti-establishment ” beer of choice are also savvy capitalists who ’ve been quite effective at making massive profits off of their “ non-conformist ” asses through slick marketing ?
You see , PBR is n’t the cheapest beer by a long shot , and it tastes like shit to boot .
But clever marketing created an illusion of hipness that does n’t seem to be waning .
Sales of PBR are up 25 % this year despite the fact that Pabst raised its prices again :
The brand hiked prices this year , and a case of PBR now costs $ 1.50 more than MillerCoors ’ Keystone , $ 1 more than Anheuser - Busch ’s Busch and Natural brands , and 50 cents more than Miller High Life .
And it ’s growing at a faster clip than all of the aforementioned brands — all of which are growing this year — despite the higher price .
So one can assume that the spike in sales is essentially being driven by the increasing effectiveness of the company ’s clever marketing campaign :
Back in 2004 , Pabst executed a highly effective word - of - mouth campaign that made the long - declining brand an “ ironic downscale chic ” choice for bike messengers and other younger drinkers who viewed the beer as a statement of non-mainstream taste .
PBR sales surged by nearly 17 % that year , and have climbed at single - digit rates since , until this year , when the recession sent its sales soaring as more drinkers were pushed into the subpremium category .
Think of it as conspicuous downscale consumption , or something like it .
“ There ’s still a bit of hipness to it , ” said Benj Steinman , editor of Beer Marketer ’s Insights .
“ Of all the subpremiums , it ’s got a little more cache . ”
“ It ’s an anti-establishment badge , ” added a major market wholesaler .
“ It seems to play to the retro , nonconformist crowd pretty well . ”
So is n’t about time we ( Yes , I ’ve dabbled in PBR on occasion . ) all find a different “ anti-establishment ” beer to drink .
Nattie Light and Miller High Life are both products of mega- corporations , so to hell with both of them .
Personally , I ’d like to nominate two tasty and inexpensive beers that could always be found in my Grandpa ’s fridge when I was growing up : Dixie Beer and Schlitz .
It ’s time .

There is no other city in the United States that highlights the Achilles Heel of the current financial crisis like Detroit Michigan .
Detroit Michigan had a booming population from 1870 to 1950 .
In 1870 Detroit had 79,577 residents and in 1950 Detroit had a stunning 1.8 million .
The massive boom came with the growth of the U.S. auto industry .
The nickname Motor City was aptly deserved as Detroit became a powerhouse of economic growth .
Yet all that has now changed .
Detroit now has 912,062 residents , a decline of 50 percent from the peak in 1950 and those leaving the city continue .
Detroit is n’t in a recession but an economic depression .
It is rare to see such a large out migration from the once powerful Detroit but visualizing this on a chart is simply amazing :
From the 1950s onward , Detroit has slowly lost residents .
However the metro area was still in growth mode up until 2008 .
The city has seen the major pain of this economic crisis on every front .
Consumer demand has shifted to more fuel efficient cars .
Global competition has eaten into the competitive advantage of the big three automakers .
Michigan also has had a weak economy with housing prices in the doldrums for over a decade .
While much of the U.S. has dealt with the housing bubble bursting in recent years , Detroit has been dealing with its own depression for over a decade .
But even the recent bubble brought some growth to Motor City in the housing mania :
What is fascinating with the data above is that Detroit housing values have been under inflationary trends for nearly two decades .
The recent bubble pushed index data over 100 for a brief interval but we are now back below the range .
Yet Detroit saw a housing decline based on real economic fundamentals of a weak economy .
That is , much of the drop came from employment or out migration instead of toxic sophisticated mortgages .
The unemployment rate however for Detroit is off the charts .
The current unemployment rate for the city is 28.9 percent .
It is amazing that such a big city is having unemployment surpassing the national average at the peak of the Great Depression .
Even the local MSA is seeing unemployment nearing 20 percent :
If that is the headline number , we can only estimate that the actual unemployment and underemployment must be nearing 40 percent .
This kind of employment pain is simply a reflection of the real shifts in the economy .
The U.S. consumer in large part is changing their habits .
Detroit is a reflection of a past that is no longer here .
It is hard to spend more than you have and build cars that simply were not fuel efficient .
It has changed some of its ways but is it too late ?
Most automakers got caught in this shift yet not to the point of the big three .
In fact , we need to remember that two of the big three are now government owned .
In many ways , it is painful to see a beloved American city with so much history being dismantled .
We would like to see it as this :
Yet the current reality is more like this :
Source : Time
In many ways that photo above could be out of some futuristic dystopian movie where a city is left to atrophy over time .
Yet it is not .
It is the slow progression and reality of the new austerity in America .
People have spent and borrowed too much on credit .
As a nation the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve have done everything they can to keep this going but as you can see from the above , consumers are just not buying it .
And how could they ?
We ’ve gutted our manufacturing base .
One lesson Henry Ford knew even with his workers is that you must pay your employees enough to purchase the product they develop especially if it is mass produced .
The only way we got people to buy cars in the last few months was through cash for clunker gimmicks and not a focus on employment .
Will this last ?
It is interesting that some of the new strategies to resurrect Detroit include bull dozing large portions of the city .
A city government that is in massive deficit , it may be cheaper to demolish certain areas instead of letting them sit and allowing crime to grow .
Plus , the city has lost tens of thousands of residents so some of the structure reflects a city that is no longer as big as it once was .
In many ways Detroit needs to downsize just like its line of autos .
I know it is hard to look at examples like this because it detracts from the Wall Street casino .
In amazing fashion the market keeps going up even though employers are not hiring and layoffs are still in the pipeline .
However Detroit is a real example of the pain currently faced in the trenches in America .
Wall Street is so disconnected from Detroit , it has forgotten it even exists .

German antitank weapons are divided into several classes .
The main class comprises guns built specifically for antitank missions and falls into three groups — guns of conventional German design , guns built with tapered - bore tubes , and captured antitank weapons .
The orthodox German guns in the first group are designed to achieve armor penetration at maximum ranges by using relatively heavy projectiles with high velocities .
The first such gun was the 37 - mm Rheinmetall ( the 3.7 - cm Pak ) .
This was too limited in power at the time of the Battle of France ( 1940 ) , and was superseded by the 50 - mm 5 - cm Pak 38 .
This 50 - mm weapon is gradually being replaced , in turn , by the 75 - mm 7.5 - cm Pak 40 , which is the standard German antitank gun of today .
Since the Pak 40 is capable of penetrating 4.43 inches of armor at 500 yards , it is considered an adequate weapon .
These three guns all have similar basic features : split tubular trails , a low silhouette , and a large shield .
All have been kept as light as possible to increase tactical mobility .
The 50 - mm and the 75 - mm guns employ muzzle brakes to reduce recoil and thus permit lighter carriages .
In 1944 another gun , the 88 - mm 8.8 - cm Pak 43/41 , was added to this group .
Although this gun is extremely powerful ( it penetrates 4.4 inches of armor at 2,500 yards ) , its great weight on its split - trail , two - wheeled carriage somewhat reduces its mobility .
Another version of this gun — the 8.8 - cm Pak 43 — mounts the same tube , but on a carriage like that of the well - known 88 - mm antiaircraft guns of the Flak 18 and 36 types .
The guns in the tapered - bore group are intended to have greater mobility than conventional guns capable of achieving identical armor penetration .
Tapered - bore guns seek to achieve penetration at short ranges , using light projectiles fired at very high muzzle velocities .
Tungsten , which is becoming increasingly difficult for the Germans to obtain , is necessary in the manufacture of projectiles for these guns ; also , the performance of the guns in combat has been a disappointment to the Germans .
All three of the tapered - bore guns bear the same date of standardization — 1941 .
First to be introduced was the very light 28/20 - mm gun 2.8 - cm s. Pz.B. 41 .
So light that it can easily be manhandled by one gunner , the 28/20 has been used by mountain troops , who can break it up into loads and climb with it , and also has been used in an airborne version .
It has been issued extensively to armored and motorized infantry as a rifle company antitank weapon .
The next larger tapered - bore gun , the 42/28 - mm 4.2 - cm Pak 41 , is mounted on a modified 3.7 - cm
Pak carriage ; this weapon also has been used by mountain troops .
The largest is the 75/55 - mm 7.5 - cm Pak 41 .
The 75/55 has a most unusual carriage .
There is no axle ; instead , the wheels are secured to the thick shield , with the gun trunnioning on the shield as well .
This gun has not been issued in large quantities .
The group of captured antitank weapons includes a number of types that the German Army had seized in the course of its conquests .
Most of these guns had been designed and built before 1940 .
The Germans have used them as stop - gap weapons , substituting them for the better matériel that German factories have not been able to produce in sufficient quantity .
For example , extensive use is made of the French Model 1937 47 - mm gun ( 4.7 - Pak 181 ( f ) ) , which has an effective range of only 550 yards .
However , there are two really useful and efficient weapons that the Germans have put to considerable use .
One is the Soviet 76.2 - mm Model 1936 field gun , which the Red Army designed with an eye to using it for antitank and even antiaircraft purposes .
The Germans have found this high - velocity gun valuable , and have modified it by adding a double shield and , sometimes , a muzzle brake .
Although it is an alternate weapon with the 75 - mm Pak 40 and the 88 - mm antitank guns in the German Army , the Soviets have found it too heavy and badly balanced , and have issued what they consider superior antitank and field guns to replace it .
Another foreign gun favored by the German is the famous 75 - mm Schneider field gun , Model 1897 .
Many of these have been captured from various European countries , especially from France .
The Germans have modified the 75 - mm Schneider by fitting it with a large muzzle brake and by putting the gun on their own 50 - mm antitank gun carriage .
They call the result the 7.5 - cm Pak 97/38 .
Since the French 75 lacks muzzle velocity , it cannot be regarded as a satisfactory modern antitank gun .
A second and highly important class of antitank weapons consists of antiaircraft guns employed in an antitank role .
The high velocity of antiaircraft guns makes them suitable for antitank missions , and , since 1940 , German designers have paid special attention to the possibility that any German antiaircraft gun may be used as a dual - purpose weapon .
The smaller guns — the 20 - mm 2 - cm Flak 30 and 38 , and the 37 - mm 3.7 - cm Flak 18 and 36 — are now of little value in an antitank role because of their lack of power .
They remain effective against lightly armored vehicles , and against the vision slits , ports , and optical apparatus of larger tanks .
The newer 50 - mm 5 - cm Flak 41 , which resembles the 37's , is not much more effective .
The 88 ‑mm guns are notorious for their effectiveness against tanks of all sizes .
These guns include the Flak 18 series ( that is , the Flak 18 , 36 , and 37 ) and the Flak 41 .
Those in the Flak 18 series have mobile cruciform carriages with four outriggers , and are capable of effective fire with heavy projectiles at great ranges .
They differ in minor details only .
The Flak 41 is a somewhat similar weapon , but much more powerful , having a greatly increased muzzle velocity .
Introduced in 1942 , it is similar to the 8.8 - cm Pak 43/41 in that its great weight renders it less mobile than would seem desirable .
Fitted with a large shield , it was designed with greater consideration for antitank fire than were the guns in the Flak 18 series .
The latter , as a matter of fact , usually are fitted with a special carriage and shield when they are to function primarily in an antitank role .
This carriage permits a limited field of forward fire from the wheels without the necessity of emplacing the gun .
A Soviet gun — the 85 - mm Model 1939 — has been fitted with an 88 - mm liner , and is now in German service as the 8.5/8.8 - cm Flak 30 ( r ) .
This gun bears a general resemblance to those in the Flak 18 series , and gives a similar performance .
It is notable that , in the case of most of the guns mentioned , the Germans have made every effort to cut down on weight so as to gain tactical mobility .
While the use of light metals and lighter carriages through employment of recoil - reducing muzzle brakes has been general , there has been a recent tendency to retain mobility but to increase muzzle velocity by reducing the gun-tube safety factor .
This appears to have been done even in the case of such heavy weapons as the 88 - mm Pak 43/41 and the Flak 41 .
The tendency has been especially noticeable in German adaptations of such captured weapons as the Soviet Model 1939 antiaircraft gun and the Soviet Model 1936 field gun , the chambers of which have been altered to take more powerful charges .
Another important class of antitank weapons is composed of the self - propelled antitank guns , or tank destroyers .
These generally comprise modern antitank guns mounted on lightly armored tank chassis .
Typical of the best of this class are the Rhinoceros ( an 88 mounted on a modified tank chassis made of Pz. Kpfw . III and Pz. Kpfw. IV parts ) , the 75 - mm 7.5 - cm Pak 40 ( Sf ) , and the 76.2 - mm 7.62 - cm Pak 36 ( r ) ( Sf ) on the Panzerjäger II ( or Marder II ) chassis or the Panzerjäger 38 , ( or Marder III ) chassis .
( The terms Marder II and III refer to highly modified tank chassis of the Pz. Kpfw .
II and Pz. Kpfw. 38 (t ) , with engines moved forward so that gunners can stand on the floor of the hull .
Panzerjäger is a general term referring to all highly modified chassis for German tank destroyers . )
Such changes give the vehicles a lower silhouette .
They represent an advance from the period 1941 - 42 , when the Germans quickly mounted any sort of antitank weapon on any sort of chassis .
Since many of the latter types of self - propelled guns are in use today , it may be said that there are as many types of German self - propelled antitank guns as there are possible combinations of guns and chassis .
One of the latest and most powerful tank destroyers is the Jagdpanther , or Panzerjäger Panther .
This weapon is an 88 - mm gun of late design on a Panther tank chassis , suitably modified .
The gun is so well armored that there is actually hard to distinguish the Jagdpanther from an assault gun .
German assault guns now must be listed as a class of available antitank weapons , although their primary mission is direct infantry support .
The most common type of assault gun is the long 75 - mm gun with muzzle brake , mounted on a Pz. Kpfw .
III chassis .
This type is known as the 7.5 - cm Sturmgeschütz 40 .
A big assault gun formerly called the " Ferdinand , " but now known as the " Elephant , " mounts an 88 .
It is thought that production of this heavy 70 - ton vehicle may have been discontinued .
German assault guns of the types mentioned have guns mounted in low armored boxes , instead of in turrets .
Fire is only to the front , with very limited traverse .
Armor is weak on the rear and top .
German development of the hollow - charge shell , which began as early as 1938 , has permitted employment of all low - velocity infantry howitzers and field artillery in emergency antitank roles .
The principle of the hollow charge is well known .
Low - velocity weapons merely have to throw their hollow - charge projectiles against an armor surface .
On striking the armor , the light streamlined cap of the shell is crushed .
The explosive then exerts a concentrated force against a small area of the armor .
The concentrated blast which results is intended to effect a penetration of the tank armor .
Hollow - charge shells have been furnished for standard infantry guns and artillery of German divisions of all types — in particular , the 75 - mm and 150 - mm infantry howitzers , the 105 - mm and 150 - mm field howitzers , and the 105 - mm guns .
Since many antitank guns of obsolete models still are in service , the Germans have introduced the stick bomb , another development of the hollow charge , in an effort to make the most of such equipment .
Stick bombs consist of very large charges mounted on a spigot .
The spigot is inserted in the gun muzzle , and the whole is propelled by firing a special blank round .
Stick bombs are furnished for the 3.7 - cm Pak , 15 - cm s. I.G. 33 , and the French Model 1937 47 - mm antitank gun .
Such bombs have short range and limited accuracy .
The French 47 , for instance , fires its stick bomb at ranges of from 200 to 275 yards only .
A most important class of antitank weapons was almost completely neglected until Germany invaded the Soviets .
Only then , apparently , did the German High Command become seriously interested in the effectiveness of close - combat antitank weapons and techniques .
The Germans were in such a hurry to introduce this type of warfare that the first German manuals on the subject hardly bothered to change the Soviet drawings that they copied .
As a result , German soldiers studying antitank close combat were treated to illustrations which showed Soviet troops successfully demolishing Pz. Kpfw .
I 's with all varieties of close - combat weapons .
Prior to the Russian campaign , the Germans had issued a company antitank weapon — the 7.9 - mm antitank rifle .
But after the Russian campaign had got under way , the Germans began to convert this weapon into a grenade launcher which could fire hollow - charge antitank grenades .
Readers of the Intelligence Bulletin already are familiar with the simpler devices used in close antitank combat — Molotov cocktails , bottles of phosphorus , sliding and hand - thrown mines , magnetic hollow charges , sticky bombs , and weapons of a similar nature .
Readers also are familiar with such weapons as the antitank hollow - charge grenade which can be launched from the standard rifle , and with the signal pistol fitted to fire hollow charges .
However , the non-recoil weapons of the bazooka type — a most important group — have not yet been discussed .
Of this group the first weapon to be adopted was a frank copy of the bazooka .
The larger German version is called the 8.8 - cm Raketenpanzerbüchse 43 , or Ofenrohr ( stovepipe ) for short .
Sometimes it is called the Panzerschreck — ( tank terror ) .
The Ofenrohr fires an 88 - mm hollow - charge projectile weighing 7 pounds .
The maximum range is about 165 yards .
The Ofenrohr is clumsier than the bazooka , and is reputed to be less accurate .
The Püppchen ( " Dolly " ) , a carriage - mounted rocket launcher with breechblock also fires the 88 - mm rocket .
Although the Püppchen has wheels , the gun can be fired from little sleighs to achieve a very low silhouette .
While the Püppchen , has a range of 770 yards , is very lightly built , and is likely to smash up when towed by motor vehicles .
The great majority of the non-recoil weapons are devices known as Panzerfaust .
There are three of these — the little Panzerfaust klein 30 ( formerly the Faustpatrone I ) , the Panzerfaust 30 ( formerly the Faustpatrone II ) , and the Panzerfaust 60 .
The little Panzerfaust is called Gretchen for short , while the 30 is known simply as Panzerfäuste .
The tubes are similar , and have a sight and firing mechanism .
They are 1 3/ 4 inches in diameter and 2 feet , 7 1/2 inches long .
The projectiles are very large hollow charges .
The charge for the Gretchen weighs 3 pounds , 4 ounces ; that for the Panzerfaust weighs 6 pounds 14 ounces .
Each is mounted on a wooden tail rod fitted with spring - steel vanes .
These vanes wrap around the rod when the rod is inserted in the muzzle of the launching tube , and spring out to guide the projectile after firing .
The tubes are expendable , and contain the propelling charge fired by percussion .
The range is very limited , and is indicated by the designation ( 30 means 30 meters range , or 33 yards ; 60 , 66 yards ) .
The operator must take cover after discharging a projectile .
Also , he must wear a helmet as protection against a rain of fragments and debris , keep his eyes closed , and keep the front edge of his helmet against the ground .
The jet of flame to the rear is fatal up to 10 feet ; the operator must take this into account when firing , and make sure that no walls or other obstacles will block the jet .
The tubes are held under the right arm .
The left hand supports the front of the tube , while the right hand is free to pull out the safety pin , cock the striker , and press the release button .
Sighting is effected by aligning the top of the sight and the top edge of the projectile .
To date , all the Panzerfäuste have proved dangerous to the user .
It is believed that every effort will be made to improve them — especially with regard to increasing the range .
Armor penetration is good ; the Germans claim as much as 7.9 inches for the Panzerfaust 30 .
It is estimated that actual penetration is around 6 inches .
Since Allied airpower has curtailed the mobility of German antitank guns , the Germans have been compelled to place great stress on the Ofenrohr and the Faustpatrone .
Large quantities of these have been issued .
The Ofenrohr is chiefly a regimental antitank company weapon , but the Faustpatronne is furnished on a generous scale to each rifle company .
Reports from the field indicate that the Faustpatrone has been especially well liked by German soldiers .
An even more recent development is the Panzerwurfmine .
This is a hand - thrown hollow charge ; it is similar in size and shape to the Faustpatrone projectiles , except that its vanes are made of cloth .
... you can play with them , chew on them , store them , swallow them , hide them , eat them , stash them or just share them ...
A long line , something of a Dragon * Con mainstay , stretched across the third floor of Atlanta , Georgia 's , Marriott Marquis hotel , all the way into the skywalk which connects into the Hyatt Regency across the street on Saturday .
Another mainstay of the convention : asking " What is this line for ? " was repeatedly answered with " Patrick Stewart . "
One convention staffer described it as a game of " human Tetris " in order to get as many of the thousands lined up to see the " Star Trek : The Next Generation " and " X - Men " star into the hotel 's enormous ballroom as possible .
In a talk show interview setting , Stewart fielded questions about his career and memories of his tenure as captain of the Enterprise .
He was barely aware of " Trek " when he got the role and was " guaranteed " by friends and others that the show would n't work .
He discussed how horribly uncomfortable the show 's uniforms were originally , leading his doctor to contact the production office demanding that they be changed .
When asked about fellow convention guests Leonard Nimoy and William Shatner , Stewart talked about how much he respected Nimoy .
As for Shatner , he paused and said , " He 's a piece of work , is n't he ? "
He was also particularly pleased to be able to recall the plots of some favorite episodes mentioned from the titles .
When the discussion turned to " X - Men , " Stewart , who had a cameo as a younger Professor Charles Xavier in " X - Men Origins : Wolverine , " said that from what he had heard , audiences have probably not seen the last of the professor .
He mentioned he recently co-starred in a production of " Waiting for Godot " with Ian McKellen and the two agreed that they would like continue exploring the relationship between Xavier and McKellen 's " X - Men " character Magneto .
As for that other franchise , Stewart thought that this summer 's reboot of " Star Trek " was " terrific , " but did n't see a future for Jean - Luc Picard in the franchise , leaving open only the possibility that he would agree to do a cameo in a sequel .
Stewart mentioned a proposed final " Next Generation " film , but after the disappointing box office for " Star Trek : Nemesis , " it never materialized .
" I feel that I have left behind a legacy as Picard , " he said .
" In my head and heart , I 've moved on . "
OVER the weekend , some visitors to the Web site of The New York Times received a nasty surprise .
An unknown person or group sneaked a rogue advertisement onto the site ’s pages .
The malicious ad took over the browsers of many people visiting the site , as their screens filled with an image that seemed to show a scan for computer viruses .
The visitors were then told that they needed to buy antivirus software to fix a problem , but the software was more snake oil than a useful program .

Exploiting weaknesses in online ad systems is an increasingly common approach for computer criminals around the globe who hope to make a quick buck from the audiences of the sites they attack .
Experts say the problem is likely to get worse as companies scramble to satiate a click - happy online culture .
“ The development of multimedia ads , mini-applications and social networking tools is far outpacing the speed of the thinking process about the security that goes into those applications , ” said Joe Stewart , a director of malware research at SecureWorks , a security services company .
This was something Richard Nixon , with his gift for looking below social surfaces to see and exploit the subterranean truths that roiled underneath , understood : the future belonged to the politician who could tap the ambivalence -- the nameless dread , the urge to make it all go away ; to make the world placid again , not a cacophonous mess .
Certainly the unseemly spectacle in NY - 23 would have horrified your grandpa 's Republican Party .
( My grandpa was a Socialist and he would have been delighted . )
First it was just a few kooks like Club For Growth , Fred Thompson and Mike Pence who were refusing to back Assemblywoman Dede Scozzafava , the official Republican Party nominee to replace John McHugh as the Representative from the sprawling upstate district that is famous for having more cows than people .
But then the noisiest and most mean - spirited factions in the shrinking Republican pup tent jumped in , the Hate Talk hosts , Dick Armey 's Astroturf - for - hire outfit , the fascist - oriented bloggers , the teabaggers and , on cue , Sarah Palin .
This puts them directly at odds with the Party Establishment , something that 's been happening more and more frequently in a party that 's always been the button - down and topdown party .
The national leadership , led -- lamely , by John Boehner , Pete Sessions , Eric Pence , Newt Gingrich , Lindsey Graham , John McCain , and Michael Steele -- are all backing Scozzafava and helping finance her campaign .
The teabaggers , the Hate Talkers and Palin are in open revolt and are pouring money into the campaign of the Conservative Party candidate , Doug Hoffman , something likely to result in a victory for Democrat Bill Owens .
Gingrich laid it out to the teabagger set -- who have reviled him since he endorsed Scozzafava last week : " The choice in New York is a practical one :
We can split the conservative vote and guarantee the election of a Democrat in a Republican seat in a substantial loss of opportunity .
Or we can find a way to elect someone who has committed to vote for the Republican leader , has committed to vote against all tax increases , has committed to vote against cap - and - trade , and is a strong ally of the NRA . "
The teabaggers do n't care .
They 've been told Scozzafava , who none of them had ever heard of a week and a half ago , must be defeated and now they 're on the march , filled with righteous indignation and ready to kill someone .
Same in Florida , where mainstream conservative Charlie Crist -- a sure bet to hold onto the open red Senate seat -- is going to be defeated in a GOP primary that , in effect , hands the Florida Senate seat to a very mediocre Democrat , Kendrick Meek .
The teabaggers , like zombies , cannot be reasoned with .
Rasmussen , for all intents and purposes a subsidiary of the GOP , reported yesterday that 73 % of Republican voters say that Republicans in Congress have lost touch with the base .
Only 15 % ofplanning to vote in 2012 primaries say the GOP members of Congress have done a good job representing Republican values .
And meanwhile , not a single national Republican polls as well as McCain did against Obama in 2012 match - up .
But the commotion in NY - 23 is nothing compared to the level of noise and seemingly mindless chaos that the Republicans have been creating since Obama was elected .
Even before he was sworn in Jon Kyl was threatening to filibuster all his appointments , Rush Limbaugh was leading the right - wing faithful in a national revival meeting predicated on doing everything under the sun to cause Obama to fail , and clowns like Glenn Beck , Lou Dobbs , Sean Hannity and Michael Savage were running along screaming , " me too , me too , " trying to earn ratings points by acting more outrageous than anyone else .
These people have done all they can to turn the public arena into a disgusting , unsavory spectacle that revolts normal people .
Alan Grayson was n't taking much poetic license when he pointed out a few weeks ago that if President Obama had a BLT for lunch , the Republicans would introduce a bill to outlaw bacon and that if he were to achieve world peace they would go into hysterics how he was out to destroy the American armaments industry .
Are their tactics self - defeating ?
We 'll see , of course , but I remember -- and want to share -- a paragraph from Rick Perstein 's marvelous book , Nixonland : The Rise of a President and the Fracturing of America .
Karl
Rove understood very well what " the fracturing of America " meant and how it could be use to prop up the least qualified man to have ever served as president .
Is there someone else in Republican circles today -- like some slimy Republican Party operative / Fox News chief Roger Ailes , for example -- waiting in the shadows to pop out the way Nixon did in 1968 , " miraculously " disposing of Mitt Romney 's front - running father and exploiting the cacophony of a society seeming to be on the verge of falling apart ?
Right now the Republicans and their allies at Hate Talk Radio , at Fox News and among the plutocrats who stand to lose the most from any changes in the status quo are doing their best to recreate that kind of chaotic , anti-social cacophony .
The Republican " big tent " may have shrunk but it now houses a far more focused -- and deadly -- cabal far more committed to grasping the levers of power than to either playing by the rules or doing what 's best for America .
Whatever version of God they worship , they see him as being on their side , making anything and everything a means to a divinely - sanctioned end .

WHEN Kevin Rudd became Australia 's prime minister almost two years ago , many thought they had heard the last loud discords about asylum - seekers landing on Australia 's northern shores .
But a recent increase in numbers of boat people has reignited the issue .
This is straining Mr Rudd 's pledge to soften the former conservative government 's hard edge towards asylum - seekers .
It is also testing Australia 's relations with Indonesia .
In Jakarta this week for the inauguration of Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , Mr Rudd persuaded Indonesia 's president to accept 78 Sri Lankans for processing in the country .
Australian authorities had rescued them from a boat between Sumatra and Christmas Island , an Australian territory .
A week earlier , to oblige Mr Rudd , Indonesia 's navy intercepted a boat with 250 - odd Sri Lankans heading for Australia .
Now moored in West Java , its passengers are refusing to disembark .
Australia has now offered Indonesia more help to deal with boat people .
In 2001 John Howard , Mr Rudd 's predecessor , exploited public anxieties about boat people when he ordered troops to board a Norwegian freighter , the Tampa , to stop it bringing 430 rescued asylum - seekers to Australia .
His Labor government last year ditched other harsh Howard measures .
Mr Rudd 's mantra is “ tough but humane ” .
Now in opposition , Mr Howard 's old political allies are shrilly blaming Mr Rudd for the boats ' reappearance .
A year ago only about 200 people were being held in immigration detention centres .
By early this month there were 1,270 , most on Christmas Island , where boat people are processed .
Yet the rise also coincides with a growth of people fleeing conflicts in Afghanistan and Sri Lanka , which account for almost three - quarters of Australia 's detainees .
And the numbers are tiny compared with the 14,000 “ unlawful non-citizens ” who , authorities say , melted into Australia in 2007 - 08 after arriving by air and overstaying visas .
Nonetheless , Mr Rudd 's approaches to Indonesia have a populist impulse : the fears , long embedded in the Australian psyche , of swarms of arrivals in the country 's north .
An opinion poll this month by the Lowy Institute , a Sydney - based think - tank , found 76 % of people are concerned about asylum seekers coming to Australia by boat .
Relations with Indonesia have rarely been better .
But there is another sensitive issue : Australian police 's recent decision to reopen the case of the “ Balibo Five ” , Australia - based journalists whom Indonesian troops murdered during their invasion of East Timor 34 years ago .
Winning Jakarta 's co-operation on both this , and clamping down on people smugglers may be tricky .
The Bryans were in California in late July for the Los Angeles Open .
They played their first match at night , on the stadium court at U.C.L.A .
They have similar form : fluid ground strokes , one - handed backhands , soft reflexes at the net .
Bob , the lefty , has the most obvious weapons — a bigger serve and a huge forehand , which he hits with a slightly more open stance .
At six - feet - four and 190 pounds , he is about an inch taller than his brother and 10 pounds heavier .
Mike , who is right - handed , takes more balls on the rise , has one of the best returns of serve in doubles and is quicker on his feet and better able to take control of the net .
It ’s not difficult to know what makes a good doubles player — an effective serve , quick hands on the volley , the ability to use the court vertically as well as sideline to sideline .
These qualities are not so rare in pro tennis , and a good doubles team is still vulnerable to any random pairing of two first - tier singles players .
( Or even one , with the right skill set : it used to be said that the best doubles team in the world was John McEnroe and whomever he put on the court next to him .
In the women ’s game , the same was true of Martina Navratilova . )
What ’s remarkable about the Bryans ’ play is the way it integrates not only their strengths but also their weaknesses , mostly through their unique relationship .
Although they have been the most dominant doubles team of the past decade , the Bryans are not unbeatable .
Despite being seeded first this year at Wimbledon , the twins lost in the finals to a bigger - serving team .
Patrick McEnroe calls them the bedrock of the American Davis Cup team ( which he has been captain of since 2001 ) , yet adds , “ They can be vulnerable when they ’re overpowered by talent , by a team with two very good players — even singles players . ”
But teamwork and chemistry usually enable them to trump an opponent ’s raw ability .
Gullikson characterized the Bryans as “ the best team in doubles , once the ball is in play . ”
It begins with court coverage — the fruit of years of playing together and learning the game together — but there ’s more to it than that .
“ Watch how little they talk to each other between points , ” says Justin Gimelstob , a recently retired player who grew up competing against the Bryans and played doubles in 13 U.S. Opens with 13 partners .
“ That ’s more the norm , ” Gimelstob says of his failure to find a consistent teammate .
“ I played doubles with 113 different people in my career .
We had to have a conference before every point . ”
A lot of good doubles teams are , like the Bryans , built on a combination of one right - handed player and one left - hander .
It can throw off an opponent ’s rhythm and keeps both partners from having to look into the sun while serving .
Most teams have the left - hander play the left side of the court and vice versa , allowing the players to cover the doubles alley — the part of the court that is out of bounds during singles matches — with forehands .
But the Bryans use the opposite formation .
They have Bob return serve from the deuce ( or right ) side of the court , and Mike from the ad ( or left ) court .
It leaves them on their natural backhand sides and can put both — particularly Bob — at a disadvantage on the return .
“ At the same time , it lets Bob poach a lot , coming across the middle of the court with his swinging forehand volley , ” David Macpherson , their coach , says .
“ They win a lot of points that way , and they are constantly moving to set that up . ”
The Bryans try to use this maneuver when Mike is serving into the ad court ( on important , uneven - score points like 30 - 15 and 40 - 30 ) and when Mike — the more sure - handed returner — is returning serve .
“ So when Mike hits a low return and makes the other team pop a volley up high , Bob is there , ” says Gene Mayer , a Top 5 A.T.P. player in the 1980s , who won a French Open playing with his brother , Sandy .
The footwork and the shot - making are the stuff of standard doubles , but it helps that the Bryans have seen each other play the same balls countless times and can engineer the point , Mayer says .
A hotly anticipated experiment will test the theory next month that the moon 's permanently shadowed polar craters harbor pockets of water ice .
A NASA spacecraft called the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) will perform a two - stage bombardment of a south polar crater to see what rises up in the ensuing debris plume .
Now , just two weeks before LCROSS 's scheduled barrage , comes a suite of evidence that the moon indeed hosts water .
But the new studies point to a different sort of deposit than the concentrated ice supply LCROSS seeks — they indicate that water exists diffusely across the moon as molecules clinging to the surface in low concentrations .
What is more , there may be a water cycle in which the molecule is broken down and reformulated over the span of a lunar daytime ( about two Earth weeks long ) .
A trio of papers published online this week in Science , each using spectroscopic data collected by a different spacecraft , find light absorptions characteristic of water or hydroxyl ( OH ) molecules or both .
And the papers ' authors say that the scenario in which both molecules appear across the lunar surface is the most plausible explanation for their data .
Water and hydroxyl are related molecular species and have similar spectroscopic signatures — the wavelengths characteristic of each reside nearby in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum .
The three - micron absorption band indicative of water appeared broadly across the lunar surface in spectrometric data taken by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper ( M3 ) , an instrument that circled the moon aboard India 's Chandrayaan 1 spacecraft until the orbiter 's mission ended prematurely last month .
At first , the instrument 's minders were confounded , figuring that something on M3 had gone awry .
" The first reaction that I think all of us had was , this is ridiculous , " says Carle Pieters , a planetary scientist at Brown University and principal investigator for M3 .
The team was finding evidence for water not in permanently shadowed craters but on the sunlit portions of the moon , which just did not add up .
" We spent months going through our data , trying to find what went wrong , " she recalls .
" What is it that gives us this signature that we can't get rid of ? "
Unable to troubleshoot the odd result , Pieters 's group turned to a second , and then a third , independent observation .
Roger Clark , a U.S. Geological Survey spectroscopist on the M3 team , reanalyzed archival data from the Cassini spacecraft , now exploring Saturn and its satellites , taken during a 1999 flyby of the moon .
The Cassini data agreed with the finding that water appears to be widespread across the lunar surface .
Yet more confirmation came from a timely flyby of the Deep Impact probe , en route to a cometary rendezvous in 2010 .
In June the spacecraft swung past the moon , and its spectrometer put the lunar water theory to the test — a test that went swimmingly well .
" In the Deep Impact data , we have very strong evidence that [ water is ] everywhere , " says planetary geologist Jessica Sunshine , a senior research scientist at the University of Maryland , College Park , who works on both the M3 instrument and the Deep Impact mission .
" There is no place on the moon that we do n't see this . "
She notes that the water appears to hug the lunar surface — reaching depths measured in millimeters or even hundreds of microns — and that the local abundance in a typical area appears quite low .
" We 're still talking about amounts of water that are less than the hottest desert you could think of here , " Sunshine says .
Paul Lucey , a planetary scientist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa who wrote a commentary in Science to accompany the three spectroscopic studies , says that he found the results " pretty stunning . "
" I was on vacation when I read the first paper , and I used colorful language when I read it , " Lucey says .
" I was amazed . "
At the same time , he says , it is not certain that the spectra show both water and hydroxyl .
" We see OH or H 2 O , " he says .
" I believe further analysis of the data that now exists will probably allow distinguishing between those two cases . "
On the other hand , Lucey notes , the Deep Impact study " is suggesting that the signature is changing with temperature or time , so that suggests to me that water is more likely , just because OH binds so tightly to minerals and is not going to be very mobile . "
In some places , such as near the equator , where daytime temperatures are high , Deep Impact saw the signal dissipating by the time the sun was directly overhead , returning when cooler temperatures arrived in the lunar evening .
One explanation for that phenomenon is that a stream of charged hydrogen atoms in the solar wind could react with oxygen - bearing lunar minerals to produce water at the surface .
That process would explain the steady , fast - acting replenishment seen in the data after sunlight has dissociated the water molecules .
Sunshine notes that in her view it is not so much a question of whether hydroxyl or water is present but how much each contributes to the spectral signature .
" The water and hydroxyl sort of mix , and it 's more complicated to know what is uniquely water versus uniquely OH , " she says .
" However , we are seeing changes as this water loss happens , and we see changes in the different parts of the absorption feature , so we 're seeing different species coming in and out .
The simplest explanation for that is certainly that you have water being lost .
OH is a much stronger bond ; it 's harder to get rid of . "
Pieters says the data from the three papers , taken together , settle the water question .
" Basically , the bottom line , if you read all three of them , is there is no question that water and hydroxyl exist on the surficial upper layers of the moon , " she says .
So why has this widespread surface phenomenon never been uncovered before , especially given that its discovery relies in part on 10 - year - old data ?
" I think it 's just one of those funny science sociological phenomena that it just did n't occur to take the measurement , " Lucey says .
Sunshine says that the focus on polar traps , such as that sought by LCROSS , tended to dominate the search for water on the lunar surface .
" Everybody tends to think about this in terms of polar ice caps and skating rinks and lakes , and we 're talking about molecules , " she says .
" It 's a real shift in the way people think about water on the moon . "
But Israel draws more dire pictures from the same set of facts .
In classified exchanges with the United States , it has cited evidence that the design effort secretly resumed in 2005 , at the order of Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
American officials say that the evidence is circumstantial , and point out that the Israelis have not produced a copy of the order they say Ayatollah Khamenei gave .
” We ’re all looking at the same set of facts , ” said one senior Israeli intelligence official , who , like others interviewed for this article , asked for anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the intelligence - gathering .
“ We are interpreting them quite differently than the White House does . ”
At the core of the dispute is the “ breakout capacity ” that Mr. Davies referred to on Wednesday in his first presentation as ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations ’ nuclear watchdog .
The phrase refers to a non-nuclear nation ’s ability to acquire enough fuel and expertise to be able to complete building an actual weapon relatively quickly .
The Israelis have argued that there could be little or no warning time  especially if Iran has hidden facilities  and they contended that in the aftermath of Iraq , American intelligence agencies were being far too cautious in assessing Iran ’s capability .
As American and Israeli officials expected , Iran turned over to European nations on Wednesday what it called a new set of “ proposals ” for negotiations over its nuclear program .
American officials said they had not read them , but Susan E. Rice , the American ambassador to the United Nations , said the Iranian response must be “ serious , substantive and constructive ” to meet Mr. Obama ’s test .
The White House has given Iran a late - September deadline to begin substantive negotiations , or face additional sanctions .

Administration officials are debating whether the Iranian leadership , struggling with violent protests , is effectively paralyzed when it comes to negotiating with the West  or for that matter in determining how aggressively to push ahead with its nuclear program .
The White House is hoping its offer to negotiate has thrown Iran ’s leadership off track , and built up credibility around the world if the president begins to press for tougher sanctions .
A group of preschool teachers in Los Angeles was sickened by marijuana this year after unknowingly eating pot brownies purchased from a street vendor by a fellow instructor , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said today .
The incident took place April 7 at an unidentified preschool and was investigated by Los Angeles police , according to the CDC report .
The preschool teacher who brought in the brownies for her colleagues told investigators that she purchased them two days earlier from a street vendor who claimed to be selling them as a church fundraiser .
The unlabeled brownies cost $ 1.50 each and came individually in plastic wrap .
The teacher did not consume any of them but said her adult son had eaten some before her bringing them to the school .
Five teachers ate one brownie each ; a sixth teacher took a bite but promptly spit it out , “ complaining of an unusual taste , ” the CDC report said .
The brownies were left in a break room .
About half an hour after one of the teachers ate the brownie , the CDC report said , the preschool director and the administrator observed one instructor becoming sleepy and dizzy and suffering shortness of breath , with tingling and numbness in her face , forehead and arms .
Suspicion immediately fell on the brownie .
The House Democratic leadership is meeting this morning to determine what version of the public option goes into the House bill -- negotiated rates or the stronger Medicare Plus 5 formula .
The most recent reports are that they are only 12 - 15 votes away from the strongest version of the bill , the Medicare Plus 5 version that ties public option rates to Medicare reimbursement rates .
Having the strongest possible House bill going in to conference with the Senate is critical , and it 's within reach .
Chris has whittled down the list of those leaning yes , the undecided , and those leaning no .
Obviously the key targets are those in the first two categories .

The sweet - toothed boy stole the money from his parents ' drawer
An eight - year - old German boy who stole his parents ' savings to go on a confectionary binge has been turned over to police in a sweet shop .
When he tried to buy 15 euros ( £ 14 ) of treats in the western town of Viersen , he was asked if he had enough money .
The shop owner 's suspicions were aroused by the sweet - toothed boy 's 1,680 - euro wad of bills and instead of a sugar rush , he got the bum 's rush .
The police were called and the boy 's parents came to collect him .
He had taken the cash - which was being saved for house repairs - from their drawer , police said .
This week the world 's first torrent hosting service was born .
Named Torrage , the sole purpose of the site is to provide a platform where both individual users and large torrent indexers can host their torrents .
It is currently in use by EZTV as well as the former BitTorrent giant Suprnova and the makers hope that others will follow .
A few weeks ago the Pirate Bay crew hinted that ‘ others ’ were working on a new torrent hosting service that will host torrents for other torrent sites , without providing a search function .
Together with open tracker initiatives like OpenBitTorrent , torrent storage services such as Torrage could provide the building blocks for many new torrent index sites .
This week the idea became reality with the launch of Torrage , which is already in use by some of BitTorrent ’s most reputable sources .
The site , which also allows individual users to store torrents online , is hosting hundreds of thousands of torrents already .
It is currently in use by Suprnova and the new and improved EZTV site .
To get started , Torrage has an API and some example code available for torrent sites owners .
Once the torrent files are uploaded they can be accessed through a url that is based on the info_hash value of the torrent .
“ You can not search or list torrent files that are stored here , you can only access them if you already know the info_hash value of the torrent you want to download , ” the Torrage site explains .
TorrentFreak spoke to several torrent site owners who all agreed that it is a welcome addition to the range of tools they have available now , and we can expect to see more sites with Torrage powered download links in the near future .
Without having to operate a tracker and store the .torrent files , maintaining a torrent site will be less complicated and much cheaper .
This aside , some might argue that this decentralized setup will reduce the legal liability for site owners since their part in the BitTorrent chain has been significantly reduced .
Whether the various copyright holders and anti-piracy watchdogs such as BREIN , IFPI and the MPAA will agree with this assessment remains to be seen .
Regardless of what they think , Torrage is a service that has the potential to help out many torrent sites , old and new .
Most safe abortions are carried out using vacuum aspiration Restricting the availability of legal abortion does not appear to reduce the number of women trying to end unwanted pregnancies , a major report suggests .
The Guttmacher Institute 's survey found abortion occurs at roughly equal rates in regions where it is legal and regions where it is highly restricted .
It did note that improved access to contraception had cut the overall abortion rate over the last decade .
But unsafe abortions , primarily illegal , have remained almost static .
The survey of 197 countries carried out by the Guttmacher Institute - a pro-choice reproductive think tank - found there were 41.6 m abortions in 2003 , compared with 45.5 in 1995 - a drop which occurred despite population increases .
Nineteen countries had liberalised their abortion laws over the 10 years studied , compared with tighter restrictions in just three .
But despite the general trend towards liberalisation , some 40 % of the world 's women live amid tight restrictions .
On some continents this is particularly pronounced : well over 90 % of women in South America and Africa live in areas with strict abortion laws , proportions which have barely shifted in a decade .
Researchers also noted that while liberalisation was a key element in improving women 's access to safer terminations , it was far from the only factor .
Even in countries where abortion is legal , lack of availability and cost may prove major obstacles .
In India for example , where terminations are legally allowed for a variety of reasons , some 6 m take place outside the health service .
The costs of unsafe abortions , which can include inserting pouches containing arsenic to back street surgery , can be high : the healthcare bill to deal with conditions from sepsis to organ failure can be four times what it costs to provide family planning services .
COUNTRIES WHERE ABORTION HAS BEEN RESTRICTED 1997 : Poland re-instated law outlawing abortion except when mother 's life at risk or she had been raped 1998 : El Salvador outlaws all abortions even when mother 's life at risk 2006 : Nicaragua similarly eliminates all grounds for legal abortion Every year , an estimated 70,000 women die as a result of unsafe abortions - leaving nearly a quarter of a million children without a mother - and 5 m develop complications .
In the developed world , legal restrictions did not stop abortion but just meant it was " exported " , with Irish women for instance simply travelling to other parts of Europe , according to Guttmacher 's director , Dr Sharon Camp .
In the developing world , it meant lives were put at risk .
" Too many women are maimed or killed each year because they lack legal abortion access , " she said .
" The gains we 've seen are modest in relation to what we can achieve .
Investing in family planning is essential - far too many women lack access to contraception , putting them at risk . "
Double Dutch Western Europe is held up as an example of what access to contraceptive services can achieve , and the Netherlands - with just 10 abortions per 1,000 women compared to the world 's 29 per 1,000 - is held up as the gold standard .
Ensuring women have the means to end their pregnancies is not liberating them
Josephine Quintavalle
Comment on Reproductive Ethics
Here , young people report using two forms of contraception as standard .
Even the UK , which has a relatively high rate , fares well in comparison to the US , where the number of abortions is among the highest in the developed world .
The institute says this rate is in part explained by inconsistencies in insurance coverage of contraceptive supplies .
In much of eastern Europe , where abortion was treated as a form of birth control , abortion rates have dropped by 50 % in the past decade as contraceptives have become more widely available .
And globally , the number of married women of childbearing age with access to contraception has increased from 54 % in 1990 to 63 % in 2003 , with gains also seen among single , sexually active women .
But there were still significant unmet contraception needs , and a lack of interest among pharmaceutical companies in developing new forms of birth control that provide top protection on demand , the institute said .
Josephine Quintavalle of the anti-abortion Comment on Reproductive Ethics said stopping women falling pregnant in the first place was an area where minds could meet .
" Abortion - back street or front street - is not the answer .
Ensuring women have the means to end their pregnancies is not liberating them - they should be able to make real choices before they fall pregnant in the first place , " she said .
" But that should n't necessarily mean taking pills every day .
There will always be problems with access and cost , particularly in countries where people struggle just to buy food .
" What we need is to better understand our fertility - if there are just 24 fertile hours in a month , we need to work out a cheap , effective way for women to know when they can fall pregnant .
That would be freedom , and that 's what we should aim for . "

It ’s About Nutritious Water , Not Just Water Coolers Manchester !
Water is so freely abundant in our lives , it ’s easy to see why some people take it and water coolers for granted .
But to Waterboy , water and water coolers are very precious .
And because we drink water for our health and well being , Waterboy believe it should be treated with the utmost respect it deserves by handling it carefully from the moment it leaves the ground till you pour out a drink from one of its water coolers .
Scientists believe that natural spring water is really beneficial to human life because the minerals it contains are more readily absorbed by our bodies when compared with the absorption of minerals from food .
You see , natural spring water is full of minerals that our bodies need and drinking it is a fantastic way to get the fluid we need for good hydration and essential nutrients at the same time .
Researchers also claim that natural spring water helps prevent nutrition deficiencies and breaks waste products down to rid toxins from the body to make our immune systems more effective .
That is why Waterboy treat the water you drink and the water cooler it is dispensed from with the utmost care .
It ’s the reason that Manchester clients trust us .

Political and business leaders may agree in principle that climate change is a serious threat , but there is a startling lack of consensus and a ‘ you - go - first ’ attitude on taking action , even amongst a small group of high - level decision makers disconnected from their cell phones here in the Arctic .
“ We want to reduce China ’s CO2 ( carbon dioxide ) emissions , but we are a market - driven economy , ” Liu Yanhua , China ’s vice minister for science and technology , told 30 participants at the Ny - Ålesund Symposium located at a scientific research centre called Kings Bay on the western coast of Spitsbergen Island about 1,200 kilometers from the North Pole .
“ Climate change is a matter of economy , of energy , ” said Yanhua , a former scientist at the Chinese Institute of Geography .
It is also an issue of generational equity , since at current rates all fossil fuels will be consumed in 50 to 80 years , leaving nothing for future generations , he said .
China ’s CO2 emissions have soared 150 percent in the last 20 years , Yanhua acknowledged , and are now the highest of any country , including the United States .
China ’s carbon intensity – the amount of carbon emitted per unit of production – is 10 times higher than Germany ’s and major efficiency improvements are needed , he said .
In 2005 , China set a target of 20 percent improvement in energy efficiency by 2010 .
Inefficient operations were shut down and major investments in energy efficiency have been made .
“ We do n’t give companies money we give them experts and scientists to solve their energy problems , ” Yanhua said .
In another effort , China subsidises the cost of buying costly hybrid vehicles and more efficient refrigerators to help reduce the country ’s energy burden .
However , while keen on energy efficiency , China has little interest in agreeing to put a cap on its emissions at the final round of international climate negotiations later this year in Copenhagen .
At the conclusion of preliminary meetings last week in Bonn , Germany , Chinese officials announced they would never agree to a mandatory cap because their economy needs to grow .

Claudio Katz .
Claudio Katz interviewed by Fernando Arellano Ortiz .
Translated by John Mage for IIRE .
July 10 , 2009 --
The exit from the systemic crisis of capitalism needs to be political and " a socialist project can mature in this turbulence " .
So says the Argentine economist , philosopher and sociologist Claudio Katz , who also warns that the " global economic situation is very serious and is going to have to hit bottom , and now we are but in the first moment of crisis " .
Katz , a prominent professor at the University of Buenos Aires in the areas of economics , philosophy and sociology , is both a human rights activist and researcher with the National Council of Scientific and Technical Research ( CONICET ) of Argentina .
Author of numerous texts interpreting contemporary capitalism , he has focused his studies on the regressive impact of neoliberalism in Latin America .
He participates actively in continent - wide forums that challenge foreign debt .
His book The Future of Socialism won an honourable mention award in the Venezuelan 2005 Libertador Prize for Critical Thought .
He is also a member of the international collective Economists of the Left ( EDI ) and currently serves as an external advisor to the Venezuelan government .
We met in one of the cozy cafes of Buenos Aires , and Professor Katz spoke about the global economic reality , the political process in Latin America , the threat of an eruption of the right in the region , and what he called " the great media inquisition " referring to the manipulation of information and communication by the giant media conglomerates .
Fernando Arellano Ortiz : Economic theorists have argued that capitalism 's current crisis is systemic and not cyclical , but what is striking is that no solution has been proposed to implement a new model or an alternative capable of replacing the capitalist system .
Do you think that finding a solution to this crisis is more of a political than an economic problem ?
Claudio Katz : I think that the big problem is definitely political , because all major economic crises to date have been resolved positively or negatively along political paths , depending on whether or not popular majorities were involved in the process .
This is a very deep crisis that neo-liberals have tried to minimise by blaming " greed " , in that way veiling financial speculation .
Also , heterodox economists present the crisis as a failure of regulation .
But this is a crisis of the system , a crisis of capitalism .
And it seems to me that it is a crisis of the capitalist model of the last 20 or 25 years , the neoliberal model , whose consequences we are seeing now .
We had two , three decades of the complete neoliberal program : privatisations , deregulation , expansion of the scope of transnational corporations to the former Soviet Union , China , to the whole planet .
And now we see the consequences of this expansion of capital , overproduction , overaccumulation , and the resulting poverty , misery and unemployment -- which the International labour Organization has predicted shall be very burdensome in the coming years .
So it seems to me we are in the first moment of the crisis , the beginning of the crisis , the debut .
You mean we 're going to have to hit bottom ?
Yes , we 're going to have to hit bottom , and especially the people of Europe and the United States , who are not accustomed -- unlike the Latin Americans -- to such economic disasters .
They will have to process this and it will take a while .
Recall that the latter decades of neoliberalism have weakened trade unions in developed countries , politically and ideologically weakened the left -- the progressive forces in Europe and the United States -- and they will have to reconstruct the experience of social mobilisation .
We are beginning to see this , more in Europe than in the United States .
In France , in Greece , in countries where there have been popular mobilisations , their political climate is already changing .
But we are going to have several years of unemployment , poverty , and social exclusion , and we will have to see how people react .
What is your vision of the socioeconomic and political process that is taking place in Latin America ?
I think the process is different from that in the United States and Europe , and that is especially so because , first , we have already experienced this kind of crisis , not in the 1930s , but in the 1980s and 1990s : this type of financial debacle led to the explosion of poverty , as we have seen in Argentina , Bolivia , Venezuela , Ecuador .
Then , there is already a certain experience of people with this type of neoliberal social disaster .
At the same time , probably -- it is not certain but it is probable -- the economic impact of the crisis wo n't be as serious as in the developed countries .
Because we have lived through a crash that was quite similar , because the banks were recapitalised and now have portfolios that are a little cleaner , the process will probably not be so traumatic .
But in Latin America it is our political experience that is most important .
It seems to me that what is interesting about our region is that there was resistance to neoliberalism and the resistance moreover had results .
We had uprisings in many countries and have new governments -- Bolivia , Venezuela , Ecuador -- which have changed the agenda of Latin American societies .
In this sense , I believe that the nationalist , radical and progressive governments of Venezuela , Ecuador and Bolivia are quite different from those like Lula 's in [ Brazil ] , or Kirchner 's [ in Argentina ] , which in the final analysis merely restore the dominant power .
Is it not a fact then that in Latin America the appearance of such governments is a symptom of the reconfiguration of the political subject ?
Yes .
But there are symptoms , and there are symptoms .
One symptom is that which leads Venezuela to take control over their national resources and decide on nationalisations , measures of income redistribution , regional integration promoting the principles of ALBA , the principles of equitable trade .
And another type is very different : MERCOSUR , UNASUR , policies that restructure in the interests of the giant economic groups dominant in Latin America rather than the genuine interests of popular majorities .
The case of Argentina now is that there have been major changes and transformations , but the distribution of income remains as regressive as , or more regressive than , in the 1990s .
The changes that really interest the people are those that improve the living standards of the population and reduce inequality .
And this popular improvement and reduction in inequality is only beginning be seen in some Latin American countries , not across the region .
Slap in the face of neoliberalism
What do you think about the nationalisations the Chávez government is carrying out in Venezuela ?
First , I think they are very promising because it puts an end to the idea that things can be only privatised .
It 's like a slap in the face of neoliberalism .
It is the complete reversal of the neoliberal principles that demand that the country 's vast natural resources be managed by private groups .
I think what is interesting is the fact that Chávez promised nationalisations and fulfilled the promise .
Overall in Latin America we are accustomed to having something promised and then not done .
And then I think it is a necessity for a country like Venezuela , because it is a country that lacks even a minimally integrated industrial structure .
It totally lacks an industry in the sense that we can talk about in Brazil , Mexico or Argentina .
Venezuela is a mid-level country , but based on oil wealth and with a rentier culture derived from the exploitation of that wealth .
And the only change possible in a society like that of Venezuela is industrial development done by the state , or not done at all .
The Venezuelan bourgeoisie did not do it in the past and will not do it in the future .
It is a social group that has always lived on the oil revenues , a true parasite , one that is always given to capital flight , waste , consumption , Miami lifestyle , lack of investment , so there could be an industrialisation process only if the state takes the reins .
The only danger I see is the cost , how much is paid in compensation to the owners of the nationalised companies , because therein lies a very complicated equation .
If oil prices remain high , then you can handle it .
But if in the coming years oil prices begin to decline , as they have been declining over the past year , it seems to me that the use of the resources of the treasury in compensation to these companies can become problematic , considering that popular management , which Chávez calls workers ' control , can be put into practice , nationalising without state ownership .
I see a problem there , but the process seems very promising .
Is Argentina going in the same direction as Chavez in Venezuela ?
No .
The government of Cristina Kirchner has adopted some measures of nationalisation , for instance , pension funds , which had been privatised and were again taken into state hands , and a set of small companies also went into the orbit of the state .
But first , they are not strategic enterprises , this is the first key difference with Venezuela .
Not only are these non-strategic businesses , but the most striking thing is that , when a nationalisation in Venezuela has a direct impact on Argentina , such as the nationalisation of the Argentinean firm Techint , Kirchner 's government has come to support the claims and criticisms made by the business groups after the nationalisation .
Battle against the right
Do you think that the political process in Latin America shall continue forward , given the experience of so - called progressive governments , or that , as Fidel Castro said , a counter - offensive of the right may erupt ?
I think the right is taking the offensive .
And this is seen in the existing international media campaign against Chávez , against Ecuador 's Correa , and in the attempt to re-elect Uribe in Colombia , in the attempt to move Chile to the right with Piñera , what you see in Peru with the government of Alan García , in Mexico with Calderón , and Panama with the recent victory of Martinelli .
That is , the right wing in Latin America retreated a bit , but it still has its strongholds .
The main stronghold , no doubt , is Uribe in Colombia and Calderón in Mexico , and this is maintained .
There is a significant pressure on Argentina , which we saw in the conflict in the countryside last year , to resume the right - wing offensive .
But I would say that the main objectives of the right were not achieved .
The right last year sought to overthrow the government of Evo Morales through a coup and failed , and failed in the attempted secession of the provinces of eastern Bolivia , and also failed in the attempt to defeat electorally both Chávez in Venezuela and Correa in Ecuador .
That is , in the three countries where the political process has advanced furthest , the right has failed to rebuild their power .
In other places the situation is gray .
The right won in Panama but lost in El Salvador , where the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front won the election .
It is a balance , but I think you have to avoid the impression , the idea , that the right is coming back .
We are almost at the start of the bicentenary of the emancipation of Latin America .
In this bicentennial might we see Spain enthroned again in the hemisphere ?
No , I think the moment when Spain was again enthroned here was the fifth centenary of the discovery in 1992 .
At that time , in the 1990s , Spain deployed its investments in the region , buying oil and telecommunications , making powerful inroads .
In contrast , in the past year we have seen the reverse , because the crisis is hitting Spain more severely than any other country with interests outside Europe .
Unemployment and public debt in Spain are at record levels , and the economic , industrial and financial crisis is probably among the most serious in Europe .
I think this is going to greatly affect Spanish investments in Latin America in the medium term .
We are approaching our bicentenary at a time when a crisis of North American domination is very evident throughout the region -- a crisis of domination in South America , and a policy of closer ties in Central America .
It is as if the continent has been divided into two parts .
The United States reinforced its dominance , its control , over Mexico , the Caribbean , Central America , Colombia , Peru , but lost its ability to influence the southern cone .
Do not forget that in the past year the US ambassadors to Venezuela and Bolivia were expelled , and both countries were for twelve months without the heads of diplomatic missions in Washington .
Then , at the meeting in Trinidad and Tobago , one saw an Obama policy of trying to return to the Clinton format , a more diplomatic policy .
And this makes visible the real difficulties the United States has from its economic crisis and the military quagmire it faces in the Middle East .
Immanuel Wallerstein speaks of the decline of the United States as an empire ...
I 'm rather averse to the idea of the inexorable decline of the US empire .
It can decline and it can restore itself .
It has recovered many times .
I think it is like a philosophy of inevitable victory .
It seems to me to be a story of the predestined succession of ascending and descending powers .
I do not believe the cycle of contemporary history is marked by inevitability .
I think that different outcomes are possible .
Paradox of capitalism
Given that the United States is weak on the global stage , does it still have many years to continue to govern as the great global hegemon ?
The United States is the military power of the whole world .
And it is the protector of all the capitalists in the world .
There is no capitalist country that is willing to , or has the ability to , replace the Pentagon in control of hundreds of military bases around the world .
The United States has NATO , and Europe and Japan both depend on NATO .
The United States maintains military supremacy , and that is the great instrument of domination which persists .
In economic and financial affairs , the thing is more complex because , paradoxically , the United States is the centre of the current crisis , but the refuge of all the capitalists in the world is the US dollar .
Thus there is a paradox : the most threatened country is the refuge , while at the same time the United States remains the country seeking to replenish the IMF while imposing global monetary policy through the US Federal Reserve .
We must separate the conjunctural from the medium term .
The United States is in a very acute crisis , but it still holds the key resources of global geopolitics .
One sees an ability to influence Latin America by the Spanish right through the FAES Foundation of José María Aznar , the fascist Popular Party , and their spokespeople in the region such as Vargas Llosa , Enrique Krause , Mariano Grondona , Jorge Castañeda .
Can the intervention of these types cause some disturbance for the progressive governments ?
I would say that the Latin American right is more disruptive than the Spanish .
The Latin American right is more than reactionary and conservative enough , and it has sufficient reserves and resources such as Mariano Grondona , Piñera , Vargas Llosa and the heirs of Octavio Paz .
The Latin American cultural neo-conservative right has ruled the region for decades , nourished the military governments and has an elitist , liberal , europensante [ accepting European opinion as the only possible truth ] , Eurocentric worldview .
The `great media inquisition '
And they have the ability to manipulate the media ...
Sure , that is the new thing .
They ruled historically through the church , their wealth , their schools , and now they have the means of communication under their control and exercise a despotic influence over them .
The media today is what the Catholic Church was ?
They are the great inquisition and exert an evil influence .
That 's why Chávez 's decision to remove the licence of RCTV seems to me so healthy and transformative .
I believe that this measure is far more important than any nationalisation of a steel company .
But with that answer the right in countries like Colombia , Peru or Mexico is going to say that Claudio Katz is a totalitarian type .
How do you respond ?
They say that because for them a monopolistic group controlling the means of communication is an example of democracy .
This is absolute hypocrisy .
The owners of the media are a handful of people , a tiny group that is not responsible .
It is a paradox : a parliamentarian must be elected , any president , mayor and governor , as well , but the media , which has a power much stronger and substantial than all the elected officials of any country , no one chooses their owners , they are the pure power of the divine .
They say they compete with each other through changing channels , but the choice is minuscule .
That is , the viewer can choose between CNN and Globovision , but this is not a real option .
How can the media in Latin America be democratised ?
Just as any institution can be democratised .
There need not be some special thing about the media compared to any other institution .
We must democratise political life , schools , institutions , armed forces , society , everything .
This is a daily concern , to end discrimination of gender , race , ethnicity .
In Latin America we are changing the constitutions of many countries to include new rights , to incorporate the neglected rights of Indigenous people , youth , children .
That is to say , the development of society is the extension of rights .
The only right that we cannot talk about is the right to communicate .
It wants to be untouched .
The Brazilian political analyst Emir Sader said that , for the media to be democratised , it must necessarily be nationalised .
Do you agree ?
I think you have to have public ownership , but control of what is seen and said cannot be operated directly by a government because that would lead to totalitarian ways .
There are many experiences in the past 50 or 60 years of public institutions that are independent of government .
The case of the BBC in London is often mentioned .
I have not studied it , I cannot say , but I know that there is , for example , a lot of experience where the key thing is a governing statutory scheme that prevents government manipulation .
We cannot move from media manipulation by capitalist groups to media manipulation by the government .
There must be freedom of information , but also public property .
I believe that the mechanisms of democratic ownership of the media must be discussed .
Do you have the feeling that Latin America is undergoing a process of political reconfiguration ?
I have the feeling that it is a long - term process and will face significant obstacles .
It will not be linear .
And we are coming to a point where our battle against the right will be very hard , the right of Uribe , Calderón and Alan García , of the right - wing military .
The United States maintains its military bases .
We cannot get carried away with the image of Obama as transforming the US relationship with the region .
The Southern Command bases remain intact with a structure of military control across the region , even minimal measures such as closing Guantanamo are not implemented , the embargo on Cuba remains unchanged .
That is to say , the major problems of political sovereignty in our region in the bicentennial are all still on the agenda .
Colombia , a militarised society
How do you analyse Colombia in respect to its internal conflict and the direct impact on the economy of that country ?
The worst thing about Colombia is that this hideous expenditure , this waste of funds on military spending , is not to defend national sovereignty , not a need to defend the country 's borders against external aggression , which is the only real justification a nation can have to devote such resources to the war effort .
Only if the country 's sovereignty and the lives of its citizens are threatened is this justified .
Colombia is on the eve of the formation of a militarised society to serve the interests of the dominant groups that control the wealth of that country .
I believe there is a tendency toward militarisation in Latin America , evident not only in Colombia but also in Brazil , where a high percentage of the budget is devoted to military spending , to manufacturing submarines , where agreements are signed with France for extremely large investments in the military sector , and at present its military forces are occupying Haiti .
We must take care to criticise the Pentagon , imperialism , the North Americans , but also the military spending in the region that does n't serve the people 's purposes .
We must be very attentive to that and remain vigilant .
But , for countries that produce weapons , that is an excellent business ...
They live on that .
War is a necessity of imperialism , a structural necessity , not an option .
If weapons are manufactured , they have to be used .
There is a group of contractors who live directly off this .
The United States and all its military partners : Israel , Colombia , Egypt , Australia .
For the United States it is the need to maintain its military supremacy as a permanent warning to other countries like China , in the sense of a demand to stay quiet , do not dare to challenge .
There is a reproduction of wars and a tendency to endless war , an unequal war , as a permanent form of exercise of supremacy , warning the rest of the world that no one dare defy the imperialist power .
We must fight against that .
Finally , do you discount the possibility that in this process we will end up with , if not a world war , a series of peripheral conflicts as a strategy to overcome the current systemic crisis of capitalism ?
Yes , it is possible .
But there is one major difference from the 1930s and it is that war is not between powers of the kind such as France against Germany , the United States against Japan .
There is a collective associated imperialism that makes war against peripheral fronts and makes war as a warning to peripheral countries that threaten to rise up .
It seems to me we are going to have many conflicts because imperialism needs them , with or without financial crisis .
The United States finished devastating Iraq , is now preparing to devastate Afghanistan , and is permanently warning Iran of a possible invasion , as it is doing with North Korea .
The crisis accentuated this tendency to war , because it is in the nature of the system , and for this reason the alternatives are so important , such as the World Social Forum , and all the anti-war coalitions around the world .
Various small collectives have arisen and emerged in Europe and in Latin America to resist war , and I think they are going to continue to develop .

Objecting to ' Gag Order ' on Insurers , Republicans Threaten to Delay HHS Confirmations
By David S. Hilzenrath
Senate Republicans said they will delay confirmation of Obama administration nominees to the Department of Health and Human Services unless HHS lifts what Republicans are calling a " gag order " on insurers .
Insurers serving people on Medicare " should not be threatened with punishment if they speak out on a matter of public concern simply because the administration disagrees with their position , " Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other top Senate Republicans said in a letter Thursday to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .
The dispute began when the big insurer Humana , which manages health plans for Medicare beneficiaries , sent a letter to health plan members saying that reform proposals under consideration by Congress could cause " millions of seniors and disabled individuals " to lose " important benefits and services . "
Humana urged its plan members to contact their elected representatives .
HHS accused Humana and other insurers of misleading Medicare beneficiaries .
It ordered them to stop and said they could face enforcement action for violating restrictions on communications between Medicare health plans and their members .
The contretemps is the latest in a series of side - issues to engulf the debate over health care policy .
An HHS spokesman reiterated the department 's position Thursday night .
" Our Department is committed to protecting Medicare beneficiaries and ensuring that their personal information is not used inappropriately .
Seniors on Medicare should not be subjected to misleading information about their Medicare benefits , " spokesman Nicholas Papas said in a statement .
" We have serious concerns that certain communications from a major insurance company violated CMS regulations and our investigation will continue . "
Several top department positions remain unfilled and could be affected by the Republicans ' threat to use parliamentary procedures to delay confirmation votes .
Those positions include the assistant secretary for public affairs , the surgeon general , and the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services .
The communications in dispute involve so - called Medicare Advantage plans paid by the government to provide care for Medicare beneficiaries who choose to enroll in them as an alternative to traditional fee - for - service Medicare .
The private plans can impose tighter restrictions on members ' care while offering extra benefits .
Democratic health care legislation would reduce funding for Medicare Advantage plans , which the administration and others say are overpaid .
Insurers say the funding cuts would lead to reduced benefits .
Republicans said HHS 's actions were at odds with guidance it issued in 1997 on communications between Medicare HMOs and their members .
" While it may be difficult for a reviewer to ascertain whether or not the information about legislation ... is accurate and without slant or unrevealed self - interest , we believe that prohibiting such information would violate basic freedom of speech and other constitutional rights of the Medicare beneficiary as a citizen , " Bruce Merlin Fried , director of HHS 's Center for Health Plans and Providers , wrote in 1997 .
The 12 - year - old memo predates changes in the regulation of Medicare health plans , " and we are in the process of evaluating those changes in this context , " HHS spokesman Papas said .
The department is not aware of any insurers other than Humana spreading misleading information to their Medicare beneficiaries , Papas said .

At a time when Americans receive far more diagnostic radiation than ever before , two cases under scrutiny in California  one involving a large , well - known Los Angeles hospital , the other a tiny hospital in the northern part of the state  underscore the risks that powerful CT scans pose when used incorrectly .
A week ago , Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles disclosed that it had mistakenly administered up to eight times the normal radiation dose to 206 possible stroke victims over an 18 - month period during a procedure intended to get clearer images of the brain .
State and federal health officials are investigating the cause .
Hundreds of miles north at Mad River Community Hospital in Arcata , the other case  involving a 2 ½- year - old boy complaining of neck pain after falling off his bed  has led to the revocation of an X - ray technician ’s state license for subjecting the child to more than an hour of CT scans .
The procedure normally takes two or three minutes .
The hospital ’s radiology manager at the time , Bruce Fleck , called the overdose a “ rogue act of insanity . ”
Robert Schlag , chief of the state ’s division of Food , Drug and Radiation Safety , said it was “ one of the more egregious , extreme cases that I have ever seen . ”
Microsoft tried to auction off some patents that they claim relate to Linux .
Patent trolls could have bought them .
Instead Open Invention Network ( OIN ) got them .
Why would Microsoft wish to get rid of 22 patents that it presumably could sue Linux over ?
Let 's try to imagine what might have happened .
Let 's pretend you are Microsoft , and you want to be evil .
Of course , Microsoft never would be .
They are internationally known for fair dealing with all their competition , particularly Linux .
But let 's pretend .
Update :
It 's actually worse than I imagined .
See update at the end of the article , the account from Red Hat .
OK .
So you are Evil Microsoft and you decide it's too difficult and dangerous to sue Linux yourself .
Antitrust annoyances , counterclaims , and PR and all that .
What to do with that patent portfolio to really cause trouble for Linux , without having your fingerprints all over it ?
Eureka !
You could sell the patents to patent trolls , and let * them * be the bad guys .
Is that not perfect if you are evil ?
Not that Microsoft would ever be evil .
We all know there is a New Microsoft in the land .
But in our imagination , let 's say that because that is your wicked plan as Microsoft Evil , you set up an auction without offering OIN or any Linux players a chance to bid .
You only invite folks who do n't have a product to sell , only entities that collect patents , or what is known as " non-practicing entities " a/k / a patent trolls , who are immune from counterclaims against their products , because they do n't have any .
Would that not have been the perfection of evil ?
You are positively drooling .
And who'd ever know it was evil you who was really behind it ?
Wait !!
Over the hill you see ... no , it ca n't be !
Here comes Allied Security Trust , or AST , riding in on a white horse and scooping up the patents you tied to the railroad tracks , and then selling them to OIN , whose very purpose in existing is to protect Linux !
Linux is saved !
Curses , you cry out !
Foiled again !
Would that not be a wonderful imaginary tale ?
And here is the first paragraph of the press release from OIN , which will enable you to decide how far off my wild imagination really is : Open Invention Network ( OIN ) , a collaborative enterprise that enables innovation in open source , today announced the acquisition of 22 Linux - focused patents that were marketed and sold by Microsoft .
The patents were recently purchased by Allied Security Trust ( AST ) from Microsoft to ensure the patents did not fall into the hands of non-practicing entities ( more information on non-practicing entities is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll, among other sites ) that could seek to assert the patents against Linux products .
OIN subsequently acquired the Microsoft patents from AST .
Update : More details from CNET 's Ina Fried , including a statement from Microsoft .
They meant to do it :
In an interview , [ OIN's ]
Bergelt said that his organization was not invited by Microsoft to directly participate in the bidding for the patents , raising the specter that Microsoft was more interested in selling to someone that might have targeted Linux as opposed to just maximizing the sales price for the patents .
" We were not offered an opportunity to participate in the bidding for this portfolio that Microsoft was selling , " Bergelt said .
For its part , Microsoft confirmed that it sold the patents to AST in July , but declined to comment on the terms of the deal .
Microsoft said that the patents were indeed ones that it had acquired several years ago in a deal with SGI .
" These patents were deemed to be non-core to our business and non-essential for our IP portfolio , " Microsoft spokesman Michael Marinello said in a statement .
: D Update : Red Hat has now published an account .
It is even worse than I imagined -- Microsoft also offered suggestions to the patent trolls on how to use the patents against Linux -- EU Commission , DOJ , are you watching ?
If the patents were non-core and not important to anyone , as some apologists have suggested , how do they explain the suggestions on how to use them against Linux ?
It 's a rhetorical question .
There is no valid answer .
Here 's the Red Hat material : Microsoft and Patent Trolls September 9th , 2009
by Red Hat The Open Invention Network ( OIN ) learned recently that Microsoft was planning to auction off some of its software patents , which we understand it marketed to trolls and some other non-practicing entities .
It also used marketing materials that highlighted offensive uses of the patents against open source software , including a number of the most popular open source packages .
This looked to us like a classic FUD effort .
To unleash FUD , you assemble a lot of patents of uncertain value , annotate them with a roadmap for the companies and products to be targeted with the patents , put the lot in the hands of trolls schooled in patent aggression , and then stand back and wait for the FUD to spread with its chilling effect .
Fortunately , OIN ( through the helpful assistance of Allied Security Trust ) managed to obtain this lot of 22 patents .
And as part of OINs portfolio , they will not be used to cause FUD regarding open source software .
Microsoft has recently sent signals that it wishes to be considered FOSS friendly , including contributing code to the Linux kernel .
And we have applauded these efforts .
But its true colors seem in question .
It sued Tom - Tom using questionable patents that targeted Linux and has sought to use the alleged strength of its public patents to twist the arms of its clients and partners under the cloak of a confidentiality agreement - imposed secrecy blanket .
This latest attempt to encourage patent aggression by trolls against FOSS further shows that Microsoft is not yet committed to the path of peace with the open source software community and appears intent on inappropriately preserving and extending its dominant market positions in the operating system and personal productivity suites .
I never applauded Microsoft 's efforts , personally .
I have consistently written that there is no new Microsoft .
And that they need to be treated in harmony with their actions , not their words .
They hate FOSS , and they show it .
They will kill it , if you relax and let them .
Now they showed it in such bold relief that there can be no further pretense .
They are what they are .
And hating their methods is not a disease .
It 's the reality principle .
I want to thank AST and OIN , and all their members , including Red Hat , for being realistic about Microsoft , because thinking clearly and acting with skill , factoring in what Microsoft * really * does , is the key to such bold and creatively successful action .
Thank you .
The Linux Foundation has now issued a statement calling on Microsoft to stop secretly attacking Linux .
I 'm sure they 'll do that , asap : " The reality is that Windows and Linux will both remain critical parts of the world 's computing infrastructure for years to come , " he wrote .
" Those customers , who have the ear of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer , need to tell Microsoft that they do not want Microsoft 's patent tricks to interfere with their production infrastructure .
It 's time for Microsoft to stop secretly attacking Linux while publicly claiming to want interoperability .
Let 's hope that Microsoft decides going forward to actually try to win in the marketplace , rather than continuing to distract and annoy us with their tricky patent schemes . "
Here 's the complete OIN press release : ******************************
September 8 , 2009 ; 4:00 p.m. EST Open Invention Network Acquires Linux - Focused Patents Marketed by Microsoft Purchase of Microsoft Patents Safeguards Linux Community Durham , NC ( September 8 , 2009 ) - Open Invention Network ( OIN ) , a collaborative enterprise that enables innovation in open source , today announced the acquisition of 22 Linux - focused patents that were marketed and sold by Microsoft .
The patents were recently purchased by Allied Security Trust ( AST ) from Microsoft to ensure the patents did not fall into the hands of non-practicing entities ( more information on non-practicing entities is available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll, among other sites ) that could seek to assert the patents against Linux products .
OIN subsequently acquired the Microsoft patents from AST .
" Today 's announcement evidences OIN 's continued commitment to acquire patents that may be relevant to Linux , " said Keith Bergelt , Chief Executive Officer of Open Invention Network .
" We are pleased to have purchased these patents and view this as a model of successful collaboration among defensive patent organizations that share a common goal of creating freedom of action for practicing entities across Linux and the broader technology sector .
The prospect of these patents being placed in the hands of non-practicing entities was a threat that has been averted with these purchases , irrespective of patent quality and whether or not the patents truly read on Linux . "
" Allied Security Trust is pleased that Open Invention Network had interest in acquiring the Open Source patent portfolio .
OIN 's purchase ensures that these important patents will not be used by patent trolls or others seeking to disrupt Linux and the many companies and individuals advancing this important technology , " said Dan McCurdy , Chief Executive Officer of Allied Security Trust .
About Allied Security Trust AST is a Delaware statutory trust currently with 15 member companies headquartered in North America , Europe and Asia .
The Trust provides opportunities to enhance companies ' freedom to sell products by sharing the cost of patent licenses .
To date , the Trust has invested $ 40 million in patent purchases over its 30 months of operations .
Through such purchases , the Trust provides an excellent opportunity for patent holders of all sizes to generate a return on their rights by selling patents to the Trust .
AST is not an investment vehicle .
Its purpose is freedom of operation and cost reduction .
It generates no profits and does not engage in patent assertions against other companies .
AST maintains a " catch - and - release " commitment that returns to the market in a timely manner patents acquired on behalf of Trust members after licenses are secured .
The Trust also addresses the increasing need for innovative companies to defend against costly patent law suits .

The Arithmetic of Voting One person , one vote . * [ * footnote :  One man shall have one vote  John Cartwright , Peoples Barrier Against Undue Influence , 1780 . ]
But one of the consequences of this sacred rule is that the more good options there are ( candidates , parties , or measures ) the weaker each becomes , and the weaker they become collectively .
Let us suppose that there are two political sides , A and B .
If there is one candidate on each side , and if the one - person - one - vote rule applies , perfect justice prevails .
That is to say , the division of the vote corresponds exactly to the wishes of the people .
If , for instance , the people are exactly divided between A and B ( as is unlikely but possible ) , then the result is a draw , which is awkward but just .
For justice in an election means that the division of the votes comes out proportional to the divisions among the voters .
But what if another candidate enters on side B ? Philosophically we might think that this ought to strengthen that side .
But of course it does just the opposite .
If , as before , 50 percent of the people are for A and 50 percent for B , then the two B candidates will now divide 50 percent of the vote between them .
They will get perhaps 25 percent each ; at any rate , each will get less than 50 percent ; and so A will win , not because there are more voters on that side , but because there are more candidates on the other side .
If a third candidate enters on side B , the average vote received by the candidates will be divided by three , and so on .
Another way of putting it is that if there are two candidates altogether A needs over half the votes to win ; if there are 3 , he needs over 1/3 ; if 4 , only 1/4 ; and so on .
Let us tabulate the situation in a simplified form , imagining that there are four voters , and two sides ,  and the voters are evenly divided between the sides .
With one candidate on each side , the result is :
With one side split :
Or the split may be of this kind :  where the notations  M  and  E mean moderate and extreme . 
Originally I drafted these ideas in February of 1968 .
At that time A could be imagined to be Nixon , BM Johnson , and BE King , or McCarthy , or the Peace and Freedom Party ; or , conversely , A could be Johnson , BM Nixon , and BE Wallace .
That situation has long since passed , but it might be less invidious to think in some such terms than to suggest contemporary equivalents .
I do not apologize for infusing the idea of good  and bad sides into such a discussion .
Of course there is never a side that is the good one in everybodys view , and so it is utterly non-objective to identify one side as the good one .
In any specific election , however , and in the minds of individual voters , the sides are good and bad in varying degrees .
The very institution of elections assumes this , for it asks the voters to identify the side they consider the good one .
From a general point of view , the purpose of elections is the lofty and impartial one of seeing that the majority wishes of the people are respected ; but from most individual points of view the far more vitally felt aim is to see that the Republicans ( or Socialists , or Christian Democrats . . .) get into power .
And neither purpose is truly served by the rule of one - man - one - vote .
The whole thing can be stated in a dispassionate way , without reference to good  or to sides : if , out of three or more candidates , two are similar , and even if a majority of voters prefers either one of these , yet the votes of that majority are split between them , with the result that another candidate is likely to win , though not wanted by the majority .
The primary reason why this seems wrong is that it makes the result of the vote depend more on the distribution of the candidates than on the distribution of the voters wishes .
Secondly , it is the opposite of the way it should be in that candidates ought to be encouraged , not discouraged , from adding their names to the competition ; each new candidate may be an improvement on the others ; at any rate the voters have a wider choice , and the statistical chance of electing a good candidate is higher .
Thirdly , you have only to think of the dilemma you are placed in if you happen to be one of the voters supporting side B , especially BE , and especially if it is a relatively small splinter .
If there had been only two candidates , you would have voted for the one you considered better .
To them is added another whom you consider better still , but he has less chance to win .
If you do vote for him , you have in effect given your vote to the candidate you consider worst .
On the other hand you feel that if you and others like you do not vote for the one you believe in , his cause will never have a chance to grow .
All this is well known .
It is a fact of political life ; it is  the voters dilemma . 
Heads are shaken over it at almost every election .
It is used : there are many instances in which one side has encouraged extra candidates to run on the other side , even planted  them there , in order to divide that side .
Or , conversely , a side undivides : Labour and the Liberal Democrats make a pact not to run against each other in certain constituencies , so that they each will have more chance of beating the Conservatives ; this is called tactical voting .
Because it is known and exploited , do we have to accept it ?
First solution that doesnt work
Let each voter cast as many votes as there are candidates .
The result then might be like this :
That is , it would be essentially the same as before .
Voters on the side where there is only one candidate would give all their votes to him ; those on the side where there is more than one candidate either would divide their votes , or would divide among themselves , some giving all their votes to one candidate on the side and some to another .
This is in effect the one - vote system still , except that your one vote may be divided into fractions of a vote .
Second solution that doesnt work
Let each voter put the candidates , or as many as he wishes to vote for , in order 1st , 2nd , 3rd .
Count his first choice as 3 votes , his 2nd as 2 , his 3rd as 1 .
Result : Again , the average of the votes for each candidate on the divided side is inevitably lower than the number of votes for the one candidate on the undivided side .
One of the candidates on the divided side could come out level with the candidate on the undivided side , but only if every voter on his side puts him first :
Third solution that doesnt work
Let each voter cast as many votes as he likes , up to some predetermined number , such as 10 .
This is really just a variant of the first solution , with the number of votes per voter changed .
And so the result will be essentially the same :
These first three solutions are really all weighted - vote systems .
In the first and third , the voter determines the various kinds of weight he can give to his own votes ; in the second , it is determined in advance for him .
Solution that works
Let each voter cast as many single votes as he likes , provided they are all for different candidates .
Result :
This is stalemate , as it should be in the hypothetical situation where the two sides are exactly equal .
If , as would happen in reality , one of the two sides has slightly more adherents than the other , then one of the candidates on that side will win .
The splitting of side B between two ( or more ) candidates has not lowered the potential number of votes for each of those candidates .
This system can be seen as negative voting .
Giving one vote each to every candidate you dont mind electing is equivalent to voting , instead , against everyone you do not want to see in office .
Thus in our example the two voters who voted for both B candidates could be said to have voted against A .
With three candidates , you could cast up to three votes ; but casting all three would have the same effect as not voting at all .
As this shows , a voter casting more than one vote does not exercise more power .
Indeed , if there is just one candidate you want to help , you can do so most powerfully by casting only one vote .
Thus far I have been simplifying to the extreme .
What kind of difference will it make when , instead of imagining that there are two clear - cut sides ,  we deal with the possibility that there is overlap between them ?
Or when the numbers of their supporters , instead of being small and equal , are large and irregular ?
Here is a somewhat more flexible kind of tabulation , which will allow us to play with examples of these more real and complicated situations :
In this particular situation , 40 % of the electorate supports only A , 30 % only the moderate B , and 5 % only the extreme B. 10 % are the floating  or potential cross - over voters , the ones who dont mind voting for either Democrat or Republican ( say ) but want to keep the extremists out .
15 % are the ones who would perhaps prefer the extreme B , but may realistically have to support the moderate B if they want to keep A out .
The result under the present system can vary widely , because of what these latter two groups may choose to do .
The 15 % group may opt for either BM or BE , depending on how they decide to resolve the rather agonizing dilemma we referred to already .
This is really a tactical decision ; it is not an ideological one .
And really therefore it is not the sort of thing that voters should be asked to decide : they are supposed to be voting in order to express their preference ; they should not be asked to make calculations of expediency which should be part of the job of the politicians themselves or of political analysts .
The 10 % group may opt for either A or BM ; they are not in a dilemma , or at least not of the same tactical kind they opt one way or the other because of the latest speeches of the candidates , or trends of the economy , and these are indeed matters that should concern the voter .
In practice , of course , the 10 % group will split , in any one of an infinity of different proportions ; so may the 15 % group ; so there are not five possible results but an infinity .
This kind of unpredictability in results is not a sign of some kind of richness in the present system , but is a sign of failure in it .
We must distinguish between two kinds of variation : variation in the underlying numbers of people who feel in sundry ways ; and variations in what may result , given one pattern of those numbers .
Here we are imagining that , like God , we know the underlying pattern : 40 % feel in favor of A only , and so on .
Given this pattern , there should ideally be one result , expressing the wishes of the people ; not a variety of possible results , expressing merely the fact that some people are forced into a dilemma .
Under the proposed system , such people can vote for both the candidate they really want and the next - best candidate who has a better chance of winning .
There is ( given our still rather simple underlying pattern of wishes ) one possible result .
And from a count of the actual votes cast for A only , for A+BM , and so on , it would actually be possible to reconstruct our table that sets out the underlying pattern of wishes . 
No longer will only God know it !
The numbers of votes the three candidates get really represent the numbers of people who are not against them .
That is why they add up to more than 100 % : many voters are not - against more than one candidate .
In the particular example , BM is the candidate with the largest number of people for , or rather not against , him ; so under the proposed system he wins .
Under the present system he could win but is more likely ( given the structure of our numbers ) to lose to A. BE is the extreme candidate with the smallest support .
In the present system he may end up with only his hard - core supporters voting for him ( 5 % ) .
This is not really fair : he has more sympathizers than that ; but with so little actual help from their sympathy his cause may wither away .
His votes can range up to 20 % , the actual amount of his sympathizers , but only as an unlikely upper limit .
In the proposed system , however , he receives 20 % of votes .
He still comes third , but the amount of support he has is actually expressed in votes , and he can proceed to build from there .
Another type of political situation can be represented like this :
Here M ( a notation that evolves easily out of our BM ) is a small party of the middle .
( The parties might be thought of as the British Labour , Liberal , and Conservative . )
In the traditional system M can receive up to 32 % of the vote , but is likely to receive little more than 12 % , since its sympathizers in the two 10 % groups fear that they will be throwing away their votes unless they give them to the large parties .
A can receive from 31 % to 41 % and B from 37 % to 47 % , so it is uncertain which of them will win , the uncertainty depending on which way the 10 % groups resolve their dilemmas .
The traditional system is therefore unfair to the middle in a situation like this .
In the proposed system , A gets 41 % , M 32 % , B 47 % ; B wins , as it should , and M gets a proportion of votes that shows the extent of its support fairly .
You are welcome to think of other situations and analyze them by means of the same sort of diagram ; perhaps more insights will emerge about the weaknesses or strengths of the suggested system .
There are two quite serious criticisms that you may already have noticed ; but if you have noticed both of them you may also notice that they are approximately opposite to each other .
The first is that the system favors parties of the middle .
The probability that a middle - of - the - road party will win is increased over that probability in the present system , because , in the proposed system , people from the areas both to right and to left of it can more readily vote for it : while still preferring , and still voting for , a party on the flank , they can also vote for the party in the middle without fearing that they are damaging their own flank party .
The other criticism is that the proposed system favors parties of the extremes !
Actually this applies to any small , relatively unsuccessful , or new party .
Instead of giving it only the small number of votes representing its hard - core support the people who insist on voting for it even while knowing that it has no chance of winning the system will tend to give it the larger number of votes representing the people who dont mind it , or prefer it , because they can vote for it without detracting from their support of the larger next - best party .
Probably no decision about an electoral system is without its effect on the outcome no change in voter - registration procedures , district boundaries , ballot apparatus , or any other matter of method , is pure of effects on the actual fortunes of Republicans , Tories , or whoever is concerned .
A change in method whose possible effects are to put into office parties that the fewest people object to , and to show the true extent of the support for all parties including the small ones , seems as benevolent as any .
This form of voting is the second simplest after one - person - one - vote .
It is time to give this costless reform a conspicuous trial .
Postscript : the history of this idea I sketched this essay in Manchester ( England ) around 1962 , including the diagrams as shown here ; wrote it fully in February 1968 , passing it to friends in Los Angeles for comment .
Eventually I printed it in my magazine In Defense of Variety ( July - August 1977 ) .
Unknown to me , the idea was put forward by several others about the same time : John Kellett and Kenneth Mott ( Presidential Primaries : Measuring Popular Choice ,  in Polity , Summer 1977 ) ; Robert J. Weber ( Comparison of Voting Systems ,  mimeographed , 1977 ) ; Steven J. Brams and Peter C. Fishburn (  Approval Voting ,  American Political Science Review , September 1978 ) ; and Richard A. Morin ( Structural Reform : Ballots , New York , Vantage Press , 1980 ) .
The expression approval voting was coined by Weber .
I had touched on this aspect ( Giving one vote each to every candidate you dont mind electing . . . ,   The votes . . . really represent the numbers of people who are not against them ) but I had forgotten to think of a handy term .
 Acceptance  might do as well as approval .
The only discussions of voting - systems I had seen were in the June 1976 Scientific American and subsequent correspondence .
The solutions mentioned seemed unrealistically elaborate requiring after - the - vote analysis by computers and did not include approval voting .
This was the provocation that made me publish my article .
But in the October 1980 issue of the same magazine approval voting was mentioned by Martin Gardner in his  Mathematical Games  feature , and with his help I got into correspondence with Brams .
Brams has done most of the publishing about and campaigning for the idea since .
His and Fishburns book Approval Voting appeared in 1983 ; it contains bibliography and history , an informal description of the advantages of the proposal including several not mentioned by me , eight chapters of technical analysis , and a  Bill to Enact Approval Voting in New York State . 
Approval voting was actually used in Massachusetts in the eighteenth century .
Members of the United Nations Security Council are allowed to vote for more than one candidate for Secretary General .
In a typical election for 12 members of a board , there are , say , 19 nominees and the instructions are to  Vote for up to 12  ; and it is not clear that anything would be lost by letting voters vote for any number .

A step further than approval voting is range voting , in which ( 1 ) voters give each candidate a number between , say , 0 and 100 , or 0 and 10 ; ( 2 ) they can opt to give no opinion on a candidate , without affecting that candidate 's chances .
Feature 1 makes the system more sensitive than approval voting but more complicated , and I fear that it brings back the " voter 's dilemma " .
I think that feature 2 is a definite solution to a need .
Range voting is very fully described by its proponent Warren Smith at http://rangevoting.org
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Credit agencies will have to disclose more of their ratings history , and banks will have to share data used to rate financial products with all credit agencies , under rules adopted by U.S. regulators on Thursday .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission passed those rules and proposed others as it took aim at the credit rating industry , blamed for fueling the financial crisis by assigning and maintaining high ratings on toxic mortgage - backed securities .
SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said the rating agency industry needs to be subjected to a stronger regulatory framework because investors frequently consider ratings in making investment decision .
“ That reliance did not serve them well over the last several years , ” she said .
The agency voted to seek comment on whether credit agencies should be categorized as “ experts ” under securities law , and thus subject to tougher standards of liability .
The SEC said it is not proposing such a move yet , but wants feedback on its potential impact .
Further , the SEC proposed on Thursday to require banks to disclose all preliminary ratings they receive from credit agencies in an attempt to stop banks from shopping for the best credit rating for their products .
Under new rules finalized by the SEC on Thursday , credit rating agencies will have to reveal more information about past ratings so investors can compare their relative performance .
The information would be publicly disclosed on a delayed basis , with up to a one - or two - year lag , to protect the rating agencies ’ proprietary information .
This requirement would apply regardless of whether agencies are paid by issuers or by investors .
In another rule adopted on Thursday , the SEC said banks and credit rating agencies should be required to share data used to rate bonds with all credit rating agencies , in an attempt to generate unsolicited ratings .
To reduce reliance on credit ratings , the SEC voted to remove references to ratings in some of its rules and forms .
The SEC said the embedded references could make investors rely on the credit raters ’ actions instead of applying their own judgment on the value of securities .
Legislation in 2006 gave the SEC greater responsibility for overseeing credit raters , and charged the agency with fostering more competition in the industry long dominated by a few firms : Moody ’s Corp ’s Moody ’s Investors Service , McGraw - Hill Cos’ Standard & Poor ’s , and Fimalac SA ’s Fitch Ratings .
At its meeting Thursday , the SEC was also considering proposing a ban on flash orders that stock exchanges send to a select group of traders fractions of a second before revealing them publicly .
The practice has been criticized for giving an unfair advantage to some market participants who have lightning - fast computer trading software .
A Canadian woman married to a British man has been deported from the United Kingdom because of a British law aimed at preventing forced marriages .
Rochelle Wallis , 19 , boarded a flight at Heathrow airport on Wednesday to travel to Calgary where she will be met by her mother , with whom she will be living in Revelstoke , B.C .
" It has n't really set in , to be honest , " Wallis told CBC News while waiting to check in at the airport .
" I can imagine once it does , I 'm going to be quite devastated . "
Her Welsh husband , Adam Wallis , 28 , echoed her sentiments .
" It 's not going to sink in until she 's walking through those gates , but I 'm still feeling really terrible , " he said .
Wallis , formerly Rochelle Roberts , met Adam when he was in British Columbia in 2006 , and they fell in love .
Wallis had the necessary visa to be in Britain at the time the couple married in November 2008 in Adam Wallis 's village of Pontrhydygroes , Wales .
The couple 's marriage application was filed a month before Wallis 's six - month visa expired , but wedding plans had to be delayed after officials lost their passport photos .
By the time the couple wed , she had outstayed her visa , meaning she had to return to Canada and apply for a spousal visa before going back to Wales .
But Britain's new Forced Marriages
Act , which raised the age individuals could apply for spousal visas from 18 to 21 for anyone outside the European Union , was in effect by then .
The law is intended to stop young girls and women from South Asia from being brought into the U.K. against their will and forced into arranged marriages .
" Rochelle entered into this union completely voluntarily , " said CBC correspondent Ann MacMillan .
" The irony is if Adam had married someone from Poland or Portugal — EU countries — there would be no problem . "
Home Secretary Allan Johnson wrote to the couple to order Wallis to leave Britain or be forcibly deported , the BBC reported .
The case has caught the attention of the British media and several members of Parliament .
' Sensible thing to do '
Labour MP Keith Vaz , who chairs Parliament 's home affairs select committee , is backing the couple .
" I think the home secretary ought to have used his discretion , which he has , to allow Rochelle to stay in this country , " Vaz told CBC .
" She 's clearly not a threat to national security , and therefore , that would have been the sensible thing to do .
" These laws were brought in to stop forced marriages — the fear people under the age of 21 were being forced to marry people just to come into the United Kingdom , This is clearly not the case , " Vaz said .
A Home Office spokesperson told the BBC the benefits of the law outweigh the drawbacks and the possibility of cases similar to Wallis 's situation .
Wallis will still be able to apply for the spousal visa when she arrives in Canada , and if it 's declined , as expected , she can appeal the decision on grounds that it violates her human rights .
The couple has sought legal advice but because of the time and money involved in such a legal challenge , the two are not sure they will be pursuing that option , MacMillan said .
Though the two could also move to another EU country and live together until she turns 21 , their current plan is to join each other for holidays in Europe until she is old enough to have her spousal visa approved , MacMillan said .

At least 87 people have been killed after troops in Guinea opened fire on a huge opposition rally in the capital Conakry , reports say .
An earlier death toll of 58 rose by nearly 30 late on Monday , according to unnamed police sources .
Some 50,000 people rallied against Capt Moussa Dadis Camara who seized power in Guinea in a bloodless coup last year .
The rally was triggered by indications he is to reverse a pledge not to run in a presidential vote set for January .
They just started to shoot people directly ...
They tried to kill us
Opposition leader Sidya Toure " There are 87 bodies that were collected in and around the stadium after the military came through , " a police source told the AFP news agency .
Four women are among the dead .
There has been no independent confirmation of the casualty figures , and the Guinean authorities have made no public comment .
Meanwhile , France issued a statement strongly condemning the " violent repression " of opposition demonstrators in its former colony .
Eyewitness ' account
The BBC's Alhassan Sillah says a doctor at government hospital in Conakry said his wards looked like " a butchery " .
Reports also say at least two opposition leaders have been arrested .
Captain Moussa Dadis Camara ( L ) may stand for president " They just started to shoot people directly ...
They tried to kill us , " Sidya Toure , former prime minister and now an opposition leader , told the BBC's Focus on Africa from a hospital .
He said he had been badly injured in the head , and was speaking secretly from the hospital 's toilet as the military was not allowing opposition members any contacts with the media .
Our correspondent says the demonstrators later dispersed , but the military is out in force mounting checkpoints on many roads .
Driving through the capital , our correspondent says he saw burnt - out vehicles around the roads and a burnt - out police station .
The atmosphere was " very strange and fearful " , with very few cars on the road , our correspondent adds .
Eccentric displays Capt Camara staged a coup hours after the death of President Lansana Conte , who had ruled for more than two decades .
The military takeover initially had some popular support , but in recent weeks there have been several anti-government protests .
This is only the beginning of demonstrations and counter - demonstrations we can expect in the next few months
Guinea expert Gilles Yabi
They appear to have been sparked by hints from Capt Camara that he may stand for president in January .
In Conakry , demonstrators gathered outside the capital 's largest stadium , carrying placards reading " No to Dadis " and " Down with the army in power " , according to the AFP news agency .
But the demonstration had already been banned and the stadium was closed and guarded by large numbers of police .
Clashes between police and demonstrators followed , with officers charging the crowds and firing live ammunition .
Guinea expert Gilles Yabi told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme that the rally was not a surprise .
" This is only the beginning of demonstrations and counter - demonstrations we can expect in the next few months , " he said .
Should Capt Camara stand for president , he said , it would be a violation of the tacit agreement between military and civil forces which has kept him in power .
And it would mark a perpetuation of the kind of rule that Guinea has seen for the past decade - which the military had promised to sweep away .
Capt Camara 's rule has been characterised by eccentric displays of power - such as forcing members of the elite presidential guard to beg for forgiveness on national TV after they roughed up a veteran officer .
Former aides and officials have been accused of corruption and links to the drugs trade , including the son of former President Lansana Conte , who was shown confessing on TV to smuggling cocaine .

Nelson Piquet has renewed his attack on his former boss Flavio Briatore - claiming the Renault chief is ' ignorant ' about Formula 1 .
Having already labelled Briatore as his ' executioner ' in an outspoken statement issued in the wake of him being dropped by the team , Piquet has again aimed his anger at the flamboyant Italian in a controversial interview with this week 's AUTOSPORT .
" He is ignorant about Formula 1 , " said Piquet .
" Maybe because of all the things that did n't favour me put me so low that he just did n't care .
He did n't understand what is going on with the team .
" If you listen to the pit - wall radio , it 's like a joke .
He has n't got a clue what is happening in the race .
Sometimes he asks if a driver has slick or wet tyres when it is obvious .
" Everyone knows that his ego is bigger than anything else .
He likes to show off .
You can be a very good businessman and whatever , but the F1 team itself can do very well without him .
When I first started he would attend all of the meetings and briefings , but taking away the business side , he makes comments that do n't make any sense .
" The only good thing the team takes out of him is his good relationship with Bernie and the FIA .
Other than that , he does n't know what is going on .
It 's like listening to something my sister would say about the car .
Pat Symonds is the guy who really understands what is going on with the team . "
Briatore has declined to comment about Piquet 's statements .
Piquet says he has no qualms about having gone on the attack in his statement and the AUTOSPORT interview after his dismissal from Renault .
" We 're free to say whatever we feel like and I do n't see why more drivers do n't do that , " he said .
" It was important for everyone to know what has been going on and not to hide like a lot of other drivers tend to do because they are scared that it could put their career in danger . "
The full interview with Piquet , which includes his thoughts on Fernando Alonso , team equality , his contract and his future , is in this week 's AUTOSPORT magazine .
Cameron cuties :
Tory anger as leader calls for all - women MP shortlists
David Cameron sparked
Tory fury by announcing he will impose all - women shortlists on constituencies selecting General Election candidates .
In a major U - turn , the Tory leader said he will force some local parties to choose a woman candidate if their MP stands down in the next few months .
The initiative was seen by some at Westminster as a cynical attempt by Mr Cameron to burnish his image as a reformer , following weeks in which he has embraced a more traditional Tory message .
But he insisted the policy change was needed to increase the number of female Tory MPs , currently just 19 out of 195 .
He said the lack of women and ethnic minority MPs was damaging for Parliament , adding : ' It 's been an even greater problem for my party and one I desperately want to address and have tried to address . '
Blair 's Babes : Tony Blair welcomes his female MPs to parliament in 1997
The move provoked an immediate backlash .
Former Tory minister Ann Widdecombe described all - women shortlists as ' an insult to women ' .
She said : ' It will do women no good at all .
Every woman in parliament should be able to look every man in the eye and know she got there on exactly the same basis .
' It is ill - advised and inequitable - it is not right that men should be barred from standing if they are the best candidate .
It is also ill - timed - why on earth does the leadership want to pick a fight with the party when we are so close to an election and doing so well ? '
John Strafford , of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy , called Mr Cameron 's announcement ' disgraceful ' .
He predicted it would lead to an exodus of activists .
Tory commentator Iain Dale , a candidate at the last election described the move as ' fundamentally unconservative ' .
He asked : ' where it will all lead ?
All - black
shortlists ?
All - gay shortlists ?
All - disabled shortlists ?
All - Muslim shortlists ?
Not in my name .'
Women shortlists : David Cameron at the Speaker 's conference
Mr Cameron said that where Tory MPs announce they are standing down after January 1 , the party will use powers normally reserved for by - elections to impose a shortlist .
In some cases all the candidates will be women .
The move is likely to apply to only a handful of seats but the decision to embrace the principle of all - women shortlists will enrage many local activists .
The Tory leader has already introduced - rule changes designed to encourage local parties to choose women and ethnic minority candidates .
He said he had tried to ' encourage , educate , cajole , lead and prod ' them .
But aides said they still select too many white , middle - class men .
Mr Cameron 's comments came at an inquiry chaired by Commons Speaker John Bercow into increasing the representation of women , the disabled and people from ethnic minorities in Parliament .
He said 33 per cent of new candidates chosen to fight Tory - held seats were women .
Even a narrow General Election win would mean around 60 female Tory MPs .
Gordon Brown told the hearing 54 per cent of new candidates in Labour - held were women .
He said he wanted to increase the number of Labour women MPs from 95 to at least 120 .
Overall , 125 of the 646 MPs are women .
But Mr Brown was forced to deny suggestions from one of his own MPs that his Cabinet is too reliant on white Scottish men .
The Prime Minister was visibly discomfited when the lack of diversity in his top team came under question .
Former minister Parmjit Dhanda pointed out that of the 23 - strong Cabinet , none are from ethnic minorities and just four are women - as many as the white Scottish men .
Before Mr Brown became Prime Minister there were two ethnic minority Cabinet members .
Mr Brown replied that ministers who attended Cabinet meetings , without necessarily heading a major department , included seven women , one Asian and the country 's first black Attorney General .
How Blair 's babes forged a path to Parliament
The idea of all - women shortlists has been highly controversial since it was first discussed in the late 1980s .
The policy was adopted by Labour in 1993 after a deal to ensure at least one female candidate on every shortlist failed to increase the number of women MPs .
Thirty - eight Labour candidates from all - women shortlists fought the 1997 election and 35 won seats as part of the famous ' Blair Babes ' intake .
The policy had already been declared illegal under sex discrimination laws after a challenge from two male would - be candidates , supported by the Equal Opportunities Commission .
In 2002 the Government changed the law to exempt all - women shortlists .
At the last election 30 Labour candidates were chosen this way .
The best - known beneficiary of all - women shortlists is former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
But most other candidates chosen this way have made little impact at Westminster .
( CNN ) -- David Beckham has confirmed that he is almost certain to return to Italian club AC Milan on loan when the transfer window re-opens in January .
David Beckham has helped LA Galaxy reach the MLS playoffs for the first time since 2005 .
The Los Angeles Galaxy star , who earned his 115th international cap for England in Wednesday night 's World Cup qualifier against Belarus , had a successful spell at the Serie A club in the second half of last season .
" The Milan deal is almost done , and hopefully that will be sorted out in the next month and I 'll probably be going there at the end of December , " the 34 - year - old told reporters after being named man of the match for his 30 - minute cameo appearance in the 3 - 0 Wembley victory .
" The move to Milan is close .
I 've always said I want to go back there and Milan have said they 've wanted me from the time I left there .
" They are still saying the same now .
It is 95 percent done and dusted , so I do n't see why it is not going to happen now . "
Beckham has been told by England coach Fabio Capello that he must be playing in a competitive European league is he is going to have a chance of playing at his fourth World Cup finals .
" Am I on target for a World Cup spot ?
There is a long time to go , a lot of games to play , a lot of the season left , " the midfielder said .
" We will see .
I 'll carry on working hard , playing as hard as I can , and just to give myself a chance .
" If I 'm in the squad , then great , and if not , then we 've got a strong squad of players that can go to Africa and make it interesting .
We all have to prove ourselves every game and every training session that we want to be in the squad and in the team for every game , and not just the World Cup , " Beckham added .
England had already qualified for South Africa before the final two qualifiers , and Beckham was an unused substitute in Saturday 's 1 - 0 defeat in the Ukraine .
He was brought on against Belarus with England 1 - 0 ahead and immediately brought cohesion to an experimental lineup as his first touch -- an unexpected short corner -- gave Shaun Wright - Phillips room to fire in the second goal .
Beckham also hit the post late in the match as he was denied his first goal at England 's national stadium , after striker Peter Crouch had wrapped up the win with his second of the match and 18th in 35 matches .
Beckham 's move to Milan in January was unpopular with the Galaxy 's fans and his teammates , but he seems to have won them over in recent weeks after helping the club reach the Major League Soccer playoffs for the first time since 2005 .
On Sunday , LA travel to Houston to take on the Dynamos , who are tied with the Galaxy on 44 points at the top of the Western Conference along with Chivas USA , with two matches of the regular season still to play .

There are many types available , from a puny . 22 - caliber up to 12 - gauge .
We opted for a Dirty Harry special .
Any punk swamp lizard that tries to attack us in the washroom is gonna wind up as matching boots , laptop bag , and Wiimote holster .
One of the striking things about mass killings in the U.S. is how consistently we find that the killers were riddled with shame and sexual humiliation , which they inevitably blamed on women and girls .
The answer to their feelings of inadequacy was to get their hands on a gun ( or guns ) and begin blowing people away .
What was unusual about Sodini was how explicit he was in his blog about his personal shame and his hatred of women .
“ Why do this ? ” he asked .
“ To young girls ?
Just read below . ”
In his gruesome , monthslong rant , he managed to say , among other things :
“ It seems many teenage girls have sex frequently .
One 16 year old does it usually three times a day with her boyfriend .
So , err , after a month of that , this little [ expletive ] has had more sex than ME in my LIFE , and I am 48 .
One more reason . ”
I was reminded of the Virginia Tech gunman , Seung - Hui Cho , who killed 32 people in a rampage at the university in 2007 .
While Cho shot males as well as females , he was reported to have previously stalked female classmates and to have leaned under tables to take inappropriate photos of women .
A former roommate said Cho once claimed to have seen “ promiscuity ” when he looked into the eyes of a woman on campus .
Soon after the Virginia Tech slayings , I interviewed Dr. James Gilligan , who spent many years studying violence as a prison psychiatrist in Massachusetts and as a professor at Harvard and N.Y.U .
“ What I ’ve concluded from decades of working with murderers and rapists and every kind of violent criminal , ” he said , “ is that an underlying factor that is virtually always present to one degree or another is a feeling that one has to prove one ’s manhood , and that the way to do that , to gain the respect that has been lost , is to commit a violent act . ”
Life in the United States is mind - bogglingly violent .
But we should take particular notice of the staggering amounts of violence brought down on the nation ’s women and girls each and every day for no other reason than who they are .
They are attacked because they are female .
A girl or woman somewhere in the U.S. is sexually assaulted every couple of minutes or so .
The number of seriously battered wives and girlfriends is far beyond the ability of any agency to count .
There were so many sexual attacks against women in the armed forces that the Defense Department had to revise its entire approach to the problem .
We would become much more sane , much healthier , as a society if we could bring ourselves to acknowledge that misogyny is a serious and pervasive problem , and that the twisted way so many men feel about women , combined with the absurdly easy availability of guns , is a toxic mix of the most tragic proportions .
Unemployment is at a 14 - year high of 2.47 million after a 210,000 rise in the three months to July , official figures showed today .
The number of people claiming jobseeker 's allowance rose by 24,400 to 1.61 million in August - the highest since May 1997 and the 18th monthly rise in a row , according to the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
The recession 's impact on young people was also underlined by jobless totals among 16 - 24 - year - olds reaching 947,000 - the highest level since ONS records began in 1992 .

The jobless rate among this age group is also a record 19.7 per cent , meaning one in five is looking for work .
Overall jobless totals are at their highest since May 1995 .
The unemployment rate is now 7.9 per cent , up 0.7 per cent on the previous three months and the highest since November 1996 .
The number of economically inactive people also rose to its highest point since ONS records began in 1971 , at 7.99 million .
The employment rate was 72.5 per cent , the lowest level for more than 12 years .
Unemployment has now risen by 743,000 over the year as a whole and looks on course to pass the three million mark next year as the impact of the recession feeds through to rising dole queues .
Vacancies were down 12,000 to 434,000 on the quarter and in the suffering manufacturing sector , the number of jobs has fallen to 2.65 million in the three months to July - the lowest since comparable ONS records began in 1978 .
The contrasting impact of recession on the public and private sectors was also shown by the 13,000 rise in public sector employees to 6.04 million in the quarter to June .
This contrasts with a 230,000 fall in private sector workers to 22.85 million over the same period , the ONS said .

For the public sector , average annual pay growth including bonuses was 3.4 per cent in July - almost three times the 1.2 per cent seen in the private sector and double the 1.7 per cent growth overall .
Paul Kenny , general secretary of the GMB union , said : " More workers , particularly young workers , are paying a devastating price for the bankers ' recession and there is some way to go before unemployment stops rising .
" Yesterday the Tories threatened 10,000 jobs secured on building the aircraft carriers in Fife , Glasgow and Portsmouth and other parts of the UK .
" We need to be clear with the electorate - the Tory plan to cut public spending will stall an economic recovery and add to the dole queues .
It is madness and must be opposed . "
TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said : " There are now over a million people out of work for more than six months , more than one in three of them under 25 .
There are no signs of recovery here .
" This is not the time to take risks with policies that could make unemployment worse .
It might look rosier in City dealing rooms but out in the real world unemployment is the number one issue . "
Derek Simpson , joint leader of Unite , said the figures showed that the recession was " far from over " .
He said : " Gordon Brown has charted a steady course through these troubled times and a break from Labour would shatter any fragile recovery .
" The Government 's help for young people and new apprenticeships shows that Labour is committed to supporting jobs . "
Sean Figg , of campaign group Youth Fight for Jobs , said : " Youth unemployment has reached 947,000 .
Job losses continue , and the prospect of getting another dims .
" Gordon Brown and David Cameron are calling for massive cuts in public spending - this will clearly have an impact on young people , especially those unlucky enough to be unemployed . "
Unemployment in the regions between May and July was :
Region , Total , unemployed , Change on quarter , Unemployment rate
North East , 116,000 , plus 13,000 , 9.4 %
North West , 293,000 , plus 12,000 , 8.6 %
Yorkshire / Humber , 235,000 , plus 24,000 , 8.9 %
East Midlands , 171,000 , minus 2,000 , 7.3 %
West Midlands , 282,000 , plus 33,000 , 10.5 %

* Evidence is classified
* Hurts U.S. advocacy of press freedom
* Family waits for son's return
BAGHDAD , Sept 2 ( Reuters ) - On Sept. 2 , 2008 , U.S. and Iraqi troops smashed in the doors of Iraqi journalist Ibrahim Jassam 's home , shouting " freeze " and holding back snarling dogs before they hauled him off into the night in his underwear .
A year later , neither Jassam and his family nor global news agency Reuters , which employed him as a freelance TV cameraman and photographer , have been told exactly why he has been detained for all this time by U.S. military forces in Iraq .
The evidence against Jassam is classified , but the accusations have to do with " activities with insurgents " , said Lt. Col .
Pat Johnson , a spokeswoman for the U.S. military in Iraq .
The term " insurgents " in Iraq generally refers to Sunni Islamist groups , like al Qaeda .
Jassam is a Shi'ite Muslim .
" In a year of trying to get specifics , we 've heard only vague and undefined accusations - to me this is unacceptable , " said David Schlesinger , editor in chief of Reuters , the news arm of international media and information provider Thomson Reuters .
" It is only right and fair that any specific accusation against a journalist should be aired publicly and dealt with fairly and swiftly , with the journalist having the right to defend himself properly . "
Jassam , who is being held in a prison camp built in the desert on the Iraq - Kuwait border , will eventually be released .
Under a U.S. - Iraqi security pact , called a Status of Forces Agreement , the U.S. military must hand over the thousands of Iraqis it still has in its custody as Iraq gradually regains its sovereignty more than six years after the U.S. - led invasion .
Those facing Iraqi charges will be tried ; the rest freed .
The Iraqi Central Criminal Court already ruled last November there was no case against Jassam .
[ ID : nLU123205 ] [ ID:nL9585447 ]
But the U.S. military says it considers Jassam a security threat to Iraq .
It says that under the security agreement , it is entitled to hold Jassam as long as possible .
" Though we appreciate the decision of the Central Criminal Court of Iraq in the Ibrahim Jassam case , their decision does not negate the intelligence information that currently lists him as a threat to Iraqi security and stability , " Johnson said .
' INCONSISTENT WITH SPIRIT OF ACCORD '
Reuters argues the U.S. army is misinterpreting its remit .
" Ibrahim Jassam has never been charged by the U.S. military or the Iraqi authorities , and has never had a single piece of evidence or even a specific allegation of wrongdoing presented to him , " said Thomson Reuters deputy general counsel Thomas Kim .
" We believe this is not consistent with the spirit behind either the Status of Forces Agreement ... or the Rule of Law . "
The U.S. military detained many Iraqi journalists during the sectarian slaughter and insurgency unleashed by the 2003 invasion .
None have been known to have been charged .
Journalists rights groups say U.S. forces may be misinterpreting legitimate journalistic activities in war zones .
Taking pictures of Shi'ite militiamen battling U.S. troops , for example , might look like enemy propaganda to a U.S. soldier .
" The year - long detention of Ibrahim Jassam without charge or due process is not only unjust it also undermines the ability of the U.S. government to effectively advocate for press freedom around the world , " said Joel Simon of the New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists .
[ ID :nN10320526 ]
The U.S. military said it expected all high security threat detainees to go before an Iraqi judge starting in December 2009 .
The intelligence information against Jassam will be aired then .
Meanwhile , Jassam 's mother , Fadhila Alwan , is waiting impatiently to welcome him back to the family home in Mahmudiya , 30 km ( 20 miles ) south of Baghdad , so she can see her son marry .
Six months before Jassam 's arrest , another teenage son was killed by what the family says was fire from a U.S. helicopter while he was crossing a street to buy bread at a bakery .
Mahmudiya , in the " Triangle of Death , " was a violent town , in the grip of Shi'ite militias , and gunbattles were common .
The U.S. military has not revealed details about the arrest , but Alwan said when the soldiers came at 1 a.m. , the family was sleeping on the roof to escape the heat of late summer .
' YOU WOULD WEEP AND BEAT YOUR HEAD '
The Iraqi soldiers were abusive and cruel , pushing Jassam 's elderly father to the ground before their U.S. counterparts stopped them , she said .
They smashed every door in the house .
" My three sons there , including Ibrahim , were tied by plastic ropes and soldiers forced them to lay down with their faces on the ground .
One of the Americans was looking at a small photo strapped to his forearm , and then he ordered Iraqi soldiers to take Ibrahim downstairs , " she said .
" Ibrahim told them he was a journalist and had n't done anything wrong .
The Iraqi soldiers told him to shut his mouth . "
They took Jassam 's cameras and computer hard drive away .
His sister , Layla Jassam , said she asked the Iraqi soldiers where they were taking Jassam .
" If you knew where we were taking him you would weep and beat your head , " one replied , she said .
The family says it has been hard not knowing anything .
" We asked his lawyer , we asked military officers , we 've asked all the officials we meet , but not one of them knew why he 's been in jail for a whole year , " said Alwan .

Over the last couple of months , I ’ve noticed something about the anti-vaccine movement .
Specifically , I ’ve noticed that the mavens of pseudoscience that make up the movement seem to have turned their sights with a vengeance on the Hepatitis B vaccine .
The reason for this new tactic , I believe , is fairly obvious .
The fact that the Hep B vaccine is administered shortly after birth seems somehow to enrage the anti-vaccine movement more than just about any other vaccine .
Moreover , given that , aside from maternal - child transmission when the mother is infected , hepatitis B is usually only contracted through either bloodborne contact ( the sharing of needles , the administration of contaminated blood ) or sexual activity , it ’s very easy for anti-vaccinationists to make a superficially plausible - sounding argument that it ’s not a necessary vaccine , even though there are reasonable rationales for giving it to infants .
The image of sticking a needle into a newborn infant trumps that , though , at least for the anti-vaccine movement .
Another possibility , suggested by Steve Novella just yesterday , is that , with the collapse under a overwhelmingly huge pile of evidence of the idea that the mercury - containing preservative thimerosal that used to be used in childhood vaccines until 2001 , caused an “ epidemic ” of autism and the failure of the “ too many too soon ” slogan to convince anyone who is not already an anti-vaccinationist , the movement needed a new bogeyman to blame for autism .
The hepatitis B vaccine , which was added to the pediatric vaccination schedule in the 1990s , around the right time to confuse correlation with causation when it comes to the increase in autism diagnoses ( just like thimerosal ) was a perfect next target , given that it ’s administered shortly after birth .
Indeed , just the other day , the anti-vaccine crank groups the National Vaccine Information Center ( NVIC ) , Talk About Curing Autism ( TACA ) , and the anti-vaccine crank blog Age of Autism posted a call for the elimination of hepatitis B vaccination for newborns :
Washington , DC – National Vaccine Information Center and Talk About Curing Autism are calling on President Obama to order the immediate suspension of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation of the birth dose of the Hepatitis B vaccine after two recent studies linking the Hepatitis B vaccine to functional brain damage in U.S. male newborns and infant primates .
In a related development today , the United States Department of Health and Human Services , including the Health Resources and Services Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , announced that 1 in every 91 children are now diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder as reported in the November 2009 issue of Pediatrics .
Previous data released by the CDC indicated a prevalence of 1 in every 150 children affected by the disorder .
Note how AoA not - so - subtly interposed the latest information about autism prevalence with its call to eliminate the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine .
Very clever .
By doing so , it linked the two in readers ’ minds , as if one had something to do with the other .
There ’s no good scientific evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine has anything to do with the “ autism epidemic . ”
Meanwhile , David Kirby is up to his usual nonsense , and the resident anti-vaccine propagandist at CBS News , Sharyl Attkisson , who has been known to feed Age of Autism information on at least one occasion in the past , served up this credulous , noncritical interview with Andrew Wakefield :
The quantity of misinformation in that single six minute video is far beyond the scope of this article .
Were I to start dissecting it , I would not have time to do what the purpose of this article was intended to do :
To deal with the study Wakefield is hawking .
That ’s why I leave the dissection of this pièce de résistance of disingenuousness and misinformation as an exercise for SBM readers–after reading the rest of this post , of course .
Trust me , it will help you .
At the heart of this latest propaganda onslaught by the anti-vaccine movement are two studies , one a restrospective study in humans and the other a study in monkeys , both of which the anti-vaccine movement is promoting as slam dunk evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine is causing all sorts of horrific problems .
Taking both of them on in one post is too much , even for my logorrheic tendencies .
So I ’ll deal first with Wakefield ’s monkey study and then , either later this week or sometime next week , hopefully discuss the human study .
The reason I start with the monkey study is because , so confident are the anti-vaccinationists of the study that they ’ve placed the accepted manuscript on the Thoughtful House website ( PDF ) .
The study has also been posted on the anti-vaccine blog Age of Autism ( PDF ) .
That means that you can read it for yourself .
( Thanks , Age of Autism and Thoughtful House !
You made my work much easier ! )
Wakefield ’s study is entitled Delayed Acquisition of Neonatal Reflexes in newborn Primates receiving A Thimerosal - containing Hepatitis B Vaccine : Influence of gestational age and Birth weight .
It was performed and written by a cast of characters that we ’ve met before , including the crank who launched thousands of cases of MMR in the U.K. through his shoddy science , being in the pocket of trial lawyers , and possibly even scientific fraud .
Then there ’s also Laura Hewitson .
We ’ve seen her before as the author of a couple of abstracts that I dissected in gory detail last year .
Suffice it to say that , not only was the science shoddy , but massive conflicts of interest were not disclosed .
The only difference this time around is that the conflicts of interest were disclosed .
In fact , let ’s look at the conflicts of interest first , using the statement straight from the manuscript :
Prior to 2005 , CS and AJW acted as paid experts in MMR - related litigation on behalf of the plaintiff .
LH has a child who is a petitioner in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program .
For this reason , LH was not involved in any data collection or statistical analyses to preclude the possibility of a perceived conflict of interest .
It ’s hard for me not to retort that LH ( Laura Hewitson ) is the first author of the paper !
She designed and coordinated the study , as the manuscript itself states here :
LH and AJW designed the study but were not involved in data collection and statistical analysis .
LH was also responsible for coordinating all aspects of the study .
One wonders how a researcher can be “ responsible for coordinating all aspects of the study ” if that researcher is not involved in data collection and analysis , one does .
Hewitson is also the corresponding author , which presumably means that she wrote the manuscript , or most of the manuscript .
Contrary to Blaxill ’s hilariously disingenuous claim , there is not just the appearance of a conflict of interest ; there is a conflict of interest , a massive conflict of interest .
The same is the case with Andrew Wakefield , who not only was in pocket of trial lawyers when he did the work that led to his infamous 1998 Lancet paper that started the MMR scare in the U.K. but was recently revealed to have almost certainly falsified data .
Wakefield , of all people , has a lot to gain if there were any work that supported his belief that vaccines cause autism .
In fact , if I were to use the same criteria that Age of Autism did when it automatically labeled any study with any pharmaceutical company underwriting whatsoever as hopelessly biased in its Fourteen Studies website , I could stop right here and dismiss Wakefield ’s current monkey study as so hopelessly the result of a conflict of interest that I do n’t even need to analyze it .
Fortunately , unlike the anti-vaccine propagandists responsible for Generation Rescue , the Age of Autism , and Fourteen Studies , that ’s not how I roll .
I did , however , have a hearty laugh at AoA ’s attempt to justify the blatant conflict of interest thusly :
One likely tactic of critics of the study will include attempts to nullify the evidence based on the alleged bias of those involved .
For one , the study is privately funded and acknowledges some well known autism advocates as financial contributors .
These include the Johnson family ( Jane Johnson is co-author of Changing the Course of Autism , a member of the Board of Directors of Thoughtful House and Director of Defeat Autism Now ! ) , SafeMinds , the Autism Research Institute and Elizabeth Birt .
Although all of these groups make clear their research interest is vaccine safety , they are frequently attacked for being “ anti- vaccine ” , an epithet that will almost certainly be hurled again here .
If the shoe fits …
After all , Thoughtful House is the place where Andrew Wakefield plies his pseudoscience on autistic children ; Defeat Autism Now ! is a cesspit of autism pseudoscience and quackery largely based on the discredited idea that vaccines cause autism , as are the Autism Research Institute and SafeMinds .
Even more amusing was this :
The most aggressive attacks , however , will likely be reserved for the study authors .
The basis of these attacks is best anticipated by the following conflict of interest disclosure in the published paper .
“ Prior to 2005 , [ Carol Stott ] and [ Andrew Wakefield ] acted as paid experts in MMR - related litigation on behalf of the plaintiff .
[ Laura Hewitson ] has a child who is a petitioner in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program .
For this reason , [ Hewitson ] was not involved in any data collection or statistical analyses to preclude the possibility of a perceived conflict of interest . ”
Is n’t the hypocrisy breathtaking ?
To me , it ’s truly astounding !
The anti-vaccine movement in general and AoA in particular go out of their way to attack any investigator who does a vaccine study that fails to find a link between vaccines and autism or other neurodevelopmental outcomes .
Inevitably , they use any hint of research funding , past or present , by pharmaceutical companies to paint the investigators as hopelessly biased .
They relentlessly attack , for example , Paul Offit as the Dark Lord of Vaccination–Satan Incarnate with syringes !– because he invented an effective vaccine and made money selling it to a pharmaceutical company ( along with his university , it should be added ) .
In Fourteen Studies , AoA and Generation Rescue slimed every investigator who received a penny of money from a pharmaceutical company .
In fact , Generation Rescue defined conflicts of interest this way :
We considered a scientist employed by a vaccine maker or a study sponsored by a vaccine maker to have the highest degree of conflict , with a public health organization ( like the CDC ) to be the second - worst .
Based on some of the things that Generation Rescue said about those “ Fourteen Studies , ” it also appeared to define the mere fact of being funded through grants from the CDC , NIH , American Academy of Pediatrics , or even the Canadian Institutes for Health Research as being a hopeless conflict of interest .
Scientists who have had NIH grants ( such as myself ) or grants from any of these other organizations know just how ridiculous considering that particular funding source to be a horrific conflict of interest is .
The bottom line is obvious .
It ’s a conflict of interest only if Generation Rescue says it is .
Accepting funding from a pharmaceutical company ?
It ’s a conflict of interest .
No doubt about it .
Real researchers would define it so .
But there ’s more to a conflict of interest than just where one ’s research funding comes from or what companies one might work for .
Not to Mark Blaxill .
To Mark Blaxill and the Age of Autism , being one of the complainants in the Autism Omnibus and being funded by organizations whose purpose is to demonstrate that vaccines somehow cause autism and other neurodevelopmental problems poses no problems with regards to being a conflict of interest .
None at all .
Neither is Andrew Wakefield ’s history of being in the pocket of trial lawyers at the time he did his “ research ” ( and I do use the term loosely ) that led to his infamous 1998 Lancet paper .
In fact , it ’s not only a non-issue , it ’s a sign of virtue to have accepted funds from anti-vaccine groups like SafeMinds .
That ’s because anti-vaccine advocates like Blaxill see themselves on the side of angels and think that they could never , ever have their objectivity affected by the funding source , having an autistic child , or being part of any legal action seeking compensation for “ vaccine injury , ” which , by the way , would definitely be helped by apparent scientific evidence showing that vaccines can cause autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders .
One notes that one of the things the previous monkey study published as an abstract by Hewitson and Wakefield got dinged for in the blogosphere was that no conflicts of interest were reported .
Poor Mark seems really peeved at the criticism Hewitson justly received for that little ethical lapse last year .
On to the study .
The first thing I always try to figure out whenever reading any study is a simple question :
What is the hypothesis being tested ?
A good study explicitly states its hypotheses in no uncertain terms .
Not this one .
This is the closest I could find to the study hypothesis :
Here we examine , in a prospective , controlled , observer - blinded study , the development of neonatal reflexes in infant rhesus macaques after a single dose of Th- containing HB vaccine given within 24 hours of birth , following the US childhood immunization schedule ( 1991 - 1999 ) .
The rhesus macaque is used in preclinical vaccine neurotoxicity testing and displays complex early neurobehavioral and developmental processes that are well characterized ( reviewed by [ 7 ] ) .
Of course , to anyone who ’s been involved in dealing with the anti-vaccine movement , one thing that ’s very clear is that the subtext behind this is the unsinkable rubber duck of a belief among the anti-vaccine movement that , somehow , someway , either vaccines or mercury in vaccines causes autism .
An inconvenient fact is that there has been no thimerosal in early childhood vaccines other than the flu vaccine since late 2001 , but that does n’t stop the anti-vaccine movement .
I suspect that the reviewers of this article were probably blissfully ignorant of this context and concentrated solely on the methodology .
Had they known , no doubt they would have asked some uncomfortable questions in their reviews .
Of course , they would have no way of knowing that this study is in fact more of a propaganda tool than anything else .
One thing that needs to be emphasized is that there really is no good primate model of autism , at least not that I ’m aware of .
That ’s why Hewitson and Wakefield resorted to looking at infant reflexes , even though it ’s not even clear whether these reflexes are in the least bit relevant to humans .
Several readers have informed me that the primitive reflexes studied by Wakefield and Hewitson in this study are present at birth in humans .
Another question that needs to be asked .
Why did the investigators look at thimerosal - containing hepatitis B vaccination ?
There ’s no thimerosal in the hepatitis B vaccine anymore and has n’t been since 2001 .
In fact , if you read the methods section of the paper , you ’ll see that Hewitson et al added thimerosal to Recombivax HB ( Merck ) in order to recreate that thimerosal feeling from the 1990s .
Why on earth would they do something like that ?
Especially since the authors state in the conclusion that the study design “ was not able to determine whether it was the vaccine per se , the exposure to thimerosal , or a combination of both , that caused these effects ” ?
I will suggest a possible reason before the end of this discussion .
Before I get to the effects Wakefield and Hewitson supposedly observed , let ’s just consider something else .
When I read this study , there was something that set my skeptical antennae twitching fiercely .
Remember the abstracts I discussed last year ?
Let ’s take a trip down memory lane and read what I wrote back then :
What first leaps to mind in looking at the study is that there are 13 monkeys in the “ vaccine ” group and only three in the control group .
No explanation is given for why there are such unequal numbers .
Similarly , there is no mention of how the monkeys were assigned to one group or the other ( randomization , anyone ? ) , whether the experimenters were blinded to experimental group and which shots were vaccine or placebo , whether the monkeys were weight - and age - matched , or any of a number of other controls that careful researchers would do .
Right off the bat , from the small numbers ( particularly with only three monkeys in the control group ) , I can say that the study almost certainly does n’t have the statistical power to find much of anything with confidence .
Now , let ’s look at how many monkeys in this study :
Thirteen receiving the hepatitis B vaccine plus added thimerosal .
Does n’t that seem rather –shall we say ?
–coincidental , convenient , even ?
There were also three animals receiving no injection and four receiving a saline placebo .
Sound familiar ?
It should .
There were three controls receiving no injection and four receiving saline placebo .
Why do I bring this up ?
Remember , the abstract from last year described the monkeys as undergoing the “ entire vaccination schedule ” ( actually , a version of the entire U.S. vaccination schedule , with the vaccination doses moved closer together to try to make the times the monkeys received various vaccines supposedly equivalent to the same physiological and developmental age when humans receive the same vaccines in the vaccination schedule ) .
The inevitable consequence of this , of course , is that the monkeys received a lot of vaccines in a much shorter time period than human babies do .
Remember how , as a result , the results of these abstracts were were portrayed as showing that vaccinated monkeys “ exhibited autism - like symptoms ” :
The first research project to examine effects of the total vaccine load received by children in the 1990s has found autism - like signs and symptoms in infant monkeys vaccinated the same way .
The study ’s principal investigator , Laura Hewitson from the University of Pittsburgh , reports developmental delays , behavior problems and brain changes in macaque monkeys that mimic “ certain neurological abnormalities of autism . ”
The findings are being reported Friday and Saturday at a major international autism conference in London .
Although couched in scientific language , Hewitson ’s findings are explosive .
They suggest , for the first time , that our closest animal cousins develop characteristics of autism when subjected to the same immunizations – such as the MMR shot — and vaccine formulations – such as the mercury preservative thimerosal — that American children received when autism diagnoses exploded in the 1990s .
Is it just me , or does this latest study strike you as being merely a subset of a study that ’s already done ?
Given the similarity of the description of the study described in the manuscript , in which hepatitis B vaccine was even spiked with thimerosal in order to mimick the vaccine schedule of the 1990s ( given that hepatitis B vaccine no longer containes thimerosal ) and the previously reported abstract , in which the entire vaccine schedule of the 1990s was supposedly mimicked , it does make me wonder .
Could it be that the results being reported derived from observations made on the same monkeys used to generate the IMFAR results ?
In other words , could it be that the investigators gave the monkeys the hepatitis B vaccine after birth , tested their various reflexes early in their lives ( only for the first 14 days ) , and then continued with their “ simulated ” vaccination schedule in order to produce the rest of the observations reported last year ?
Inquiring minds want to know !
After all , the current study only goes out for two weeks ; it would be easy to continue the rest of the simulated vaccination schedule after that and then make measurements on the same monkeys .
Indeed , one wonders if , stung by the criticisms of inadequate controls , the investigators added additional controls and kept the same group of 13 monkeys as the “ vaccinated group . ”
Maybe they did n’t , but the similarity between the numbers of monkeys used in the studies described in the IMFAR abstracts last year and the numbers of monkeys used in this study sure do raise an eyebrow , do n’t they ?
So does this part of the methods section :
Animals were allocated to either the vaccinated ( exposed ) or saline / no injection ( unexposed ) groups 19 on a semi-random basis in order to complete peer groups for later social testing [ 7 ] such that each 20 peer group contained animals from either the unexposed or exposed study groups .
Once a new peer 21 group was started , new animals were assigned to this group until it consisted of 3 or 4 infants , the 22 ages of which were less than 4 weeks apart from their peers .
My first thought was :
What ’s with this “ semi- random basis ” stuff ?
Why not on a random basis ?
Being a little bit “ not random ” is like being a little bit pregnant , if you know what I mean .
In other words , when investigators start adding nonrandom selection to a protocol , it ’s not random anymore .
That much should be obvious .
And when the selection of animals is no longer random , then that calls the whole study into question .
It sounds to me as though Hewitson and Wakefield designed the experiment ( or let the experiment unfold ) so that all members of a given peer group received the same treatment ; i.e. , they all got Th - HepB ( HepB vaccine with thimerosal added ) , they all got saline , or they all got no injection .
If so , that ’s certainly consistent with my speculation that there were some animals added at the end of the experiment .
If my interpretation ( i.e. , that more animals were added later as controls ) , it strikes me as odd .
Why on earth would Hewitson and Wakefield choose that design ?
Why not include at least one saline or no-injection animal in each peer group ?
With the apparent design for this experiment , there ’s no way to discriminate between possible vaccine - related effects and uncontrolled time - related confounders , given that some monkeys under this design must have been analyzed in a noncontemporaneous fashion .
The questions of why there are two control groups and why the randomization scheme was such that each member of a peer group got the same treatment becomes especially suspicious to me because in their analyses , Hewitson and Wakefield pool the four monkeys receiving the saline control with the three receiving no injection for purposes of calculating means .
Could it be that the investigators simply added a few monkeys after the experiment had already been started ( or even after the original 16 monkeys had already undergone the entire “ vaccination schedule ” ) ?
Again , inquiring minds want to know !
Could it be that , in order to beef up their apparent statistical power to detect differences in these various reflexes , some additional monkeys had to be added ?
Or was this done in response to reviewers ’ concerns ?
If that ’s the case , then when were these additional monkeys studied ?
How long after the original group ?
Mark Blaxill brags that the person who measured the monkeys ’ reflexes was trained by an expert until her results had a high concordance with those of experts , but if there were a several month delay between when she measured the first group of monkeys and then the additional controls , it ’s not too hard to imagine that she got better and thus more able to detect subtle differences in the reflexes .
If conditions under which the monkeys were raised change , then the same sort of time - dependent confounders could be at work here .
I ’d really like to see when each monkey was born and what the time to criterion was for each monkey .
In other words , I ’d like to see at least some of the raw data .
The similarities between the designs of the studies described in the IMFAR abstracts last year and this study sure make me wonder if perhaps Hewitson and Wakefield are perhaps “ minimizing ” the use of animals .
Of course , minimizing the use of animals , particularly primates , in research is normally a good thing , but if that ’s what they ’re doing , why not report the entire study ?
After all , in the video above , Wakefield admits that this study is part of an ongoing study of the “ vaccine schedule . ”
However , if you go back to look at the IMFAR abstracts that I discussed last year , you ’ll see that it was stated that the monkeys were killed between 12 - 15 months and tissues examined at necropsy .
In other words , Hewitson and Wakefield were done with those animals over a year ago !
Given that , why not just report the whole study instead of this little piece of it , which must have been done at least two or three years ago ?
Are they planning on having data from this study come out in little dribs and drabs .
In other words , are they planning on publishing several papers , each consisting of what we call an “ MPU ” or “ minimal publishable unit , ” derived from part of the same study ?
Whatever the case , in this particular MPU , what did Hewitson and Wakefield find ?
Not much , actually , the triumphant crowing of Mark Blaxill at AoA notwithstanding .
Basically , Hewitson and Wakefield reported that three of thirteen infant reflexes were delayed in their appearance .
Specifically the root reflex was delayed by one day ; the suck reflex by nearly two days , and the snout reflex , also by nearly two days .
Because they mixed thimerosal into the hepatitis B vaccine and did n’t have a control group with thimerosal - free hepatitis B vaccine , Hewitson and Wakefield could n’t even hazard a guess whether the effects observed , even if significant , were due to the vaccine or the thimerosal or both .
There also appeared to be a confounding factor in that monkeys with lower gestational age ( GA ) .
For example , the authors state :
In general , as GA increased animals reached criterion earlier whereas animals of lower GA were relatively delayed .
This effect was only significant when exposure was taken into account .
I really have to wonder whether in a larger group of completely unvaccinated monkeys the correlation between the delay in appearance of these reflexes with decreased gestational age would reach significance , no hepatitis B vaccination necessary .
The authors try to spin their results as suggesting that lower GA monkeys are more susceptible to whatever effect it is they think they ’re seeing due to Th - HepB , but their arguments are not very convincing –about as convincing as their data , actually , as in not very .
In addition , given such small numbers , I always wonder about the validity of carrying out any sort of multivariate analysis .
Another point to consider , in this paper these reflexes are ranked from 0 ( absent ) to 3 ( the highest possible score ) .
The time to criterion was defined as the time to reach the highest possible score .
Again , given the small numbers and the correlation between gestational age and reaching these milestones , I really have to question whether the results in this study , despite being apparently statistically significant if you pool the two control groups , are really behaviorally or biologically significant .
If there ’s one thing my mentors always taught me , it ’s that statistically significant does n’t necessarily mean significant .
This is particularly true , since it is not reported whether these delays are prolonged or whether the baby monkeys recover .
Finally , there is the question of whether the authors bothered to correct for multiple comparisons .
Whenever a large number of comparisons are made , by random chance alone the odds of seeing a “ positive ” or a correlation between a marker and what is being studied increases .
The problem is that , the larger the number of comparisons , the larger the chance that any “ hit ” observed is a false positive .
In the case of multiple comparisons , a statistical adjustment needs to be made to correct for the effect of multiple comparisons .
In other words , if the authors did n’t correct for multiple comparisons , it ’s quite possible–likely , even–that their observed “ positives ” are in fact false positives .
Personally , I ’m not all that impressed .
One reason is that , even if the study shows what the authors claim it shows , so what ?
Wakefield and Hewitson have n’t shown evidence of long - lasting neurological impact , and they certainly have n’t shown any evidence that the hepatitis B vaccine causes autism , even though you know that ’s the subtext of what they are arguing .
Moreover , the numbers are really small .
I look at monkey studies in much the same way that I look at clinical trials .
If a study is worth doing prospectively , it ’s worth doing with enough subjects at the outset to provide sufficient power to guarantee that there is a high likelihood that the question being asked will be answered .
If an investigator ca n’t provide enough subjects , then he should n’t do the study
Another reason I have a problem with this study is that no statistical justification is given for pooling the no vaccine group with the saline placebo group .
Whenever I see pooling of groups like this , I become very suspicious of a post hoc combining of data , which is always dicey .
Indeed , a good rule of thumb is that it ’s usually at least a little bit questionable to combine groups like this for purposes of statistical analysis unless this pooling was part of the study design from the beginning , in which case it is still somewhat dicey but not as bad .
Presumably the reason why two control groups were used was to determine if simply the pain of giving a saline injection may have had any affects on the time to criterion for these neurodevelopmental parameters .
That ’s a scientifically legitimate reason to have two control groups ( although one certainly does wonder why they did n’t have a control group receiving thimerosal - free hepatitis B vaccine ) .
But , again , it really makes me wonder whether the investigators pooled the data , apparently post hoc .
The only reason to do such a post hoc pooling is to convert three groups to two groups and to add statistical power to the control group .
You can be quite confident that , had there been a statistically significant difference between the “ vaccinated ” group and the saline placebo group and between the “ vaccinated ” group and the uninjected group , Hewitson and Wakefield would not have pooled the data .
In fact , I almost guarantee it .
After all , why do something that will lead to scientists questioning the validity of your study ’s statistical analysis if you do n’t have to ?
In the case that there were in fact statistically significant differences between each of the control groups compared to the “ vaccinated ” group , you can be quite certain that the results would have been reported –shall we say ?
–unmassaged by the pooling of the two control groups .
It ’s also rather instructive to look at the original IMFAR abstract , which reported :
Kaplan - Meier survival analyses revealed significant differences between exposed and unexposed animals , with delayed acquisition of root , suck , clasp hand , and clasp foot reflexes .
Interaction models examined possible relationships between time - to - acquisition of reflexes , exposure , [ 3C ] DPN binding , and volume .
Statistically significant interactions between exposure and time - to - acquisition of reflex on overall levels of binding at T1 and T2 were observed for all 18 reflexes .
For all but one ( snout ) , this involved a mean increase in time - to - acquisition of the reflex for exposed animals .
It ’s interesting to note that they looked at 18 reflexes then but only reported 13 now .
Why did they drop five between then and now ?
There were more “ significant ” differences in time to criterion in the “ old ” study described in the IMFAR abstract , and only two of the reflexes appeared to be consistent between the two studies .
Again , I have to ask :
Is the experiment reported in this paper a true repeat of the studies in the IMFAR abstracts , or is it simply an “ extended ” version of the prior study ?
I think you know which one I suspect .
In fact , Wakefield all but admitted it in the interview in the video above .
I also think that this study was a horrible waste of primates , and I ca n’t believe the University of Pittsburgh ’s IACUC was thinking when it approved this study .
Maybe it ’s because , as Mark Blaxill was so happy to inform us , the University of Pittsburgh primate facility is relatively new , and Pitt ’s IACUC was not experienced in evaluating primate protocols at the time these experiments were being proposed .
Finally , on a different note , I wonder about the ostensible justification for this study :
Since Th[ imerosal ] - containing vaccines , including the neonatal HB vaccine , continue to be used routinely in developing countries [ 3 ] , continued safety testing is important , particularly for premature and low - birth - weight neonates .
If the authors are so concerned with vaccine reactions and autism in developing countries , then why on earth did they try to mimic the U.S. vaccination schedule ?
Why did they use monovalent hepatitis B vaccine , when few countries other than the U.S. do ?
Most developing countries use a tetravalent , pentavalent , or hexavalent vaccine containing multiple other antigens , such as diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis , IPV , Hib , and HepB antigens .
The hepatitis B vaccine , if given at all , usually is n’t given until at least six weeks of age as part of existing vaccine programs .
So , when you come right down to it , this study is n’t even studying what it claims to be looking at or following the rationale that its authors claim as the reason for the study !
If it were , it would not be following the U.S. vaccination schedule .
In reality , it looks very much as though this study is custom - designed to sow doubt and fear about the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine in the United States .
That , and it ’s almost certainly going to be used as ammunition for legal action and lawsuits .
Just wait .
It also may be another objective here .
I note that anti-vaccine groups like TACA funded this study , which certainly cost at least $ 100,000 to do , most likely considerably more than that .
Anti-vaccine groups would not have invested so much money if they did n’t expect a payoff .
Here ’s what I think might be going on .
Like all good denialists , anti-vaccine groups and their toady scientists ( like Wakefield ) want material to sow doubt about the science they deny , in this case , the safety and efficacy of childhood vaccines .
Small preliminary studies in general have a fairly high likelihood of producing false “ positive ” results ( i.e. , showing a correlation where a larger , better designed study would find none ) ; so funding such studies is likely to produce at least some apparent “ hits , ” such as this this study by Hewitson and Wakefield .
Because such studies are small and preliminary , they can’t really settle anything , and the anti-vaccine movement knows it .
So anti-vaccine groups like TACA and Generation Rescue will use the results of these small studies as justifications for claiming that there is doubt over whether vaccines are safe and , most importantly , that more money is needed to do more and bigger studies .
They ’ll then get such larger studies funded through the NIH or through the efforts of anti-vaccine sympathizers like Representative Dan Burton .
In the meantime , they ’ll point to the very existence of such NIH - funded studies as further “ evidence ” that there is still a scientific controversy over whether vaccines cause autism and milk them for all they ’re worth until the larger studies come back negative , as they almost always do .
It ’s a very hard strategy to counter , and , unfortunately , it just might work .
Creationists wo n't be wooed by logic , however eloquent , and they certainly wo n't be swayed by condescension , says Randy Olson
Richard Dawkins , seen at the 2009 Paraty International Literary Festival , Brazil
WHEN he has that fire in his belly , Richard Dawkins is arguably the greatest living populariser of evolution .
His foundational work , The Selfish Gene , inspired a generation of evolutionary biology students ( myself included ) , while The God Delusion was a powerfully effective self - esteem booster for atheists in the closet .
With his new book , splendidly titled The Greatest Show on Earth , Dawkins joins other popularisers in what has become almost a rite of passage – to “ make the case ” for evolution to the general public .
It ’s like the “ ring the bell ” game at the county fair where every able young male feels obliged to step up and swing the giant mallet .
Two of the greatest efforts in recent years come in both flavours : atheist ( Why Evolution is True by Jerry Coyne ) and believer ( Finding Darwin ’s God by Kenneth Miller ) .
These previous books were so well written it seemed the challenge had been met .
Another “ argument for evolution ” book could only be justified by a great new angle on how to reach the unconverted masses .
Advertisement
Implying that your audience is stupid does not qualify as a great new angle .
Yet this is precisely what Dawkins does .
He opens the book by mentioning his two previous books about evolution , and then , with a nearly audible scoff , adds that back when he wrote those books ( when people , apparently , were smarter ? ) he did n’t have to argue that evolution actually happened .
“ That did n’t seem to be necessary , ” he says .
By the first chapter he is comparing his predicament to a history professor forced to teach “ a baying pack of ignoramuses ” and dealing with a “ rearguard defence ” .
Today , he proclaims , “ all but the woefully uninformed are forced to accept the fact of evolution ” .
It ’s really kind of comical .
If “ spot the condescensions ” is a new drinking game , then bottoms up !
There ’s one in just about every chapter .
Though Dawkins says from the outset , “ This is not an anti-religious book ” , he ca n’t help but knock religion throughout , For instance , he writes : “ God , to repeat this point , which ought to be obvious , but is n’t , never made a tiny wing in his eternal life . ”
Young Earth creationists are , he writes , “ deluded to the point of perversity ” .
You get the sense that Dawkins just ca n’t control it .
It ’s as if he suffers from an anti-religious form of Tourette ’s syndrome .
“ You get the sense that Dawkins ca n’t control it .
It ’s as if he suffers from anti-religious Tourette ’s ”
The Greatest Show on Earth is not a bad book – Dawkins would n’t know how to do that .
His use of a crime scene investigation as a parallel for the narrative is at times very effective , particularly in showing the endless frustration of addressing the “ gaps ” critique of the fossil record .
But in the end , you have to wonder why Dawkins wastes so much time trying to argue with creationists .
We all know that creationists are not rational thinkers .
They are driven by beliefs , not by logic .
Dawkins provides a transcript of his interview with the president of Concerned Women for America which reads like a Monty Python skit as the woman , a bullheaded creationist , simply answers all of Dawkins ’s sophisticated argumentation by saying she ’s not convinced – like a cartoon character standing in front of a hail of bullets taunting , “ You missed me . ”
It ’s a shame Dawkins could n’t take a few tips from his atheist colleague Jerry Coyne .
Coyne ’s powerful and popular book was , to quote Booklist , “ far more presentational than disputatious ” .
That is a desperately needed attribute these days in making the convincing – and persuasive – case for evolution .

Scientists Force Fungus to Have Sex to Create Biofuel
August 11th , 2009 by Bryan Nelson
Austrian scientists are putting the ‘ fun ’ in ‘ fungus ’ by forcing organisms which are usually asexual to have sex instead .
The hope is that the fungus would then be easier to breed , which would allow researchers to create organisms that are more efficient at degrading cellulose for the purpose of making biofuel .
[ social_buttons ]
Originally discovered in the Solomon Islands during World War II eating away at the canvas and garments of the U.S. Army , scientists have long known that the soil fungus Trichoderma reesei was particularly good at converting cellulose– a major component of plant biomass– into glucose .
But until now it has been difficult for researchers to improve the fungus because it was believed to be asexual .
Due to the fact that sexual organisms exchange and mix their genetic material when they breed , their traits can be more easily manipulated artificially .
Under the assumption that Trichoderma reesei was asexual , scientists looking to improve the fungus were instead limited to techniques like dosing the fungus with radiation or chemicals in order to alter its genetic profile .
But that process only created random or unpredictable mutations .
But for the first time since its discovery 50 years ago , scientists can now make the fungus have sex .
Past studies have shown that Trichoderma reesei is genetically identical to another species of fungus , Hypocrea jecorina , which it so happens is capable of sexual reproduction .
The primary difference between the two organisms was that Hypocrea jecorina seemed capable of assuming both the male and female roles , whereas Trichoderma reesei seemed only capable of assuming the male role .
So scientists got a novel idea :
Why not breed the male - oriented Trichoderma with a female - oriented Hypocrea ?
The result was a successful mating – the Trichoderma lured into having sex could now be artificially selected for their advantageous genetic traits .
The findings could have largescale ramifications .
Researchers want to employ the organisms to make use of the otherwise useless cellulose in sawdust , weeds and other plant scrap to make biofuel .
Thus , the primary benefit of fungus sex could be to turn bush into biofuel .
But the newly sexualized fungus can also help farmers .
Since Trichoderma includes species that help plants by killing harmful fungi , they can be put to use protecting crops we use for food .

Re : The Saudi Ibn Al Rawandi
I managed to get his blog post from Google chache .
I 'll translate the relevant bit about him revealing his identity , I 'll leave the Saudi jokes aside because no one will understand them .
Here goes .
I am the scholar extraordinare " al Rawndy " aka Hamid Salaf Alanazi who lives in the extremist shithole otherwise known as al Riyadh .
Hear me :
They have obeyed an illiterate moron who told them the sky talked to him !
That it has chosen him for his wit and cleanliness instead of the Greek Philosophers or Indian physicians and anyone who talked back to him WILL SUFFER !
In his Quran are numerous grammatical and scientific errors .
The style of the Quran is merely bad poetry .
It rhymes but in a poor manner and it's incoherent and poorly balanced .
They slay their minds and others because of worthless scripture .
There is no one in the sky !
They have wasted their oil money and history will laugh at them .
I pity the West , they give them all those products and expect good things out of them .
THE GREAT JEWISH RABBI !
Their God invites them into heaven and then barbecues the rest of humanity into an oven .
What foolishness is this ?
completely unacceptable .
King
Abdullah calls for tolerance among the world religions and then orders them to jail a Saudi who has converted to Christianity !
They 're lying about religious tolerance and think the whole world is stupid .
The Quran says that Allah is the best of all creators which means there are other creators !
Islam is indeed hilarious .
Allah says he has throne !
Which means he occupies a limited space !
And Allah also mentions that he has physical hands in the Quran !
In my country they spend billion of dollars on religious books , the religious police , religious clerics and on mosques instead of actually helping the needy !!!
They spend millions on scholars who have nothing better to talk about than menstruation , farting and cleaning yourself with sand !
They 've talked to the death about these things , are n't they bored yet ?
They have PhDs in Jihad and murder , utterly disgraceful !
I 'll talk about Muhammad 's lies next ( there 's a lot of stuffing here , I 'll make it shorter to fit the post ) : 1- an ant that TALKS ?
A sea that is split ?
( This is his Arabic language degree ) 2 - Muhammad made the bastard Alexander the great into a Prophet !!!
He 's the two horned one in the Quran !
and he made the MIGHTY sun set in a mud pit ?
But Muslims will deny the absurdity of these things because of sheer emotions .
They say my country is civilized .
How can it be when a woman can be hit for talking to a male salesman ?
Must she use sign language ?
And they say the sun PRAYS under Allah 's throne ?
Does it do Wudhu first ?
Is the sun female ?
Must she wear a Burka ?
Hehehehe3 - They hit and beat up young men for drinking alcohol and dressing in a Western Style .
Or even because they drank alcohol in the desert .
How can we be modern if the population is going to be jailed for having fun ?
4 - The Quran says semen comes from between the spine and ribs !!!
Everyone knows Semen comes from the testicles !
It only makes sense !
Do n't you see how Muhammad has lied to you ?
5- Their Prophet forbids alcohol !
He does n't know that most cleansers and perfumes have alcohol nowadays !
There are hadiths saying he did drink wine but of course that 's banned now .
6 - He has married 12 women without witnesses or dowries !
He even raped Safiya after killing her entire tribe including her father and brother .
Allah is matchmaker for Muhammad !
He child raped Aisha when she was nine .
He hurt Umm Habeeba because her father was his enemy and because her ex Husband ran away and become a Christian .
He wipes his ass with a stone , does n't shower or bathe and Muslims call him CLEAN ?
7 - He allows you to hit your wife and own concubines .
Plus you get whores in heaven !
Such idiocy .
8 - Muhammad tells people to wait until heaven to get pleasures while he fucks his harem !
Do n't criticize him or Allah will be mad.9 - Do I need to mention his ethnic cleansing of a Jewish tribe ?
10 - Muhammad says there is nothing like Allah but the Quran says he has hands and a face .
Is n't this a contradiction ?
And if it 's a metaphor why can't God be clear ?
11 -" We have created everything male and female " .
Did n't Muhammad know there are unisex and asexual creatures ?
12 - I think he 's the only Man on the planet who has convinced people that drinking camel piss IS GOOD FOR YOU !
13 - He said that menstruation is caused by the devil running in a woman 's womb !!!
Muhammad knew nothing about the womb and the shedding of its lining .
14 - The Quran says that you should n't force your girls into prostitution but if you do then Allah will forgive you !
You can be a pimp !
15 - He stole Pagan poetry and removed the names of Pagan gods then said that this is part of the Quran .
16 - He said the heavens were the same breadth as the Earth ?
THE EARTH IS LESS than a speck of dust compared to this vast universe !
17 - He made his religion as he went along .
Taking all kinds of creeds into the mix .
Did n't anyone notice this plagiarism ?
Do you know what you get for leaving Islam ?
DEATH .
Because they do not have evidence to back up their barbaric creed .
That 's why they kill apostates .
I 've never seen a religion more evil than Islam .
I call upon every humanistic institution to protect me from the crazy Wahhabi disease and give me shelter and refuge .
P.S. I cut out a lot of things .
Things that sounded incredibly offensive , stuffing and Arab jokes .
Il ministro Renato Brunetta
I benefici effetti prodigiosi della ' cura Brunetta ' per i fannulloni della nostra pubblica amministrazione sono il fiore all ' occhiello di questo governo .
Della sua terapia miracolosa , il ministro figlio di un venditore ambulante veneziano è riuscito a convincere tutti , dagli statistici agli stessi politici d'opposizione .
Per la gente comune , grazie a lui l'impiegato lavativo è stato rimesso in riga .
D'altronde come interpretare altrimenti il mirabolante meno 40 per cento di assenze per malattia propagandato a più riprese dal suo ministero ?
La realtà , però , è diversa dai fuochi d'artificio alla festa del Redentore .
E poche coraggiose voci fuori dal coro fra gli statistici del nostro
Paese sgonfiano quei numeri , ridimensionando l'ormai celebre effetto- Brunetta .
Che si fonda su tre pilastri di cartapesta .
Il primo : l'analisi si limita agli enti che ci tengono a farsi belli della propria virtuosità ( mentre gli asini se la battono ) .
Il secondo : nei suoi conti mancano all 'appello grossi pezzi dell ' apparato statale - come l'istruzione e le forze di polizia - nonché ministeri o comuni importanti .
Il terzo : le sue statistiche tagliate con l'accetta spesso finiscono col premiare chi non se lo merita e punire chi non ha colpa .
Senza dimenticare che gli stessi dati del ministero iniziano a riconoscere che ' l ' onda ' si sta ritirando .
Riflusso napoletano
Che il travet non abbia più così paura degli strali di Brunetta , infatti , è proprio il suo ministero a raccontarcelo .
La riduzione delle assenze per malattia registrata a settembre dello scorso anno , quando si era raggiunto il meno 44,6 per cento , è stato il picco dal quale poi non si è fatto altro che scendere .
In modo graduale , ma inesorabile : meno 41 a novembre , meno 33 ad aprile , meno 27 a giugno , per finire con il meno 17 di luglio .
Mai come in quest ' ultimo mese ci sono state tante amministrazioni che hanno invertito la tendenza , col meno che si è andato trasformando in più .
Al Comune di Napoli le assenze si sono impennate del 30 per cento , nonostante il fatto che a palazzo San Giacomo i dipendenti siano diminuiti .
Anche l'altra grande città del Regno delle due Sicilie , Palermo , si distingue per la propria indifferenza al ministro - castigatore .
Con una particolarità : fra gli uffici che hanno lavorato meno , negli ultimi quattro mesi dell ' anno scorso , ci sono quelli addetti a raccogliere soldi per il Comune ( servizio Tributi e Tarsu ) .
Alla faccia della lotta all 'evasione .
Sempre stando ai numeri ministeriali , non è che a Nord se la passino meglio .
A Parma , per esempio , chi lavora in Comune a luglio se l'è squagliata : più 32 per cento , rispetto allo zero di giugno e al meno 21 per cento di maggio .
E il malcostume non cambia se ci spingiamo ancora in su , per fare tappa in un paesino brianzolo piuttosto noto : ad Arcore , dove il premier ha casa , le assenze sono salite del 27 per cento rispetto all ' anno scorso .
In barba al suo illustre e industrioso cittadino .
A scoppio ritardato
L'afflosciarsi dell 'effetto Brunetta è però solo una parte di quello che il ministro non dice .
Se oggi il fannullone italiano inizia a essere una specie protetta , non è solo merito suo ( anche se lui se lo arroga tutto ) .
Come dimostrano i dati della Ragioneria generale dello Stato , è già da fine 2004 che si verifica nella popolazione dei dipendenti pubblici una concreta diminuzione di chi si dà malato .
Ovverosia già molto prima dell 'era post Brunetta del pubblico impiego .
Alla Provincia a Pisa lo sanno bene : dall ' inizio del 2005 l'ente toscano è riuscito nell ' impresa di abbassare del 20 - 30 per cento il tasso d'assenteismo .
" Tutto quello che potevamo recuperare l'abbiamo recuperato , motivo per cui ora le assenze oscillano di mese in mese , seguendo cause fisiologiche come il tempo o i cicli influenzali " , dice il direttore generale Giuliano Palagi , non curandosi del più 17,5 per cento fatto segnare a luglio .
Al di là di questa ' appropriazione indebita ' , cosa più grave nel bluff mediatico del ministro - economista è la mancanza di attendibilità dei dati che diffonde ogni mese .
" Le sue cifre aprono una finestra solo su una parte del panorama della nostra pubblica amministrazione : quella migliore " , fa notare Giulio Zanella , ricercatore all ' Università di Siena e firma del sito di economisti noisefromamerika.org .
Appellandosi alla collaborazione delle singole amministrazioni , il ministero infatti non pubblica tutti i numeri degli enti - né potrebbe - ma solo quelli inviati di loro spontanea volontà .
Per capirci , è come se a scuola venissero interrogati solo i ragazzi che si offrono volontari : ai somari per cavarsela basta stare zitti .
" Però in questo modo il campione non è rappresentativo , e i risultati tanto strombazzati non hanno alcun valore scientifico , perché inevitabilmente sovrastimano la realtà " , aggiunge Zanella .
E non ha aiutato nemmeno " l'operazione di ' pulitura ' dei dati fatta dall '
Istat " , perché si è trattato , per l'appunto , solo di una pulitura .
" Mi aspetto che i prossimi dati ufficiali della Ragioneria generale dello Stato , che rappresenteranno la prova del nove , ridimensionino quel 40 per cento di Brunetta " , conclude il ricercatore senese .
Facendo piazza pulita della retorica politica .
Il paradosso di Sondrio
Che i numeri del ministero siano tutt ' altro che uno specchio fedele della realtà lo si capisce anche da altre falle , più o meno grandi .
Prima di tutto c'è quella postilla con cui si avvertono i lettori che nell ' analisi mensile non rientrano scuola , università , regioni e pubblica sicurezza .
Cioè un bel pezzo d'apparato statale .
Inoltre , gli stessi enti i cui dati trovi un mese , magari latitano il mese prima .
Tanto che spiccano frequenti assenze di lusso : a luglio mancavano i dati del ministero degli Interni e di quello dei Trasporti , della Provincia e del Comune di Milano , dei Comuni di Torino , Bari e Venezia .
Quasi tutti , ad eccezione del Viminale e del capoluogo pugliese , erano invece presenti nella rilevazione del mese precedente .
Infine , a scapito delle verità di Brunetta va la scarsa collaborazione delle amministrazioni nel loro insieme : meno della metà delle 10 mila burocrazie italiane compila i moduli on line .
Certo oggi va meglio che agli inizi , quando già nei primi cinque mesi dall ' approvazione della legge 133 Brunetta aveva sbandierato il suo famoso 40 per cento : all 'epoca solo il 15 per cento di quella che è l'intera burocrazia italiana aveva risposto alle sollecitazioni ministeriali .
C'è poi un ultimo errore da prendere in considerazione , del quale già avvertono a scuola quando ti insegnano a fare la media fra due numeri : se io mangio due polli e tu non mangi niente , se non stai attento finisci col sostenere che abbiamo mangiato un pollo a testa .
È il malinteso in cui si incappa prendendo alla lettera i dati di Brunetta .
Se scorri i numeri più aggiornati fra quelli forniti dal ministero , al secondo posto nella top ten trovi il Comune di Sondrio , con un aumento delle ore di assenza per malattia di oltre il 90 per cento rispetto allo stesso mese dello scorso anno .
Che sia Sondrio , proprio la terra nat ìa di Giulio Tremonti , la capitale dei fannulloni d'Italia ?
Non esattamente .
A un'analisi appena meno superficiale , infatti , ti accorgi di come stiano le cose in realtà .
" Quella del ministero è una statistica piuttosto rozza " , contesta Alcide Molteni , sindaco del comune lombardo : " Ora , io ho circa 150 dipendenti .
Tre di questi hanno malattie croniche che li obbligano a casa tutto l'anno , chi per l'infarto , chi per seri problemi polmonari , e loro da soli coprono gran parte delle assenze .
Ad agosto , per esempio , su 87 giorni di malattia , in tre ne hanno fatti 62 , e tutti gli altri ne hanno fatti 25 " .
Per converso è facile capire che , come a Sondrio si punisce chi non ha colpe , la media ' del pollo ' può tranquillamente finire col premiare chi invece non lo meriterebbe .
Le donne nel mirino
Sotto la scure di Brunetta , però , non ci finiscono solo i malati gravi .
I primi risultati di uno studio ancora in corso all 'Istat - sul numero di persone che fanno orario ridotto a causa di malattia in una settimana tipo - smorzano gli entusiasmi dei brunettiani convinti , concentrandosi sui primi sei mesi dall ' entrata in vigore della legge .
Ebbene , il primissimo ( e forse l'unico ) colpo inferto dalla sua crociata antifannulloni si è abbattuto nell 'estate 2008 su una ben precisa fetta dei dipendenti pubblici : le donne del Centro Italia .
E basta .
Che cosa avranno mai fatto le donne di Roma per meritarsi questo ?
Una possibile spiegazione ce la suggerisce Riccardo Gatto , ricercatore Istat , e autore dello studio insieme ad Andrea Spizzichino : " D'estate , una volta chiuse le scuole , si hanno più problemi a trovare qualcuno a cui affidare un bimbo , e quindi è possibile che ci si assenti solo per gestirli meglio .
Infatti , la differenza significativa rispetto agli uomini sul lavoro è che sono ancora le donne a farsi tipicamente carico delle mansioni familiari " .
E sempre le donne , secondo un calcolo fatto da Zanella , fanno mediamente due giorni di assenza l'anno in più degli uomini , per evidenti ragioni familiari e biologiche .
Fra l'autunno e l'inverno , invece , ci si ammala per davvero .
E proprio negli ultimi tre mesi del 2008 , sempre secondo lo studio di Gatto , l'effetto Brunetta semplicemente " non emerge più dall ' analisi dei dati " .
" Già nei tre mesi estivi il fenomeno non è particolarmente rilevante " , osserva , " perché passa dall ' 1,8 dell ' anno prima all ' 1,3 per cento .
Ma nel quarto trimestre la legge sembra aver esaurito il suo effetto " .
Conclusioni pesanti e fuori dal coro , quelle di Gatto , pronunciate durante un seminario a ' casa ' del ministro .
E passate sotto silenzio .
Un mini-risultato
Insomma , malati cronici , donne con figli , ma di fannulloni puniti , per ora , neanche l'ombra .
Fatta la tara , che cosa resta concretamente di questa ' cura Brunetta ' ?
Secondo Zanella , in ultima analisi , si potrebbe parlare di un 10 per cento in meno di assenze .
Ma qui finisce .
" Il fatto che quest ' anno i numeri del ministro si siano ridotti è normale , perché le assenze non possono continuare a calare all ' infinito " .
Un effetto , quindi , c'è stato , ma è " un puro effetto di prezzo , dovuto alla decurtazione dallo stipendio dei giorni di assenza .
Se oggi le arance costano un euro , e domani due , ne comprerai di meno .
Qui è la stessa cosa .
Ognuno fa i propri conti : prima potevo ammalarmi quanto volevo , adesso non più , quindi cercherò di fare meno assenze .

Certo è che però non basta tenere la gente in ufficio ( magari con 38 di febbre ) per farla essere produttiva .
" La soluzione non è costringere la gente ad andare al lavoro in qualsiasi condizione di salute , visto che si può arrivare a perdere fino a 50 euro al giorno in caso di malattia " , contesta Michele Gentile della Cgil : " Quel che servirebbe , in realtà , sarebbero più controlli da parte dei dirigenti , cosa che nel privato avviene molto più che nel pubblico " , suggerisce Gianni Baratta della Cisl .
Insomma , conclude Gentile , " la diagnosi è giusta , ma la terapia è sbagliata " .
Court rejects genetically modified sugar beets U.S. DISTRICT COURT
The government illegally approved a genetically modified , herbicide - resistant strain of sugar beets without adequately considering the chance they will contaminate other beet crops , a federal judge in San Francisco has ruled .
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jeffrey
White rejected the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's decision in 2005 to allow Monsanto Co. to sell the sugar beets , known as " Roundup - Ready " because they are engineered to coexist with Monsanto 's Roundup herbicide .
Sugar beets produce 30 percent of the world 's sugar and , according to consumer groups , half the granulated sugar in the United States .
This year 's planting , centered in Oregon 's Willamette Valley , is the first to include a full crop of the Monsanto product .
White said the USDA , in concluding that the new crop would have no significant environmental effects , discounted the likelihood that wind - borne pollen would spread to fields where conventional sugar beets , table beets and the beet variety known as Swiss chard are grown .
Planting genetically modified sugar beets has a " significant effect " on the environment , White said in his ruling Monday , because of " the potential elimination of a farmer 's choice to grow non-genetically engineered crops , or a consumer 's choice to eat non-genetically engineered food . "
He said the department must prepare an environmental impact statement , which would include public input .
White did not immediately prohibit distribution of the genetically modified sugar beets , but a lawyer for plaintiffs in the case said they would ask the judge for an injunction against sales until the review was completed .
The ruling " sends a very clear message to the USDA to protect American farmers and consumers and not the interests of Monsanto , " said Kevin Golden , a San Francisco attorney for the nonprofit Center for Food Safety , which opposes genetically modified foods and supports organic farming .
Golden said the ruling could also affect herbicide use , because the Environmental Protection Agency has allowed more herbicide spraying in areas where the resistant crops are grown .
Representatives of the Agriculture Department and Monsanto were unavailable for comment .
Luther Markwart , spokesman for the 10,000 - member American Sugar Beet Growers Association , said the group is " looking forward to aggressively advocating " for farmers who want to use the altered beets .
The ruling followed a similar decision in 2007 by another federal judge in San Francisco , Charles Breyer , to halt the nationwide planting of Monsanto 's genetically engineered strain of alfalfa until the USDA conducted an environmental study .
A federal appeals court upheld Breyer 's decision last year .
The department 's 2005 decision on sugar beets acknowledged that pollen from the genetically modified crop could spread to other beet crops .
But the USDA said farmers would not be harmed because they would still be able to buy non-genetically modified seeds .
White , however , cited studies that said winds can carry sugar beet pollen at least 2 1/2 miles , much farther than the voluntary buffer zones between beet crops recommended by Oregon agriculture officials .
He said the department had failed to consider the economic effects of its decision and had provided no evidence for its conclusion that non-genetically modified sugar beets would remain available to farmers .
Allegations of industry - sponsored ghostwriting date back at least a decade , to scientific articles about fen- phen , the diet drug combination that was taken off the market in 1997 amid concerns that it could cause heart - valve damage .
But evidence of the breadth of the practice has come to light only gradually , most recently in documents released in litigation over menopause drugs made by Wyeth .
The documents offer a look at the inner workings of DesignWrite , a medical writing company hired by Wyeth to prepare an estimated 60 articles favorable to its hormone drugs .
In one publication plan , for example , DesignWrite wrote that the goal of the Wyeth articles was to de-emphasize the risk of breast cancer associated with hormone drugs , promote the drugs as beneficial and blunt competing drugs .
The articles were published in medical journals between 1998 and 2005  continuing even though a big federal study was suspended in 2002 after researchers found that menopausal women who took certain hormones had an increased risk of invasive breast cancer and heart disease .
Wyeth has changed its policy in the years since the hormone papers were published , according to Douglas Petkus , a company spokesman , and now requires that scientific articles acknowledge any participation by Wyeth or a Wyeth - sponsored writer .
Some leading medical journals have also beefed up their disclosure policies for authors .
Some of the authors of the Wyeth hormone articles played significant roles in the work , while others made minor changes to drafts that were prepared for them , the documents show .
But , in the main , the articles did not disclose that they had been drafted by outside writers paid to advance the drug company ’s views .
Many universities have been slow to react to evidence about the extent of the practice .
In December , for example , Mr. Grassley released documents indicating that DesignWrite had drafted an article that was published under the name of a gynecology professor at New York University School of Medicine .
Eight months later , a spokeswoman said the school had not looked into the matter .
“ If we had received a complaint , we would have investigated , ” said Deborah Bohren , the vice president for public affairs at New York University Langone Medical Center .
“ But we have not received a complaint . ”
She added N.Y.U. never condoned ghostwriting and was now drafting a written policy to that effect .
Faculty members , however , are responsible for the integrity of their own work , she said .
Today I have a post from a guest writer .
Pop_Icon is angry , and here is why :
To take a purposely direct connotation to Family Guy , do you know what REALLY grinds MY gears !?
Cash for Clunkers .
Look , I get it .
The car industry is the carpet on the floor of the economy .
If we can get people to buy cars , we can * jump start * the economy .
The road to “ The Bridge to Nowhere ” was , I ’m sure , paved with the best intentions , and I know our government was looking , to what in all accounts looks like a win - win - win — incentivize Americans to ditch their gas - guzzling vehicles for a fuel - sipping new car that not only cuts our dependence on foreign oil , but also cleans the air .
And , listen , I know that drastic times call for drastic measures , that ’s what everyone tells us , right ?
Is it the right thing to do ?
We get into the predicaments over the course of years , yet our microwaveable , instant messaging , ORDER NOW public has no patience for pain .
Hell , most of the population feels they have the right to never be offended .
Surely , they must have the right to immediate relief from all that ails them .
Well folks , the time has come .
The most popular stimulus program EVER .
Ran out of money in the first week ….$ 1 Billion USD .
Gone .
Done .
Used .
The auto dealerships are ecstatic .

Stories roll in from all over the country telling the tale of the busiest they ’ve ever been .
New fuel - efficient cars rolling off the lot in droves .
The proud new owner thinking they ’ve just scored a great deal .
Save the economy , get a massive incentive to buy a new car , and your old car relegated to obsolescence .
Do they know what happened to their old car ?
Do they care ?
My wife , mother , father , coworkers , and friends were all flabbergasted when I clued them in .
You , dear readers , are going to see virtually first hand what this has done .
Your friends and family turned into giggling executioners into what I ’m calling ‘ the economic - automotive equivalent to the holocaust ’ .
Before you get your knickers in a wad , I in no way belittle what atrocities the millions of Jewish people experienced in that dark and tragic time .
However , I am a car enthusiast .
There is a whole economic world that revolves around driving , repairing , buying / selling , making parts , maintaining , and ultimately disposing of the machines that changed our world , forever .
So , it should come as little shock , to those who know me , what I went through seeing the atrocities these so - called “ clunkers ” experienced in their days in the CARS program .
My soul hurt seeing these cars die , some of which were completely undeserving , and to what ultimate end .
If you gave your once - beloved 4 - wheeled friend to this government program , you must watch what I ’m about to show you .
I will warn you , the links to these videos I ’m giving to you are disturbingly graphic .
In some of these videos , the executioners are laughing and cackling as the automobiles cry out with oil - curdling screams .
A beautiful green Volvo. Clean .

There are dozens upon dozens of clips like these .
Some of these vehicles were not in good shape .
I ’m surprised some of them were even roadworthy in any way .
Destroying the engine , though , destroys parts that are usable in other roadworthy vehicles , though .
Some may say that once you sell your car to someone else , they could use it as a prop in a car crash scene in a film or blow it up on MythBusters .
My point is , at least the cars are serving a purpose .
Cash for Clunkers kills cars .
Salvage yards overwhelmed by cars will probably not be able to use the over - supply of inventory of what parts are usable .
Most will be , sadly , gone forever .
Mere shells of memories of virginity lost , little Billy ’s bad seafood , and enough spare change to buy tacos in Africa — all gone .
Bottom line folks , which has been driving this whole notion any how , is that we have to be careful what we wish for .
Everything comes at a price .
We got here not with cautious optimism , but rampant greed , feeding on excesses at the cost of public well - being .
A corporate economy based on use - and - refuse goods , chewing through precious resources for our fancy and luxury .
A people and a government so addicted to the drug of money , so deeply addicted ( read : in debt ) that there are but glimmers of light to be found in a maze of tunnels .
In a world where the government no longer fears the people , but fears the spigot capped on the teat of corporate lobbying coffers , where only we could think this CARS program makes any sense .
Especially a politically motivated program that , I will agree , looks a lot better on paper than it does in practice , but only through the eyes of a junkie .
Maybe it is us who is in need of a mental makeover before we drive the political machine , which could only be considered a two - party clunker , to a major overhaul .
What do you think ?
Nonprofit organizations say they are upset that Congress and the Obama administration have not addressed their rising health care costs in the various health care proposals being floated on Capitol Hill .
The main bill in the House would award a tax credit to small businesses that provide their employees with health insurance  but nonprofits do not pay income taxes and thus would not benefit .
“ Why should employees of nonprofits be treated worse than employees of for - profit businesses ? ” said Jonathan A. Small , government affairs consultant at the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee of New York .
Nonprofit groups were hoping that the president would include them in his speech to Congress on Wednesday , but instead he mentioned only “ families , businesses and government . ”
Nightmare on J Street
At last , somebody found me out .
This week , former AIPAC and Israeli embassy official Lenny Ben-David published an article revealing that I had given a donation to the " pro-Israel and pro-peace " organization J Street .
Because I am of Lebanese descent , this clearly indicates that my dollars must be intended to advance some pernicious anti-Israel agenda — and that J Street must be the vehicle for those aims .
I would be only too happy to ignore Ben - David ’s article as a collection of cheap innuendo and loose associations , but the stakes are too high .
With J
Street ’s inaugural conference less than one week away , opponents are desperate that it fail .
The attacks on the organization , its founder Jeremy Ben - Ami , its staff , and their supporters have taken on an all too - familiar form — eschewing substance to malign the motives and associations of those they disagree with .
Ben -David and his supporters are now attacking J Street for accepting contributions from Americans of Arab descent .
The donations in question are largely symbolic , many of them in amounts between $ 30 - $ 100 , but his point is loud and clear — an organization that receives Arab - American support must , by definition , be suspect .
But why on earth should J Street be ashamed to have the support of Arab - Americans like me ?
And why should Arab - Americans worry that participating in the political life of their country and exercising their freedom of speech might — simply because of their ethnicity — harm the candidates and causes they hold dear ?
Ben -David ’s allegations offer two competing conclusions .
Either J Street is not sufficiently pro-Israel ( how else would it attract Arab - American support ? ) or there is a significant group of Arab Americans for whom being pro-Palestine and pro-Israel are not mutually exclusive .
He assumes , and hopes everyone else will also assume , that the former is self - evident and the latter is impossible .
He is wrong .
It is possible to be both pro-Israel and pro-Palestine , not out of some blanket support for either government , but out of a sincere belief that peace is in both people ’s best interests .
I hold that belief as a result of years of work within the Arab and Jewish American communities , working in partnerships not just with J Street but also with such groups as Americans for Peace Now , Brit Tzedek v’Shalom , and Israel Policy Forum .
I have traveled to the region and remain humbled and inspired by the courage and tenacity of those Israelis and Palestinians who refuse to submit to the cynicism or pessimism this conflict so often demands .
The reason J Street causes such fury among certain detractors often has nothing to do with its policy positions .
These people are angry because the political climate has shifted in a way that they no longer understand or control .
The generation that elected President Obama is not interested in being divided based on religion or ethnic heritage .
We are not interested in a zero - sum game .
We believe our elected officials must play a leadership role in brokering a two - state solution to this conflict , and that Arab and Jewish Americans must work together to support them .
How can anyone profess to believe in a two - state solution , in which Israelis and Palestinians will live side by side , if they view with suspicion Arab and Jewish Americans working together to get there ?
As a staff member at the Arab American Institute ( AAI ) , it was my job to engage Arab Americans in civic life , including giving time and money to the candidates and causes we believe in .
AAI ’s founder , James Zogby , has dedicated his career to combating those who would seek to exclude us because of our ethnic heritage .
We have the right to engage in American political life because we are Americans .
That we do so is to our credit , and not a negative reflection on those we choose to support in our common quest for peace .
At the United Nations in September , President Obama said that resolving the Israeli - Palestinian conflict is " absolutely critical " to American national interests .
Many of us – Arab and Jewish Americans alike — wholeheartedly agree .
Those Arab Americans who support J Street , like myself , do so because we are eager to work with an organization that views us as partners and does not seek to perpetuate the divisions and pathologies of the Middle East here in the United States .
Contrary to Ben - David ’s assertions , those of us who work in coalition to support President Obama ’s efforts are not the ones with explaining to do .

An Irish sporting hero 's decision to " out " himself as gay in a new book was hailed as a landmark on Thursday by one the country 's leading gay support groups .
Donal Og Cusack , 32 , a triple all - Ireland medallist and goalkeeper with the Gaelic Athletic Association 's hurling team in the southern county of Cork , reveals his sexual orientation in a new autobiography , Come What May .
" I get more out of men .
Always have .
I know I am different but just in this way .
Whatever you may feel about me or who I am , I 've always been at peace with it , " he says in the book , to be published on Friday .
The burning question about precisely where a person can smoke these days is flaring up again in Ontario , where a 48 - year - old trucker faces a $ 305 fine for lighting up on the job : while driving his big rig along Canada 's busiest highway .
The man , who hails from London , Ont. , a two - hour drive southwest of Toronto , was headed for the Ontario border city of Windsor when he was pulled over Wednesday along Highway 401 and given a ticket under the Smoke - Free Ontario Act .
The law , considered a Canadian standard - setter when it was passed in 2006 , forbids smoking in all workplaces and enclosed public spaces , including buildings , structures or vehicles worked in or frequented by employees , according to the government 's website .
" Examples of an enclosed workplace include the inside of a trailer office on a construction site , the inside of a loading dock , or the inside of a delivery truck , " the site says .
Ontario provincial police Const .
Shawna Coulter said the law is very explicit about what constitutes a workplace .
" It says the inside of any place , building , structure or vehicle that is part of the employee 's workplace , which if you 're driving a truck for long periods of time – that becomes your workplace . "
The driver , whose name was not immediately released , could have good reason to fight the ticket in court , said Doug Switzer , vice - president of the Ontario Trucking Association .
The provincial law ought not apply in the case of federally regulated trucking companies that operate in other provinces or the United States , Switzer said – nor should it be brought to bear on truckers who own and operate their own rigs and work alone .
" It is a little complicated on the enforcement end because you 've got thousands of people from OPP , municipal police forces and health unit enforcement staff , not all of whom are versed in the subtle nuances of the trucking industry or the smoking legislation , " Switzer said .
Julie Rosenberg , a spokeswoman for Ontario's Ministry of Health Promotion , refused to comment Thursday on whether or not the law would be applicable in the case of a truck belonging to a federally regulated company .
In the event the driver of the truck did not construe an employee as defined by the legislation , however , " the vehicle in question would not meet the definition of an enclosed workplace , " Rosenberg said in an email .
Transportation Minister Jim Bradley said he'd never heard of such a case , and while he could n't comment on any particular case , said he 'll be watching to see how this one unfolds .
" It would be interesting to see how this develops , " Bradley said .
" That 's interesting .
It 's a new one to me . "
Coulter said it was unclear whether the fine was the first of its kind in Ontario .
" We do n't track specific charges , but I do n't know that it 's been utilized in the past , " she said .
Nonetheless , that 's the way the law is supposed to work , said Health Promotion Minister Margarett Best .
" It 's about health , and I 'm not looking at this from the perspective of whether it's a milestone or not , " Best said of the charge .
" I 'm looking at it from the perspective of being concerned about the health of Ontarians . "
Neil MacKenzie , the manager of tobacco programs for the Windsor - Essex County Health Unit , said even a farmer 's enclosed tractor would be considered a work environment .

" Whether or not you have the sunroof open or windows down ... it's an enclosed workplace and you 're prohibited from smoking in that vehicle , " MacKenzie told Windsor radio station CKLW .
Still , no one would march into a field and fine a farmer for smoking in an enclosed tractor , he said .
" Before we take any radical action on it , we 'd confirm with the Ministry of Health whether there 's precedent , " MacKenzie said .
" We 'd make sure the farmer understood requirements and give the opportunity for full compliance . "
Ontario's Liberal government , first elected in 2003 , has been aggressive in its efforts to curb tobacco use in the province .
Last summer , the province amended the Highway Traffic
Act to prohibit smoking in cars carrying children .
Stringent anti-tobacco laws prohibiting smoking in covered public places and workplaces , like restaurants and bars , are also in effect in a number of other Canadian provinces and territories , including Manitoba , Saskatchewan , Quebec , the Maritime provinces , the Northwest Territories and Nunavut .
Last February , a 29 - year - old woman from the Sarnia , Ont. , area was charged under the ban after she was allegedly found smoking with five young children in the vehicle .
Officers said they found both the driver and a 19 - year - old female passenger smoking cigarettes .
Several provinces , meanwhile , plan to join forces against tobacco companies to recover health - care costs related to smoking .
Quebec confirmed earlier this month it was joining Ontario , British Columbia and New Brunswick in filing a multibillion - dollar lawsuit against tobacco manufacturers .
Ontario's $ 50 - billion lawsuit against three tobacco companies is aimed at recovering the cost of treating smoke - related illnesses dating back as far as 1955 .
The provinces began to consider legal action after a 2005 Supreme Court of Canada ruling that upheld British Columbia 's right to seek compensation against tobacco companies .

Advertisement British Airways is going where failures have gone before .
Three London to New York business class - only airlines have already collapsed - Silverjet , Maxjet , Eos - hit by rising oil prices .
But more than a year after the last one - Silverjet - went bust , British Airways is trying its own version .
The new service will fly from London 's City airport .
That could be a key difference from its failed competitors , which flew from Luton and Stansted - not particularly convenient for those in the financial heart of the capital .
And it means that high - flyers wo n't need to cross London to fly from Heathrow .
But there is a disadvantage too .
Refuelling stop Flying from London City means the planes need to land at a much steeper angle than normal - the Airbus A318 which is being used for the new service is approved for a five and a half degree approach slope , compared with three degrees for a normal approach .
It also has to carry less fuel on take - off .
And that means a refuelling stop in Shannon in the Republic of Ireland .
The planes will have to stop at Shannon to refuel
That adds time to the journey .
But on the plus side travellers can clear US immigration while in Ireland - so when they land in the States they can pass through the domestic gate which should be quicker .
British Airways says that , once you take that into account and the fact that bankers wo n't have to cross London to Heathrow , the new service will actually be quicker - especially on the return leg when there 's no need to stop in Shannon .
Environmental objection
The plane will carry only 32 passengers , in seats that recline to fully flat beds .
That has outraged environmentalists , who say each traveller will be responsible for about three times the emissions of regular flights .
And it sits somewhat at odds with the deal offered last week on behalf of the airline industry by BA 's boss , Willie Walsh , for carbon emissions to be cut by 50 % from 2005 levels by 2050 .
Silverjet , the UK 's first business only service , ceased operations last year
One new feature is the ability to send text messages and use the internet during the flight - which BA says is n't currently available on its other business class services .
But passengers will have to pay extra for it - with charging on a similar basis to how roaming works on a mobile phone .
Even when you 're buying a £ 4,000 return ticket , not everything is complimentary .
That price is also slightly more expensive than a more normal business class ticket from Heathrow .
At first the service will be once a day - except on Saturdays when London City is closed - before increasing to two flights a day from mid-October .
BA will have to make sure the service is reliable .
If there were any technical problems with the plane it could mean big delays waiting for a new flight .
The airline thinks it 's got a winning case for a new business service and will be hoping a resurgent banking sector will provide the custom .
But the economy is still struggling , businesses are trying to trim costs and some banks are worried about public perceptions of largesse after the taxpayer bail - out .
That 's all extra baggage for the new route to take on board .
The A318 is the smallest aircraft in BA 's fleet - and it's got another claim to fame too .
It 'll be the first plane since Concorde to carry the BA001 flight number .

Sichuan quake once - in-4000 - year event
People who were killed , injured or bereaved in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake had the cruel misfortune to be victims of an event that probably occurs just once in four millennia , seismologists report .
In a paper published in the journal Nature Geoscience , Dr Shen Zhengkang of the China Earthquake Administration and colleagues say the 12 May 2008 quake comprised a strong seismic wave , unusual geology and the failure of three subterranean ' barriers ' to resist the shock .
Using global positioning system ( GPS ) markers and data from satellite - borne interferometric radar , the scientists built up a picture of the Longmen Shan fault , on the northwest rim of the Sichuan basin , as it was gouged open by the 7.9 - magnitude temblor .
Nearly 88,000 people were killed in what was the largest seismic event in China in more than 50 years .
The investigators say the sub - surface geometry is complex , varying significantly along the length of the fault zone .
In the southwest of the zone , the fault 's plane dips slightly to the northwest .
It then rides up , becoming nearly vertical , in the zone 's northeast .
Added to this is a change in motion , or principal movement , along the fault .
The motion initially starts out as a thrust , a vertical movement in which lower layers of rock are pushed up and on top of higher layers .
Farther along the fault , this changes to so - called strike - slip movements , which are lateral .
Wave of energy
Three junction segments , which have held up for years , received extraordinary blows that day when the main shock was unleashed about 30 kilometres southwest of the city of Yingxiu , the authors say .
A wave of energy rocketed along the fault , ripping open the rock beneath Yingxiu as well as Beichuan and Nanba , which is where the biggest earth slippages , and fatalities , occurred .
The paper 's authors say that these three locations were ' barriers ' that were smashed down in a single , exceptional event and caused the rest of the fault to rip open .
" We estimate that the failure of barriers and rupture along multiple segments takes place approximately once in 4000 years , " they say .
Offering a morsel of comfort , Shen says , " There are still aftershocks , but I do n't think there is big chance in that region of another big one " for the foreseeable future .

UPDATE : Also available for Google ION !
PRINCETON , NJ -- Gallup 's October Crime poll finds 44 % of Americans in favor of making marijuana legal and 54 % opposed .
U.S. public support for legalizing marijuana was fixed in the 25 % range from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s , but acceptance jumped to 31 % in 2000 and has continued to grow throughout this decade .
" The highest level of support for decriminalizing the use of marijuana today is seen with self - described liberals , among whom 78 % are in favor . "
Public opinion is virtually the same on a question that relates to a public policy debate brewing in California -- whether marijuana should be legalized and taxed as a way of raising revenue for state governments .
Just over 4 in 10 Americans ( 42 % ) say they would favor this in their own state ; 56 % are opposed .
Support is markedly higher among residents of the West -- where an outright majority favor the proposal -- than in the South and Midwest .
The views of Eastern residents fall about in the middle .
The new findings come as the U.S. Justice Department has reportedly decided to loosen its enforcement of federal anti-marijuana laws by not pursuing individuals who buy or sell small amounts of the drug in conformity with their own states ' medical marijuana laws .
This seems likely to meet with U.S. public approval , as previous Gallup polling has found Americans generally sympathetic to legalizing marijuana for medical purposes .
In 2003 , 75 % of Americans favored allowing doctors to legally prescribe marijuana to patients in order to reduce pain and suffering .
Basic Support for Legalization Highest Among Liberals
The highest level of support for decriminalizing the use of marijuana today is seen with self - described liberals , among whom 78 % are in favor .
In contrast , 72 % of conservatives are opposed .
Moderates are about evenly divided on whether the use of marijuana should be legal , although they tilt against it ( 51 % vs. 46 % ) .
Somewhat milder differences are seen according to political party , mainly because of the tempered support of Democrats relative to that of liberals .
However , a solid 70 % of Republicans -- similar to the rate seen among conservatives -- are opposed .
Gallup also finds a generational rift on the issue , as 50 % of those under 50 and 45 % of those 50 to 64 say it should be legal , compared with 28 % of seniors .
Basic Support Swells Among Certain Groups
Most of the expansion in support for legalizing marijuana since Gallup last measured this in 2005 is seen among women , younger Americans , Democrats , moderates , and liberals .
By comparison , there has been little change in the views of men , seniors , Republicans , independents , and conservatives .
Regionally , support has grown the most in the West and Midwest .
Bottom Line
Public mores on legalization of marijuana have been changing this decade , and are now at their most tolerant in at least 40 years .
If public support were to continue growing at a rate of 1 % to 2 % per year , as it has since 2000 , the majority of Americans could favor legalization of the drug in as little as four years .
Americans are no more -- and no less -- in favor of legalizing marijuana when the issue is framed as a revenue - enhancement tool for state governments .
Regardless of how the question is asked , 53 % of Americans living in the West -- encompassing California , where the issue could be on the ballot in 2010 -- support legalization .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,013 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Oct. 1 - 4 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±4 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Until then , just make sure that they do n't do anything stupid - like give out their address or phone number to any " vampires " they may meet online or drink someone else 's blood ( a good way to contract any number of nasty , blood - borne pathogens ) , etc , etc .

Imagine what a dinner conversation would be like if you had decent table manners , but the ears of a lizard .
Not only would you have to stop eating whenever you wanted to speak , but , because parts of your ears are now attached to your jaw , you ’d have to stop eating whenever you wanted to hear anybody else , as well .
With no fork action on your end , your waiter would soon conclude that you were obviously “ done working on that ” and would whisk your unbreached baked ziti away .
Sometimes it ’s the little things in life that make all the difference  in this case , the three littlest bones of the human body .
Tucked in our auditory canal , just on the inner side of the eardrum , are the musically named malleus , incus and stapes , each minibone , each ossicle , about the size of a small freshwater pearl and jointly the basis of one of evolution ’s greatest inventions , the mammalian middle ear .
The middle ear gives us our sound bite , our capacity to masticate without being forced to turn a momentarily deaf ear to the world , as most other vertebrates are .
Who can say whether we humans would have become so voraciously verbal if not for the practice our ancestors had of jawboning around the wildebeest spit .
The middle ear also explains why mammals , as a group , have the sharpest hearing on Earth and the greatest diversity of listening styles , from the bats and dolphins that can detect pressure waves bouncing around at the spiky , ultrasonic end of the bandwidth , to elephants and humpbacked whales that can hear infrasonically , capturing the long , low sound prints muttered by their peers for miles around .
All told , a new study suggests , the middle ear was such a great invention , such an essential part of being a mammal , that once evolution had seized upon it , no crude substitute or older model would do .
In the current issue of the journal Science , paleontologists report on the fossilized remains of a newly discovered mammal from the Mesozoic era , some 123 million years ago .
The snouty , 3 - ounce , chipmunk - size animal , named Maotherium asiaticus , lived in what is now northeastern China and darted around the feet of the dominant dinosaur overlords , as mammals had been doing for some 100 million years .

( CNN ) --
The social networking site Facebook on Monday pulled a third - party application that allows users to create polls after a site member built a poll asking if President Obama should be killed .
There are more than 350,000 applications on Facebook .
The company says it disables any that violate its terms .
The U.S. Secret Service , the agency assigned to protect the president , has launched an investigation , agency spokesman James Mackin said .
" As is usually the case , our vigilant users reported it to us first , " Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN .
" The USSS [ Secret Service ] sent us an e-mail late this morning PDT asking us to take it down .
At that point , it had already been removed , and we let them know . "
Schnitt said the application " was immediately suspended while the inappropriate content could be removed by the developer and until such time as the developer institutes better procedures to monitor their user - generated content . "
Watch report on Facebook poll »
Facebook allows third - party developers to create applications -- such as polls and quizzes -- which are then made available to Facebook users , who use the applications to create specific content .
Users may choose to make their content available to the general population of Facebook or limit it only to their friends .
In this case , Schnitt said , the user made the poll asking whether Obama should be killed available to the general public .
The possible responses to the poll were " yes , " " maybe , " " if he cuts my health care " and " no . "
Schnitt said the poll " appears to have been posted over the weekend . "
CNN 's Martina Stewart contributed to this report .

Engineers in Korea have created a material that could allow super - dense “ millipede ” - style data storage systems to work at room temperature .
The discovery brings the technology closer to commercial reality – good news for people struggling with over - full digital memories .
A decade ago , IBM engineers unveiled the ultra - high - density “ millipede ” data storage system .
Now more than ever , people who want to store digital photos and video need this probe storage system – which can cram a terabit , or 125 gigabytes , into every square inch – but IBM ’s and other systems with similar designs remain frustratingly distant .
Millipede and other similar systems work on a simple principle : an incredibly sharp needle – the probe – etches data as a series of nanoscale pits in a tough polymer surface , and the same probe feels for what ’s been written to read it back .
Hard surface
But to punch a hole in the hard polymer surface the probe had to be hot enough to make the polymer temporarily pliable .
Raising a probe to the 350 °C necessary for each digital 1 and 0 to be written makes the system power - hungry , and that is keeping probe storage from the market , says Jin Kon Kim at Pohang University of Science and Technology in Kyungbuk , Korea .
Advertisement
His team has designed a probe storage system that does n’t need heat to function .
Instead , it uses an unusual “ baroplastic ” – a hard polymer that becomes soft when placed under pressure .
The first such materials were found a decade ago , but became soft only under high pressures of above 300 bar .
Kim ’s team has created a new baroplastic that goes through the transition at the much lower pressure of 60 bar : “ the lowest value among all block copolymers reported in the literature ” , says Kim .
Pressure probe
The Korean team has shown that the tip of an atomic force microscope ( AFM ) can etch the kind of tiny pits that store data in millipede - like systems simply by pressing on the new material .
Lighter pressure can be used to feel for and read out the pits without altering them .
It solves one issue but raises another , says David Wright at the University of Exeter , UK , who co-ordinates Protem , a Europe - wide project to explore the potential of probe storage .
“ The forces needed are relatively high , and this is likely to lead to tip wear issues , ” he says .
Even systems that use heat suffer such problems , and they would be worse if more force was being used , he says .
“ A tip might have to scan many kilometres of media in any real practical storage system – and most AFM tips wear out in much less than a metre of scanning . ”
Bilayer approach
Protem has been making some progress of its own , says Wright .
“ The key development on the polymer side is new bilayer materials , ” he says .
These combine a hard polymer skin just a few nanometres thick with a softer layer – for example polystyrene – beneath .
“ It combines the softness you want [ to avoid damaging the probe tip and for fast writing speeds ] with the thermal stability necessary for long data lifetimes . ”

During the question - and - answer portion of the event , Reagan returned to the topic , this time telling the students that lowering taxes increases revenue :
Q My name is Cam Fitzie and I 'm from St. Agnes School in Alexandria , Virginia .
I was wondering if you think that it is possible to decrease the national debt without raising the taxes of the public ?
PRESIDENT REAGAN : I do .
That 's a big argument that 's going on in government and I definitely believe it is because one of the principle reasons that we were able to get the economy back on track and create those new jobs and all was we cut the taxes , we reduced them .
Because you see , the taxes can be such a penalty on people that there 's no incentive for them to prosper and to earn more and so forth because they have to give so much to the government .
And what we have found is that at the lower rates the government gets more revenue , there are more people paying taxes because there are more people with jobs and there are more people willing to earn more money because they get to keep a bigger share of it , so today , we 're getting more revenue at the lower rates than we were at the higher .
And do you know something ?
I studied economics in college when I was young and I learned there about a man named Ibn Khaldun , who lived 1200 years ago in Egypt .
And 1200 years ago he said , in the beginning of the empire , the rates were low , the tax rates were low , but the revenue was great .
He said in the end of empire , when the empire was collapsing , the rates were great and the revenue was low .
From Salon 's Jeff Horowitz 's 2005 article , " My Right Wing Degree , " we find that O'Keefe has ties to the Leadership Institute , Morton Blackwell 's group that gave us Karl Rove and Jeff Gannon :
Thirty - five years ago , Blackwell dispatched a particularly promising 17 - year - old pupil named Karl Rove to run a youth campaign in Illinois ; Jeff Gannon , a far less impressive student , attended the Leadership Institute 's Broadcast Journalism School .

The Rutgers Centurion is a conservative monthly that got off the ground this fall with institute help .
Rutgers student James O'Keefe founded the magazine after coming across a conservative publication at Tufts ... The institute gave O'Keefe books on starting a publication , awarded him a $ 500 " Balance in Media Grant , " and suggested never - fail places on campus to ferret out liberal excess .
" They were really excited , " O'Keefe recalls .
We also learn that O'Keefe has been accused of dishonest editing in the past .
A Political Gadfly Lampoons the Left via YouTube ~ snip ~
Three years ago , Mr. O’Keefe said , he read " Rules for Radicals " by the left - wing icon Saul Alinsky , the Bible for many community organizers , including those at Acorn , the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now .
He absorbed in particular Rule 4 : " Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules . "
~ snip ~ Gregory Walker Levitsky , a friend at Rutgers , said " what disturbed James as a student was the double standard applied to conservative groups and conservative causes . "
" He likes making waves , " Mr. Levitsky added .
" But the hidden camera simply shows the truth . "
Not everyone among Mr. O’Keefe ’s acquaintances agrees .
Liz Farkas , a Rutgers student who called Mr. O’Keefe " a nice guy and a loyal friend , " said she grew disillusioned after he asked her to help edit the script of a Planned Parenthood sting .
" It was snippets to make the Planned Parenthood nurse look bad , " Ms. Farkas said .
" I said : ‘ It has no context .
You ’re just cherry - picking the nurse ’s answers . ’
He said , ‘ Okay ’ — and then he just ran it . "
Asked whether the left - leaning documentaries of Michael Moore do not do the same , Ms. Farkas said : " Michael Moore goes after the rich and powerful .
James is n’t doing that .
He goes after low - level bureaucrats and people who are trying to help low - income people . "
The son of a materials engineer and a physical therapist , Mr. O’Keefe grew up in Westwood , N.J. , becoming an Eagle Scout and starring his senior year in high school in the musical " Crazy for You . "
As a philosophy major at Rutgers , he founded a conservative monthly , The Centurion , that featured the Lucky Charms story and other efforts to expose what he saw as liberal absurdity or hypocrisy .
After graduating from Rutgers in 2006 , he spent a year working for the Leadership Institute , a group based outside Washington that trains young conservatives on college campuses .
Mr. O’Keefe was " very effective and very enthusiastic , " said Morton Blackwell , the institute ’s founder .
But Mr. Blackwell said Mr. O’Keefe was asked to leave because officials felt his video work might violate Internal Revenue Service rules barring nonprofit groups from trying to influence legislation .
~snip ~
http://www.nytimes.com/...
DUer mzmolly , in her investigative journal at DemocraticUnderground , questions the veracity of the edited video O'Keefe has produced :
" I 've never done anything wrong in my life . "
" They destroyed my family . " ~ a tearful Juan Vera Juan Carlos Vera , who claims he was trying to help people he thought were in danger , was fired by ACORN based upon the contents of a heavily edited , questionable video which can be viewed here : http://biggovernment.com/... /
Ironically , the video appears to bolster Mr. Vera 's version of events .
There is one statement that remains on the video , in spite of all the editing , that I feel substantiates the story presented by Mr. Vera .
About 4 minutes into the video , Hannah Giles states ~ " the girls are coming this weekend , that 's why we 're in an emergency situation , that 's why we like ran in here for help , because I wanna get them before the pimp has time to bond with them and you know , herd them away . "
Mr. Vera said he was trying to help people in danger .
The statement by Giles above , leads me to believe he 's being truthful in this assertion .
In a press conference Thursday at ACORN 's National City headquarters , Vera said statements he made in the video were taken out of context .
The now - former ACORN worker said he was merely trying to help the pair because he thought they were in danger .
" I never done anything wrong in my life , " Vera said .
" They destroyed my family . " I believe Juan Vera .
I would like to see ACORN reinstate his position until a full investigation ( including a review of all unedited tape recordings involved ) can be completed .
...
Of particular concern is the discrepancy between the content of the video - the manner in which it has been edited - and the transcripts of O'Keefe 's video :
For those who are interested , the transcripts can be found here :
http://biggovernment.com/... /
http://biggovernment.com/... /
And the video , here : http://biggovernment.com/...
Note , too , upon watching the video and reading the transcript , it is apparent , as Mr. Vera himself claims , that there was an obvious language barrier , which brings to question whether he really understood what the couple was asking of him .
On edit , of importance , too , is the fact that Vera did contact the National City police to report this couple .
Of interest to me is who may have helped O'Keefe and his scantily dressed sidekick , Hannah Giles .
That prompted me to dig a bit on my own :
Did The Leadership Institute fund James O'Keefe in his recent ACORN project ?
Posted by Emit on Sat Sep-19-09 06:58 PM
The Leadership Institute trains over 400 students in conjunction with the 9/12 Project March on Washington .
This past Friday , September 11 , 2009 , the Leadership Institute trained over 400 students in conjunction with the 9/12 Project March on Washington .
Tea Partiers from around the country came to the JW Marriott , across from Washington , DC ’s Freedom Plaza , and learned grassroots techniques that will make them more effective " online , on the ground , and on the Hill . "
This training was heavily promoted by FreedomWorks , the grassroots organization that launched the efforts that brought hundreds of thousands of activists to DC on September 12th to protest against the wasteful spending in Congress .
http://www.leadershipinstitute.org/...
Hmmmm , and they train college students to set up groups on campuses - Blackwell himself said in a video on their wesbite that they have provisions in place for all 4 - year colleges across the country via their just released CampusReform project .
See the project 's website here : http://www.campusreform.org/...
Hmmmm , what else do they train for and fund ?
Did The Leadership Institute fund James O'Keefe in his recent ACORN project ?
" O' Keefe insists that he and Giles 's work was done independently and rejects liberal suggestions that the videos were bankrolled by conservative organizations .
He does , however , acknowledge receiving help and advice from a conservative columnist and Web entrepreneur . "
He 's been with the Leadership Institute for some time .
The Leadership Institute helped James O'Keefe found The Rutgers Centurion , a conservative monthly magazine , after he was fired from the Daily Targum .
It would be plausible that the recent ACORN project of his was an effort assisted and funded by the Leadership Institute .
Maybe it was even the Institute 's own idea .
This needs to be researched .
I mean , look what was available to O'Keefe and Giles ...

In an earlier Kos diary , reference is made to O'Keefe " thanking " the Leadership Institute for " a $ 4000 monitor to make his movies ... "
First , recent history .
James O'Keefe founded The Rutgers Centurion , after he was kicked off the main Rutgers student paper .
As documented in a 2005 Salon Article O'Keefe got the money and technical know - how for the paper from The Leadership Institute , a right - wing organization specializing in campus astro - turf grass - roots .
By the way , the Leadership Institute also funds O'Keefe 's video work : as shown by this post where he thanks " LI " for a $ 4000 monitor to make his movies .
http://wwww.dailykos.com/...
Looks like O'Keefe 's blog has been scrubbed , so I was unable to verify that information first hand .
At a minimum , James E. O'Keefe III needs to release all unedited versions of his tapes .
All of them .
Only then can these ACORN workers be judged .
UPDATE : Thank you all for the recs !

UPDATE : I would like to give a special shout out to mzmolly , Turborama , starroute , Beaverhausen and other DUers who have been asking questions and digging deep into O’Keefe and the Leadership Institute this weekend .
This O'Keefe character needs to be exposed for what he is !
UPDATE : I just replaced one of my own links ( To the " A Political Gadfly Lampoons the Left via YouTube " story ) , because when I clicked on it myself , I got a virus alert .
Do n't know what that was about , but I hope others do not experience the same thing .
in 1983 , [ Steve Roberts ] packed up a Tandy 100 laptop and a 5 - watt solar panel , fleeing suburbia on his recumbent bicycle on what would become a 17,000 mile journey that forever cemented his place in the geek pantheon … not just as a technology hacker , but as one of the preeminent “ life hackers , ” pursuing his own dreams on his own terms and inspiring others to do the same .
In this 1989 video , recently unearthed by Hack a Day , [ Roberts ] reflects on the first 16,000 miles of his voyage , detailing some of the technology that went into his then - current ride , the Winnebiko II .
Next time you ’re comfortably working from the local park with your laptop tethered to a 3G connection , raise your latte in toast to [ Roberts ] , who was pioneering the “ mobile professional lifestyle ” more than two decades ago .
There was no Google Maps , no mainstream consumer internet , no 3G wireless .
It was all packet radio and acoustic couplers on pay phones .
Where he casually speaks of “ living in the computer networks , ” he ’s referring to CompuServe , GEnie and UUCPNET .
And next time you ’re trapped at a green light while the driver ahead of you is distracted by text messaging , you can curse thank [ Steve ] for that , too … with his handgrip - integrated keyboard , he may well have invented texting while driving .
[ Roberts ] is still blazing trails … tinkering , writing , and living the “ technomad ” lifestyle , now by sea instead of land .
You can follow along with his adventures on two web sites : microship.com is now primarily a retrospective of the past quarter century … the Winnebiko / BEHEMOTH bike projects and subsequent Microship trimaran , along with archives of his writings .
nomadness.com looks ahead to “ open - ended global voyaging ” on his new vessel , the Nomadness .
The site contains articles and reviews , photos , and his blog with current status updates .
There ’s also the Nomadic Research Labs Store , where you ’ll find [ Roberts ’ ] own books , project surplus , and boating and electronic parts .
Toronto researchers have developed a portable device they say will accurately diagnose prostate cancer in 30 minutes .
The microchip technology , created by a pair of University of Toronto scientists , will be able to determine the severity of the tumours through a simple urine sample and produce quick diagnosis with no need for painful biopsies .
Now heading into the engineering stage , a BlackBerry - sized device should be available for doctors ' use within two to three years and could be tuned to detect a broad range of cancers and infectious ailments , the researchers say .
" The goal would be to produce a result ..... while you 're sitting in the waiting room , " says engineering professor Ted Sargent , holder of the U of T's Canada Research Chair in Nanotechnology .
A paper on the work was published today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology .
The device uses a fingertip - sized microchip - fitted with nanometre - sized meshing - programmed to detect DNA sequences and proteins that are uniquely produced by specific cancers or pathogens .
These " biomarkers " would be drawn from urine or blood samples by molecular " bait " placed on the meshed surface of the chips .
" We simply put a sample on the chip and we have a nice small chip reader that then analyses it and tells you what markers are in the sample , " says Shana Kelley , a U of T pharmacology professor and study co-author .
Detected markers can tell you not only which kind of cancer is present , but also the stage and severity the tumour has attained .
" That 's very important to be able to do that , because cancers are actually a bunch of different diseases with different levels of aggressiveness , " Kelley says .
" And particularly in prostate cancer , there are very non-aggressive forms ..... that you simply want to leave alone , " she says .
Kelley says the technology could herald an age of surgery - free diagnosis for cancer patients .
" The real drive is towards non-invasive diagnostics so we can just screen people without having to take parts of their organs in order to do it , " Kelley says .
Dr. Tom Hudson , scientific director of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research , says the study is " proof of principle " that it is possible to have a quick , affordable technology that can test for many different cancer biomarkers at once .
" This is a critical step , " he says .
" They have shown you can detect this gene mutation ( for prostate cancer ) .
And if you extrapolate that you can do it for one gene , you could probably do it for 100 or 1,000 . "
Hudson says scientists face three major challenges in using biomarkers to more accurately and quickly detect cancer - a necessary step towards more personalized , targeted cancer therapies .
Scientists around the world are working hard on the first challenge , which is identifying biomarkers for specific cancers , and testing those markers ' usefulness in diagnosing cancer in patients .
Some 1,000 biomarkers have been found , but Hudson says only nine of those have been validated so far in the clinic .
Until now , solutions for the other two challenges - finding a way to test for many different biomarkers at once , and developing a cost - effective technology to do it - have lagged behind the biomarker search .
" They ( Kelley and Sargent ) are working on part two and three of this equation , " says Hudson , who cautioned the device was still a long way off from being a staple in doctor 's offices .
" How we make these ( biomarker ) tests happen in the clinic or in the clinical lab really needed some advances in technology .
And they 've done all the proof of principles here for a technology that 's going to work . "

For the initial work , Sargent and Kelley looked at prostate cancer , which has a set of signature biomarkers that have been shown in many studies to accurately portray the existence and severity of that disease .
The pair showed that the chips were well able to pick up these makers in the miniscule concentrations that would typically be found in the urine of prostate cancer patients .
Currently prostate cancers are diagnosed using what is known as a prostate specific antigen or PSA test .
The test has proven unreliable in determining the severity of the ailment , however , and has resulted in a large number of unnecessary or overly aggressive surgeries .
But even now , Kelley says , they are shifting the technology 's sights on to other cancers and ailments .
" We focused in on prostate cancer in our first set of studies , but we 've already done now a little bit of work with head and neck cancer , " Kelley says .
" But really any cancer where there is an established molecular profile , we should be able to pick up using this device , " she says .
A six - inch cube in its current configuration , Kelley says the device can be miniaturized in the development and manufacturing process down to basic BlackBerry size .
Sargent says he envisions the devices being a commonplace tool in doctors ' offices around the world .
Along with the handheld detector itself , physicians would be provided with a binder full of chips that had been tuned to detect different cancers and diseases .
" Say you were looking for H1N1 ( influenza ) or some dangerous infectious agent , there could be chips specific to those , " he says .
" You would just insert the proper one , " he says .
As more disease biomarkers are discovered , chips could be easily programmed to find and detect them at the low concentrations they typically attain in blood or urine .
The bat that came out of the dark
By Matt Walker
Editor , Earth News
A tiny bat living in central Italy has emerged from the dark and started hunting by day .
This switch in hunting strategy is highly unusual among insectivorous bats , which routinely hunt at twilight or by night to avoid predators .
Yet a small group of soprano pipistrelles has been spotted brazenly flying by day in a mountain canyon within an Italian beech forest .
Only one other species of insectivorous bat frequently flies during daylight .
A research team lead by Dr Danilo Russo , a bat expert from the University of Bristol , UK and the University of Naples Federico II in Italy report the discovery in the journal Mammalian Biology .
This behaviour , performed systematically , was absolutely new to us
Dr Danilo Russo
Together with colleagues from both institutions , Dr Russo initially set out to find the roosts of another species , the barbastelle bat ( Barbastella barbastellus ) , in the beech forests within a mountain canyon near the village of Villavallelonga in the Abruzzo , Lazio and Molise National Park in central Italy .
" One late afternoon , walking in the woodland , we spotted some bats flying unusually early , " Dr Russo explains .
" We thought the phenomenon might be occasional , as sometimes happens , so we came back at the same time on the following days and the bats were there . "
The scientists established that the bats are soprano pipistrelles ( Pipistrellus pygmaeus ) , a species with a high - pitched call that is closely related to the common pipistrelle ( Pipistrellus pipistrellus ) .
The bats routinely come out to forage well before sunset , commonly feeding on gnats , wasps and bugs .
Deadly trade - off
Such behaviour is extremely rare for insectivorous bats .
These bats face a trade - off .
During the day there are more insects around to feed on .
But the bats themselves are very vulnerable to being caught and eaten by predatory birds , which fly by sight .
So instead , the bats have evolved to fly in the dark , only emerging during the hours of twilight or darkness .
That keeps the bats safe , and their echolocating ability allows them to navigate and hunt those insects that are still about .
Yet over many evenings spread over two summers , the researchers continually saw this one population of soprano pipistrelles hunting insects by day .
The bats only do so at the bottom of the canyon , where local conditions seem to provide a safe haven for day flying .
A lone soprano pipistrelle flying more than an hour before sunset can just be seen near the bottom right of the photograph
The forest canopy lining the canyon protects the bats from predators , while offering a bountiful supply of insect food .
The researchers suspect that other local populations of bats may also have become day - hunters .
But they have not been recorded before by scientists as " bat researchers seldom look for bats in daytime " , says Dr Russo .
" In my career I have rarely come across a fully occasional daytime flight , " he adds .
Individual bats are sometimes seen flying during the day .
But they usually do so soon after hibernation , when they are starving and need to replace fat reserves depleted during the winter .
" But this behaviour , performed systematically , was absolutely new to us . "
Only one other bat , the Azores noctule ( Nyctalus azoreum ) , is known to regularly hunt by day .
This species hunts insects in the dry forests of the Azores , where there are no predatory birds that fly by day .

Jazzwares Astro Boy Figure Review
| By
I have so much stuff waiting to get reviewed and I just sort of randomly picked this because I thought it might be neat to review .
Astro Boy is often credited as being the “ first Anime ” as it was one of the first really big Japanese cartoons based off a Manga .
I never followed Astro Boy much since he ’s always creeped me out .
Astro Boy basically looks like a prepubescent Namor from Marvel Comics .
Astro Boy ’s story is being remade into a new CGI movie by Imagi films which brought us the underrated TMNT a couple years back .
It ’s hitting this winter and with it comes toys .
Astro Boy has been slightly revamped for this movie , thankfully , to make his look something slightly less appealing to pedophiles .
As for Astro Boy himself , the story is basically robot Pinocchio that then fights crime and oppression .
Jazzwares new Astro Boy line is out in a handful of retailers and despite having only mild interest in the character I could n’t help but be drawn in to the figures .
This is the smaller scale Astro Boy , I assume it ’s supposed to be 3 3/ 4 scale since 3 3/ 4 is the new black , but he actually comes up a little shorter .
Packaging :
The packaging is pretty decent , just hip enough to be trendy but not flashy enough to be outstanding .
It looks a bit like a cross between the new Kamen Rider figures and Bakugan packaging .
Either way , the figure inside looks much better than those franchise ’s toys so that ’s why I decided to buy him .
The front of the package shows off the figure as well as his accessory ( in this case normal feet ) and looks clean enough .
There are a few futuristic indentations on the front which made it appear like maybe there were more accessories inside .
Not sure if that was an intended optical illusion or if I ’m just nuts .
The back of the package shows some other figures in the series .
pretty standard fare .
Articulation :
Articulation is actually pretty good which is what helped draw me in .
Astro has a ball jointed head with a decent amount of movement .
Not a ton , but enough to get you by .
He has pin / post style ball jointed shoulders , a waist cut , hinged elbows , knees and standard cut legs .
Astro also has swivel in his feet , since you can remove them …
More on that later .
Overall I think you can get Astro Boy into all his core poses .
He ’s actually a lot of fun to pose and seems just like he ’s flying when he ’s got his rocket boots in .
I enjoyed posing him and thought he ’d look great with a posing stand .
The sculpt is really charming and he looks like the original Astro Boy which is why I chose him .
Even though I never cared much for Astro Boy ’s design , I ’m old school and wanted this figure to look like the title character …
Although it appears as though in the movie he rarely looks like this .
Again , the character has some seriously perverted overtones so I understand why they put pants on him .
His face has been “ matured ” a bit which is nice because the fruity eye lashes and rosy cheeks would n’t have appealed to kids .
It also would n’t have appealed to me , but it might appeal to creepy dudes in their 40’s .
Anywho , the rest of the sculpt is pretty simple , clean and fits the bill .
He has some translucent plastic on his feet to simulate the rocket flying portion .
The paint work is pretty good and while I guess it could be sharper in certain respects I ca n’t complain .
I think it ’s better than a lot of mass market toys out there .
Jazzwares is a pretty small company but this figure is way better than the larger Bandai company Kamen Rider toys .
You can tell Jazzwares put some love into this toyline and did n’t just try to cheap it out and make a buck like so many toy companies seem to do these days .
Here ’s where this figure kind of goes in the toilet .
I was all ready to RAVE about how much fun this toy was …
Until I tried to swap out the feet .
I loved the idea that this guy came with regular feet .
I prefer the flying feet , but I figured he ’d look cool with his regular feet as well .
I tried to pop them out and I found they were VERY hard to pull out .
As I fought with the replacement feet , I realized that I was probably going to break this figure if I was n’t careful .
It ’s made of a hard plastic and should n’t break , but these rocket boots were stuck in there deep .
It was like I was trying to remove a joint that was n’t intended for removal .
I decided to check the instructions , but low and behold , there are none .
I ’m sure the kids who this is marketed for have no idea what a boil and pop is .
What sucks even more is , even after doing a boil and pop I could n’t get one of the boots out .
It was a real pain in the ass .
I actually had to use a ton of force and stick the edge of a spoon in there to pry it loose .
I was using so much force that when it did finally pop free , it flew across the room and literally disappeared .
So now I have one rocket boot .
BOO !
Seriously Jazzwares , how are kids supposed to change these feet around when a grown ass man can’t ?
Additional Notes :
Astro Boy looks like it ’s going to be a kids movie .
Not one of those “ parents want to go see it ” kids movies either .
I do n’t think it ’s going to be stupid , but I doubt it ’ll be one I see in the theatre unless reviews are just really good .
The movie is already getting some drama from conservative right wing nutjobs who say it ’s promoting socialism or some such nonsense , so who knows if it ’ll be a hit .
Value :
Value is pretty good if you consider he ’s $ 5.99 and that it ’s a fairly quality figure .
Unfortunately I no longer have the rocket blast boots .
Why could n’t they have just made that easier ?!
I ’m not sure I want to plunk down another $ 6 to have a pair with the rockets .
I ’m torn .
I also think I warped the leg a bit yanking on it .
Make no mistake this figure is sturdy , it ’s just poorly engineered in terms of swapping the limbs .
Score Recap :
Packaging – 6
Sculpting – 7
Articulation – 6
Accessories – Extra Feet
Value – 6
Overall – 6 out of 10
I ’m probably going to pick up a couple more figures from the toyline because they look cool .
That ’s a big compliment as I ’m not a huge fan of the anime , but the toys are neat .
Jazzwares deserves some credit for making what looks to be decent toys at an affordable price , however the swappable feet are really poorly engineered and bring the overall score down a bit in my view .
Had I not had issues with the feet , you could bump this up a half point or so .
Has a major change in circumstances affected your ability to pay alimony ?
If you or your spouse is seeking alimony ( spousal support ) or is considering seeking alimony , effective legal counsel is critical to the outcome .
Talk to an alimony lawyer at The Law Offices of Abbott & Abbott , P.C. , in Marietta or Canton , Georgia .
Alimony is a highly subjective decision .
If it goes to court , the judge will decide whether your divorce will include spousal support , how much it will amount to and for how long it will be paid .
Your divorce lawyer can present the necessary information with an explanation for why alimony is or is not necessary .
Courts generally base alimony on need and ability — the need of one spouse and the other spouse ’s ability to pay .
Alimony can provide the dependent spouse with temporary support while pursuing education or a job , for example .
— the need of one spouse and the other spouse ’s ability to pay .

In Georgia , a long - term marriage is generally regarded as 10 or more years .
Spousal support is more common in long - term marriages .
is generally regarded as 10 or more years .
Spousal support is more common in long - term marriages .
While the length of alimony is discretionary to the judge , a guideline approach is to take one - quarter to one - third of the length of the marriage for the payment of alimony .
If circumstances change after the divorce and there are reasons to change the amount of alimony , talk to your attorney about alimony modifications .
Because alimony is entirely within the judge ’s discretion , your lawyer ’s aggressive representation can be the difference in whether alimony is awarded .
Alimony Modifications
We help our clients understand their alimony obligations as well as their ability to ask the court for relief of those obligations when the facts warrant it .
If your divorce settlement agreement states that alimony is non modifiable , you will not be able to change your alimony payment no matter how much your circumstances or those of your ex-spouse may have changed .
you will not be able to change your alimony payment no matter how much your circumstances or those of your ex-spouse may have changed .
To modify your alimony obligation , the judge will require proof of a major change in your ability to pay .
Did you lose your job or your ability to work ?
Have you suffered a catastrophic illness or injury ?
in your ability to pay .
Did you lose your job or your ability to work ?
Have you suffered a catastrophic illness or injury ?
If you have questions about your alimony obligation , bring in your divorce decree and your lawyer will review it with you .
Has your ability to pay changed substantially ?
bring in your divorce decree and your lawyer will review it with you .
Has your ability to pay changed substantially ?
Alimony is based on need as well as the ability to pay .
Has your ex-spouse ’s need for alimony changed ?
Did your ex-spouse get married or get a high - paying job ?
Do not make changes in your alimony payments unless the court approves the changes .
Changing the payment without a court order can result in a contempt of court action .

In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit .
Not a nasty , dirty , wet hole , filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell , nor yet a dry , bare , sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat : it was a hobbit - hole , and that means comfort .

The tumor microenvironment ( TME ) is comprised of an array of cell types , including immune and inflammatory cells , adipose cells , neuroendocrine cells , and cancer - associated fibroblasts .
Additionally , blood and lymphatic vascular networks and extracellular matrix components create a diverse and multifaceted situation .
Understanding how all of these elements interact requires the ability to distinguish individual cell types -- something that is difficult to do using bulk cell approaches .
Single cell gene expression analyses offer a high - resolution understanding of the TME .
Carroll wrote about his wild years at a New York school
US writer and musician Jim Carroll , best know for writing The Basketball Diaries , has died in New York aged 60 following a heart attack .
Carroll 's 1978 book , which was made into a film starring Leonardo DiCaprio , was about his formative years as a star player and drug user .
The poet , who was also linked with The Doors and Lou Reed , appeared in artist Andy Warhol 's films .
Singer Patti Smith said he was " the best poet of his generation " .
The musician told the New York Times that his work was " sophisticated and elegant " .
His self - titled band was later formed with the assistance of Smith , and their debut album was called Catholic Boy .
Carroll returned to writing on a full - time basis in the mid-1980s , but his debut novel remained unfinished .
When you get right down to it , Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves does n't blaze any trails .
You can point to a half - dozen heroes Nathan Drake looks and sounds like .
He hangs out in environments that look like they were taken from the Tomb Raider series .
At one point — and boy was it a facepalm moment — he solves a puzzle by moving mirrors to redirect light .
You could turn Uncharted 2 into a fine drinking game if you want to start yelling out where these set pieces and action scenes come from .
On the other hand , this may be the best action game released in the past ten years .
It 's not just a good game , it 's a game that makes you wonder why other games are n't better .
Complaining about Uncharted 2 being reminiscent of past games is like tearing down Christina Hendricks because other women also have breasts .
So what does the game do so right ?
I 'm glad you asked .
Title Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves Developer Naughty Dog Publisher Sony Computer Entertainment Price $ 59.99 Shop.ars Platform PlayStation 3
The characters feel real
" I did n't ask for your heroics , " a woman tells Nate at one point in the game .
Nate understands the same thing the player does : if she had to ask for them , they would n't be heroics .
Drake is an oddly human lead for a video game , even if his escapes do stretch the bounds of the believable .
That 's what makes him great though ; we get the sense if we had just a bit more upper body strength , or if we read just a few more books , then we could do the things he does in the game .
Also spectacular is the voice acting .
This is the new high water mark for writing and voice acting in video games .
The conversations flow naturally , no one breaks character , and people actually have interesting things to say .
The net effect is a game that is n't as good as a movie — it 's actually better than most movies .
Watch the body language and expressions on characters that are n't the focal point of certain scenes ; they 'll react to what 's going on .
In some places , the silences are more telling than the words .
Character interaction is natural , nuanced , and constructed in a way that actually makes sense .
This is one of the rare games that I played without subtitles , because they move faster than the spoken word , and the jokes and dramatic sections work better when you do n't know what someone will say next .
Nathan Drake is a funny , self - deprecating guy .
His friends and enemies are just as well - developed .
Even better , although he often seems somewhat super - heroic , Drake can be hurt .
He can be broken .
At parts of the game he looks battered by what 's going on around him , both physically and emotionally .
When he gets angry , it 's in a way that feels real and biting .
The story itself is no great shakes , and you 'll be able to see many of the plot twists coming a mile away .
What 's special about this game are the people in it , and how they act around each other .
That 's a rare thing in any game , much less an action title .
( All that stuff I just said ?
Do n't apply it to the villain .
Seriously , the accent is the most interesting thing about him .
Just saying . )
The levels may be linear , but the action is n't
The gun fights in Uncharted 2 are good , but they 'd better be , because you 'll be spending a lot of time with a firearm in your hands .
At first , the gunplay may seem a little simplistic , but the options the game gives you as you tackle each situation are many .
You can take the stealth route and silently take down some enemies to improve your odds .
You can literally run and gun , although you 'll eat through your ammo rather quickly .
Or , you can take a more measured approach and move across each set piece slowly , aiming with precision .
Whenever I died in a section a few times , I would try to attack it from another angle , or with a new idea about how to survive , and I was always pleasantly surprised by what I found .
Your tactics change depending on which of the game 's many and impressive guns you 're holding , or you can use your grenades extensively , or just run at someone when they 're reloading their shotgun and do things with your hands .
You have a limited reticule when you blind fire from cover , and the cover mechanic itself is much improved from the first game ; the gun fights feel much better , and the controls have been tightened until they scream .
Even better , the gunfights often have a vertical element ; you 'll have to pay attention to what 's below you and above you the entire time .
The level design in the areas where the game throws a large amount of enemies at you is amazing , and it adds to the replay value of the game .
The combat is n't a chore ; you 'll want to play each section multiple times to check out all your options .
There is one scene — and I wish I could go into more detail but I do n't want to spoil anything — that is set up in a way that I found utterly original .
It involves a road sign , and I wonder if people will be as thrilled with it as I was .
That 's how impressive Uncharted 2 is : a random gun fight in the middle of the game is given as much love as a major set piece .
Two - thirds of the way through the game , I was still finding new animations and hand - to - hand fighting moves .
You always feel like something interesting and fresh is right around the corner .

CowDetectCBM is a completely new method for detecting cow signals .
The movement and position of the cows in the cowshed are observed using a technology similar to that used in Global Positioning Systems where data is registered , processed and received on a hand terminal by the production manager .
At the same time the manager gets a modern tool for communication about the day 's tasks and the cows condition .
No more yellow sticky notes or slips of paper that get lost - the data is supplied at the point where it is used .
Right into the hands of the person who has too convert the observations to actions .
Everything take place in real time , and dat can be displayed on the hand terminal as the production manager does his rounds .
From idea to reality Good ideas often originate with the person that needs a solution .
However , the ideas do not lead to a serial production very often , but in few cases they do .
Read more Benefits in many ways
During the development phase leading researchers have indicated a possible additional profit of approx .
EURO 335 per animal and per annum , if the production manager converts the signals to actions .

The state ’s four health insurers posted net losses for the second quarter , citing continuing pressure from the economic downturn .
Among the factors contributing to the nonprofits ’ performance were increasing medical expenses , higher claim costs associated with newly insured members , employers shifting to less profitable products , and people using more health services because they fear losing their jobs and company - paid insurance coverage .
Last year , all four insurers showed gains during the second quarter .
Because the state is a highly competitive insurance market , health plans typically operate on thin margins .
But the recession has eroded their profitability , at least temporarily , according to financial reports filed with the state Department of Insurance .
“ We ’ve been seeing some signs of increased utilization of health care services that appears to be fueled by people anticipating losing their jobs or by people who have already been terminated but have n’t yet lost their health benefits , ’’ said Jim DuCharme , chief financial officer at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in Wellesley , the state ’s second - largest health insurer .
DuCharme said it is too soon to say whether the trend will accelerate enough to throw off insurers ’ budget projections for the rest of 2009 .
Health plans say they expect their financial conditions to improve in the second half of the year when higher premiums - paid by employers to insurers - typically go into effect .
Boston - based Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts , the state ’s largest health plan , reported the biggest net loss : $ 33.6 million for the three months ending June 30 .
That included a $ 23.1 million loss for its health maintenance organization subsidiary .
The insurer posted combined income of $ 30.8 million in last year ’s second quarter .
Fallon Community Health Plan , based in Worcester , reported a net loss of $ 3.9 million for the April - to - June period , compared with net income of $ 1.2 million for the same quarter in 2008 .
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care posted a loss of $ 2.3 million for the most recent quarter .
It had net income of $ 600,000 last year .
Tufts Health Plan in Watertown had the narrowest deficit of the four insurers , reporting a second - quarter net loss of $ 204,000 .
A year ago , it posted quarterly income of $ 24.9 million .

I ’m busy preparing a tutorial for DEFUN on Saturday , and was putting together the “ further reading ” slides for the attendees , so they have material to go to for deeper reading .
Here ’s my basic “ How to learn about parallel programming in Haskell ” reading list .
Learn Parallel Haskell
Does anyone else have favourite learning materials for parallel and concurrent programming in GHC Haskell ?
Let ’s not beat around the bush here , Internet Explorer is garbage .
It has been the thorn in the side for every web developer that has walked the Earth .
The Internet would be a much better place without it .
Now that I have that out of the way , I ’ll get down to showing you how to remove Internet Explorer of any version on an platform .
Internet Explorer 6
Windows XP and Windows Server 2003
Start ->Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs
Cick Add / Remove Windows Components
Locate Internet Explorer and uncheck it
Click Next and continue to follow the prompts
Note : Although this will remove all the links to Internet Explorer on your system it will not actually delete IE completely , as it is integrated with the Windows Shell it will still exist on your computer and be used for browsing files .
Chrome Frame
Our friends at Google have offered us another solution for those who cannot uninstall Internet Explorer 6 .
If you are not an Administrator on your system and cannot remove IE or install an alternate browser then Chrome Frame is the solution you ’re looking for .
After installing the plugin your browser will be able to render websites using Chrome ’s engine , meaning your old and dusty copy of IE6 will be able to run HTML5 and not mangle every other site out there .
How do you get this plugin ?
Just grab it at Google Code .
Internet Explorer 7
Windows XP and Windows Server 2000 / 2003
Start ->Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs
Locate Internet Explorer 7 and click Remove
Note : Uninstalling Internet Explorer 7 will result in Internet Explorer 6 being restored
Windows Vista
Start ->Control Panel ->Programs and Features
Click View Installed Updates
Locate Internet Explorer 7 and click Uninstall
Note :
If the above method does not work for you try following these steps instead :
Navigate to C: \WINDOWS\ie7 \spuninst\
Run spuninst.exe

A long time ago we heard about the UK considering testing out some non lethal directed energy gear .
Basically a beam - based weapon which would cause a burning sensation to discourage a victim ( or attacker ) , but not actually damage skin or leave burn marks .
This is what the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate , JNLWD , has been exploring since 2005 .
But according to project engineer Wesley Burgei , they 've still got a few bugs left to work out :
" We have established the minimum irradiance to cause a sensation and have characterised where thermal injury begins , " he says .
" But the exact operating irradiance which balances a useful military effect with a conservative margin of safety has not been nailed down yet . "

In plain words ?
There are some itty bitty safety issues .
Thankfully those will be ironed out before the weapons ever hit the streets due to some UN protocol on blinding laser weapons .
It turns out that they forbid weapons which would penetrate the retina and cause blindness .
It seems odd that a beam - based weapon could affect skin without damaging eyesight , but , according to Burgei , it 's entirely possible to use a " retina safe " wavelength .
It 's great that safety is a priority in the design and creation of these beam - based weapons , but Steve Wright , a non lethal weapons analyst at Leeds Metropolitan University , raises an interesting point about them :
" Persuading by pain rather than brain - through conversation - has led to push - button torture in the past .
If it leaves no mark on the skin how will anyone prove it 's been abused ? "

Tasers and the like leave evidence , marks and traces of use , but once they 're within proper safety limitations , beam - based weapons like the one being built by the JNLWD wo n't .
Not to start the " Oh , no !
They 'll be abused ! " train , but how will we regulate them ?

Find My iPhone to the rescue again !
Pittsburgh Police nabbed three robbery suspects over the weekend , after the man they allegedly robbed used the MobileMe online service to point police to their location .

I 'm relieved to see he called the cops and did n't take chances like the guys that personally tracked down a swiped iPhone back in June .
That was an amazing tale , though .

The weekend robbery happened in ( the apparently appropriately named ) Shadyside .
North Versailles police have three suspects in custody , and recovered a pellet gun amongst various stolen items .
So for $ 99 a year , Apple 's MobileMe gets you Find My iPhone , email / calendar sync , photo gallery space , and iDisk online backup .
But with so many free online services these days , it 's really only the tracking / remote wipe feature that interests me ( even though someone can just pop up out the SIM card or switch it off if they get into the phone itself ) .

The % key is one of the best features of vim : it lets you jump from { to } , [ to ] , and so on .
However , it does not work by default with quotes : Either " or ' , probably because the opening and closing quote are the same character , making implementation more difficult .
Thinking a bit more about the problem , I 'm convinced that it should be implemented , by counting if the number of preceding quotes is odd or even and jumping to the previous or next quote , accordingly .

Using data on movie - rating patterns , new Wharton research challenges current thinking on the Long Tail effect — a widely publicized theory that suggests the Internet drives demand away from hit products with mass appeal , and directs that demand to more obscure niche offerings .
In a working paper titled , “ Is Tom Cruise Threatened ?
Using Netflix Prize Data to Examine the Long Tail of Electronic Commerce , ” Wharton Operations and Information Management professor Serguei Netessine and doctoral student Tom F .
Tan pull information from the movie rental company Netflix to explore consumer demand for smash hits and lesser - known films .
Netflix made its data available as part of a $ 1 million prize competition to encourage the development of new ways that will improve its ability to introduce customers to lesser - known titles they might find appealing .
The Long Tail theory suggests that , as the Internet makes distribution easier — and uses state - of - the - art recommendation systems that allows consumers to become aware of more obscure products — demand will shift from the most popular products at the “ head ” of a demand curve — as charted on an xy axis — to the aggregate power of a long “ tail ” made up of demand for many different niche products .
The Wharton researchers find that the Long Tail effect holds true in some cases , but when factoring in expanding product variety and consumer demand , mass appeal products retain their importance .
The researchers argue that new movies appear so fast that consumers do not have time to discover them , and that niche movies are not any more well - liked than hits .
According to Netessine , the Long Tail effect may be present in some cases , but few companies operate in a pure digital distribution system .
Instead , they must weigh supply chain costs of physical products against the potential gain of capturing single customers of obscure offerings in a rapidly expanding marketplace .
Companies , they add , must also consider the time it takes for consumers to locate off - beat items they may want .
“ There are entire companies based on the premise of the Long Tail effect that argue they will make money focusing on niche markets , ” says Netessine .
“ Our findings show it ’s very rare in business that everything is so black and white .
In most situations , the answer is , ‘ It depends . ’
The presence of the Long Tail effect might be less universal than one may be led to believe . ”
The Long Tail theory was developed in 2004 by Chris Anderson , editor - in - chief of Wired magazine .
Anderson is also author of The Long Tail : Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More .
The key difference between the opinion of the book and the study by Wharton researchers is how they define “ hits ” and “ niches . ”
In the book , Anderson focuses on the definition of hits in absolute terms such as the top 10 or top 1,000 products , while Netessine and Tan argue that , to take growing product variety into account , one has to define popularity in relative terms , such as the top 1 % or top 10 % of products , to properly assess the presence or absence of the Long Tail .
In an e-mail , Anderson says the Wharton paper and other academic evaluations that are critical of the Long Tail theory are not relevant because they take a percentage approach to evaluating the power of the head and tail of demand .
“ Although academics are free to do all the relative analysis they want , it is incorrect to apply it to my theory , ” he writes .
Anderson argues that defining the head and tail of demand in percentage terms is meaningless in a market with unlimited inventory , such as a retailer with digital distribution .
For example , take a company with 1,000 different items in which the top 100 — or 10 % — account for 50 % of sales .
If 99,000 more items are added to the catalog and sales of the top 100 fall to 25 % of the total , it may take another 900 items to make up the next 25 % .
In this case , Anderson would argue that sizable demand has shifted down the tail toward more people selecting fewer products .
In relative terms , however , 1 % of the products now constitute 50 % of the revenues , which would make it appear that there was a greater importance of the hit products .
But since real people experience the world in absolute numbers , not percentages , this is a statistical illusion , he states .
The truth is that people are choosing a wider array of titles .
“ Nobody in the business world is confused about this , thankfully , ” Anderson adds .
Netessine , who shared drafts of the paper with Anderson , says the Long Tail theory is “ fascinating ” and he notes that he recommends Anderson ’s book to incoming MBA students .
Nonetheless , he and Tan contend that Anderson ’s focus on absolute demand can be misleading .
“ One has to be careful about defining hits and niches in the Internet era , ” the paper states .
“ In a brick - and - mortar world , where product variety is relatively stable and all products are consumed at some rate , hits and niches are typically defined in absolute terms ( e.g. , the top 10 , the bottom 100 movies ) .
However , product variety has been skyrocketing in the Internet age , and therefore more and more products can be left unnoticed by consumers , or are being discovered very slowly , even though the customer base is also expanding . ”
The 80 - 20 Rule
Indeed , at Netflix the number of rated movie titles increased from 4,470 in 2000 to 17,768 in 2005 .
If this product variety is taken into account so that product popularity is calculated relative to the total product variety , Wharton researchers do not find any evidence of the Long Tail effect .
The authors also performed an analysis taking an absolute approach to the Netflix data , like Anderson , and found that the Long Tail effect is only partially present :
Demand for niches decreases over time — rather than increases — although demand for hit products also declines .
The Wharton researchers also disagree with Anderson ’s theory and its implicit challenge to the Pareto principle , or so - called 80 - 20 rule , which in this case would state that 20 % of the movie titles generate 80 % of sales .
Anderson argues that as demand shifts down the tail , the effect would diminish .
Using Netflix data , Netessine and Tan show the opposite — an even stronger effect , with demand for the top 20 % of movies increasing from 86 % in 2000 to 90 % in 2005 .
Anderson did his own analysis using the Wharton data and found lower demand for the top 500 products and more interest in the middle part of the curve .
He also points out that a Long Tail adding up to 15 % of total demand came from titles beyond the top 3,000 — the amount typically stocked in a video store .
While the Long Tail theory focuses on the revenue potential of selling many individual products , Netessine says it is important to acknowledge that cultivating this revenue comes at a cost — including expenses associated with operating its distribution centers and stocking thousands of DVDs .
When applying the Long Tail theory to companies , Netessine says , a relative analysis is more meaningful because it takes into account the costs involved in maintaining a supply chain to feed demand for many obscure choices .
He points to Amazon as another example of an Internet distribution company that still has substantial costs involving warehousing and shipping .
A business model based on the Long Tail effect might work for a company based on pure digital distribution , such as the music website Rhapsody , according to Netessine .
“ For Rhapsody the cost of stocking the extra songs is zero , ” he says .
“ As a result , it does n’t cost anything to offer unbelievable product variety , and the consumer can go into the Long Tail and consume songs that were previously unavailable . ”
For any company marketing a physical product , such as Netflix ’s DVDs or Amazon ’s books , managers must weigh the costs of stocking an item against the likelihood that it will generate revenue .
“ If you stock a lot of products that nobody consumes , then you have a problem , ” says Netessine .
“ You have to start worrying about products not having enough demand and consumers not discovering the products fast enough .
That ’s exactly what we find in the Netflix data . ”
Netessine points out that Netflix reported 55,000 movie titles in its 2005 annual statement , but , based on the data , only 18,000 of them were rated by the customers .
In all , the researchers based their observations on an examination of 480,000 users , 17,770 movies and television series , and more than 100 million ratings representing a 10 % random sample of all Netflix ratings .
The Wharton paper also explores how consumers branch out from hits to discover more obscure products .
Netessine says the research indicates that “ primitive ” recommendation systems are likely to blame for the delay in lesser known products becoming available and consumers finding their way toward them .
“ Many recommendation systems are not terribly smart , ” Netessine states , adding that recommendations about films are made to Netflix subscribers who view similar films .
But in order for a film to be recommended , it must be viewed in the first place .
“ If you want to see the long tail effect — consumers going into those obscure products — you have to be sure consumers learn about them , and that ’s not easy .
Current tools may not be good enough . ”
Indeed , Netflix made its data available as part of a $ 1 million competition to develop an algorithm that would lead to a 10 % improvement in predicting user ratings .
The company is now in the process of determining the winner .
The researchers also investigated the Long Tail theory premise that consumers will gravitate to more obscure products because they will find them more satisfying than mass - market hits .
Contrary to Anderson ’s suggestion and independent of how popularity is measured , Wharton researchers find that consumers tend to be less satisfied with niche movies than with hit movies .
Moreover , it is mostly heavy movie watchers who venture into niche movies .
Since only a small fraction of consumers constitute heavy movie watchers , it is not surprising that there is weak evidence of the Long Tail effect , Netessine concludes .
The paper argues that the research findings have important implications because the Long Tail theory has gained momentum in the business world .
“ Whether or not the Long Tail exists is a fundamental question for decision makers in marketing , operations and finance who face the prospect of further penetration of the Internet channel , which offers expanding product variety and new recommendation systems to help manage it , ” the paper states .
According to Netessine , the research is likely to generate controversy because of its findings that contradict the popular Long Tail theory .
Nonetheless , Anderson is the first individual acknowledged at the end of the paper for “ his encouraging comments and constructive advice . ”
Says Netessine : “ We have agreed to disagree . ”
Culture and Marketplace Effects on Perceived Price Fairness : China and the USA
For the last week or so , there has been a growing controversy over the activities of ACORN which Wikipedia describes as “ a collection of community - based organizations in the United States that advocate for low - and moderate - income families by working on neighborhood safety , voter registration , health care , affordable housing , and other social issues . ”
ACORN became a flashpoint during the last presidential election , because Republicans wanted to tie Barack Obama to allegations of voter fraud by ACORN .
When the election ended , the campaign to destroy Obama and ACORN did not .
So , a couple of kids dressed up as a pimp and prostitute went to various ACORN offices and tried to catch staff members giving them advice on how to break the law .
The staff in some of the ACORN offices obliged and a sh*t storm ensued .
To make a long story short , Congress felt the heat and immediately moved to defund ACORN and any organization “ that has been charged with breaking federal or state election laws , lobbying disclosure laws , campaign finance laws or filing fraudulent paperwork with any federal or state agency .
It also applies to any of the employees , contractors or other folks affiliated with a group charged with any of those things . ”
According to HuffPo , the language in the bill is so broad that it applies to all the big players in the military industrial complex , like Boeing , Lockheed Martin , Raytheon and General Electric ( you can see a list of the offending companies here ) .
This highlights the shame of the conservative / Republican crusade against ACORN .
According to the Washington Examiner , ACORN only received $ 15 million $ 53 million in Federal dollars since 1994 .
I do n’t think I have to tell you that $ 15 million $ 53 million is nothing compared to the hundreds of billions we throw at defense contractors like Boeing every single year .
It does n’t compare to the trillions we ’ve given given to banks through bailouts and Fed loans just in the last year .
And yet , conservatives do n’t seem to care at all about them .
On the contrary , Obama was painted by conservative critics as soft on national security for trying to scrap the wasteful F - 22 jet fighter .
Democrats were painted as communists for trying to reign in executive salaries at banks that received bailout money .
The same is happening now while Obama and Democrats try to reign in wasteful health insurance companies that receive billions in government dollars .
Conservatives do n’t just ignore these larger cases of fraud and misconduct , they cheer them on and defend them whole heartedly .
So I ’m making a plea to our conservative friends .
Now that you ’ve destroyed ACORN , turn your rhetorical guns on the bigger cases of fraud .
Expose Boeing , expose Lockheed Martin .
Show us that you ’re opposition to abuse of government money is more than political opportunism .

By Oregon Employment Department ,
Oregon ’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 12.2 percent in August from the revised July figure of 11.8 percent .
Oregon ’s unemployment rate has been close to 12 percent for the six month period March through August , following a steep run-up during the prior nine months .
Oregon ’s unemployment rate was 6.5 percent in August 2008 .
– The U.S. seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose from 9.4 percent in July to 9.7 percent in August , its highest level in 26 years .
– In August , Oregon ’s seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll employment declined by 6,600 jobs , following a gain of 500 ( as revised ) in July .
Industry Payroll Employment ( Establishment Survey Data )
In August , four major industries posted seasonally adjusted job losses : leisure and hospitality ( 2,300 ) , government ( - 2,000 ) , professional and business services ( - 800 jobs ) , and educational and health services ( - 800 ) .
None of the other major industries posted significant changes .
While seasonally adjusted nonfarm payroll employment dropped sharply in August , by 6,600 , there was positive news in the goods producing sector .
The long - term slide in employment in both construction and manufacturing at least temporarily halted .
Both of these two major industries performed roughly in line with their normal seasonal pattern .
And the revisions to these two industries for July data show that the originally reported losses in July were not as substantial as initially estimated .
Leisure and hospitality saw the peak employment month of the year come in under 173,000 compared with 181,700 in August 2008 .
The most recent monthly tally was down from the July figure by 1,000 .
Arts , entertainment , and recreation was hit with a loss of 1,100 in August .
Elsewhere in the broader industry , full - service restaurants cut 400 jobs in August and is now down 5,100 jobs or nearly 8 percent over the year .
Underscoring the notion of consumers eschewing luxury goods in favor of cost - conscious alternatives , limited - service eating places added 1,000 jobs in August and now is down only 500 jobs , or less than 1 percent , since August 2008 .
Government cut 3,500 jobs at a time of year when a loss of 1,500 is the normal seasonal pattern .
Federal government cut 300 jobs , but is still up 600 from its year - ago figure .
State government was essentially unchanged over the month and over the year .
Local government , then , has been the main driver of government ’s recent trends .
In July , local government spiked upward on a seasonally adjusted basis as local education started the summer break a bit higher than expected .
Then in August , local education dropped down further than normal for the month .
In August , local education reached 83,500 , which was essentially at the same level as in August 2008 .
Indian tribal employment was 8,500 in August , which was 700 below its year - ago figure .
The tribal casinos , restaurants , and accommodations are feeling the effects of the recession .
Professional and business services has shown a downward trend over the past 12 months , shedding more than 17,000 jobs or nearly 9 percent in that time .
After a flat trend in the spring , by August , the decline resumed , with a loss of 800 jobs on a seasonally adjusted basis .
Educational and health services posted a rare seasonally adjusted job loss in August , cutting 400 jobs at a time of year when a gain of 400 is the norm .
Longer term , the industry is still on the uptrend , having added 5,600 jobs or 2.6 percent to its workforce over the past 12 months .
Two component industries have held back health care recently .
Ambulatory health care services is down 800 jobs since August 2008 , while social assistance is down 900 over that time .
Unemployment ( Household Survey Data )
In August , Oregon ’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 12.2 percent , four - tenths of a percentage point above the revised July figure of 11.8 percent .
The rate has been within two tenths of a percentage point from 12 percent since March .
Since August 2008 , the number of Oregonians unemployed has risen by 109,141 .
Most of the increase was due to the loss of jobs , as employment is down 104,678 during that 12 - month period .
Apart from the drop in the employed and the sharp increase in the number of unemployed , the labor force has shown a trend not seen in more than a decade .
During July 2008 through April 2009 , Oregon ’s seasonally adjusted labor force grew very rapidly , increasing by more than 52,000 individuals or 2.7 percent .
Then from April through August this measure of the labor force declined by more than 36,000 people , putting the labor force just slightly above its August 2008 total .
Reasons for the declines in Oregon ’s labor force over the past four months are unclear at this time .
In August , 235,745 Oregonians were unemployed .
In August 2008 , 126,604 Oregonians were unemployed .
The Oregon Employment Department plans to release the August county and metropolitan area unemployment rates on Monday , September 21st and the statewide unemployment rate and employment survey data for September on Monday , October 12th .

Introduction to Feature Teams
Better to teach people and risk they leave , than not and risk they stay — anonymous
Introduction to Feature Teams
Figure 7.1 shows a feature team — a long - lived , [ 1 ] cross-functional team that completes many end - to - end customer features , one by one .
In Scrum and other agile methods the recommended team structure is to organize teams by customer - centric features .
Jim Highsmith , in Agile Project Management [ Highsmith04 ] , explains :
Feature - based delivery means that the engineering team builds [ customer - centric ] features of the final product .
In lean thinking , minimizing the wastes of handoff , waiting , WIP , information scatter , and underutilized people is critical ; cross-functional , cross - component feature teams are a powerful lean solution to reduce these wastes .
Why study the following in - depth analysis ?
Because feature teams are a key to accelerating time - to - market and to scaling agile development , but a major organizational change for most — changing team structure is slow work , involving learning , many stakeholders , and policy and mindset issues .
If you ’re a change agent for large - scale agility , you need to really grasp the issues .
Figure 7.2 a long - lived feature team ; developers , testers , and others create a complete customer feature
A proper Scrum team is by definition a feature team , able to do all the work to complete a Product Backlog item ( a customer feature ) .
Note that Scrum team ( feature team ) members have no special title other than “ team member . ”
There is not emphasis on ‘ developer ’ versus ‘ tester ’ titles .
The goal is to encourage multi-skilled workers and “ whole team does whole feature . ”
Naturally people have primary specialities , yet may sometimes be able to help in less familiar areas to get the job done , such as an ‘ analyst ’ helping out with automated testing .
The titles in Figure 7.1 should not be misinterpreted as promoting working - to - job - title , one of the wastes in lean thinking .
Feature teams are not a new or ‘ agile ’ idea ; they have been applied to large software development for decades .
They are a refinement of cross-functional teams , a well - researched proven practice to speed and improve development .
The term and practice was popularized at Microsoft in the 1980s and discussed in Microsoft Secrets [ CS95 ] .
Jim McCarthy [ McCarthy95 ] , the former development lead of Visual C++ , described feature teams :
Feature teams are about empowerment , accountability , identity , consensus and balance …
Empowerment — While it would be difficult to entrust one functional group or a single functional hierarchy , such as Development , for instance , with virtually absolute control over a particular technology area , it ’s a good idea to do that with a balanced multi-disciplinary team .
The frontline experts are the people who know more than anyone else about their area , and it seems dumb not to find a way to let them have control over their area .
Accountability — …
If a balanced group of people are mutually accountable for all the aspects of design , development , debugging , QA , shipping , and so on , they will devise ways to share critical observations with one another .
Because they are accountable , if they perceive it , they own it .
They must pass the perception to the rest of the team .
Identity — …
With cross-functional feature teams , individuals gradually begin to identify with a part of the product rather than with a narrow specialized skill .
Consensus — Consensus is the atmosphere of a feature team .
Since the point of identification is the feature rather than the function , and since the accountability for the feature is mutual , a certain degree of openness is safe , even necessary .
I have observed teams reorganizing themselves , creating visions , reallocating resources , changing schedules , all without sticky conflict .
Balance — Balance on a feature team is about diverse skill sets , diverse assignments , and diverse points of view .
Feature teams are common in organizations learning to deliver faster and broaden their skills .
Examples include Microsoft , Valtech ( applied in their India center for agile offshore development ) , the Swedish software industry [ OK99 ] , Planon [ Smeets07 ] , and telecom industry giant Ericsson [ KAL00 ] .
The report on Ericsson ’s feature teams clarifies :
The feature is the natural unit of functionality that we develop and deliver to our customers , and thus it is the ideal task for a team .
The feature team is responsible for getting the feature to the customer within a given time , quality and budget .
A feature team needs to be cross functional as it needs to cover all phases of the development process from customer contact to system test , as well as all areas [ cross component ] of the system which is impacted by the feature .
To improve development on large products ( one sub - project may be one million person hours ) in their GSM radio networks division , Ericsson applies several practices supporting agility , including feature teams and daily builds .
It ’s no coincidence that both these practices were popularized by Microsoft in the 1990s ; Ericsson also understands the synergy between them [ KA01 ] :
Daily build can only be fully implemented in an organization with predominantly customer feature design responsibility . …
The reasons why feature responsibility is a prerequisite for taking advantage of daily build is the amount of coordination and planning needed between those responsible for delivering consistent parts of each module that can be built . …
In a feature team this coordination is handled within the team .
In another book describing the successful practices needed for scaling agile development , Jutta Eckstein similarly recommends “ vertical teams , which are focused around business functionality ” [ Eckstein04 ] .
Feature teams do ‘ vertical ’ end - to - end customer features ( GUI , application logic , database , … ) rather than ‘ horizontal ’ components or layers .
In her more recent scaling book she again emphasizes “ In order to always keep the business value of your customer in mind , there is only one solution : having feature teams in place ” [ Eckstein09 ] .
A common misunderstanding is that each feature team member must know everything about the code base , or be a generalist .
Not so .
Rather , the team is composed of specialists in various software component areas and disciplines ( such as database or testing ) .
Only collectively do they have — or can learn — sufficient knowledge to complete an end - to - end customer feature .
Through close collaboration they coordinate all feature tasks , while also — important point — learning new skills from each other , and from extra -team experts .
In this way , the members are generalizing specialists , a theme in agile methods [ KS93 , Ambler03 ] , and we reduce the waste of underutilized people ( working only in one narrow speciality ) , a theme in lean thinking .
To summarize the ideal feature team [ 2 ] :
Feature Team
long - lived — the team stays together so they can ‘ jell ’ for higher performance ; they take on new features over time
cross-functional and cross-component
co-located
work on a complete customer - centric feature , across all components and disciplines ( analysis , programming , testing , …)
composed of generalizing specialists
in Scrum , typically 7 ± 2 people
Feature teams work independently by being empowered and given the responsibility for a whole feature .
Advantages include :
increased value throughput — focus on delivering what the customer or market values most
— focus on delivering what the customer or market values most increased learning — individual and team learning increases because of broader responsibility and because of co-location with colleagues who are specialists in a variety of areas
— individual and team learning increases because of broader responsibility and because of co-location with colleagues who are specialists in a variety of areas – critical for long - term improvement and acceleration ; reduces the waste of underutilized people simplified planning — by giving a whole feature to the team , organizing and planning become easier
— by giving a whole feature to the team , organizing and planning become easier – for example , it is no longer necessary to coordinate between single - specialist functional and component teams reduced waste of handoff — since the entire co-located feature team does all work ( analysis , design , code , test ) , handoff is dramatically reduced
— since the entire co-located feature team does all work ( analysis , design , code , test ) , handoff is dramatically reduced less waiting ; faster cycle time — the waste of waiting is reduced because handoff is eliminated and because completing a customer feature does not have to wait on multiple parties each doing part of the work serially
— the waste of waiting is reduced because handoff is eliminated and because completing a customer feature does not have to wait on multiple parties each doing part of the work serially self - managing ; improved cost and efficiency — feature teams ( and Scrum ) do not require a project manager or matrix management for feature delivery , because coordination is trivial .
The team has responsibility for end - to - end completion and for coordinating their work with others .
Data shows an inverse relationship between the number of managers and development productivity , and also that teams with both an internal and external focus are more likely to be successful [ AB07 ] .
Feature teams are less expensive — there is n’t the need for extra overhead such as project managers .

Feature teams are less expensive — there is n’t the need for extra overhead such as project managers .
–
For example [ Jones01 ] : “ The matrix structure tends to raise the management head count for larger projects .
Because software productivity declines as the management count goes up , this form of organization can be hazardous for software . ” better code / design quality — multiple feature teams working on shared components creates pressure to keep the code clean , formatted to standards , constantly refactored , and surrounded by many unit tests — as otherwise it wo n’t be possible to work with .
On the other hand , due to long familiarity , component teams live with obfuscated code only they can understand .
better motivation — research [ HO80 , Hackman02 ] shows that if a team feels they have complete end - to - end responsibility for a work item , and when the goal is customer - directed , then there is higher motivation and job satisfaction — important factors in productivity and success .
— research [ HO80 , Hackman02 ] shows that if a team feels they have complete end - to - end responsibility for a work item , and when the goal is customer - directed , then there is higher motivation and job satisfaction — important factors in productivity and success .
simple interface and module coordination — one person or team updates both sides of an interface ( caller and called ) and updates code in all modules ; because the feature team works across all components ; no need for inter -team coordination .
— one person or team updates both sides of an interface ( caller and called ) and updates code in all modules ; because the feature team works across all components ; no need for inter -team coordination .
change is easier — changes in requirements or design ( we know it ’s rare , but we heard it happened somewhere once ) are absorbed by one team ; multi-team re-coordination and re-planning are not necessary .
Avoid … Single - function teams A Scrum feature team is cross-functional ( cross - discipline ) , composed of testers , developers , analysts , and so on ; they do all work to complete features .
One person will contribute primary skills ( for example , interaction deisgn or GUI programming ) and also secondary skills .
There is no separate specification team , architecture team , programming team , or testing team , and hence , much less waiting and handoff waste , plus increased multiskill learning .
Avoid … Component teams
An old approach to organizing developers in a large product group is component teams — programmer groups formed around the architectural modules or components of the system , such as a single - speciality GUI team and component - X team .
A customer - centric feature is decomposed so that each team does only the partial programming work for their component .
The team owns and maintains their component — single points of specialization success or failure .
In contrast , feature teams are not organized around specific components ; the goal is a cross - component team that can work in all modules to complete a feature .
Note Components ( layer , class , … ) still exist , and we strive to create good components , but we do not organize teams by these .

Long ago , Mel Conway [ Conway68 ] observed that
[ … ] there is a very close relationship between the structure of a system and the structure of the organization which designed it .
…
Any organization that designs a system [ … ] will inevitably produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization ’s communication structure . [ 3 ]
That is , once we define an organization of people to design something , that structure strongly influences the subsequent design — typically in a one - to - one homomorphism .
A striking example Conway gave was
[ An ] organization had eight people who were to produce a COBOL and an ALGOL compiler .
After some initial estimates of difficulty and time , five people were assigned to the COBOL job and three to the ALGOL job .
The resulting COBOL compiler ran in five phases , the ALG0L compiler ran in three .
Why raise this topic ?
Because “ Conway ’s Law ” has — strangely — been incorrectly used by some to promote component teams , as if Conway were recommending them .
But his point was very different :
It was an observation of how team structure limits design , not a recommendation .
Cognizant of the negative impact , he cautioned :
To the extent that an organization is not completely flexible in its communication structure , that organization will stamp out an image of itself in every design it produces .
…
Because the design that occurs first is almost never the best possible , the prevailing system concept [ the design ] may need to change .
Therefore , flexibility of organization is important to effective design .
Ways must be found to reward design managers for keeping their organizations lean and flexible .
In this way , Conway underlines a motivation for feature teams .
In Microsoft Secrets [ CS95 ] , Brad Silverberg , senior VP for Windows and Office , explained their emphasis on feature teams , motivated by the desire to avoid the effects of “ Conway ’s Law ” :
The software tends to mirror the structure of the organization that built it .
If you have a big , slow organization , you tend to build big , slow software .
Disadvantages
It is extraordinary the amount of delay , overhead , unnecessary management , handoff , bad code , duplication , and coordination complexity that is introduced in large groups who organize into component teams , primarily driven by two assumptions or fears : 1 ) people ca n’t or should n’t learn new skills ( other components , testing , … ) ; and 2 ) code ca n’t be effectively shared and integrated between people .
The first assumption is fortunately not so , and the second , more true in the 1970s , has been resolved with agile engineering practices such as continuous integration and test - driven development ( TDD ) .
Component teams seemed a logical structure for 1960s or 1970s sequential life cycle development with its fragile version control , delayed integration , and weak testing tools and practices because the apparent advantages included :
people developed narrow specialized skill , leading to apparently faster work when viewed locally rather than in terms of overall systems throughput of customer - valued features , and when viewed short - term rather than long - term
those specialists were less likely to break their code
there were no conflicting code changes from other teams
Fortunately , there has been much innovation since the 1960s .
New life cycle and team structures have been discovered , as have powerful new version - control , integration , and testing practices .
Systems and lean thinking invite us to ask , “ Does a practice globally optimize value throughput with ever - faster concept - to - cash cycle time , or locally optimize for a secondary goal ? ”
From that perspective , let ’s examine the disadvantages of a component team …
Promotes Sequential Life Cycle Development and Mindset
Customer features do n’t usually map to a single component nor , therefore , to a single component team ; they typically span many modules .
This influences organization of work .
Who is going to do requirements analysis ?
If several component teams will be involved , it is not clear that any particular one of them should be responsible for analysis .
So , a separate analyst or analyst team does specification in a first step .
Who is going to do high - level design and planning ?
Again , someone before the component teams will have to do high - level design and plan a decomposition of the feature to component - level tasks .
She is usually titled an architect or systems engineer ; in [ Leffingwell07 ] this role is called requirements architect .
In this case , one usually sees a planning spreadsheet similar to the following :
Feature Component A B C D E … Feature 1 x x
x
Feature 2 x x x
…
Who is going to test the end - to - end feature ?
This responsibility does n’t belong to any one component team , who only do part of the work .
So testing is assigned to a separate system - test team , and they start high - level testing after development has finished — sometimes long after , as they need the work of multiple component teams and these teams seldom finish their work at the same time .
Plus , they have a backlog of other features to test .
Now what do we have ?
( before development ) requirements analysis by a separate analyst ( before ) high - level design and component - level task planning by a separate designer ( during ) implementation by multiple interdependent component teams that have to coordinate partially completed work ( after ) system testing of the feature
Back to a waterfall !
There is massive handoff waste in the system and plenty of delay .
This is traditional sequential life cycle development and mindset , even though — ironically — people may incorrectly think they are doing Scrum or agile development simply because they are doing mini-waterfalls in a shorter and iterative cycle ( Figure 7.3 ) .
But mini - waterfalls are not lean and agile development ; rather , we want real concurrent engineering .
Completing one non-trivial feature now typically takes at least five or six iterations instead of one . [ 4 ]
And it gets worse :
For very large systems the organization adds a subsystem layer with a subsystem architect and subsystem testing — each specialized and each adding another phase delay before delivering customer functionality .
Note Component team structures and sequential life cycle development are directly linked .
Figure 7.3 com-ponent teams lead to sequential life cycle
Limits Learning
Consider this thought experiment , although it will never be achieved : Option 1 — Everyone working on the product can do everything well .
Option 2 — Every person can do one ( and only one ) small task extremely well , but nothing else .
Which option allows faster feature throughput ?
Which option has more bottlenecks ?
Which offers more adaptability ?
Although the perfection vision of option - 1 is n’t possible , viewed along a continuum of desirability , we want to encourage a learning organization that is moving in that direction — reducing bottlenecks , people learning one area well , then two , …
Observations :
Developing multi-skilled people takes plenty of learning opportunities and close work with different kinds of experts .
More specifically , developing programmers who can help in several components requires a variety of experiences and mentors .
Data shows an extraordinary variance in individual programmer productivity — studies suggest an average of four times faster in the top versus bottom quartile [ Prechelt00 ] .
There ’s a strong link in software development between what you know and what you can do well — software is the quintessential knowledge - sensitive profession .
In short :
There are great business benefits if we have skilled developers who are constantly learning .
This learning has preconditions , of management responsibility :
slack [ 5 ]
a structure to support continual learning – but there ’s a systemic flaw in component teams …
How do developers become skilled in their craft and broadly knowledgeable about their product ?
We asked Pekka Laukkanen — an experienced developer and creator of the Robot test framework [ Laukkanen06 , Robot08 ] — a question : “ How do you become a great developer ? ”
He thought about it carefully and answered : “ Practice — and this means not just writing lots of code , but reflecting on it .
And reading others ’ code because that ’s where you learn to reflect on your own . ”
Yet , in traditional large - product groups with component teams , most developers know only a narrow fragment of the system , and most salient , they do n’t see or learn much that is new .
And on the other hand , there are always a few wonderful people who know a lot about the system — the people you would go to for help on an inexplicable bug .
Now , when you ask how that ’s possible , a common answer will be , “ He knows everything since he always reads everybody ’s code . ”
Or , “ He ’s worked on a lot of different code . ”
Interestingly , such people are more common in large open source products ; there is a culture and value of “ Use the source , Luke ” [ Raymond ] that promotes reading and sharing knowledge via code .
Why does this matter ?
Because component teams inhibit developers from reading and learning new areas of the code base , and more broadly , from learning new things .
Contrast the organizational mindset that creates such a structure of limited learning with the advice of the seminal The Fifth Discipline [ Senge94 ] in which MIT ’s Peter Senge summarizes the focus and culture of great long - lived companies : learning organizations .
Lean Process and Product Development [ Ward06 ] also stresses this theme ; it summarizes the insight of Toyota ’s new product development success :
It ’s about creating lots of knowledge , and about continual learning .
And Toyota Talent [ LM07 ] asks the question : “ How does Toyota continue to be successful through good times and bad ? ” and answers “ The answer is simple : great people , ” and
It is the knowledge and capability of people that distinguishes any organization from another .
For the most part , organizations have access to the same technology , machinery , raw material , and even the same pool of potential employees as Toyota .
The automaker ’s success lies partially in these areas , but the full benefit is from the people at Toyota who cultivate their success .
Isao Kato , one of the students of Taichii Ohno ( father of the Toyota Production System ) , said :
In Toyota we had a saying , “ Mono zukuri wa hito zukuri ” , which mean “ Making things is about making people . ” [ Kato06 ]
Yet what is the journey of the software developer in many large product groups ?
After graduating from university , a young developer joins a large company and is assigned to a new or existing component .
She writes the original code or evolves it , becoming the specialist .
There she stays for years — apparently so that the organization can “ go faster ” by exploiting her one specialty — becoming a single point of success or failure , a bottleneck , and learning only a few new things .
The university did not teach her good design , so where did she learn good from bad ?
How can she see lots of different code ?
How can she see opportunities for reusable code ?
How can she help elsewhere when there ’s a need ?
NOTE
Note that the problem is not specialization ; it is single - specialization , bottlenecks , and team structures that inhibit learning in new areas .
To create a learning organization , we want a structure where developers can eventually become skilled in two areas — or more .
Component teams inhibit that .
Component team ( and single - function team ) organizations gradually incur a learning debt — learning that should have occurred but did n’t because of narrowly focused specialists , short - term quick - fix fire fighting , lack of reflection , and not keeping up with modern developments .
When the product is young , the pain of this debt is n’t really felt .
As it ages and the number of single - specialized teams — the number of bottlenecks — expands from 5 to 35 , this debt feels heavier and heavier .
Those of you involved in old large products know what we mean .
Encourages Delivery of Easier Work , not More Value
Component specialists , like other single - specialists , create an organizational constraint or bottleneck .
This leads to a fascinating sub-optimization :
Work is often selected based on specialty rather than customer value .
Component teams are faster at developing customer features that primarily involve their single - speciality component — if such single - component customer features can be found ( not always true ) .
For that reason , when people are sitting in a room deciding what to do next , features are often selected according to what available component teams can do best or quickest .
This tends to maximize the amount of code generated , but does not maximize the value delivered .
[ 6 ]
Therefore , component teams are optimized for quickly developing features ( or parts of features ) that are easiest to do , rather than of highest value .
We once saw a component team assigned to code their small part of a low - priority customer feature that was not due for more than 18 months in the future , simply because it was easier to plan that way .
Interestingly , this sub-optimization is often invisible because 1 ) there is n’t prioritization based on a customer - value calculation or the prioritization scheme consists of bizarre super - coarse - grained variants such as “ mandatory ” versus “ absolutely mandatory ” ; 2 ) component teams tend to be busy fixing bugs related to their component ; and , 3 ) there is plenty of internal local - improvement work .
Everyone appears very busy — they must be doing valuable work !
The sub-optimization becomes clear when we create a real Product Backlog , sorted by a priority that includes value ( Figure 7.4 ) .
The Resource Pool and Resource Manager Quick Fix
One quick - fix way that traditional resource management tackles the priority problem is by creating projects according to which specialists are required and available [ McGrath04 ] .
Project managers select people from a specialist resource pool and release them back when finished .
This gives rise to project groups or feature projects , usually with matrix management .
In such organizations one hears people called ‘ resources ’ as though they were machine parts and human or team dynamics had little importance on productivity or motivation ( which is not the case ) .
Thus , with a resource pool , management twists the organization around single - specialist constraints .
It seems to work well on paper or in a project management tool .
But people are not machine parts — they can learn , be inspired or de-motivated , gain or lose focus , etc .
In practice , resource pool and feature project management has disadvantages :
lower productivity due to non-jelled project groups — there is clear evidence that short - lived groups of people brought together for a project — a “ project group ” — are correlated with lower productivity [ KS93 ] .
— there is clear evidence that short - lived groups of people brought together for a project — a “ project group ” — are correlated with lower productivity [ KS93 ] .
lower motivation and job satisfaction — I often lead a “ love / hate ” exercise with many people in an enterprise to learn what they , well … hate .
In large groups focused around resource pools and project groups , “ we hate being part of a resource pool thrown into multiple short - term groups ” is always at or near the top .

less learning — more single - specialization as people seldom work / learn outside their area .
— more single - specialization as people seldom work / learn outside their area .
lower productivity due to multitasking — with resource pool management it is common to create partial ‘ resource ’ allocations where a person is 20 % allocated to project - A , 20 % to project - B , and so forth . [ 7 ]
This implies increasing multitasking and — key point — lots of multitasking reduces productivity in product development , it does not improve it [ DeMarco01 ] .
— with resource pool management it is common to create partial ‘ resource ’ allocations where a person is 20 % allocated to project - A , 20 % to project - B , and so forth .
This implies increasing multitasking and — key point — lots of multitasking reduces productivity in product development , it does not improve it [ DeMarco01 ] .
lower productivity and throughput due to increased handoff and delay waste — the people in the temporary group are often multitasking on many projects .
If that ’s the case , it leads to another productivity / throughput impact :
Since they are not working together at the same time on the same goal , there is delay and handoff between the members .
— the people in the temporary group are often multitasking on many projects .
If that ’s the case , it leads to another productivity / throughput impact :
Since they are not working together at the same time on the same goal , there is delay and handoff between the members .
lower productivity and increased handoff and delay due to physical dispersion — the project group is rarely co-located in the same room ; members may be in different offices , buildings , or even cities ( and time zones ) , and have little or no relationship with each other ; physical and time zone dispersion of a task group impacts productivity [ OO00 ] .
— the project group is rarely co-located in the same room ; members may be in different offices , buildings , or even cities ( and time zones ) , and have little or no relationship with each other ; physical and time zone dispersion of a task group impacts productivity [ OO00 ] .
lower productivity and higher costs due to more managers — if each temporary project group has a project manager ( usually in a matrix management structure ) , costs are higher and productivity lower because of the inverse relationship between management count and software productivity .
Observe the relationship between the lean “ Go See ” attitude and the belief that it is skillful to have resource pools that optimize around single - specialist constraints .
People that do not spend regular time physically close to the real value - add workers may believe in resource pools and short - lived project groups because it appears on paper — as with machine parts — to be flexible and efficient .
Yet those frequently involved in the real work directly see the subtle ( but non-trivial ) problems .
Promotes Some Teams to Do “ Artificial Work ”
A corollary of the disadvantage of encourages delivery of easier work , not more value is illustrated by an example :
Assume the market wants ten features that primarily involve components A–T and thus ( in the simplest case ) component teams A–T .
What do component teams U–Z do during the next release ?
The market is not calling for high - value features involving their components , and there may even be no requests involving their components .
In the best case , they are working on lower - value features — because that is all they can do .
In the worst case , there is an explicit or more frequently a subtle implicit creation of artificial work for these teams so that component team U can keep busy doing component - U programming , even though there is no market driver for the work .
With component teams and large product groups there is often a resource manager who tries to keep the existing teams busy ( “ 100 % allocated ” ) by choosing and assigning this low - value or artificial work , or by asking the underutilized teams for advice .
Their focus is the local optimization of “ everyone doing their best ” — generating code according to what people know , rather than generating the most value .
And the work is sometimes ‘ redesign ’ :
If we do n’t have anything new , we ’ll redo what we did before . [ 8 ]
More Code Duplication and Hence Developers
We once visited a client with many component teams and discussed the link between this structure and code duplication .
The client asked , rhetorically , “ Do you know how many XML parsers we have ? ”
Consider duplication : Good code is free of it , and great developers strive to create less code as they build new features , through constant refactoring .
It ’s difficult to see duplication or opportunities for reuse in a code base with single - component specialists , because one never looks broadly .
Single - component specialists increase duplication .
And so the code base grows ever larger than necessary , which in turn demands more single - component specialists … [ 9 ]
Ever -Growing Number of Developers
Component teams create several forces to increase the number of developers .
One reason examined previously is the increased code bulk due to duplication .
A second reason involves the mismatch between the existing component teams and the high - priority work , as explained next and summarized in the system dynamics diagram , Figure 7.5 .
Figure 7.5 system dynamics of component teams and number of developers
Component teams become boxes in the formal organization structure , each with its own manager .
Several component teams form a subsystem group or department with a second - level manager .
This leads to an interesting dynamic …
Example : Current release — A high - priority goal involves mostly work in component or subsystem A , and therefore component - A or subsystem - A groups work on it .
They hire more people in the belief it will make them go faster .
Component - C team has lower - priority goals and does not need or get more people .
Next release — A high - priority goal involves primarily work for component C. Now , they are viewed as the bottleneck and so hire more people ( see Figure 7.6 ) .
We could have moved people from one component team to another , and gradually taught them ( through pair programming ) to help , instead of hiring more people .
But this rarely happens .
The other component team already has work chosen for the release , so they wo n’t wish to lose people .
And there is a fear it will take too long to learn anything to be helpful .
Also , the mindset is that “ it would be a waste of our specialist to move her to another component team . ”
Finally , moving people is inhibited by political and management status problems — many managers do n’t want to have a smaller group ( another force of local optimization ) .
Conway formulated this well :
Parkinson ’s law [ Parkinson 57 ] plays an important role …
As long as the manager ’s prestige and power are tied to the size of his budget , he will be motivated to expand his organization .
[ Conway68 ]
Thus , the component - A team will grow , as will the component itself .
It may even eventually split into two new components , and hence two new teams .
The people will specialize on the new components .
In this way large product organizations tend to grow even larger .
Figure 7.6 ever - growing size with component teams
Problems in Planning and Coordination
Scrum ( and other agile methods ) strive for an integrated product at the end of every iteration with demonstrable customer functionality .
For most features this involves multiple component teams and therefore complicates planning and coordination between teams .
Example :
In the next iteration the goal is to do Product Backlog items 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 .
Backlog item 1 ( customer feature 1 ) requires changes in component A and B .
Item 2 requires changes in component A , B , and C , and so forth .
All teams depend on one another in the iteration planning and need to synchronize their work during the iteration ( see Figure 7.7 ) — a task that is often handled by a separate project manager .
Even if we successfully plan the complex interdependencies for this iteration , a delay in one team will have a ripple effect through all component teams , often across several iterations .
Delays Delivery of Value
Value can be delivered only when the work of multiple component teams is integrated and tested .
Figure 7.3 illustrates how component teams promote sequential life cycle .
So what ?
With a component team organization , the work - in - progress ( WIP ) from a team usually waits several iterations before it can be combined into a valuable feature .
This WIP , like all inventory , is one of the wastes in lean thinking ; it hides defects , locks up an investment , reduces flexibility , and slows down the delivery of value .
And in addition to the straightforward sequential life cycle reasons already discussed , component teams delay delivery as follows …
Example :
Item 1 in the Product Backlog involves component A. Component team A will work on their part of item 1 next iteration .
Item 4 involves components A and C . Since component team A is busy with item 1 , they do not work on item 4 .
Item 4 is the highest goal involving component C. Component team C therefore works on their part of item 4 next iteration .
First problem :
Not every team is working on highest value .
Second problem :
After the iteration , item 4 ( which needs code in components A and C ) ca n’t yet be integrated , tested , and delivered , because of the missing component A code .
Item 4 delivery has to wait for component team A .
Organizations try to solve this problem by the quick fix of creating a role , called project manager or feature manager , for coordinating the work across teams and / or by creating temporary project groups whose far - flung members multitask across multiple concurrent feature goals .
Such tactics will never fundamentally resolve the problem or support rapid development , since the problem is structural — baked into the organization , built into the system .
More Poor Code / Design
Perhaps the greatest irony of component teams is this : A mistaken belief behind their creation is that they yield components with good code / design .
Yet , over the years we have looked closely at the code across many large products , in many companies , and it is easy to see that the opposite is true — the code in a component maintained by a single - component team is often quite poor . [ 10 ]
For example , we will sit to start pair programming with a component team member ( who knows we ’ll be looking for great code ) , and with a slightly apologetically grin the programmer will say , “ Yeah , we know it ’s messy , but we understand it . ”
What is going on ?
limited learning — as discussed above , developers are not exposed to vast amounts of different code ; this limits their learning of good design .
— as discussed above , developers are not exposed to vast amounts of different code ; this limits their learning of good design .
familiarity breeds obfuscation — when I stare at the same complicated , obfuscated 10,000 lines of code month after month it starts to be familiar and ‘ clear ’ ; I can no longer see how complicated it is , nor does it especially bother me , because of long exposure — so I am not motivated to deeply improve it .

obfuscation and duplication - heavy large code bases breed job security — some do think like this , especially in groups where line management are not master programmers , not looking at the code , not encouraging great , refactored code .
— some do think like this , especially in groups where line management are not master programmers , not looking at the code , not encouraging great , refactored code .
no outside pressure to clarify , refactor , or provide many unit tests for the code — no one other than the team of five component developers ( who are long familiar with the complicated code ) works on it ; thus there is no pressure to continually refactor it , reduce coupling , and surround it with many unit tests so that it is clear and robustly testable for other people to work on .
The perpetuation of belief that component teams create great code is an indicator of a lack of “ Go See ” behavior by first - level management .
If they were master developers ( lean principle “ my manager can do my job better than me ” ) and regularly looking in depth across the code base , they would see that on average , more — not less — fresh eyes on the code makes it better .
Summary of Disadvantages
promotes sequential life cycle development and mindset
limits learning by people working only on the same components for a long time — the waste of underutilized people
encourages doing easier work rather than most valuable work
promotes some component teams to do “ artificial work ”
causes long delays due to major waiting and handoff wastes
encourages code duplication
unnecessarily promotes an ever - growing number of developers
complicates planning and synchronization
increases bottlenecks — single points of success are also single points of failure
fosters more poor code / design
Platform Groups — Large - Scale Component Groups
In large product organizations , there often exist one or more lower - level platform groups distinct from higher - level product groups .
For example , in one client ’s radio networks division a platform group of hundreds of people provides a common platform to several market - visible products ( each involving hundreds of people ) .
Note that the platform group and a higher - level product group that uses it are essentially two very large component groups .
There is no absolute constraint that a separate platform group must exist ; for example , the software technologies and deployment environment are the same in both layers .
A higher - level developer could in theory modify code in the lower - level ‘ platform ’ code — the boundary is arbitrary .
So , the long - term organizational change toward feature teams , large - scale Scrum , and less handoff waste implies that an artificially constructed platform group may merge into the customer - product groups , with feature teams that work across all code .
This is a multi - year learning journey .
Try …Feature teams
Most drawbacks of component teams can be resolved with feature teams ( defined starting on p. 150 ) .
They enable us to put the requirements analysis , interaction design , planning , high - level design , programming , and system test responsibilities within the team [ 11 ] , since they now have a whole end - to - end customer - feature focus .
Planning , coordinating , and doing the work are greatly simplified .
Handoff and delay wastes are dramatically reduced , leading to faster cycle time .
Learning increases , and the organization can focus on truly high - priority market - valued features .
And because multiple feature teams will work on shared components , sometimes at the same time , it is essential that the code is clean , constantly refactored , continually integrated , and surrounded by unit tests — as otherwise it wo n’t be possible to work with .
NOTE
Note a key insight : Feature teams shift the coordination challenge between teams away from upfront requirements , design , and inter - team project management and toward coordination at the code level .
To see this , compare Figure 7.7 and Figure 7.8 .
And with modern agile practices and tools , coordinating at the code level is relatively easy .
Naturally , developers and managers unfamiliar with these practices do n’t know this , and so continue with upfront responses to the coordination challenge .
Figure 7.8 feature teams shift the coordination problem to shared code
As the shift to shared code coordination illustrates , a feature team organization introduces new issues .
In traditional development these seemed difficult to solve .
Fortunately , there are now solutions .
The following sections analyze these challenges and illustrate how modern agile development practices ameliorate them , thus enabling feature teams .
Challenges or issues of feature teams include :
broader skills and product knowledge
concurrent access to code
shared responsibility for design
different mechanism to ensure product stability
reuse and infrastructure work
difficult - to - learn skills
development and coordination of common functional ( for example , test ) skills that span members of many feature teams
organizational structure
defect handling
Feature Teams versus Feature Projects
Feature teams are not feature projects .
A feature project is organized around one feature .
At the start , the needed specialists ( usually developers from component teams or a resource pool ) are identified and organized into a short - lived group — a virtual project group .
The specialists are usually allocated a percentage of their time to work for the feature project .
Feature teams and feature projects have important differences : Long - life teams —
A feature team , unlike a project group , may stay together for several years .
The team has an opportunity to jell and learn to work together .
A well - working jelled team leads to higher performance [ KS93 ] .

Shared ownership —
In a feature team , the whole team is responsible for the whole feature .
This leads to shared code ownership and cross-learning , which in the long run increases degrees of freedom and reduces bottlenecks .
In feature projects , developers only update their particular single - specialty section of code .

Self - managing ; improved cost and efficiency — Feature teams ( and Scrum ) do not require overhead project managers , because coordination is trivial .
Broader Skills and Product Knowledge
This is the opposite of the limits learning problem of component teams .
The feature team needs to make changes in any part of the system when they are working on a customer feature .
First , not all people need to know the whole system and all skills .
The Product Owner and teams usually select a qualified feature team for a feature , unless they have the time and desire for a ‘ virgin ’ team to invest in some deep learning in less familiar territory .
In the common case , the team members together need to already know enough — or be able to learn enough without herculean effort — to complete a customer - centric feature .
Notice that feature teams do have specialized knowledge — that ’s good .
And , since learning is possible , they are slowly extending their specializations over time as they take on features that require moderate new learning , strengthening the system of development over time ( see Figure 7.9 ) .
This is enhanced by more pair - work and group - work in a team with various skills .
We move beyond false dichotomies such as “ specialization good , learning new areas bad ” and “ generalists good , specialists bad . ”
Figure 7.9 special - ization is good , learning is good
Learning new areas of the code base is not a profound problem for “ moderately large ” products , but beyond some tipping point [ 12 ] it starts to be a challenge .
One solution is requirement areas .
In traditional large product development , component teams are usually grouped within a major subsystem department .
Similarly , when scaling the feature team organization , we can group feature teams within a requirement area — a broad area of related customer requirements such as “ network performance monitoring and tuning ” or “ PDF features . ”
To clarify : A requirement area is not a subsystem or architectural module ; it is a domain of related requirements from the customer perspective .
What ’s the advantage ?
Most often , a requirement - area feature team will not need to know the entire code base , since features in one area usually focus across a semi-predictable subset of the code base .
Not always , but enough to reduce the scope of learning .
Requirement - area feature teams provide the advantage of feature teams without the overwhelming learning challenge of a massive code base . [ 13 ]
But stepping back from the ‘ problem ’ of requiring broader knowledge :
Is it a problem to avoid , or an opportunity to go faster ?
A traditional assumption underlying this issue is the notion that assigning the existing best specialist for a task leads to better performance .
Yet this is an example of local optimization thinking — no doubt locally and short - term it seems faster for code generation , but does it increase long - term systems improvement and throughput of highest market - valued features ?
In addition to the obvious bottlenecking it promotes ( thus slowing throughput of a complete feature ) , does it make the organization as a whole speed up over time ?
As previously explored in the section on the disadvantages of component teams :
Product groups that repeatedly rely on single - skill specialists are limiting learning , reducing degrees of freedom , increasing bottlenecks , and creating single points of success — and failure .
That does not improve long - term system throughput of highest market - valued features or the ability to change quickly .
There is an assumption underlying concerns about broader product knowledge :
The assumption is that it will take a really long time for a developer to learn a new area of the code base .
And yet , in large product groups , it is not uncommon for an existing developer to move to a different component team and within four or five months be comfortable — even shorter if the code is clean .
It is n’t trivial , but neither is it a herculean feat .
Programmers regularly learn to work on new code and in new domains all the time ; indeed , it ’s an emphasis of their university education .
Still , to dig deeper :
Why is it hard to learn new areas of the code base ?
Usually , the symptom is incredibly messy code and bad design — a lack of good abstraction , encapsulation , constant refactoring , automated unit tests , and so forth .
That should be a warning sign to increase refactoring , unit tests , and learning , not to avoid new people touching fragile code — to strengthen rather than to live with a weakness .
Learning new code and changing an existing code base is indeed a learnable skill .
It takes practice to become good , and people in feature teams get that practice and learn this skill .
Returning to the apparent quick - fix , short - term performance advantage of choosing the best existing specialist for a task , this “ common sense ” has also been questioned in a study [ Belshee05a ] .
Development ran with one - week iterations .
Each iteration the team experimented with new practices .
One experiment involved task selection .
A traditional approach may be called most qualified implementer — the specialist who knows most about a task works on it .
The team experimented with a task selection method called least qualified implementer — everyone selects the task they know least about .
Also , task selection was combined with frequent pair switching , called promiscuous pairing , each 90 minutes .
First , the initial velocity did not drop significantly .
Second , after two iterations ( two weeks ) the velocity increased above their previous level .
The benefit of increased learning eventually paid off .
Belshee explains the above result with a concept called beginner ’s mind .
“ Beginner ’s Mind happens when the thinker is unsure of his boundaries .
The thinker opens himself up and thoroughly tests his environment …
The whole mind just opens up to learning . ” [ Belshee05 b ]
An experience report from Microsoft related to these practices :
The principles laid out in Belshee ’s paper are not for the faint of heart .
They require dedication , commitment and courage .
Dedication is required of each team member to strive for self improvement .
Commitment is needed for each team member to ensure the values and principles will be followed and the team will hold itself accountable .
Courage , because the emotions that Promiscuous Pairing invites will be not unlike the most fun and scariest roller - coaster ever experienced .
[ Lacey06 ]
The studies illustrates the potential for acceleration when an organization invests in broadening learning and skill , rather than limiting it through dependence on bottlenecks of single - specialists .
Concurrent Access to Code
As illustrated in Figure 7.8 , one important difference between component teams and feature teams is that the dependency and coordination between teams shifts from requirements and design to code .
Several people may concurrently edit the same source code file , typically a set of C functions , or a class in C++ or Java .
With weak or complex version - control tools and practices , common in the 1980s and still promoted by companies such as IBM , this was a concern .
Fortunately , it is n’t an issue with modern free tools and agile practices .
Old - generation and complex ( and costly ) version control systems such as ClearCase defaulted to strict locking in which the person making a change locked the source file so that no one else could change it .
Much worse , vendors promoted a culture of avoiding concurrent access , delaying integration , complex integration processes involving manual steps , integration managers , and tool administrators .
This increased costs , complexity , bottlenecks , waiting , and reinforced single - team component ownership .
On the other hand , the practices and tools in agile and in open source development are faster and simpler .
Free open source tools such as Subversion [ 14 ] default to optimistic locking ( no locking ) , and more deeply , have always encouraged — through teaching and features — a culture of simplicity , shared code ownership , and concurrent access [ Mason05 ] .
With optimistic locking anyone can change a source file concurrently .
When a developer integrates her code , Subversion automatically highlights and merges non-conflicting changes , and detects if conflicts exist .
If so , the tool easily allows developers to see , merge , and resolve them .
An optimistic - locking , fast , simple tool and process are required when working in an agile development environment and are a key in eliminating problems related to concurrent access to code .
Optimistic locking could in theory lead to developers spending inordinate time merging difficult changes and resolving large conflicts .
But this is resolved with continuous integration and test - driven development , key practices in scaling agile and lean development .
When developers practice continuous integration ( CI ) they integrate their code frequently — at least twice a day .
Integrations are small and frequent ( for example , five lines of code every two hours ) rather than hundreds or thousands of lines of code merged after days or weeks .
The chance of conflict is lower , as is the effort to resolve .
Developers do not normally keep code on separate “ developer branches ” or “ feature branches ” ; rather , they frequently integrate all code on the ‘ trunk ’ of the version - control system , and minimize branching .
Furthermore , CI includes an automated build environment in which all code from the hundreds of developers is endlessly , relentless compiled , linked , and validated against thousands of automated tests ; this happens many times each day . [ 15 ]
In test - driven development every function has many automated micro-level unit tests , and all programming starts with writing a new unit test before writing the code to be tested .
Further , every feature has dozens or hundreds of automated high - level tests .
This leads to thousands of automated tests that the developer can rerun locally after each merge step — in addition to their continual execution in the automated build system .
In lean thinking terminology , CI replaces big batches and long cycle times of integration ( the practice of traditional configuration management ) with small batches and short cycles of integration — a repeating lean theme .
Shared Responsibility for Design
In a traditional component team structure , each component has an owner who is responsible for its design and ongoing “ conceptual integrity . ”
On the other hand , feature teams result in shared ownership .
This could — without the practices used in agile methods — lead to a degradation of integrity .
All that said , it must be stressed that in reality , code / design degradation happens in many groups anyway , regardless of structure ; recall the reasons component teams ironically often live with obfuscated code ( p. 173 ) .
Continuous integration ( CI ) implies growing a system in small steps — each meant to improve the system a little .
In addition to integration of all code on the trunk multiple times daily and non -stop automated builds running thousands of automated tests , CI with on - going design improvement is supported by other practices :
evolutionary design culture — since ( as Conway points out ) the initial design vision is rarely great , and in any event since software is ever - changing , encourage a culture in which people view the design or architecture as a living thing that needs never - ending incremental refinement
— since ( as Conway points out ) the initial design vision is rarely great , and in any event since software is ever - changing , encourage a culture in which people view the design or architecture as a living thing that needs never - ending incremental refinement – a sequential life cycle with a single upfront architectural or design phase gives the false message that the design is something we define and build once , rather then continually refine every day for the life of the system test - driven development — drive code development with automated micro- unit tests and higher - level tests ; each test drives a small increment of functionality
— drive code development with automated micro-unit tests and higher - level tests ; each test drives a small increment of functionality – this leads to hundreds of thousands of automated tests refactoring ; a key step — after each micro-change of a new unit test and related solution code , perform a small refactoring step to improve the code / design quality ( remove duplication , increase encapsulation , … ) – refactoring implies always leaving the code a little better than we found it – note that design quality means code quality ; there is no real ‘ design ’ in software other than the source code [ Reeves92 ]
These CI practices support continuous design improvement with feature teams , and the 9th agile principle : Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility .
Plus , there are strong connections between these agile practices and the lean principles Stop and Fix , Continuous Improvement , and the kaizen practice of endless and relentless small steps of improvement — in this case , “ kaizen in code . ”
Successfully moving from solo to shared code ownership supported by agile practices does n’t happen overnight .
The practice of component guardians can help .
Super - fragile components ( for which there is concern [ 16 ] ) have a component guardian whose role is to teach others about the component ensures that the changes in it are skillful , and help remove the fragility .
She is not the owner of the component ; changes are made by feature team members .
A novice person ( or team ) to the component asks the component guardian to teach him and help make changes , probably in design workshops and through pair programming .
The guardian can also code - review all changes using a ‘ diff ’ tool that automatically sends her e-mail of changes .
This role is somewhat similar to the committer role in open source development . [ 17 ]
It is another example of the lean practices of regular mentoring from seniors and of increasing learning .
Another possible practice is establishing an architecture code police [ OK99 ] ; to quote , “ The architecture police is responsible for keeping a close check on the architecture . ”
Note that since the only real design is in the code , architecture code police are responsible for continually looking at the code ( not at documents ) , identifying weaknesses , and coaching others while programming — they are master - programmer teachers .
Architecture code police are a variant of component guardians ; they are responsible for overall code quality .
But no single person is responsible for a specific component .
Warning :
This practice could devolve into a separate “ PowerPoint architects ” group that is not focussed on the code , and not teaching through pair work .
A related practice is used at Planon , a Dutch company building workplace management solutions .
The co-creator of Scrum , Jeff Sutherland , wrote : “ We have another Scrum company that has hit Gartner Group ’s magic [ leaders ] ” [ Sutherland07 ] .
They have multiple feature teams , each consisting of an architect , developers , testers , and documentation people .
There is also one lead architect , but he is not responsible for defining the architecture and handing it over to the team .
Instead , he is “ the initiator of a professional circle , that includes all architects , to keep the cross - team communication going . ”
Planon ’s term professional circle is a community of practice , in which people with similar interest form a community to share experiences , guide , and learn from each other [ Wenger98 , WMS02 ] .
At Planon , they have a community of practice for different specialists such as architects , testers , and ScrumMasters [ Smeets07 ] .
Another practice to foster successful shared design is the design workshop .
Each iteration , perhaps multiple times , the feature team gets together for between “ two hours and two days ” around giant whiteboard spaces .
They do collaborative agile modeling , sketching on the walls in a creative design conversation .
If there are component guardians or other technical leaders ( that are not part of the feature team ) who can help guide and review the agile modeling , they ideally also participate .
See Figure 7.10 .
For broad architectural issues joint design workshops ( held repeatedly ) can help .
Interested representatives from different feature teams ( not restricted to ‘ official ’ architects ) spend time together at the whiteboards for large - scale and common infrastructure design . [ 18 ]
Participants return to their feature team , teaching joint insights in their local workshops and while pair programming .
Handoff and partially done work ( such as design specifications ) are wastes in lean thinking .
To reduce this and to encourage a culture of teaching , it is desirable that design leaders not be members of a separate group that create specifications , but rather be full - time members on a feature team who also participate in joint design workshops as a part - time architectural community of practice .
Figure 7.10 design workshop with agile modeling
New Mechanisms for Code Stability
Code stability in a component team organization is attempted with component owners .
They implement their portion of a customer feature in their component , hopefully keeping it stable .
Note that stability is an ideal rather than an assured consequence of this approach .
It is common to find large product groups where the build frequently breaks — often as a consequence of the many coordination problems inherent to and between component teams . [ 19 ]
With feature teams , new — and just plain better — stability techniques are used .
Massive test automation with continuous integration ( CI ) is a key practice .
When developers implement new functionality , they write automated tests that are added to the CI system and run constantly .
When a test breaks :
The CI system automatically ( for example , via e-mail or SMS ) informs the set of people who might have broken the build .
Upon notification , one or more of these people stop , investigate , and bring the build back to stability .
– this CI attitude illustrates the lean principle of Stop and Fix
Infrastructure and Reuse Work
In a component team organization , goals such as a reusable framework or improving test automation are usually met by formation of a temporary project group or with an existing component team .
In a feature team organization with Scrum , these major goals are added to the Product Backlog — an exception to the guideline to focus on adding customer - feature items , since these goals span all features .
This backlog infrastructure work is prioritized by the Product Owner in collaboration with the teams .
Then the infrastructure work is given to an existing feature team , as any other backlog item .
This team works on infrastructure for a few iterations ( delivering incremental results each iteration ) and thus may be called an infrastructure team , a temporary role until they return to normal feature team responsibility .
Difficult - to - Learn Skills
A feature team may not have mastery of all skills needed to finish a feature .
This is a solvable problem if there is the potential skill [ KS01 ] .
On the other hand , some skills are really tough to learn , such as graphic art or specialized color mathematics .
Solutions :
fixed specialist for the iteration — This creates a constraint in the iteration planning ; all work related to that skill needs to be done by the feature team with the specialist ( who may be a permanent or temporary visiting member ) .
— This creates a constraint in the iteration planning ; all work related to that skill needs to be done by the feature team with the specialist ( who may be a permanent or temporary visiting member ) .
– A good Stop and Fix approach to working with the specialist is that he is a teacher and reviewer , not a doer roaming specialist — During the iteration planning several teams request help from a specialist ; she schedules which teams she will work with ( and coach ) and roams between them .
— During the iteration planning several teams request help from a specialist ; she schedules which teams she will work with ( and coach ) and roams between them .
visit the specialist at her primary team — the specialist physically stays with one feature team that needs her most ( for the iteration ) and invites other people to visit her for mini- design workshops , review , and consultation .
Solo specialists are bottlenecks ; avoid these solutions unless team learning is not an option .
Encourage specialists to coach , not do .
Coordinating Functional Skills : Communities of Practice
An old issue in cross-functional teams is the development and coordination of functional skills and issues across the teams , such as testing skills or architectural issues .
The classic solution , previously introduced , is to support communities of practice ( COP ) [ Wenger98 , WMS02 ] .
For example , there can be a COP leader for the test discipline that coordinates education and resolution of common issues across the testers who are full - time members of different feature teams and part - time members of a common testing COP .
Organizational Structure
In a component - and functional - team ( for example , test team ) organization , members typically report to component and functional managers ( for example , the “ testing manager ” ) .
What is the management structure in an agile - oriented enterprise of cross-functional , cross -component feature teams ?
In an agile enterprise , several feature teams can report to a common feature team ’s line manager .
The developers and testers on the team report to the same person .
Note that this person is not a project manager , because in Scrum and other agile methods , teams are self - managing with respect to project work ( 11th agile principle ) .
Handling Defects
In a traditional component team structure , the team is usually given responsibility for handling defects related to their component .
Note that this inhibits long - term systems improvement and throughput by increasing interrupt - driven multitasking ( reducing productivity ) for the team , and by avoiding learning and reinforcing the weakness and bottleneck of depending upon single points of success or failure .
On a large product with ( for example ) 50 feature teams , an alternative that our clients have found useful is to have a rotating maintenance ( defect ) group .
Each iteration , a certain number of feature teams move into the role of maintenance group .
At the end of the two or three iterations , they revert to feature teams doing new features , and other feature teams move into maintenance .
Lingering defects that are n’t resolved by the timebox boundary are carried back to the feature team role and wrapped up before new feature work is done .
As an additional learning mechanism , consider adding the practice of handling defects with pair programming , pairing someone who knows more and someone who knows less , to increase skills transfer .
In a great blow for consumers everywhere , the prospect of 3 - strikes for copyright infringers has returned with a vengeance , as both the EU Council and French Constitutional court pushed forward with their respective legislation .
HADOPI is alive , and the EU has shredded requirements for judicial oversight .
The threat of 3 - strikes based legislation had been reduced in recent weeks , with strong protests in the UK and proposed legislation elsewhere meeting stiff opposition .
However , none of this stopped the lobby groups , or the politicians looking to push for the ruling .
In the EU , the amendment , which would protect against 3 - strikes laws by requiring due judicial process to occur before any sanction ( such as cutting off Internet access ) , has been substantially watered down .
Meanwhile , in France the Constitutional Court has ruled in favor of a slightly modified version of HADOPI – their legislation which includes a 3 - strikes sanction .
On Tuesday , the Parliament gave up on Amendment 138 , which had been voted on twice by the assembly , gaining a majority both times .
The amendment was supposed to protect the rights of citizens from being treated as guilty upon the accusations of an industry group , and punished based on the same .
It read ;
Applying the principle that no restriction may be imposed on the fundamental rights and freedoms of end -users , without a prior ruling by the judicial authorities , notably in accordance with Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union on freedom of expression and information , save when public security is threatened in which case the ruling may be subsequent .
Instead , they are now considering a version which does not guarantee the right to an effective and timely judicial review .
Christian Engstrom , the Pirate Party ’s MEP , commented on the amendment in his blog .
He included the differences in text that have been made since Tuesday ( bold denotes added text , strike - through indicates removed ) in a meeting between three negotiators for the European Parliament and representatives for the Council of Ministers .
The changes included the removal of the judicial guarantee , that any measures should come only after a fair an impartial procedure ( and should now just ‘ respect ’ such things ) , and the ACTA - like inclusion of ‘ National Security ’ clauses .
He summarized things simply , saying : “ It shows utter contempt for Parliament by totally ignoring everything it says .
The Council plans to bypass Parliament and once and for all prove that it is they who make the decisions , end of story . ”
Meanwhile , France ’s highest Constitutional Court has approved a slightly modified version of HADOPI .
While initially blocked last September , a change to require a judge to sign off on the disconnection action ( rather than the Agency itself ) has meant it passed the Court .
However , such court measures will be ‘ fast tracked ’ rather than given full judicial process , a situation the New York Times describes as ‘ similar to traffic violations ’ .
This has angered many , including ( of course ) the Pirate Party .
Laurent Le Besnerais of the Parti Pirate and Pirate Party International called it “ a huge blow for Internet Freedom . ”
“ In June 2009 , this same Council declared that Internet access is a fundamental right which cannot be restricted without judicial process , ” he told Torrent Freak .
“ Today , the council gives a judge the right and responsibility to pronounce a closure of Internet access to anyone suspected of having shared illegally .
Furthermore , the suspect will have to prove his innocence , which creates a presumption of guilt . ”
With the flip - flopping over these measures , it can only be seen as a greater boost for the European Pirate Parties in future elections .
However , since much of the party works and draws its support online , there is the risk that members could start having their net connections cut off .
With evidential standards so low , would it really be beyond the realms of possibility that political critics of these plans could end up being cut off at the say - so of those they oppose ?
If all goes as planned the agency will be staffed next month , with letters starting in the new year , and terminations starting as soon as next summer .
How long the law will stay once the innocent start being punished is harder to predict .
As with IPRED , the people the law aims to deal with will just use seedboxes , VPNs , and open WiFi hotspots instead of their home connections .

NASA Television Receives Philo T. Farnsworth Primetime Emmy Award
WASHINGTON -- NASA Television has been honored with a Primetime Emmy Award by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences .
The 2009 Philo T. Farnsworth
Award recognizes the agency for engineering excellence and commemorates the 40th anniversary of the technological innovations that made possible the first live TV broadcast from the moon by the Apollo 11 crew on July 20 , 1969 .
The prestigious Emmy Award , named after the man credited with designing and building the world 's first working television system , honors an agency , company or institution with contributions over a long period of time that have significantly affected the state of television technology and engineering .
" I congratulate the many NASA staffers who are being recognized by the academy with this award for contributions to television engineering excellence , " NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said .
" From the first landing of man on the moon in 1969 to today 's high definition broadcasts of America 's ongoing space exploration initiatives , television has been a powerful communications tool that enables the agency to share its achievements in exploration and discovery with the world .
"
In 1927 , Farnsworth was the first inventor to transmit a television image comprised of 60 horizontal lines .
He developed the dissector tube , the foundation of the modern electronic televisions .
In a 1996 interview , his wife Elma , whose nickname was Pem , said the two of them watched with pride the televised Apollo 11 moonwalk .
" We were watching it and when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon Phil turned to me and said , ' Pem , this has made it all worthwhile . '
Before then , he was n't too sure .
" Over the agency 's 50 - year history , NASA TV has served as a vital engineering and mission support resource and a valuable communications outlet .
" I am honored to have been selected to accept this award on behalf of NASA and the hundreds of engineers and technicians who made the telecast of this historic event possible , " said Richard Nafzger , an engineer at NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. , Nafzger was 28 years old when he worked with the team that brought television from the moon to a world - wide audience estimated at more than 600 million people .
Joining Nafzger in accepting the honor will be Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot and moonwalker Buzz Aldrin .
Today , NASA TV is available on four digital channels , serving the general public , educators and journalists .
It also is streamed continuously over the agency 's Internet homepage .
The Primetime Emmys are awarded by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences in North Hollywood , Calif .
Recipients of the Engineering Awards will receive their statues during a special ceremony on Saturday , Aug. 22 , at the Renaissance Hotel in Los Angeles .
This is NASA Television 's second Emmy Award for 2009 .
In January , the Midsouth Chapter of the National Television Academy awarded NASA TV the Governor 's Award for Lifetime Achievement at a ceremony in Nashville , Tenn .

Nearly four in ten companies have staff whose main job is to monitor the outgoing email of colleagues , according to US data security research .
More than a third of the companies surveyed hired staff to perform only that monitoring function .
Email security company Proofpoint interviewed email chiefs at 220 companies which employed more than 1,000 people .
It found that companies were so worried about employees leaking information via email that 38 per cent of them paid other employees to monitor communications .
" An increasing number say they employ staff to read or otherwise analyze the contents of outbound email ( 38 per cent , up from 29 per cent in 2008 ) , " said a Proofpoint statement .
" The pain of data leakage has become so acute in 2009 that more US companies report they employ staff whose primary or exclusive job is to monitor the content of outbound email ( 33 percent , up from 15 percent in 2008 ) . "
The survey suggested that companies have reason to be careful .
Proofpoint said that 43 per cent of the companies told it that they had investigated email leaks of confidential information in the past year .
" Nearly a third [ of companies ] , 31 percent , terminated an employee for violating email policies in the same period ( up from 26 per cent in 2008 ) , " said Proofpoint 's statement .
Blogs are also increasingly a source of concern for companies .
The survey found that 18 per cent of the companies it spoke to had conducted an investigation into employees ' use or blogs or message boards and 17 per cent had disciplined an employee for breaking company rules on their use .
Workers had been fired over blog and message board use at 9 per cent of the companies interviewed .
The research also uncovered the dissemination of sensitive or valuable company information through social networks such as Linked In , Facebook or MySpace .
It found that 17 per cent of companies had had information exposed through those channels , and that 8 per cent had fired employees because of it .
Proofpoint said some data leaks being experienced by companies are related to the economic downturn .
It found that 18 per cent of companies believed a leak was related to an employee who was leaving the company , and that 42 per cent of firms believed that increasing layoffs at their firm created an increased risk of data leakage .
Morag Hutchison , an employment law expert at Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind OUT - LAW .
COM , said that if companies in the UK want to take action against individuals relating to their email or internet use then they have to have clearly spelled out at the outset what is and is not allowed .
" We advise employers to ensure that they have a email and internet use policy setting out what , if any , personal use of the internet and email is allowed at work , " said Hutchison .
She said that any policy had to be actively communicated to have any effect .
" It is important that this policy is clearly communicated to all employees and that the employer monitors compliance of it and takes the appropriate enforcement action if they discover a breach .
The internet policy should also cross reference the disciplinary policy that the employer is required to follow , " she said .
" It is also important that the policy is consistently applied , and not just applied to people the company wants to let go . "

" It 's time to stop the tanning madness , " said Jenice Armstrong in the Philadelphia Daily News .
A new report by the World Health Organization ranks " tanning beds and the ultraviolet radiation they emit right up there with tobacco , asbestos , and plutonium " as a known cancer risk .
The risk of skin cancer jumps by 75 percent for people who start using tanning beds before age 30 — it's a wonder tanning salons are still legal .
" Tanning junkies " have ignored warnings about skin cancer for years , said Melissa Dahl in MSNBC , but this time " something clicked . "
Tanning salons across the country are reporting a spike in canceled appointments .
But , " not surprisingly , the indoor tanning industry takes issue with the new report . "
Dan Humiston , president of the Indoor Tanning Association , says it 's not tanning beds that are dangerous , just the kind of " overexposure " that produces sunburn .
The Indoor Tanning Association has even " shamelessly " claimed that tanning beds offer health benefits , said USA Today in an editorial , because their rays are a source of vitamin D .
The industry has even called attempts to link tanning beds to melanoma " irresponsible . "
But " it 's the industry that appears irresponsible , much as Big Tobacco once was as it tried to refute science . "
It only took a few Google searches to compile the data and it is apparent in testimony before Congress .
Folks , 100 million Americans with insurance are already on some sort of Government plan .
43 million are on Medicare
42 million are on Medicaid
4 million are on Tricare ( active and reserve military , plus retirees ) - no link , this is an estimate
8 million are covered by the Veterans Administration
7.4 million are on SCHIP
1.8 million are served by the Indian Health Services
2.7 million Americans are offered the FEHBP
656,000 are US Post Office employees
3.8 million are full - time State government employees
10.9 million workers are full - time Local government employees - 6 million of them public school teachers .
Does anyone know a public school teacher without a good insurance plan ?
We all know the government needs to get it 's hands off of your Medicare , but to fully assess the government role in health insurance we must include all the private health insurance plans which are government - administered .
These plans are contracted to private insurance companies , but because of the combined bargaining powers of government and civil service unions , they offer better benefits at a lower cost - exactly what we all want , right ?
The numbers add up to more than 124 million people .
20 % are either duplicates or people who do n't enroll in their government - sponsored plans for some reason , according to the CBO .
That leaves 100 million on the government health care - teat , roughly 40 % of the 260 million Americans who have health insurance at all .
Am I missing something here ?
100 Million of us already have " government " health insurance !!!
Why is n't this number constantly being thrown in the face of the idiots who tell us the government should " stay out " of health care ?
If Democrats pointed out that the " Public Option " is no more or less than what is already offered to 100 million people all over the country , whom the Republicans claim are " happy " with the " status quo " , would n't that bring more people on board to finally get the Health Insurance reform bill Americans need ?
Afghanistan : A War of Lies
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis Recently by Eric Margolis : Those Tricky Iranians Are Now Threatening To Cooperate
President Barack Obama and Congress are wrestling with widening the war in Afghanistan .
After eight years of military operations costing US $ 236 billion , the US commander in Afghanistan just warned of the threat of " failure , " aka defeat .
Truth is war ’s first casualty .
The Afghan War ’s biggest untruth is , " we ’ve got to fight terrorists over there so we do n’t have to fight them at home . "
Politicians and generals keep using this canard to justify a war they ca n’t otherwise explain or justify .
Many North Americans still buy this lie because they believe the 9/11 attacks came directly from the Afghanistan - based al - Qaida and Taliban movements .
Not true .
The 9/11 attacks were planned in Germany and Spain , and conducted mainly by US - based Saudis to punish America for supporting Israel ’s repression of the Palestinians .
Taliban , a militant religious , anti-Communist movement of Pashtun tribesmen , was totally surprised by 9/11 .
Osama bin Laden , on whom 9/11 is blamed , was in Afghanistan as a guest because he was a national hero for fighting the Soviets in the 1980 ’s and was aiding Taliban ’s struggle against the Afghan Communist - dominated Northern Alliance afterwards .
Taliban received US aid until May , 2001 .
The CIA was planning to use Osama bin Laden ’s al - Qaida to stir up Muslim Uighurs against Chinese rule , and to employ Taliban against Russia ’s Central Asian allies .
Most of the so - called " terrorist training camps " in Afghanistan were being run by Pakistani intelligence to prepare mujahidin fighters for combat in Indian - held Kashmir .
In 2001 , Al - Qaida only numbered 300 members .
Most have since been killed .
A handful escaped to Pakistan .
Only a few remain in Afghanistan .
Yet President Obama insists 68,000 or more US troops must stay in Afghanistan to fight al - Qaida and prevent extremists from reacquiring " terrorist training camps . "
This claim , like Saddam ’s nonexistent weapons of mass destruction , is a handy slogan to market war to the public .
Today , half of Afghanistan is under Taliban control .
Anti-American militants could more easily use Somalia , Indonesia , Bangladesh , North and West Africa , or Sudan .
They do n’t need remote Afghanistan .
The 9/11 attacks were planned in apartments , not camps .
However backwards and oafish its Pashtun tribesmen , they have no desire or interest in attacking America .
Taliban are the sons of the US - backed mujahidin who defeated the Soviets in the 1980’s .
Taliban never was America ’s enemy .
Instead of invading Afghanistan in 2001 , the US should have paid Taliban to uproot al - Qaida — as I wrote in the Los Angeles Times in 2001 .
The Pashtun tribes want to end foreign occupation and drive out the Afghan Communists and drug lords , who now dominate the US - installed Kabul regime .
But the US has blundered into a full - scale war not just with Taliban , but with most of Afghanistan ’s fierce Pashtun tribes , who comprise over half the population .
This conflict is now spreading into Pashtun regions of Pakistan .
Last week , the US Ambassador in Islamabad actually called for US air and missile attacks on the Pakistan ’s city of Quetta , where some senior Taliban figures are said to be located .
The US is sinking ever deeper into the South Asian morass .
Washington is trying to arm - twist Pakistan into being more obedient and widening the war against its own independent - minded Pashtun tribes — wrongly called " Taliban . "
Washington ’s incredibly ham - handed efforts to use US $ 7.5 billion to bribe Pakistan ’s feeble , corrupt government and army , take control of military promotions , and get some sort of control over Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal , sparked a firestorm of anger .
Pakistan ’s soldiers are on the verge of revolt .
So , too , Washington ’s plans to build a 1,000 - person fortress embassy in Islamabad , a consulate in Peshawar that will clearly serve as an intelligence base , and the deployment of growing numbers of US mercenaries in Pakistan .
It ’s all a neat circle .
Washington says it will need more personnel and a bigger embassy to supervise the distribution of the increased aid to Pakistan , and more mercenaries ( AKA " contractors " ) to protect them .
President Obama has been under intense pressure to expand the war from flag - waving Republicans , much of the media , and the hawkish national security establishment .
Israel ’s supporters , including many Congressional Democrats , want to see the US seize Pakistan ’s nuclear arms and expand the Afghan war into Iran .
Israel ’s hawkish foreign minister , Avigdor Lieberman , recently identified Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iraq as the main threats to Israel .
President Obama should admit Taliban is not and never was a threat to the west ; that the wildly exaggerated al - Qaida has been mostly eradicated ; and that the US - led war in Afghanistan is causing more damage to US interests in the Muslim world — now 25 % of all humanity — than Bin Laden and his few ragtag allies .
The bombing in Madrid and London , and conspiracy in Toronto , were all horribly wrongheaded protests by young Muslims against the Afghan War .
We are not going to change the way Afghans treat their women by waging war on them , or bring democracy through rigged elections .
We are not going to win hearts and minds by imposing a Communist - dominated Kabul regime on pious Muslims , bombing their villages and sending Marines to kick down their doors and violate their homes .
US Afghan commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal is demanding 40,000 — 80,000 more troops .
Even this number will not win the war in which Washington cannot even define the terms of victory .
The only way out of this morass is through a negotiated settlement that enfranchises and includes the Pashtun and their fighting arm , Taliban .
If the Afghan resistance ever gets modern antiaircraft and antitank missiles , the western occupation forces will be cut off and doomed .
Today , they can barely hold on against the lightly - armed Taliban .
I wish President Obama would just declare victory in Afghanistan , withdraw western forces , and hand over security to a multinational stabilization force from Muslim nations .
Good presidents , like good generals , know when to retreat .

Google is apparently answering the complaints of Android developers by re-designing the on - device store to put more emphasis on paid software .
The current version of the Android Market emphasizes popularity .
By default , items are listed in order by the number of times they have been downloaded .
This means the free software is given priority , as free apps are always get downloaded more often — users are more willing to try out an app they know they wo n’t have to pay for .
This is clearly the case with Android ’s on - device software store .
In the list of all applications , users have to skim past dozens and dozens of titles before coming to the first paid one .
Many Android developers believe this is stifling the success of paid software .
This includes Larva Labs , which makes two of the top twelve paid apps on the Android Market , This game developer listed “ Hard to find paid apps ” in its recent blog post listing the top five problems with the Android Market , and says that so far it is averaging $ 62.39 a day in sales from Google store .
Others are having problems too .
Demiforce makes the game Trism , which is available for both the iPhone and Android .
The iPhone version pulled in over $ 250,000 in its first two months on the App Store — the Android version has not yet sold 500 copies .
The New System
However , Google seems to be aware of these concerns , and is moving to address them .
Some screenshots of the next version of the Android Market have leaked out , and they show that the new default view will be to show “ Top paid ” software , putting much more emphasis on this class of software .
However , users will also have the option to switch to tabs showing “ Top free ” and “ Just in ” apps .
A Better Payment System , Too
Another of Larva Labs complaints is that all purchases made through the Android Market have to go through Google Checkout , which currently only supports buying items with a credit card .
As Larva Labs says , “ Lots of users do n’t have credit cards , or do n’t want to use their credit card to make an impulse buy . ”
Google is in the process of changing this , too .
It has promised an update Google Checkout that will make it more flexible , including allowing users to charge items on their mobile phone bill .
Other Changes Requested
Despite these changes , there ’s still room for progress .
The leaked screenshots of the next version of Android market do n’t address some of the other complaints .
For example , developers are still very limited in the amount of text they can use to describe their software , and they ca n’t include a screenshot — the Apple App Store gives room for an extensive description , and a screenshot , too .

As the world still struggles to deal with the first truly global recession , little attention has been given to the growing number of hungry people and the possibility of mounting food crises in the years ahead .
According to the World Bank , over a billion people around the world are now chronically hungry .
Stagnant agricultural productivity , rising food prices and now declining incomes , especially in much of Africa and parts of South Asia , have brought the world dangerously close to humanitarian distress and resulting social and political instability .
Averting such a calamity must be high on the global agenda .
Surprisingly , while our world may be increasingly urban , the world of the poor and hungry remains overwhelmingly rural .
Of the 1.2 billion people in the world living on less than a dollar a day , the majority , almost 700 million , are small farmers , farm labourers and their families in Sub -Saharan Africa and South Asia who are unable to sustain themselves , not to mention rapidly growing urban populations , due to decades of lagging farm productivity .
Most of the world ’s hungry people are women and children .
Women comprise 80 per cent of Africa ’s farmers , but they have access to only 5 per cent of the continent ’s agricultural land , credit and extension services , a key reason for the region ’s average grain yield being one - fifth that of the US and Europe .
Sub -Saharan Africa accounts for 55 per cent of the global nutritional gap , with devastating impacts on children ’s physical and mental development .
Almost half of all children in South Asia , most of them on farms , are underweight for their age .
Why do we face such a crisis when it seemed so recently that the Green Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s had ushered in an era of food plenty ?
Beginning in the 1980s the world turned its back on agricultural development .
The Green Revolution technologies of new seeds , fertilizer and farm practices resulted in dramatic yield increases for irrigated crops , especially wheat and rice , in settings with adequate infrastructure such as market roads , largely in Asia .
These breakthroughs created the false impression that the world ’s food and farming problems had mostly been solved , when in fact the Green Revolution had bypassed much of Africa and the dry - lands of South Asia .
The rising global demand for food due to population growth and changing diets ( producing one pound of beef takes three pounds of grain ) has outstripped the growth in the production of staple food crops .
Per capita production of maize in Africa , for instance , has actually fallen 14 per cent since 1980 .
The projected increase of Africa ’s population by 2050 means that African agricultural production would need to double just to keep the number of hungry people at today ’s level .
To some extent the gap between food supply and demand has been met by imports .
Commercial grain imports by developing countries almost tripled between 1990 and 2008 .
But the increasing dependence on food imports exposed these economies , and especially their poorest citizens , to wide swings in the world market prices .
In the first half of 2008 grain prices doubled or tripled in some countries .
Since then prices have fallen by 50 - 60 per cent in many countries but remain well above their ten - year average , swelling the ranks of the extremely poor , who spend 50 - 70 per cent of their incomes on food , by at least 100 million people .
These are dangerous portents for the future .
Improving agricultural productivity will become a more , not a less , challenging task in the decades ahead .
The supply of readily arable land is diminishing in most developing countries .
Water scarcity is already a constraint in the semi-arid tropical zones of Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia where pressure on the land is high .
According to the projections of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , weather extremes including severe drought are likely to become more frequent in those same regions .
When the world recovers from recession , income growth and dietary shifts will once again put demand pressure on the world ’s food supply .
But there is good news .
We know how to increase agricultural productivity and farm incomes – through a combination of adaptive agricultural research , improved education and extension , and market development , all aimed at small farmers , especially women farmers .
A new generation of seeds and farm practices and infrastructure improvements will make possible higher yields and increasing farm incomes .
A new Green Revolution can help .
Though Green Revolution technologies have been increasingly criticised as benefiting only larger farms and harming the environment , later studies showed that small farmers benefited as much .
In fact , without yield - increasing technologies , the expansion of agriculture into marginal lands would have wreaked greater environmental damage .
What is required first and foremost is to put agriculture back at the top of the global development agenda .
We seem to have forgotten that no economy has achieved sustained growth and graduated to middle income status without first developing its agriculture .
There are promising signs of change .
The World Bank has announced a new focus on agricultural development in Africa .
The G20 Summit in April 2009 addressed the need , and the G8 are expected to issue a major statement on global food security at their meeting this week .
Under NEPAD — the New African Partnership for Agricultural Development — African nations have committed to devoting more resources to improving agriculture .
The United States is moving to renew American leadership for global agricultural development .
President Obama has announced his support for doubling US foreign assistance for agriculture .
Legislation sponsored by Senators Lugar and Casey proposes to overhaul totally US agricultural development assistance .
But the second Green Revolution cannot be a carbon copy of the first .
It will have to be the result of a partnership between the donor countries , the developing nations and international institutions , with goals defined by African and Asian partners .
It will also have to create public - private partnerships with universities and research institutes , agri-business companies , and non-government organisations committed to hunger and poverty reduction .
While the above policy errors need fixing , the shock of global food price increases in 2008 holds out the hope that even in the midst of a great recession , this most fundamental of human needs can once again become the focus of global concern .
Marshall Bouton is President of The Chicago Council on Global Affairs and directed a recent Council - sponsored study of US global agricultural development policy .

Every weekend during this fall marathon season , long after most runners have completed the 26.2 - mile course  and very likely after many have showered , changed and headed for a meal  a group of stragglers crosses the finish line .
Many of those slower runners , claiming that late is better than never , receive a finisher ’s medal just like every other participant .
Having traversed the same route as the fleeter - footed runners  perhaps in twice the amount of time  they get to call themselves marathoners .
And it ’s driving some hard - core runners crazy .
“ It ’s a joke to run a marathon by walking every other mile or by finishing in six , seven , eight hours , ” said Adrienne Wald , 54 , the women ’s cross-country coach at the College of New Rochelle , who ran her first marathon in 1984 .
“ It used to be that running a marathon was worth something  there used to be a pride saying that you ran a marathon , but not anymore .
Now it ’s , ‘ How low is the bar ? ’ ”
Tens of thousands of runners are training for marathons this time of year .
As the fields continue to grow  primarily by adding slower runners  so has the intensity of the debate over how quickly an able - bodied runner should finish the once - elite event that is now an activity for the masses .

In my previous post , I suggested several possible Polymath projects .
One of them , which initially seemed to be the favourite ( and was my own favourite ) was to have a look at an idea I had had for getting round the Razborov - Rudich obstacle to proving lower bounds in computational complexity .
( This is closely related to the P versus NP problem , though my idea did not obviously apply to that problem itself . )
However , now I am fairly sure I have understood why it cannot work : somehow , even if you come up with an idea for a proof that is not directly ruled out by their result , you find that slightly more complicated arguments , based on their idea , do eventually show that it does n’t work .
While thinking about my approach , I wrote what was intended to be a series of five initial posts for the Polymath project if it happened .
I thought I would experiment , so instead of explaining the basic concepts in the usual way I wrote a dialogue , which I hoped would be easier to read .
It is between three characters , who are denoted by smileys ( or is that smilies ?
no , perhaps not ) .
The main character , :) , is a mathematical optimist , continually becoming enthusiastic about ideas that have not been fully thought through .
The next character , 8 ) , is much more sceptical , and also knows more about computational complexity ( a lot less than an expert in the area , but enough to merit a “ cool ” smiley ) .
Finally , 😐 is a neutral observer who occasionally asks for fuller explanations when 🙂 or 8 ) seem to be omitting them , and sometimes makes easy but useful mathematical observations .
To some extent these characters , particularly the first two , represent different sides of me as I think about the problem .
However , I do not always agree with what they say ( sometimes this is obvious , since they do not always agree with each other ) , and I sometimes allow them to get things wrong , or to think that they have had an idea when in fact that idea is already known .
For example , towards the end of this first part of the conversation , 🙂 has the idea of applying the insights of Razborov and Rudich to other computational models .
Not surprisingly , 🙂 was not the first to think of doing that , as an internet search later revealed .
Since I wrote the post about Polymath projects , the conversation has expanded and is now in seven parts of about 5000 words each .
Be warned in advance that pretty well every idea that 🙂 has is eventually doomed to fail .
But I hope that non-experts will find the failure instructive even if experts just find it wearily familiar .
I also hope that some of the later parts of the conversation might lead to fruitful exchanges of comments even if they do n’t lead to a proper Polymath research project .
For instance , at least at the time of writing , I do n’t have completely satisfactory general explanations for why some of :) ’s approaches fail .
And some of the heuristic arguments ( of which there are many ) presented here are open to criticism .
( Another warning : some of the early arguments are definitely wrong , even when the three characters appear to take them seriously , and their wrongness is pointed out only quite a bit later .
It may be a little unconventional to explain mathematics by putting forward incorrect ideas and correcting them only after their consequences have been explored in detail , but there are plenty of conventional accounts of computational complexity for those who want them . )
For these kinds of reasons , it seems to me that I might as well post the dialogue rather than letting it go to waste .
It ’s even conceivable that somebody will be prompted by the ideas here to have better ideas , in which case maybe something serious could come out of it after all .
I plan to post the seven parts ( or more if I continue to add to them ) of the dialogue at a rate of about one a week , to keep this blog ticking over until I am ready to start a Polymath project on something else .
The first part is very much an introduction .
**************************************************************
🙂 Guess what I ’ve been thinking about recently ?
8 ) The Riemann hypothesis ?
🙂 Very funny .
But actually you ’re not far off .
I ’ve been wondering about the P versus NP problem .
8 ) Wonderful .
Join the club .
But I should warn you that it drives people mad .
🙂 I can believe that , as it ’s driving me a bit mad actually .
8 ) Well , it ’s possible that I may be able to put you out of your misery by showing that whatever you are trying cannot work .
That would replace madness by mere disappointment .
🙂 I suppose if I end up sadder but wiser , then at least I ’m wiser .
8 ) Wow , you ’re definitely a half - full type of person are n’t you ?
🙂 I am actually , not just in real life but in mathematical research as well .
😐 Would someone mind explaining what the P versus NP problem is ?
🙂 Oh , sorry .
Well , P is the class of computational problems that can be solved in polynomial time .
For example , multiplying two - digit numbers can be done in roughly steps ( or fewer if you use clever methods ) and is therefore a problem in P .
It is a widely accepted model for the class of problems that we can solve on a computer without taking unacceptably long .
As for NP , it is the class of problems with the property that a solution can be verified in polynomial time .
For example , the problem of determining whether a graph with vertices contains a clique of size is in NP because if somebody claims that a particular set of vertices is a clique , then this can easily be checked in polynomial time ( simply by looking at every pair of vertices in and checking that they form an edge ) .
If you want to know more , I suggest looking at the Wikipedia article on the topic , which is OK .
I do n’t want to say too much more myself , other than that it is widely considered to be one of the most important problems in mathematics .
That ’s because what I ’ve really been thinking about is a purely mathematical problem that is “ morally equivalent ” to the P versus NP problem .
8 ) Which formulation are you talking about ?
🙂 I ’m talking about finding superpolynomial lower bounds for the circuit complexity of an NP problem .
In particular , I ’m talking about the following formulation .
Let ’s define a Boolean function to be a function from to .
( Usually the range is , but not always , and for the ideas I shall be looking at it is more convenient to take .)
Let us say that a Boolean function is basic if it is of the form for some .
( The basic functions are often called the Rademacher functions . )
And let us define the Boolean operations to be the operations , , and , where and take the pointwise maximum and minimum , respectively , of and .
A straight - line computation of a Boolean function is then a sequence such that each member of the sequence is either a basic function or is created from one or two earlier functions using a Boolean operation .
A Boolean function is said to have circuit complexity at most if there is a straight - line computation of of length at most .
It is not too hard to show that if there exists a Boolean function in NP ( which means that you encode an NP problem in an obvious way and set to be 1 if the answer is yes for and otherwise ) that has superpolynomial circuit complexity , then P does not equal NP .
8 ) Sounds OK to me .
😐 You may know all about that , but I find it an interesting formulation , since it makes no mention of non-mathematical concepts such as “ algorithm ” .
Somehow , the problem feels more approachable when you put it like this .
8 ) It does until you try to solve the reformulated problem …
🙂 Well , let me tell you my idea for solving the reformulated problem .
It ’s an obvious idea really .
8 ) I ’m suspicious already .
If it ’s an obvious idea , then it ’s almost certainly known not to work .
🙂 Well can I try it out anyway ?
The thought was that one could try to define a function ( the letter standing for “ complexity ” ) with the following properties .
( i ) for every basic function .
( ii ) for every .
( iii )
If and are small , then so are and .
( iv ) is very large for some function that belongs to NP .
I admit that I have just been a bit vague about property ( iii ) , but the idea would be to use it to give an inductive argument that is small for every function of polynomial circuit complexity , and hence that does not have polynomial circuit complexity .
8 ) Have you actually got any candidates for such a function ?
🙂 Well , I have n’t yet thought of one that works , but the interesting thing is that my attempts so far have failed for two very different reasons .
8 ) This sounds familiar , but let ’s hear what these attempts were .
🙂 Well , a thought that occurred to me was that maybe functions of low circuit complexity have some kind of structural property that shows that they are not truly random , whereas some function in NP might lack that property .
So one would like to have some measure of pseudorandomness and show that the measure was small for functions of low circuit complexity but large for at least one function in NP .
In additive combinatorics , there are many measures of pseudorandomness , but let me mention just one : we could define to be the reciprocal of the modulus of the largest Fourier coefficient of , since having no large Fourier coefficients is a well - known measure of quasirandomness ( as it would be called in this context ) .
But this does n’t work .
By Parseval ’s identity , the norm of a function is equal to the norm of its Fourier transform .
A Boolean function has norm 1 ( since its modulus is 1 everywhere ) , so the sum of the squares of the moduli of the Fourier coefficients is 1 .
It follows that at least one Fourier coefficient has modulus at least .
But there are polynomially computable Boolean functions for which this bound is attained : I ’m fairly sure an example is the function , where .
Thus , there is no hope of using this particular measure of quasirandomness to distinguish between functions in P and functions in NP .
8 ) You said you ran into another difficulty .
Can you explain what that was ?
🙂 Well , many of my attempts failed for similar reasons to the attempt above .
So then I started to wonder whether there existed a function with anything like the properties I wanted .
And it occurred to me that there does , but for a trivial reason .
I define to be the maximal function such that for every basic function , for every , and and are always at most .
We can say a little bit about this function .
Suppose that has circuit complexity at most .
Then an easy inductive argument shows that is at most …
8 ) Can I interrupt at this point ?
🙂 OK .
8 ) You are defining something very similar to what is known as a formal complexity measure , and the correct version of what you are about to say is that is trivially at most the formula - size complexity of rather than its circuit complexity .
😐 What is formula - size complexity ?
8 ) If I ’m forced to explain it in :) ’s terminology , then I define it as the number of basic functions ( with multiplicity ) you need in a formula that builds out of basic functions using the Boolean operations .
For example , writing for the function , the function has formula - size complexity at most 4 , since I ’ve just written it using four basic functions .
Anyhow , the formula - size complexity of a function can be bigger than its circuit complexity , and probably it can be much bigger .
Therefore , using a formal complexity measure is not that great as a method for proving that P NP .
🙂 Oh no .
That ’s stupid of me .
But it ’s still an interesting problem to prove lower bounds for formula - size complexity is n’t it ?
8 ) Very much so .
The best known lower bound for the formula - size complexity of a function in NP is .
Any improvement on that would be very interesting , and a superpolynomial lower bound would be a big big result .
🙂 Yes , but not a million - dollar result .
8 ) I would n’t worry about that if I were you .
Is n’t lasting fame in the theoretical computer science community good enough for you ?
🙂 Er … well , it would be good , but if I could have a million dollars as well then I would n’t say no .
But actually it ’s not really that .
It ’s that showing that P NP is the big one .
I would n’t have to explain to colleagues in other subjects what I had done .
The formula - size problem is more of interest to specialists .
8 ) That ’s true I suppose .
But it ’s still quite an easy problem to explain to non-specialists .
Can we stop talking about this and get back to the mathematics ?
🙂 All right , I ’ll talk about formula size for now , and leave for later the question of whether any of this would apply to circuit complexity .
Let ’s quickly prove that if we set to be the formula - size complexity of , then we get the largest possible formal complexity measure .
First , it is trivial to verify that is a formal complexity measure .
Now suppose that is another one and let be a function of formula - size complexity .
Then either is plus or minus a basic function , in which case and are both 1 , or the smallest formula for writes as or for two functions and of formula size and with .
But by induction and ; since is a formal complexity measure it follows that is at most .
So , if some specific function has superpolynomial formula size , then there is a formal complexity measure that is big for and small for all functions of small formula size .
But that is a completely uninteresting result , since the formal complexity measure in question is the formula size .
So the problem I have is this .
All the formal complexity measures I can think of fail for one of the following two reasons .
Either is big even for some easily computable functions , so showing that is big does n’t prove that is hard to compute , or is small for all low - complexity functions , but for trivial reasons , so showing that is big is trivially equivalent to showing that is hard to compute .
There does n’t seem to be anything in between .
8 ) Very succinctly put .
Did you know that there are rigorous results that show that the kinds of difficulties you are encountering are not just due to your lack of imagination but are actually essential features of the problem ?
🙂 I had heard something of the kind , but I ’d love to hear more .
8 ) Well , the most famous result of this kind , and the one that best explains your particular difficulties ( other people have had different difficulties that can be explained in other ways ) is due to Razborov and Rudich .
They defined a notion that they call a natural proof , and they showed that , subject to the truth of certain unproved conjectures that almost everybody believes , there cannot be a natural proof that P NP .
To explain their idea , let me say first what a pseudorandom subset of is , where is some finite set .
Let and let be some class of functions from to
Since there are many levels of the set - theoretic hierarchy involved here , let me quickly clarify where appears .
Each function can be thought of as some attempt to recognise elements of The very best one could hope for would be for to be the characteristic function of but we might well be happy if for every and with probability at most 1 / 2 if is chosen purely randomly .
At any rate , if then is a function from to So is a property of Boolean functions that are defined on
Anyhow , we shall say that is –pseudorandom for if
for every function .
Loosely speaking , one could say that functions in “ cannot tell the difference ” between random elements of and random elements of .
A case of particular interest is when is the set of all functions of polynomial circuit complexity ( or , since that does n’t quite make sense , let ’s say of circuit complexity at most , where is the cardinality of ) , and when is some function that tends to zero faster than the reciprocal of any polynomial .
Then we say to ourselves that no polynomial time algorithm can tell the difference between a random element of and a random element of .
😐 A small question .
Could n’t we just let be the set and let ?
I ’d find that less confusing somehow .
8 ) That ’s a better question than you think .
As it happens , I very deliberately did n’t do that , and I believe that by the end of my discussion you will be less confused than if I had .
In fact , let me tell you straight away why I went for a general set .
It ’s because I ’m actually going to use this concept in the case where is the set , so is not but .
In other words , there are even more levels of the set - theoretic hierarchy involved than I was letting on just now .
If you want to get your head round this , it ’s best not to think of as having anything to do with the number .
Just think of it as some group with elements .
It so happens that is a power of 2 , that the group is , and that we do n’t care all that much about its group structure , but put all those thoughts out of your mind and think about functions defined on a finite group that take the values .
Now the thought that underlies the work of Razborov and Rudich is one that you have probably had yourself : it seems to be extraordinarily hard to tell the difference between a random Boolean function of low complexity and a purely random Boolean function .
In fact , so much does this seem to be the case , that one might even hazard a guess that some theorem along the following lines is true : no polynomial - time algorithm can tell the difference between a random Boolean function of low complexity and a purely random Boolean function .
What does this mean ?
In order to stick to our resolution not to think about , let us write for .
Then a random Boolean function is a random function from to , while a random low - complexity Boolean function is a function from to that is built out of basic functions in a certain way .
( More precisely , it comes at the end of a shortish sequence of functions , each of which is obtained by applying a random Boolean operation to some random earlier functions in the sequence , according to some suitable probability distribution — let ’s not worry about the details for now . )
Now it could be that the reason that the random low - complexity functions are hard to distinguish from purely random functions is that the random low - complexity functions form a pseudorandom subset of the set of all Boolean functions on .
Here , it helps to visualize the elements of in a line , so a Boolean function on is just a string of length .
We then pick out of these functions and call them basic , and a low - complexity Boolean function is a function that can be built out of basic functions in a particularly simple way .
What does it mean to say that the low - complexity Boolean functions form a pseudorandom subset ?
It means that if is any function from to that can be computed in polynomial time ( as a function of of course — that ’s the parameter we care about here ) , then the probability that given that has low complexity is almost exactly equal to the probability that .
😐 One small remark .
The function is n’t a Boolean function according to the definition we have been using .
But of course we can interpret it as one by identifying with in an obvious way .
That makes sense of the statement that can be computed in polynomial time .
8 ) You ’re right , and that ’s an argument in favour of making all our Boolean functions take values in .
🙂 Granted , but for the kinds of thoughts I was having it was more natural to have functions that typically averaged .
For example , when discussing Fourier analysis or more general quasirandomness norms it ’s more convenient to use - valued functions .
8 ) Let ’s just all agree that we can switch from one notation to the other as we see fit .
Anyhow , the point is that if you buy the assertion that a random low - complexity function is polynomially indistinguishable from a purely random Boolean function , then you can kiss goodbye to any thoughts of an easy proof that P NP .
🙂 That sounds sort of plausible , but can you spell it out ?
8 ) Certainly .
Let me put the argument a bit loosely though .
If you want to prove that P NP , then an obvious approach would be to find some “ simplicity property ” that all functions in P have , and some function in NP does not have .
That property will be a property of Boolean functions on , or equivalently of elements of .
Now let ’s suppose that the property is something that can be calculated in polynomial time .
Then every random low - complexity function will have the property ( by hypothesis ) , and since the property does not distinguish between random low - complexity functions and purely random functions , it follows that almost every function has the property .
To put it loosely , random functions have the property too .
Now that ’s a bit strange , since the property was supposed to be one that applied to “ simple ” functions , and for any sensible definition of “ simple ” one would want a random function to be simple with only very tiny probability .
But this argument shows that you ca n’t have that .
If you define some notion of simplicity in the hope of proving that functions in P are simple and some function in NP is not simple , then either your notion of simple will not be computable in polynomial time ( in the size of the group on which your functions are defined ) or it will apply to almost all functions .
🙂 Wow .
I can see that that rules out a lot of the ideas I had been having .
For example , the Fourier transform of a function on the group can be calculated in time that is polynomial in , and almost all functions have no large Fourier coefficient , so it was guaranteed in advance that the property “ has no large Fourier coefficient ” would apply not just to some low - complexity functions but in fact to almost all low - complexity functions .
8 ) Actually , I must admit that I oversimplified a bit .
What Razborov and Rudich actually showed was not that the low - complexity functions form a pseudorandom subset of the set of all Boolean functions , but rather that it is possible to find a probability distribution that is concentrated on the low - complexity functions such that a random function chosen from this probability distribution cannot be distinguished by a polynomial - time algorithm from a purely random Boolean function .
To oversimplify again , but much less , they found a clever subset of the set of all low - complexity functions rather than taking all of them .
Also , and importantly , in order to show this they relied on an unproved hypothesis that asserts that certain kinds of pseudorandom generators exist .
But this hypothesis , which is actually stronger than the hypothesis that P NP , is widely believed , and if it is true then the argument above still goes through .
🙂 I ’m going to have to go away and think about this .
😐 Meanwhile , can this paper be found online ?
8 ) Yes .
Here is the paper of Razborov and Rudich , and here is a very nice discussion of natural proofs by Luca Trevisan .
😐 Thanks very much .
I ’ll go and have a look at those .
By the way , where does the term “ natural proof ” come from ?
8 ) Oh sorry , I forgot to say .
Well , Razborov and Rudich call a proof that P NP natural if it defines some property of simplicity with the following features :
( i ) all low - complexity functions are simple ;
( ii ) a random function is , with high probability ( or even with non-tiny probability ) , not simple ;
( iii ) whether or not a function is simple can be determined in polynomial time ( in ) ;
( iv ) some function in NP fails to be simple .
The discussion above can be rephrased as saying that there is no property that satisfies ( i ) to ( iii ) .
In particular , if pseudorandom generators exist ( which they do if , for instance , factorizing is hard ) , then there is no natural proof that P NP .
🙂 Hmm . I ’m not sure how to react to this .
Initially I thought that perhaps I would be OK because , as you ’ve pointed out to me , I was effectively thinking about formula size rather than circuit complexity .
And the Razborov - Rudich result does n’t tell us that there is no natural proof that some function in NP has large formula size .
But then it occurred to me that we could use their basic insight to give at least a heuristic argument that there is no natural proof that a function has large formula size either .
Can I try it out on you ?
8 ) Sure , go ahead .
🙂 Well , let me try to convince you that there is no natural proof that some specific function in NP has formula size greater than .
To do this , I ’ll define a notion of a random formula inductively as follows .
Let the basic functions be .
I start by writing each basic function out times , and also minus each basic function times .
I now have a list , with lots of repeats , of length .
I now make a formula out of this in steps as follows .
At the first step , I choose at random two functions and in my list , and I randomly decide either to take or to take .
And then I remove and from the list and add the function .
I then keep on repeating this process .
At each stage , the number of functions in the list goes down by , so after steps I ’m down to one function .
That is my random function of formula size at most .
8 ) So what ?
🙂 Well , unfortunately I do n’t know how to prove anything about this random model .
But it is at least plausible that a random function produced in this way is indistinguishable to any polynomial - time algorithm from a purely random Boolean function .
And if that ’s the case , then exactly the same argument goes through , and no natural proof could give lower bounds for formula size .
8 ) Yes , but what makes you say that that huge assumption of yours is even plausible , let alone true ?
🙂 I do n’t know .
There just seems to be some kind of meta - principle that everything is either easy or impossible .
So if there is n’t some obvious way to look at the values taken by a Boolean function defined by a smallish formula and work out what that formula is , then probably even telling the difference between a random function of low formula size and a purely random function is a problem that ca n’t be solved in polynomial time .
And even if we merely suspect that that might be the case , then it should make us happier if our attempt to prove a lower bound for formula size was not an attempt to find a natural proof .
8 ) Hmm … that feels a bit circular to me .
It ’s a bit like saying , “ If there ’s no such thing as a natural proof then there ’s no such thing as a natural proof . ”
🙂 I do n’t see it that way .
The way I ’d put it is , “ My gut tells me that no polynomial - time algorithm can distinguish between a random low - formula - size function and a purely random function , so if I try to solve that problem by finding a suitable complexity measure , then I ’m going to have to look for complexity measures that cannot be calculated in polynomial time . ”
[ In fact , this model of a random formula is flawed .
See this comment of Luca Trevisan .
And Ryan Williams suggests another reason that it may not work . ]
While I ’m at it , I ’d like to mention another problem that I find very appealing .
It ’s sometimes thought of as a toy version of the P versus NP problem , in that the difficulties that arise feel quite similar .
The question is this : find an explicit non-singular matrix over ( where “ explicit ” means that it can be computed in polynomial time ) such that the number of Gaussian row - operations needed to turn it into the identity is superlinear .
😐 Can you explain that in slightly more detail ?
🙂 OK .
Over any field , any non-singular matrix can be turned into the identity by a combination of three operations : interchanging two rows , adding one row to another , and multiplying a row by a non -zero scalar .
A simple counting argument shows that the number of row operations you need to turn a random non-singular matrix over into the identity is at least .
( Sketch : the number of non-singular matrices is not far off , and the number of sequences of at most row - operations is at most , since the number of distinct row - operations is at most .
Putting these two facts together and using the fact that row - operations are invertible , one gets the result after an easy computation . )
But it is very hard to prove that any specific matrix needs more than , say , operations , though it is easy to define matrices that at least appear to need more than this .
😐 Thanks , that was useful .
🙂 The point I wanted to make about this problem is that it too may be difficult for a formal reason .
Suppose it is the case that there is no polynomial - time algorithm that can tell the difference between a purely random matrix and a matrix that is produced from the identity by applying to it a random sequence of row - operations .
I do n’t have any evidence in favour of that supposition , but neither can I think of some sophisticated algorithm for row - reducing a matrix that will always find a short sequence of operations if such a sequence exists .
So I find the supposition at least moderately plausible .
If it is true , then there is no natural proof that some specific matrix cannot be row - reduced using a linear number of operations .
Here , a natural proof would be a polynomially computable property of matrices that all products of linearly many elementary matrices had , but that some explicit matrix lacked .
8 ) OK , thanks for that .
You seem to have become a sort of optimistic pessimist .
🙂 I see what you mean .
But actually I ’m a bit depressed by all this .
8 ) Well , there are some people , including Razborov and Rudich in their original paper , who maintain that one should n’t necessarily react that way .
If somebody shows you that a certain type of argument cannot work , then it should narrow down the search space and make finding a proof easier .
So one can see the Razborov - Rudich argument as a very helpful hint rather than as a brick wall .
🙂 Yes , I like that .
The trouble is that right now I ca n’t see how to get into this nice area that lies between natural proofs and useless universal proofs .
I think we ’d better stop this conversation for now , but I ’ll be back .
8 ) I ’m looking forward to it .

It ’s a lesson he should have learned from Plaxico Burress — but this was worse .
A 15 - year - old Brooklyn boy shot himself in the penis Sunday after fumbling with a gun that had slid from his waistband , authorities said yesterday .
Khamir Grant was then arrested for reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon — the same charges levied against Burress , who shot himself at a Manhattan nightclub in 2008 , law - enforcement sources said .
Grant told cops that he was walking home from Amersfort Park at East 39th Street and Avenue J in East Flatbush around 1:30 a.m. , when the gun began to fall into his pants , sources said .
When Grant grabbed for it , he accidentally pulled the trigger , firing a bullet right through his penis .
Grant staggered home and told his mom what had happened , sources said .
They took a livery car to Kings County Hospital , where Grant was released after treatment and then arrested by police .

She stood alone in the sodden field on the outskirts of Paris , her fashionable ankle boots firmly planted in the mud churned up by the cavalry who drilled there .
No , she would not be tied to the stake , she told her executioners politely .
And nor would she allow them to blindfold her .
She faced the barrels of the firing squad without flinching .
Earlier , at 5 am , they had woken her in her filthy cell in the Prison de Saint - Lazare to tell her this was the day she would die .
She dressed in her best - stockings , a low - cut blouse under a dove - grey , two - piece suit .
Scroll down for more ...
On her head she perched a three - cornered hat at a jaunty angle , hiding her greying hair , unkempt and unwashed through nine months of incarceration .
Over her shoulders she slung a vivid blue coat like a cloak to keep out the cold October air .
In a black car with its window blinds down , Margaretha Zelle , convicted of espionage , was then driven at speed through the still streets of the capital - a place she loved with a passion , though she was Dutch not French - to this damp and drear spot .
The 12 soldiers in their khaki uniforms and red fezzes raised their rifles .
She waved to the two weeping nuns who had been her comfort in prison and on her last journey .
She blew a kiss to the priest and another to her lawyer , an
ex -lover .
The sun was coming up when the shots rang out .
Zelle slumped to the ground .
The officer in charge marched forward and fired a single bullet into her brain , the coup de grace .
An extraordinary life was over .
The woman who was executed that day in 1917 was better known as Mata Hari , the name Zelle had chosen for herself when she became Europe 's queen of unbridled eroticism , an exotic dancer , courtesan , harlot , great lover , spendthrift , liar , deceiver and thief .
And German spy ?
That is what - in the fevered atmosphere of France in World War I , with the Kaiser 's troops encamped within its borders - she had been shot for .
She caused the deaths of tens of thousands of French soldiers , it was said , a crime that would ever after make her synonymous with seduction and treachery , the ultimate femme fatale .
Except that she may not have been guilty at all .
In a new and fascinating biography , American academic Pat Shipman makes the case that , far from being the betrayer , she was the one betrayed , and by that breed she loved all her life - men .
It was men who , like witchhunters , built the case against her , driven by prejudice not fact .
And with France gripped by anti-German spy mania , few would stick their heads above the parapet to defend her .
Britain 's fledgling intelligence service , MO5 ( soon to change its name to MI5 ) also helped dig her grave with , as we will see , the dodgiest of dossiers .
But in the story of Mata Hari , there was one thing that needed no sexing - up - Mata herself .
Sex was the driving force of her life .
In the little Dutch town where she grew up , her shopkeeper father lavished extremes of affection on his " little princess " .
It made her vain , self - centred and spoilt , and with an insatiable longing for male attention .
At school , the 16 - year - old bedded the headmaster .
Was he the seducer or her ?
No one knows , but this was 1893 and it was the girl who was sent home in shame .
The restless teenager now set about finding a man to take her away from the stuffiness of Dutch society .
When , through a Lonely Hearts ad , she met Captain Rudof MacLeod , a hard - living , hard - drinking officer home on leave from Holland 's vicious colonial wars in the East Indies , she did n't care that he was 22 years older than her .
He was handsome , with a splendid moustache .
She was tall ( 5ft 10 in ) and elegant , with flirty dark eyes and a dark olive complexion .
The attraction was immediate , sexual and very strong .
She told him she longed to do " crazy things " and they were engaged within six days .
They married three months later , she in a bright yellow gown rather than the traditional white .
There were problems almost straight away .
She could n't keep her eyes off the other officers and , as she was the first to admit , did not have it within her to be " a good housewife " .
" I was not content at home , " she later confessed .
" I wanted to live like a colourful butterfly in the sun . "
He was jealous , though saw no reason why he should forego the womanising , drinking and coarseness of his bachelor days .
He was constantly in debt ; she was extravagant , always spending .
As for his syphilis , caught overseas , he neglected to tell her .
The omens were not good .
Nonetheless , she bore him two children , and they returned as a family to his new posting in the colonies .
There , in the exotic surroundings of Indonesia , their marital problems multiplied .
She did not fit the mould of the officer 's wife , not least because her dark skin made the snobbier women suggest she had native blood in her .
To the men , however , that look was seductive , and she made the most of it .
" Her languid , graceful style of moving , her dark eyes and luxurious hair , telegraphed her sexuality to any male in her presence , " writes Shipman .
" She drew every man 's lustful admiration and every woman 's envy .
She was seen as morally dangerous , selfish and frivolous . "
The marriage deteriorated into sharp quarrels , too much drinking , rows about money and accusations of infidelity .
But what destroyed the union was tragedy .
Their son , Norman , was struck by serious illness and died at the age of two .
His sister , one - year - old Nonnie , nearly died , too , but pulled through .
The boy 's death shattered both parents .
Who was to blame ?
A local nanny was said to have poisoned the children because of some grievance , real or imagined , against MacLeod , though no case was ever brought .
Nor was the death ever reported in the colonial press .
For some reason , it seemed to have been hushed up .
Shipman 's hypothesis is that the children were being treated for congenital syphilis , caught from their father , and the garrison doctor accidentally overdosed them with mercury .
Whatever the real cause of the boy 's death , the couple blamed each other .
The relationship sank into hatred .
His wife was " scum of the lowest kind " MacLeod told his family back in Holland , " a woman without heart , who cares nothing for anything " .
On that he was wrong - she cared for officers .
He caught her with a second lieutenant .
She flaunted herself in a low - cut dress at a ball .
She was punishing him by stoking up his jealousy .
He punished her in return with a cat - o' - nine - tails .
She wrote to her father : " I can not live with a man who is so despicable .
I eat and live apart and I prefer to die before he touches me again .
My children caught a disease from him . "
MacLeod left the army and the family returned to Holland .
There they separated .
But MacLeod had one more weapon to use against her .
He put an advertisement in the local papers warning shops not to give her credit because he had resigned all responsibility for her .
It left her penniless .
She had to earn money - and there was only one way she knew how .
Sexual favours were her only useful assets , but she did not see Holland as the best place to exploit them .
In 1903 , with little money and no contacts , she took herself off to Paris .
There , she would recreate herself as a model , an actress , perhaps , or a chic cosmopolitan in that chicest of cities .
But , as Shipman tells us , " the only dependable source of income available to her was pleasing men for money " - prostitution .
But then a circus gave her a job , and the owner advised her where her talents lay - dancing .
And dance she did .
From the depths of her experiences in the East Indies she invented what she called " sacred dances " .
They were exotic and seemed to have some mysterious eastern mythology about them but , most of all , they involved her ending up all but naked .
It was a brilliant move .
Dancers at the Moulin Rouge were flashing their knickers and breasts but Zelle 's great departure was to push the bounds of discretion even further and wrap sex up with religion and art .
She began by performing in private homes , but soon the stories of her " artistry " and , above all , her nudity were passing round the salons of Parisian high society .
She wore a beaded metallic bra , which never came off - she was self - conscious about her tiny breasts - but the veils covering the rest of her floated free as she danced in " slow , undulating , tigerlike movements " .
The critics enthused , " feline , trembling in a thousand rhythms , exotic yet deeply austere , slender and supple like a sacred serpent " .
She added spice to the performance with lies .
First there was her name - Mata Hari , meaning " sunrise " or , more literally , " the eye of the day " , in the language of the Dutch East Indies .
Then there were the stories to the press , that she was the daughter of an Indian temple dancer who had died giving birth to her , that she grew up in a jungle in Java .
Her life became an unending performance , both on stage and off .
Her success seemed unstoppable and the money came rolling in .
But she still managed to spend more than she earned as she travelled Europe , picking up lovers , dropping some , keeping others .
" Tonight I dine with Count A and tomorrow with Duke B .
If I do n't have to dance , I make a trip with Marquis C. I avoid serious liaisons .
I satisfy all my caprices , " she said .
All too soon she was suffering from over - exposure in another sense .
By 1908 anyone who was anyone in Europe had seen her dance at least once , while the lesser theatres were overrun with imitators doing Oriental dances .
The dance work was now more irregular and increasingly she would have to rely on her men friends for her livelihood .
One , a stockbroker , provided her with a chateau in the Loire and another house on the Seine - until he went bankrupt .
Still she refused to cut her prodigious spending or alter her outrageous lifestyle .
When she was frantic for money , some said , she would ply her trade at Paris 's maisons de rendez - vous , one step up from ordinary brothels .
Her financial problems seemed eased when in May 1914 she signed a contract to dance for six months at the Metropol in Berlin , starting in September .
But the political situation overtook her .
When war broke out in August that year , though Holland was neutral , she was stuck in a now belligerent and increasingly jingoistic German capital with no money and no job .
Her fur coats and money had been seized .
She charmed a Dutch businessman to pay her train fare to Amsterdam .
Back in Holland , she took up again with a former lover .
Aristocratic and wealthy , he was just her type .
There she was visited by Karl Kroemer , the German consul , who told her he was recruiting spies .
He gave her 20,000 francs and a code name , H21 .
She took his money but she did n't take him seriously .
She told herself the cash was compensation for the furs taken from her in Berlin and threw away the invisible ink he gave her .
" As she never had the slightest intention of spying for Germany , she felt no guilt or obligation to do anything for the money she had accepted .
She had always taken money from men because she needed it and they had it ; she always felt she deserved it , " says Shipman .
Others , ominously , would not agree .
Naively , she failed to realise the Europe she had travelled through so freely and so promiscuously had disappeared for ever .
British counter - intelligence certainly had her number .
They stopped her at Folkestone , while she was travelling from Holland to France via Britain to avoid the front - line , and recorded that " although she was thoroughly searched and nothing incriminating was found , she is regarded by police and military to be not above suspicion " .
A copy of the report was sent to intelligence officials in France , Britain 's ally against Germany .
But on what was this suspicion based ?
The report noted that she " speaks French , English , Italian , Dutch and probably German .
Handsome , bold type of woman " .
And that , says Shipman was the key .
" The problem was not what Mata Hari said but who she was .
She was a woman travelling alone , obviously wealthy and an excellent linguist - too educated , too foreign .
Worse yet , she admitted to having a lover .
Women like that were immoral and not to be trusted . "
A British intelligence officer in Holland now added to Mata Hari 's dossier with rumours about payments to her from the German embassy .
He added , with no evidence whatsoever : " One suspects her of having gone to France on an important mission that will profit the Germans . "
In Paris , Mata resumed her glamorous life , living at the Grand Hotel and with plenty of men in uniform to keep her occupied .
She did not know that two secret policemen were tailing her .
They steamed open her letters , questioned porters , waitresses and hairdressers and collected abundant evidence of her love life - but not of espionage .
She spent a day and a night with the Marquis de Beaufort , had a flirtatious dinner with a purveyor of fine liquors and then met another lover , who embarrassingly for the secret policemen was a senior colleague from their own bureau .
But her main intention at this time was to get a permit to go to the town of Vittel , which was in the eastern war zone , because she was desperate to see the man with whom she had fallen deeply in love , a Russian captain 18 years her junior named Vadime .
For that , she had to apply to the head of French Intelligence , Captain Georges Ladoux , an ambitious man who had staked his reputation on France being riddled with foreign spies and his being able to destroy their network .
He was in need of an attention - grabbing case to prove the worth of his bureau .
He regarded Mata as little better than a prostitute ; she thought him small - minded and coarse .
They fenced words with each other .
She wanted her pass to Vittel .
He agreed , if she promised to enlist as a spy for France .
The entire encounter was bizarre , Shipman argues .
If Mata Hari was already a German spy , as Ladoux believed , then he was foolhardy to try to recruit her to be a French one .
Mata Hari was known by sight throughout Europe .
Her comings and goings were reported in gossip columns .
Wherever she went , she was the centre of attention .
It is difficult to imagine a woman less able to engage in clandestine activities .
But she accepted his offer - as long as she was given enough money to pay off her massive debts and settle down with Vadime .
The great seductress wanted out of the game .
But it was too late .
Ladoux was convinced she was a German spy , however ridiculous that was .
So , too , were the British .
For Mata Hari , everything in her tangled life was unravelling dangerously .
She went to Vittel and had a blissful interlude in the spa town with her Russian .
On her return to Paris , Ladoux sent her on her first mission - to German - occupied Belgium where she said an ex-lover could steer her into the arms of the German military governor .
But Belgium proved impossible to reach and she ended up in Spain .
There , she turned her charms on a German captain , an intelligence officer named Kalle , and stretched out on a chaise longue as he told her secrets about German manoeuvres in North Africa .
This information she triumphantly passed on to Ladoux , believing she was doing his bidding , earning the million francs he had promised her .
Instead , she had fallen into his trap .
Her meetings with Kalle would be turned against her , twisted to claim that she was handing over French secrets to the enemy rather than teasing out German ones .
On February 10 , 1917 , a warrant for her arrest was signed by the French war minister .
Three days later , police officers knocked on the door of her hotel room and found her eating breakfast in a lace - trimmed dressing gown .
She was not , as wild rumours around Paris soon claimed , naked .
At the Palais de Justice she faced the investigating magistrate , Pierre Bouchardon .
" From the very first interview , I had the intuition that she was a person in the pay of our enemies , " he wrote later .
" I had but one thought - to unmask her . "
The process was under way that would lead her unfairly but inexorably to her execution .
It did not seem to matter that no one had the least bit of evidence against her .
Nor could anyone point to a single document , plan or secret that she passed to the Germans .
Suspicion , envy and the prejudices of small - minded men would triumph .
Only 30 years after her death would one of her prosecutors concede the truth - " there was n't enough evidence to flog a cat " .

If you work in the corporate world and are attending a meeting you might have easily prepared for it by watching paint dry or grass grow .
However there are many meetings in recent history that I would have loved to attend or at least be a fly on the wall starting with this list of ten .
10 Charles Rolls & Frederick Royce
When Fredrick Henry Royce purchased his first two - cylinder car ( a French Decauville ) he was very dissatisfied with its performance .
He decided to build a car of his own by “ taking an existing part and making it better and eventually started successfully building his own two - cylinder , 10 - horsepower cars that were known for their silent and vibration - free ride .
The automobiles soon caught the attention Charles Stewart Rolls who at the time operated a London dealership for French Panhard automobiles .
Eventually a meeting was arranged between Rolls and Royce at the Midland Hotel in Manchester England on May of 1904 .
During the meeting Rolls was impressed by Royce ’s determination and creativity and discussed the possibility of combining their own expertise and dedication with the latest technologies .
The two men later agreed to establish an automobile partnership .
Interesting Fact :
In 1907 under the supervision of Charles Rolls , the company began to manufacture small aircraft engines .
Tragically three years later Rolls was killed when his Wright biplane crashed .
He was the first Briton to be killed in an aeronautical accident , and the eleventh internationally .
As a symbol of mourning the “ RR ” logo on the radiator plate was changed from red to black .
9 Dexter King & James Earl Ray
This awkward meeting took place in 1997 in a Tennessee state prison hospital between Dexter King , son of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and James Earl Ray ( the convicted assassin of his father )
It was the first between the two men and also marked the first time the King family had publicly backed Ray ’s claim of innocence .
Dexter King asked James Earl Ray , “ Did you kill my father ? ”
Ray answered : “ No , I did n’t . ” Dexter King responded , “ I believe you , and my family believes you . ”
Ray was taken to the meeting room in a wheelchair , and at times he mumbled and rambled .
Dexter King who was 36 at the time sat just three feet away and listened patiently to Ray who at the time was dying of liver disease .
Interesting Fact : Ray told his wife , who thought he was innocent , that he had killed King and threatened to kill her .
In discussing the events surrounding King ’s death , Ray admitted his guilt with the statement : “ Yeah , I killed him .
But what if I did ; I never got a trial . ”
Ray died in prison a year later in 1998 at the age of 70 .
8 Edgar Allan Poe & Charles Dickens
These two great writers met in March of 1842 when Charles Dickens visited Philadelphia to lecture and also talk about the importance of international copyright laws .
Poe sent him a letter requesting a meeting along with a two - volume collection of his short stories .
Dickens responded to his letter and wrote “ My Dear Sir , I shall be very glad to see you whenever you will do me the favor to call .
I think I am more likely to be in the way between half past eleven and twelve than any other time . ”
Dickens was just 30 years old and had already published Pickwick Papers , Nicholas Nickleby , and The Old Curiosity Shop .
The relatively little - known Edgar Allan Poe was 32 and had published Tamerlane and Other Poems .
The two met twice in Dickens ’s hotel room .
The meetings were impersonal as they discussed contemporary English and American writers .
Poe then came to the point and asked Dickens if he could help publish his Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque in England .
Dickens promised to try .
Nine months later Dickens wrote
Poe admitting failure to get his work published .
Interesting Fact :
Six years earlier
Poe had married his 13 - year old first cousin Virginia Clemm and was living with her and her mother ( Poe ’s Aunt / mother in - law ) Maria Clemm .
Virginia Clemm died of tuberculosis when she was just 24 .
Because of his wife ’s death
Poe became despondent and turned to drink to cope .
When Dickens returned to America for his second tour , Poe was already dead .
Dickens learned that Maria Clemm was ill and living on charity .
Dickens visited her , pressed some money into her hand , and later from England contributed $ 1,000 for her keep .
7 Thomas Stafford & Alexei Leonov
On July 15th 1975 two men aboard the Soyuz ( from the Soviet space program ) and three men aboard the last Apollo mission ( from the US space program ) were launched within seven and a half hours of each other The Astronauts & Cosmonauts were to perform some experiments but the primary purpose of the mission was symbolic and was an attempt to ease the tensions between the two superpowers .
On July 17 , Stafford and Leonov met and exchanged the first international handshake in space through the open hatch of the Soyuz .
The spacecrafts remained linked for 44 hours , long enough for the men to pay visits to each other ’s ships , eat together and converse in each other ’s languages .
The Soviets remained in space for five days , the Americans for nine days .
Interesting Fact : The Americans and Soviets exchanged flags and gifts including tree seeds which were later planted in the two countries .
6 Pope John Paul II & Mehmet Ali A?ca
In 1981 Mehmet Ali A?ca from Turkey and a known member of the Turkish ultra-nationalist Grey Wolves organization shot and wounded Pope John Paul II .
After the assassination attempt the Pope asked people to “ pray for my brother ( A?ca ) whom I have sincerely forgiven . ”
In 1983 , the Pope and A?ca met and spoke privately at a prison in Rome Italy where he was being held .
A? ca eventually developed a friendship with the pontiff .
The Pope was also in touch with A?ca ’s family over the years , meeting his mother in 1987 and his brother a decade later .
Interesting Fact : When Pope John Paul II died in 2005 , A?ca ’s brother Adnan said that his entire family was grieving and that the Pope had been a great friend to them .
Also : A?ca wanted to visit the Pope ’s funeral however Turkish authorities rejected his request to leave prison to attend .
5 Richard Nixon & Elvis Presley
The fact that a famous entertainer would meet the President of the United States is not unusual .
What makes this story so fascinating is the events leading up to the meeting .
Without an invitation or any previous communication Presley flew to Washington D.C with a couple of his bodyguards to see the President .
During the flight Presley wrote Nixon a six - page handwritten letter on American Airlines stationary requesting to meet with him and suggested that he be made a “ Federal Agent - at - Large ” .
Presley arrived at the White House gate on the morning of December 21st 1970 and handed his letter to the guards then waited .
Nixon ’s aids advised the President to meet with the rock star and scheduled a meeting for that afternoon .
During their meeting in the Oval Office Presley said he wanted to be helpful , and restore some respect for the flag which he thought was being lost because of the drug culture and anti American radical groups .
At the conclusion of the meeting , Presley told the President how much he supported him , and then in a spontaneous gesture , put his left arm around the President and hugged him .
Interesting Fact :
Of all the requests made each year to the National Archives for reproductions of photographs and documents , the one item that is requested more than any ( even more than the Bill of Rights or the Constitution ) is the photograph of Elvis Presley and Richard M. Nixon shaking hands during this famous meeting .

4 Henry Stanley & David Livingstone
Henry Morton Stanley was a British journalist and was well known for his exploration of Africa .
The New York Herald hired him as a reporter to find the Scottish missionary and explorer David Livingstone , who was known to be in Africa but had not been heard from for 3 years .
In March of 1871 Stanley outfitted an expedition with the best of everything including 200 porters .
The 700 - mile expedition through the tropical forest was extremely difficult to say the least with many of his carriers deserting and some others dying from tropical diseases .
Stanley found Livingstone on November 10 , 1871 , in Ujiji near Lake Tanganyika in present - day Tanzania , and greeted him with the now famous , “ Dr. Livingstone , I presume ’ .
Interesting Fact :
Here are the exact words written by Stanley when he finally met up with Livingstone : “ As I advanced slowly toward him I noticed he was pale , looked wearied , had a gray beard , wore a bluish cap with a faded gold braid round it , had on a red - sleeved waistcoat , and a pair of gray tweed trousers .
I would have run to him , only I was a coward in the presence of such a mob – would have embraced him , only , he being an Englishman , I did not know how he would receive me .
So I did what cowardice and false pride suggested was the best thing – walked deliberately to him , took off my hat , and said : ‘ Dr. Livingstone , I presume ? ’
“ Yes ” , said he , with a kind smile , lifting his cap slightly .
3 Douglas MacArthur & Emperor Hirohito
The above picture was taken on September 27 , 1945 at the US Embassy in Tokyo just weeks after Japan formally surrendered .
According to Mc Arthur ’s he was expecting that Hirohito might deny any responsibility to war crimes that were committed by the Japanese but instead he said this : “ I come to you , General MacArthur , to offer myself to the judgment of the powers you represent as the one to bear sole responsibility for every political and military decision made and action taken by my people in the conduct of war . ”
There had been considerable outcry from some of the Allies , notably the Russians and the British , to punish Hirohito for war crimes but American authorities , including MacArthur , decided that it would be easier to stabilize and reform Japan if they let him remain as ruler but not a Shinto deity .
Interesting Fact : Hirohito later became a respected marine biologist and wrote a number of books on the subject .
After Hirohito died in 1989 because of his interest in science and in modernizing his country he was reported to have been buried with his microscope and a Mickey Mouse watch .
2 Ulysses Grant & General Robert E. Lee
In 1865 Robert E. Lee realized there was little choice but to surrender his Army to General Grant .
This would be the beginning of the end of the bloodiest conflict in United States history .
After communicating through notes , Grant and Lee agreed to meet at the Appomattox Court House in Virginia .
When Lee arrived General Grant began the conversation and talked about how they met before while serving in Mexico .
The meeting lasted approximately two and one - half hours .
Lee asked Grant to commit the terms to paper .
Grant then wrote up the terms ending with the sentence ‘ officers appointed by me to receive them .
After reviewing the terms Lee informed Grant that the Cavalry men and Artillery men in the Confederate Army owned their horses and asked that they keep them .
Grant agreed and Lee wrote a letter formally accepting the surrender .
General Lee shook hands with General Grant and bowed to the other officers and left the room .
Before Lee left , General Grant stepped outside and saluted Lee by raising his hat .
Lee then raised his hat respectfully and rode off to break the sad news to his men .
Interesting Fact :
When Lee mentioned to Grant that his men had been without rations for several days , Grant arranged for 25,000 rations to be sent to the hungry Confederates .
1 Niels Bohr & Werner Heisenberg
This fascinating meeting was between good friends who were also two of the greatest physicists of their time .
To this day this meeting has created great controversy and speculation as to what was really said and what was really behind the words that were exchanged that day .
The meeting has also inspired a play called Copenhagen .
Heisenberg was from Germany and met Niels Bohr in 1922 when he was his physics teacher .
Bohr was a well known physicist from Denmark and was half Jewish .
Heisenberg immediately made Bohr aware of his talents in class and a productive collaboration and friendship developed between the two men for many years .
In 1939 , shortly after the discovery of nuclear fission , the German nuclear energy project had begun .
Heisenberg became one of the principal scientists leading research and development in the project .
The relationship became strained partly because Bohr , with his partially - Jewish heritage , remained in occupied Denmark , while Heisenberg remained in Germany .
In 1941 , Heisenberg travelled to Copenhagen to meet Bohr .
During the now famous meeting it is speculated that Heisenberg revealed the atomic bomb program ’s existence to Bohr and the meeting along with their friendship ended abruptly .
Interesting Fact :
In February 2002 , a letter written by Bohr to Heisenberg in 1957 was discovered but was never sent to Heisenberg .
Bohr relates in the letter that Heisenberg , in their 1941 meeting did not express any moral problems with the bomb making project and that Heisenberg had spent the past two years working almost exclusively on it and that he was convinced that the atomic bomb would eventually decide the war .
It has also been speculated that Heisenberg had moral qualms and tried to slow down the project .
Heisenberg himself attempted to paint this picture after the war .

Long time no post .
Let 's change this !
JS - Robotics , I suppose that 's named after the founder Jin Sato build a very cool kit for kids and educational purpose .
It is a robot kit , some kind of mixture between a bristlebot and a microcontroller - robot .
The interesting thing about this robot is , that it can be programmed just without the use of a computer .
It features some of the most popular robot - functionality , that most robot beginners are trying to build like " detect object " , " follow a line " or " robot sumo " .
One the one hand that is fine .
On the other it 's a little weak preset - funk .
What 's the fun of robot - sume with exactly two of the same robots ?
But the sounds are awesome anyway !

Cody Johnston is the newest addition to the roster of Cracked columnists .
The first thing you need to come to terms with is that Cody is ... different .
Not the euphemistic " different " a father might use when consoling an ugly child .
More like the euphemistic " different " psychiatric professionals use to describe the patient whose roommates keep swallowing their tongues .
As such , his schedule will be different .
He 's going to post songs and other things we 've not seen in these parts and he 's going to post often .
Some of his stuff will be sane enough to share with the masses on the front page , and some you 'll have to come find for yourself .

So hold on to your butts and try not to swallow your tongues ( we recommend you use both hands for this ) because , if you 're lucky , it 's going to be a weird ride .
Object - Oriented Reengineering Patterns
About this book
Object - Oriented Reengineering Patterns collects and distills successful techniques in planning a reengineering project , reverse - engineering , problem detection , migration strategies and software redesign .
The original edition was published by Morgan Kaufmann in 2003 , and is now out - of - print .
The copyright has reverted to the authors , and we are now making this volume available under the Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike 3.0 license .
You can download the book as a free PDF , or you can order it from Amazon or Lulu .
Contents
The documentation is missing or obsolete , and the original developers have departed .
Your team has limited understanding of the system , and unit tests are missing for many , if not all , of the components .
When you fix a bug in one place , another bug pops up somewhere else in the system .
Long rebuild times make any change difficult .
All of these are signs of software that is close to the breaking point .
Many systems can be upgraded or simply thrown away if they no longer serve their purpose .
Legacy software , however , is crucial for operations and needs to be continually available and upgraded .
How can you reduce the complexity of a legacy system sufficiently so that it can continue to be used and adapted at acceptable cost ?
Based on the authors ' industrial experiences , this book is a guide on how to reverse engineer legacy systems to understand their problems , and then reengineer those systems to meet new demands .
Patterns are used to clarify and explain the process of understanding large code bases , hence transforming them to meet new requirements .
The key insight is that the right design and organization of your system is not something that can be evident from the initial requirements alone , but rather as a consequence of understanding how these requirements evolve .
This book speaks with experience .
It gives you the building blocks for a plan to tackle a difficult code base and the context for techniques like refactoring .
It is a sad fact that there are too few of these kinds of books out there , when reengineering is such a common event .
But I 'm at least glad to see that while there are n't many books in this vein , this book is an example of how good they are .

Americans hate taxes .
It ’s not a right or left issue .
It ’s not a Democratic or Republican issue .
It ’s not an old or young issue .
It ’s strangely not even a rich or poor issue .
It ’s an American issue .
It ’s our biggest peeve .
We all agree on some level :
Our country is great but we feel very cranky about forking over our money to the government .
This is an odd character trait in Americans .
For example we happily pay for cable even though television is free ” ” we clearly have no problem signing up for more bills .
The average American credit card debt is around $ 10,000 and the average APR is 14 % .
We clearly have no problem doling out loads of cash with nothing to show for it .
We do n’t even pay out that much of our income to the government when compared to other industrialized nations .
For an average family with children we pay about 20 % of our income to taxes .
For singles it ’s 37 % .
Belgians pay close to 55 %
But Americans hate taxes and we always have .
We hate the idea of them .
We want to believe freedom and taxes absolutely contradict each other .
Like improv and comedy .
While other colonies of Great Britain simply asked for their independence ( i.e. Canada and Australia ) , Americans were so outraged about the King raising taxes we started a bloody and costly revolutionary war lasting nearly a decade .
Yes , it all started with a tax hike .
“ No more taxes ! ” is the original battle cry for Americans .
Our country ’s birth , in a way , was a giant scheme to get out of giving up a fraction of our salaries to bureaucrats .
We just despise taxes .
Taxes are so loathed by Americans , politicians have to come up with new phrases in order to talk about them .
That ’s why “ fees ” , “ tariffs ” and “ tolls ” are used to “ balance deficits . ”
Instead of just saying taxes are needed to fund the government .
It ’s an attempt to make it palatable to American sensibilities .
This prettier word tactic is combated by calling anything you disagree with the ominous “ hidden tax . ”
A hidden tax is something lurking in the bushes that can jump out and kill you .
Very scary .
Notorious tax - phobe Grover Norquist requests conservative candidates sign his heavy - handed pledge to not raise taxes .
He wants them to be like 1981 ’s tax - cutter President Ronald Reagan .
Sure Reagan raised taxes for the next six years in a row ( including the biggest tax increase in American history ) but for the people who want like him and celebrate him , like Norquist , it ’s never ever referred to .
For politicians raising taxes is a taboo . Â
It ’s an unmentionable .
So when Los Angeles City Councilwoman Janice Hahn proposed taxing medical marijuana clinics in the city , you ’d think there would be fury .
You ’d think there would be an uproar .
You ’d think there would be fist shaking and protests .
“ No more taxes ! ” Â
You ’d expect people to show up to City Council meetings dressed up like Paul Revere with picket signs of Hahn looking like Hitler or Chairman Mao .
You ’d expect bags of Lipton to be mailed to her .
You ’d expect someone to be upset – after all this is America !
But no one was upset .
Not the ones who would pay the tax .
Not at all , according to Hahn .
“ I ’ve heard support across the board for taxing medical marijuana , ” she tells Kush LA .
The proposed medical marijuana tax is almost like a sin tax .
A sin tax is what the government puts on things like gambling , booze or tobacco .
It ’s supposed to somehow discourage people from doing it because taxes are just that revolting to people .
A sin tax is punitive .
It ’s monetary punishment for being a sinner .
It ’s quite literally “ hell to pay . ”
But a sin tax on medicine ?
( Could someone possibly use medical marijuana recreationally ?
Yes , it ’s possible .
Not like Viagra has ever been used recreationally ” )
A sin tax on medicine and no one is angry ?
No one ?
Really ?!
Could pot smokers be the only group in the history of the world to ever want to be taxed ?
To ever hope to be taxed ?
To ever specifically ask the government to tax them more ?
“ I ca n’t remember the last time an interest group volunteered to be taxed , ” admitted Hahn .
This might be a first .
This is historic .
A group of Americans are lobbying the government so they can give more money to the government in the form of a tax .
There are volumes of political theory that have just been challenged .
We ’re witnessing history here .
Someone notify the media .

It ’s been a while since we ’ve heard much news about the Samsung Galaxy GT - I7500 , so it ’s a pleasure to see these live photos of the white version of the handset .
Rumored for some time , but until now unsighted in the wild , the images landed in the grateful hands of Arne over at the : : unwired .
According to his tipster , the white Galaxy you see here will be identical , feature - wise , to its black counterpart .
That means Android OS 1.5 Cupcake , quadband GSM , triband UMTS / HSPA , WiFi b/g , Bluetooth and GPS , together with a 3.2 - inch HVGA AMOLED touchscreen and 5 - megapixel camera .
The Galaxy ’s 3.5 mm headphone socket is n’t such a big deal now that the Hero has arrived with the same thing , but it ’s still something we ’re glad to see .
Worth noting is that , no matter how much we might like it to be , this is n’t a leak of the Samsung GT - I5700 Galaxy Lite , just a white version of the original Android smartphone .
Nothing definite regarding launch , but it ’s tipped to hit O2 Germany first before spreading to other European carriers .
Building on the successful launch of Fusion ( tm ) 6.0 this summer and the upcoming release of Generation ( r ) 2.0 , eyeon Software Inc. has introduced a new a la carte pricing structure for software purchases .
The new pricing model will allow artists and facilities to select from a range of purchasing options , with a variety of upfront costs and annual subscription fees .
A la carte pricing is available for both Fusion and Generation , with a new Superscription option for Fusion that includes both Imagica ’s keyer , Primatte (r ) and Re: Vision Effect ’s optical - flow based retiming solution , Twixtor .
With the imminent release of Generation 2.0 , the new site - pricing offer is already being well - received .
“ Did the new pricing help us ?
Well , it allowed us to buy right now , and not have to wait until the next instalment on our project came in , ” said Chad Capeland , Director of R&D at Anatomical Travelogue in New York City .
“ In the case of Generation , that was really important , because we ’re building our whole pipeline around it and we need to be able to do R&D on it .
The new pricing allowed us to buy two copies , so we can have two people doing pipeline development , one doing I/O testing and the other doing scripting . ”
Anatomical Travelogue is currently working on an immersive 3D venue project , including scented air jets and speakers built into the seat .
“ Generation 2 will give us the ability to review our sequences in stereo so we can make sure the edit continuity is preserved and no one gets motion sickness .
We ’ll also be able to do all of our conforms in - house now , which will be a big timesaver for us . ”
For facilities tackling complex new projects , or simply trying to take their studio to the next level , the new pricing structure allows them to get on board with the latest software much more easily .
“ It ’s a big weight off my shoulders , ” said Capeland , “ and we did n’t have to pitch a big purchase to management . ”
“ The new pricing is a big help for us , because it spreads the cost of ownership out much more manageably , ” said Di He , owner of AIVFX .
The Toronto facility specializes in 3D character animations and documentary production .
Most recently AIVFX used Fusion and Generation on a Chinese short film , which has been submitted to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science for consideration for this year ’s Oscars .
“ Fusion and Generation were a great help on this project .
We love them ! ”
eyeon ’s new flexible pricing model follows on the success of the 2009 Own Your Art at $ 995 Down program .
“ It is clear that people need better payment alternatives than have been typically available , and eyeon now delivers a number of options that are necessary in today ’s market , ” explains Joanne Dicaire , Director of Sales and Marketing at eyeon .
“ With all of the new stereo projects , and with increasingly complex VFX work expected in tighter deadlines , facilities need as many tools as possible as quickly as possible . ”
Pricing and Availability
Altogether , eyeon is offering three new pricing packages .
Fusion 6.0 : Existing Multi-Seat Discounts
$ 2,995 to $ 4,995 ( depending on the number of licenses purchased ) with $ 395 annual subscription fee .
Fusion 6.0 : New Subscription Plus
$ 1,495 per license with $ 995 annual subscription fee .
Fusion 6.0 : New Superscription

Probably the most scenic railway journey in Britain , the Settle to Carlisle Railway runs for 73 miles between the tiny market town of Settle and the Cumbrian city of Carlisle .
Built my over 6000 navvies , the line is a marvel of Victorian engineering and determination .
Anyone who has been to the remote stops along the way will vouch for the extreme weather that must have made such a project particularly arduous .
The first two shots show the Ribblehead Viaduct which was completed in 1875 .
This beautiful piece of architecture is located around 8 miles outside of Settle .
It is said that hundreds of navvies died during its construction .
Settle Station is utterly charming .
In fact , raising interest rates at the moment , a mistake made during the Great Depression , is contra-indicated .
And that will still be so as long as unemployment runs high .
Additional stimulus would not lead to near - term inflation , he argues .
You can see Krugman 's more wonkish version of exactly when interest rates should be raised to stave off inflation here .
DeLong convincingly explains in detail why adding fiscal stimulus now will have a favorable multiplier effect that boosts the economy by generating jobs as well as increasing tax revenue without increasing inflation and a need for raising interest rates .
How much should the stimulus be ?
Last December , Lawrence Summers and the rest of Obama 's incoming National Economic Council feared that increasing the size of the stimulus program from $ 800 billion to $ 1.2 trillion would bring the above [ inflationary ] factors into play .
It is now reasonably clear that they were overly pessimistic about the effects of additional short - term government spending , in large part because they were overly optimistic about the state of the economy .
So how much should the government spend ?
I would favor starting with $ 100 billion next month , and continuing with an additional $ 100 billion every month thereafter .
Meantime , we should keep an eye on the bond market and inflation forecasts .
As long as the terms on which the U.S. government can borrow are exceptionally advantageous , and the unemployment rate remains exceptionally high , the benefits of government spending will continue to be exceptionally large .
Anyone who still thinks additional well - targeted stimulus is not required need not go far to find reasons to change his or her mind , as AnswerLady makes clear .
There is also Economic Policy Institute President Lawrence Mishel 's testimony to the House Ways and Means Subcommittttee on Income Security and Family Support last Thursday .
The situation , he said , is grim .
The numbers have become familiar , each new set breaking records not seen for decades , often since the Great Depression .
There are 15.1 million officially unemployed , 26.6 million if you count the discouraged and the underemployed .
Some 5.4 million have been out of work for more than six months ; 2 million for more than a year .
Six million are receiving unemployment compensation , but only 40 % of those out of work are covered by these benefits in the first place .
Some 44 % of households have seen layoffs or cuts in pay or hours .
Record numbers of Americans are on Food Stamps .
New foreclosures loom .
Bankruptcies , even though they are harder to come by these days , are soaring .
The tepid recovery that even many optimists think we will see develop over the next year means those unemployment and associated numbers are likely to stay high through 2011 , perhaps over 8 % .
Mischel argues for a second , or improved , stimulus :
Additional aid should be provided to the hamstrung state governments , dozens of which are facing new deficits on the heels of last year's .
Direct creation of public service jobs should be initiated .
In 1978 , Congress funded jobs for 750,000 people .
A larger program is needed now .
" Any unemployed worker should be eligible ; the jobs should pay prevailing wages ; and great care should be taken to prevent displacement of public employees .
Such a program can be targeted at distressed communities and will be needed for many years to come as unemployment remains high . "
A job tax credit should be enacted that would refund 10 % - 15 % of wages paid for each new hire over the next two years .
More should be spent on infrastructure .
" The $ 13 billion of Recovery Act highway and transit funds under contract have created 122,000 job months already , a number that is doubling each month .
The nation ’s schools could quickly and effectively spend $ 10 billion on repairs and maintenance alone , putting to work some of the million
and a half construction workers who remain jobless . "
These unemployment and associated statistics are only part of the economy 's malaise , however .
And an additional stimulus will not deal with structural problems .
Chief among these are interconnected income inequality , outsourcing / off - shoring and and the productivity disconnect .
Since 1973 , productivity has soared , but workers have received only a tiny fraction of the increased earnings .
In fact , during the weak " recovery " of 2002 - 2007 , they got none of it .
The top one - tenth of 1 % of U.S. households ( 13,000 of them ) took nearly a third of all income growth since 1989 .
The bottom 90 % got 16 % .
No stimulus - old or new - will resolve that inequality and the destruction that it creates .
That will take a new attitude from our leaders , which will require a big push from the bottom up .
Relatively few women reach the top ranks of financial firms
Men working in the UK 's financial sector receive five times more in bonus payments than women , according to a survey of 44 leading companies .
On average , women earn £ 2,875 compared with £ 14,554 for men , the Equality and Human Rights Commission found .
Chairman Trevor Phillips said the sector must take action " to address this shocking disparity of rewards " .
Equality Minister Harriet Harman said the government was introducing " tough new measures " to tackle the pay gap .
BBC business reporter Brian Milligan said the survey , commissioned by Ms Harman , was believed to provide the most accurate picture yet of pay differences within banks and insurance companies .
Divide ' entrenched '
One of the main reasons for the vast difference in bonuses is that relatively few women reach the top ranks of financial firms where the biggest rewards are paid .
Equality is vital , not only for individuals , but for the economy and society as a whole
Equality Minister Harriet Harman
MPs to investigate sexism in City
It comes on top of an average difference of 39 % between men and women 's basic salaries .
The EHRC said the gender divide was " entrenched " by recruitment patterns , with women starting at companies on lower salaries and then being left behind throughout their career .
The commission also said that just one in four of the firms surveyed was undertaking a pay audit to try to investigate whether they had a pay gap .
Mr Phillips encouraged more firms to follow the lead of the " enlightened few " .
" For business to thrive in the new economy it simply can't afford to recruit and reward in the way it has done in the past , " he said .
" By bringing down arbitrary barriers , and changing practices that , intentionally or not , inhibit women 's success , financial firms have the chance to boost morale , bring on new talent , and maximise the potential of their existing employees . "
As well as pay audits , the EHRC said companies should appoint a board member specifically to drive change on the issue .
Secrecy clauses Ms Harman , who is also minister for women , said : " We cannot tackle discrimination if it is hidden which is why I asked the commission to produce this report .
Women applying for the top jobs need more flexibility with hours and childcare responsibilities
John Cridland , CBI " Equality is vital , not only for individuals , but for the economy and society as a whole .
" Despite many actions taken by the government since 1997 , inequality and discrimination still exist , which is why we are introducing tough new measures in our Equality Bill including gender pay reporting and proposals to ban secrecy clauses which are particularly prevalent in financial services . "
John Cridland , deputy director general of business group the CBI , said parts of the financial services sector still had " some further distance to go " in terms of equality .
" But , as in many other areas of business , women applying for the top jobs need more flexibility with hours and childcare responsibilities , " he added .
The role of women in the City will be the subject of a new inquiry launched by the Treasury Committee this autumn .
The 44 firms questioned in the survey employ almost 300,000 workers - about a fifth of the sector 's workforce .

Chocolates as a Gift Idea for Rakhi
" Nine out of ten people like chocolate .
The tenth person always lies . " - John Q. Tullius
That ’s how irresistible the universal appeal of chocolate is !
People irrespective of age fall in love with chocolates at a very tender age and that love affair continues for the rest of their lives .
Chocolate on Rakhi is so popular not just for its unforgettable taste but the magic that is associated with it .
In fact the sweetness of chocolates multiplies when you share it with others .
Chocolate is arguably the symbol of love and among an overwhelming majority of people it is considered as the numero uno gift item for any season , for any occasion .
Sending chocolates is possibly the best way to express your love for anyone from child to adult .
Rakhi is one such occasion which offers the opportunity to celebrate love with manifold gifts and assortments .
It is an auspicious occasion when a sister and a brother celebrate their unconditional love for each other .
A sister may not always be physically present to tie the sacred thread on her brother ’s wrist but she can send Rakhi to India with the most wonderful rakhi gifts .
But no gift is complete without chocolates , no matter in whatever shape or form .
A beautifully designed chocolate gift basket containing chocolates of many varieties such as , dark chocolates , white chocolates , chocolates with nuts , fruits , and almonds , and those with different flavours such as raspberry or caramel makes it an exceptionable rakhi hamper This Raksha Bandhan you may not be with your beloved brother or sister but through our website giftstoind ia24x7.com you can send rakhi to India along with the perfect chocolate hamper of your choice .
The sweet taste of chocolate will not only offer a mouth watering sensation to your dear brother or sister but also bring back the golden memories of the yester years .
The most alluring chocolates hampers to look for :
This year you have the most delectable chocolate hampers on offer to send on raksha Bandhan in India .
The options galore , it may vary from a heart shaped hamper embellished with copious numbers of colourful heart shaped chocolates with crispy kajus to a hand made chocolate thali with the most sumptuous of chocolate collections from the house of celebrated chocolate manufacturers such as Nestle , Cadburys and the world famous Swiss chocolate makers Kraft Foods .

It not only indulges one in sweet ecstasy but also works as a catalyst to retain the mutual longing and attachment that exists between any human relationship .
The second hack in the book Perl Hacks ( no link ; if you download it and send me $ 2 and Ovid $ 0.50 via PayPal or wherever , we get a lot more money than we would if you bought a printed copy from the publisher , grumble grumble ) talks about perldoc for a good reason .
If you do n't take advantage of Perl 5's copious documentation , you 'll struggle learning Perl 5 , far more than necessary .
( The first hack in the book is to look up distributions and documentation on the CPAN .
As mst says , CPAN is my language . )
Note that well - behaved CPAN distributions also include copious documentation which integrates with perldoc .
I miss this in other languages .
The examples here assume you use perldoc from the command line .
If that 's not the case -- if you have them installed on your system in HTML form or if you prefer to browse them on perldoc .
perl.org , the suggestions will still work with modifications .
Start by running perldoc perltoc .
You do n't have to know or understand all of this , but it gives you an overview of all of the documentation included as part of a complete Perl 5 installation .
If you 've never read any of the documentation before -- if you 're a novice to Perl 5 in general , perhaps -- then perldoc perlintro is a quick survey of what you can do with Perl .
It does presume some familiarity with programming , but if you 're reading this I presume the same .
Other documentation worth skimming includes perldoc perlstyle and perldoc perlglossary .
The former will help you as a neophyte understand what makes decent Perl and the latter explains several of the terms of art in the Perl community .
You should also read perldoc perldoc , as it includes gems many Perl gurus do n't know .
Operator and Builtin Documentation
The most useful perldoc flag is -f .
After eleven years with the language , syntax rarely fools me , but I still can't remember all of the return values of caller or localtime in the right order , and I can't always remember all of the arguments to splice and substr .
perldoc -f name looks through perldoc perlfunc and displays the documentation of the builtin named name .
I use this regularly :
$ perldoc -f splice splice ARRAY , OFFSET , LENGTH , LIST splice ARRAY , OFFSET , LENGTH splice ARRAY , OFFSET splice ARRAY Removes the elements designated by OFFSET and LENGTH from an array , and replaces them with the elements of LIST , if any .
In list context , returns the elements removed from the array .
In scalar context , returns the last element removed , or " undef " if no elements are removed .
The array grows or shrinks as necessary .
If OFFSET is negative then it starts that far from the end of the array .
If LENGTH is omitted , removes everything from OFFSET onward .
If LENGTH is negative , removes the elements from OFFSET onward except for - LENGTH elements at the end of the array .
If both OFFSET and LENGTH are omitted , removes everything .
If OFFSET is past the end of the array , perl issues a warning , and splices at the end of the array .
This is handy if you remember the name of the builtin , but not its exact syntax or semantics .
When I can't remember what I want , I read a couple of pages into perldoc perlfunc , which categorizes builtins by their uses .
Occasionally the difference between a Perl 5 operator and builtin is significant , so you have to trawl through perldoc perlop for more details .
That 's rarely an issue for me , but that may be how I program .
Be aware of the distinction and be willing to check the other document , if necessary .
Perl FAQs
Perl 5 also includes a copious FAQ which contains a wealth of information for novices .
perldoc perlfaq is a great place to start , but when I need to look something up in the FAQ , I use the -q option to perldoc :
$ perldoc -q number Found in /usr / share / perl/5.10/pod/perlfaq4.pod
Why am I getting long decimals ( eg , 19.9499999999999 ) instead of the numbers I should be getting ( eg , 19.95 ) ?
Internally , your computer represents floating - point numbers in binary .
Digital ( as in powers of two ) computers cannot store all numbers exactly .
Some real numbers lose precision in the process .
This is a problem with how computers store numbers and affects all computer languages , not just Perl. perlnumber shows the gory details of number representations and conversions .
To limit the number of decimal places in your numbers , you can use the printf or sprintf function .
See the " Floating Point Arithmetic " for more details .
printf " %.2f " , 10/3 ; my $ number = sprintf " %.2f " , 10/3 ;
This relies on a keyword search , so you have to get a keyword in the title of a question right , but if you browse the titles of the FAQ , you 'll get some idea of the questions in the FAQ and the answers you can expect .
" Mrs Sheersmith would have only paid a few dollars for it and she probably would have thought nothing of the dishevelled young painter who sold it to her .
I am nervous and it is hard to put my thoughts together .
Sometimes you do n’t know what to say .
Man , there is a lot of people there .
I have come here today to die , not make speeches .
Where ’s Mr. Marino ’s mother ?
Did you get my letter ?
I want to ask if it is in your heart to forgive me .
You do n’t have to .
I wish I could die more than once to tell you how sorry I am .
Could you please tell that lady right there  can I see her ?
She is not looking at me  I want you to understand something , hold no animosity toward me .
I want you to understand .
Please forgive me .
I do n’t think the world will be a better or safer place without me .
I am sorry .
I want to tell my mom that I love her .
Walt Mossberg yesterday revealed Microsoft ’s official chart that explains how you can upgrade your version of Windows .
And I use the word ‘ explains ’ in its loosest possible sense , since Microsoft ’s chart looks like this :
Clearly , this is a great example of how extra choice does n’t always benefit the consumer .
And for what it ’s worth , all those blue boxes are boxes of doom — â€˜in - place upgrades ’ ( green ) means the install will keep your files , settings and programs intact , but the more common custom install ( blue ) refers to a clean install , which will force a user to move their files , install the OS , replace their files and reinstall their apps .
( And then , presumably , curl up into a ball in the corner of the room and weep uncontrollably . )
I thought it ’d be useful to create a Mac equivalent for Snow Leopard .
If you ’ve got an Intel Mac , the upgrade path regarding installation is certainly a lot simpler :

WWF Sweden is urging its government – holding the current EU Presidency - to get behind an effective international agreement on halting forest loss as a key and highly cost effective measure on climate change .
A new report shows combatting deforestation to be second only to energy efficiency as a way of combatting climate change .
- WWF Sweden is urging its government – holding the current EU Presidency - to get behind an effective international agreement on halting forest loss as a key and highly cost effective measure on climate change .
“ Sweden should follow the examples set by its northern neighbors in developing systems to halt deforestation , ” said WWF CEO General Lasse Gustavsson ..
“ Stemming deforestation is one of the most efficient tools wehave to slow down climate change .
” Gold in Green Forests , a report issued today by WWF - Sweden , says that next to energy efficiency halting forest loss and degradation is the most cost - effective method for mitigating climate change .
The annual loss of natural forests in developing countries is equivalent to one third of Sweden ’s surface area .
Forest fires , the conversion of forests to agricultural land and the cultivation of energy crops are responsible for the high rate of forest loss .
A program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation , known as REDD ( Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation ) is currently being discussed in the negotiations for a global climate deal .
REDD aims to make it worthwhile for developing countries to maintain their forests , as opposed to cutting them down .
In order for REDD to succeed it needs a suitable framework and international finance , including aid to developing countries will be required .
Potential investors recently surveyed by WWF said they would be ready to support a forest carbon market if certainty and support were forthcoming from the international community and key national
In Indonesia , where large areas of forests are cut down and prepared for palm oil plantations , 80 percent of greenhouse gas emissions come from deforestation .
Halting deforestation would not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions , but would also secure the livelihoods of people living in these forests .
” We should see that many solutions for climate change are good for both the environment and our wallets .
- Sweden ’s cautious attitude in this area is therefore very surprising , ” said Gustavsson , who calls for the government to take action during the ongoing climate change conference in Bangkok and secure a system to finance the protection of the world ’s forests .
” Norway , Finland , Denmark and Germany have already guaranteed financing for REDD between 2010 and 2012 .
It 's time for the Swedish government to take action - both domestic and as EU President , ” he said .
If parties are able to come to an agreement on a new climate deal in Copenhagen , it will not enter into force until 2013 .
Meanwhile deforestation will continue to accelerate in large parts of the tropics .
“ Time is passing and the possibility of reaping the positive climate effects that a stop in the loss of forests entails is decreasing rapidly .
Complex social , economic and ecological are involved which is why a global cooperation for REDD must be carefully prepared , ” says Stefan Henningsson , Climate Director , WWF Sweden .
WWF negotiators in Bangkok are urging a an insitutional structure for REDD which guarantees transparency , effectiveness and longterm financing from developed countries in support of measures in developing countries .
In financing , WWF is seeking the equivalent of $ US 42 billion per year after 2013 , a key element of an estimated financing requirement of $ US 160 billion annually for climate change adaptation and mitigation in developing countries .
The scheme would aim for a goal of zero net deforestation by 2020 , with WWF also emphasising that forestry and climate projects must also contribute to the conservation of biological diversity and respect the rights of local and native populations .
Triangular " DNA origami " were made to assemble on etched carbon and silicon
Shapes of DNA have been used to enhance the production of circuits for next - generation computer chips .
Researchers reporting in Nature Nanotechnology have now shown how to get engineered " DNA origami " to self - organise on silicon .
The origami can be designed to serve as a scaffold for electronic components just six billionths of a metre apart .
Making chips with components closer together leads to smaller devices and faster computers .
The six nanometre mark is nearly eight times better than the current industry produces .
Several research groups have shown that DNA itself can be used to store or manipulate data , and the juggling of DNA in a test tube or within bacteria has been shown to solve simple computational tasks .
The current method , by contrast , leverages the ability to design DNA strands into regular shapes such as triangles .
Shapely
The computer industry would like to make use of next - generation materials with favourable electronic properties such as carbon nanotubes or nanowires .
Such structures are tiny and difficult to manipulate , but the chemical groups hanging off of DNA molecules could be used as anchor points for them .
Those anchor points can be as little as six nanometres ( nm ) apart , making these DNA - bound circuit components smaller and thus faster than can currently be produced .
The current industry standard for etching electronic components from larger structures - a so - called " top down " approach - has components at a distance of 45 nm .
DNA offers many anchor points for tiny circuit components
But the new " bottom - up " technique promises distances nearly four times better than the planned industry move to 22nm .
What makes the technique particularly useful is that the regular shapes of the circuit - loaded DNA origami allows them to fit neatly into shaped pits the researchers bored into silicon or carbon using standard techniques .
This self - assembly occurs when a liquid filled with the origami is put in contact with the etched surfaces in what the authors call a case of " bottom - up keys " fitting into " top - down locks " .
Because the eventual placement of the components puts them so much closer , the approach could lead to computers that are both smaller and faster .
However , the motivations are also economic - industry - wide shifts to smaller components are phenomenally expensive to the manufacturers .
" The combination of this directed self - assembly with today 's fabrication technology eventually could lead to substantial savings in the most expensive and challenging part of the chip - making process , " said Spike Narayan , a science and technology manager at IBM 's Almaden research centre .
Fuller integration of the technique could take as much as 10 years , IBM said .

The population delusion
A UNIQUE approach to helping farmers and communities in poor countries adapt to the destructive effects of climate change seems to be paying off .
By combining environmental farming methods with family planning , the Consortium for Integration of Population , Health and Environment ( CIPHE ) in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , says farming productivity in the Wichi wetlands in the south - west of the country has increased – although how much of this is down to a reduction in family size is not yet clear .
“ This is an approach that can balance population with …
A magnetic charge can behave and interact just like an electric charge in some materials , according to new research led by the London Centre for Nanotechnology ( LCN ) .
The findings could lead to a reassessment of current magnetism theories , as well as significant technological advances .
The research , published in Nature , proves the existence of atom - sized ‘ magnetic charges ’ that behave and interact just like more familiar electric charges .
It also demonstrates a perfect symmetry between electricity and magnetism – a phenomenon dubbed ‘ magnetricity ’ by the authors from the LCN and the Science and Technology Facility Council ’s ISIS Neutron and Muon Source .
In order to prove experimentally the existence of magnetic current for the first time , the team mapped Onsager ’s 1934 theory of the movement of ions in water onto magnetic currents in a material called spin ice .
They then tested the theory by applying a magnetic field to a spin ice sample at a very low temperature and observing the process using muons at ISIS .
The experiment allowed the team to detect magnetic charges in the spin ice ( Dy 2 Ti 2 O 7 ) , to measure their currents , and to determine the elementary unit of the magnetic charge in the material .
The monopoles they observed arise as disturbances of the magnetic state of the spin ice , and can exist only inside the material .
Professor Steve Bramwell , LCN co-author of the paper , said : “ Magnetic monopoles were first predicted to exist in 1931 , but despite many searches , they have never yet been observed as freely roaming elementary particles .
These monopoles do at least exist within the spin ice sample , but not outside .
“ It is not often in the field of physics you get the chance to ask ‘ How do you measure something ? ’ and then go on to prove a theory unequivocally .
This is a very important step to establish that magnetic charge can flow like electric charge .
It is in the early stages , but who knows what the applications of magnetricity could be in 100 years time . ”
Professor Keith Mason , Chief Executive of STFC said : “ The unequivocal proof that magnetic charge is conducted in spin ice adds significantly to our understanding of electromagnetism .
Whilst we will have to wait to see what applications magnetricity will find in technology , this research shows that curiosity driven research will always have the potential to make an impact on the way we live and work .
Advanced materials research depends greatly on having access to central research labs like ISIS allowing the UK science community to flourish and make exciting discoveries like this . ”
Dr Sean Giblin , instrument scientist at ISIS and co-author of the paper , added : “ The results were astounding , using muons at ISIS we are finally able to confirm that magnetic charge really is conducted through certain materials at certain temperatures – just like the way ions conduct electricity in water . ”
Check out this illustrative news story from Mississippi , 1963 Tel Aviv , today .
The great Israeli blogs Promised Land and Dimi ’s Notes report that the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva has established a patrol unit to break up dates between Palestinians and Jews .
Dimi Reider explains and provides a translation of a Yediot Ahronot article on the program :
But while the Zionist Agency is talking the talk , Petah Tikva municipality is walking the walk – the patrol walk .
The city hall there is establishing a patrol unit to break up Arab - Jewish dates .
What follows is a translation of the relevant excerpt from a local Yediot Ahronot paper .
“ Minority men ” is a depressingly transparent euphemism for Arabs , and I tried to preserve the stale and clumsy language of the original :
Municipality will locate girls going out with men from minorities
The youth department of the Petah Tikva municipality set up today a special team to assist young girls in the habit of mingling with men from minorities | Einav Yossef - Zada , Ynet 14.09.09
A special team in the youth department of the Petah Tikva municipality will locate [ Jewish – DR ] girls in the habit of meeting with men from minorities and will assist them .
The decision comes after a relationship was discovered between a girl from the city and minority men from Jaljulya who murdered Arik Karp last month on a Tel Aviv beach .
“ The problem of minority men is well - known , ” said the chief of the youth department , Moshe Spektor .
“ Our attempts to deal with this problem are real and sincere .
The municipality is making an effort to examine the matter in cooperation with the police . ”
My mother is a more patient human being after having raised a child who incessantly asked , “ Are we there yet ? ”
That information , often out of reach for a frustrated toddler , carries with it a feeling of reward .
The majority of us are all too familiar with the urge to know more about the future , whether it is an exam grade , an experimental result , or the status of a new job .
Prior knowledge frequently has no effect on the actual outcome of the event – we ’ll get the same grade regardless – and yet we still desperately want to know .
This leads to what scientists refer to as “ information - seeking behavior ” – our mind craves relevant information .
The neural basis behind this seemingly universal desire has eluded scientists for some time , but the wait is over .
Contemporary theories of reinforcement learning are rooted in the dopaminergic reward system .
Dopamine neurons in parts of the midbrain , such as the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta , play a vital role in the expectation of reward .
Most of what is known about these neurons comes from electrode recording experiments with rhesus monkeys .
Not surprisingly , these neurons respond to primitive rewards , such as food and water .
They signal a monkey ’s expectation of rewards , but what was not known until now is whether these same neurons might also signal expectation of information .
To test for this preference for information , which is a cognitive reward , a new paradigm needed to be put in place .
Ethan Bromberg - Martin and Okihide Hikosaka , both at the National Eye Institute , developed a brilliant behavioral task that opened the door .
In the experimental design , monkeys were placed in front of a computer screen and were trained to perform a saccade task , in which they learned to direct their gaze at specific areas .
The monkeys were first given the option of choosing between one of two colored targets .
One of these targets would give the monkey advance information about its future reward .
The advance information came in the form of visual cues , one representing a large reward and the other a small reward .
Choosing the other initial colored target revealed cues that were randomly associated with reward size , thus possessing no informative value .
After only a few days of training , the monkeys showed a clear preference for choosing the informative colored target .
The researchers then tested to see when the monkeys wanted the information .
In this scenario , the monkeys were again initially presented with two colored targets .
One of these targets had informative value while the other did not .
The difference was that the monkeys always received informative cues just before their rewards .
The choice each monkey had to make was whether to see an earlier informative cue .
Despite always having a delayed informative cue , regardless of which initial target they selected , the monkeys preferred to have advance information as soon as possible .
Like high - school seniors waiting on their SAT results , the monkeys wanted to know , and they wanted to know right now .
As humans who experience anticipation almost on a daily level , we can easily understand why monkeys would prefer immediate information .
What exactly in our brains , though , might be responsible for such a behavior ?
Working off the hunch that the midbrain dopamine neurons are heavily involved in reward expectation , such as the arrival of a squirt of juice , the researchers hypothesized these same neurons might also be signaling the expectation of information .
As it happens , when colored targets were presented individually , the dopamine neurons responded more strongly to the informative target than the random target .
This result supports the notion that midbrain dopamine neurons are coding for both primitive and cognitive rewards .
So why do dopamine neurons treat information as a reward ?
It ’s easy to see how treating information this way might be a useful evolutionary adaptation .
For many animals , each day consists of numerous decisions that pertain to eating , reproducing and socializing .
Obviously , having access to more relevant information – such as knowing where the food is located - allows animals to make better decisions .
Furthermore , having access to such information might give us better control over our environment , thus increasing our chances of survival .
When asked if their work might have clinical applications , Drs. Bromberg - Martin and Hikosaka point out that deciphering the neural code behind these systems gives insight into basal ganglia disorders .
Parkinson ’s disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in areas of the midbrain .
While the disease is most often associated with motor dysfunction , in some cases there are also cognitive impairments .
One such impairment is a patient ’s gradual loss of motivation and ability to learn from rewards .
Since the same dopamine neurons are encoding rewards and information , the death of these neurons may reduce the drive to seek information , as well .
Dr. Hikosaka is also enthusiastic about where the research is going next .
It has long been thought that there are two levels of decision - making : a conscious level taking place in the cerebral cortex and an unconscious level in the basal ganglia .
The story is not so simple , he says , because these two systems are connected via the midbrain dopamine neurons .
Perhaps future work will reveal how our conscious and unconscious decisions are influencing one another , all due to this very busy population of dopamine neurons .
It ’s often remarked that “ ignorance is bliss . ”
However , when you look at ignorance from the perspective of the brain a very different picture emerges .
Our brains , and the brains of other animals , have evolved to find information rewarding .
In fact , not knowing is stressful , which is why we strive to decrease that uncertainty whenever possible .
We want the information and we want it now !

From Reuters : CIT debt swap struggles , bankruptcy looms .
Reuters is reporting that " sources familiar with the matter " say bondholders are showing little interest in the debt exchange offer and a bankruptcy is now more likely .
Also this morning CIT announced that CEO Jeffrey Peek is resigning effective Dec 31st .
The possible bankruptcy of CIT is a major concern because CIT provides financing for about one million small businesses .
And small businesses are already having trouble obtaining credit .
From Peter Goodman in the NY Times : Credit Tightens for Small Businesses
Many small and midsize American businesses are still struggling to secure bank loans , impeding their expansion plans and constraining overall economic growth ...
Most banks expect their lending standards to remain tighter than the levels of the last decade until at least the middle of 2010 , according to a survey of senior loan officers conducted by the Federal Reserve Board .
...
Bankers worry about the extent of losses on credit card businesses ...[ and ] are also reckoning with anticipated failures in commercial real estate .
Until the scope of these losses is known , many lenders are inclined to hang on to their dollars rather than risk them on loans to businesses in a weak economy ...
Also see : Small Business and Employment A CIT bankruptcy will probably lead to even tighter credit for many small businesses exacerbating the current credit situation .

Dumb and ungracious ?
Megan Fox , pictured at the Toronto Film Festival in Canada , has been criticised by crew after she described her director as ' Hitler '
' He wants to be like Hitler on his sets , and he is .
So he 's a nightmare to work for but when you get him away from set , and he's not in director mode , I kind of really enjoy his personality because he 's so awkward , so hopelessly awkward .
The scathing open letter , which was posted on director Michael Bay 's website , described her acting as ' unbearable '
' He has no social skills at all .
And it 's endearing to watch him . '
The furious crew members , who have not been named , posted a long open letter to Megan on the director 's official website and signed it ' Loyal Transformers Crew ' .
In it , they tore into her as a second - rate Angelina Jolie who was disliked across the set for her diva - like behaviour .
The letter has since been removed from the site , but not before it was seen by thousands of fans .
' Michael found this shy , inexperienced girl , plucked her out of total obscurity thus giving her the biggest shot of any young actress 's life , ' they wrote .
' He granted her the starring role in Transformers , a franchise that forever changed her life ; she became one of the most googled and ogled women on earth .
' She was famous !
She was the next Angelina Jolie , hooray !
Wait a minute , two of us worked with Angelina - second thought - she 's no Angelina .
You see , Angelina is a professional .
' We know this quite intimately because we 've had the tedious experience of working with the dumb - as - a - rock Megan Fox on both Transformers movies . '
They added : ' When facing the press , Megan is the queen of talking trailer trash and posing like a porn star .
And yes we 've had the unbearable time of watching her try to act on set , and yes , it 's very cringe - able .
' So maybe , being a porn star in the future might be a good career option .
But make - up beware , she has a paragraph tattooed to her backside ( probably due her rotten childhood ) easily another 45 minutes in the chair !'
The crew went on to call her the ' grump of the set ' and said 'we actually do n't think she knows who Hitler is by the way ' .
Tense relations ?
Megan Fox has worked with director Michael Bay on both Transformers films
' She 's as about ungracious a person as you can ever fathom .
She shows little interest in the crew members around her .
We work to make her look good in every way , but she 's absolutely never appreciative of anyone 's hard work .
Never a thank you .
' All the crew members have stopped saying hi to Ms. Princess because she never says hello back .
It gets tiring .
Many think she just really hates the process of being an actress .
' Megan has been late to the sets many times .
She goes through the motions that make her exude this sense of misery ...
' Megan really is a thankless , classless , graceless , and shall we say unfriendly b****.
It 's sad how fame can twist people , and even sadder that young girls look up to her .
If only they knew who they 're really looking up to . '
' Plucked out of total obscurity ' : Transformers in 2007 propelled Fox and co-star Shia LaBeouf to superstardom
Whether pining for the Dark Ages while applying thick black eyeliner or shooting Nazis from the comfort of a couch , everyone has fantasized about living in another era .
But we rarely stop to wonder how history 's greatest figures would translate in our modern age .
How would the great minds of the past adjust to the internet , or today 's political climate , or current pop culture , or any other aspect of life in 2009 ?

Advertisement Prince Charles has paid tribute to the families who lost loved ones in the 7 July 2005 London bombings , at a memorial in Hyde Park .
He said that their bravery " offered us hope for the future " .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown and Minister for London Tessa Jowell joined the Prince of Wales at the unveiling of the 52 steel pillars .
Fifty - two people died after suicide bombers detonated explosives on board three Underground trains and a bus .
The victims ' relatives at the unveiling said the permanent memorial , between the park 's Lover 's Walk and Park Lane , was a " fitting tribute " .
The location of the memorial AT THE SCENE Peter Hunt , BBC royal correspondent
" When the bombers struck " , one of the bereaved told me , " they took away my today and my tomorrow . "
Four years on , the emotions are still raw , but mixed with the pain is a sense of pride that a national memorial now exists .
What was very striking about this simple , sombre service was the sheer number of relatives gathered in front of the 52 stainless steel pillars .
Hundreds of lives have been affected directly by the attacks .
Their loved ones were of all ages , both sexes and many races .
After Prince Charles had delivered a powerful and personal address , the relatives , in the pouring rain , moved forward and placed flowers beside the memorial .
I saw a boy in shorts and a baseball cap next to an elderly woman in a wheelchair .
They all brought roses .
A red one symbolising love , a white rose for peace .
Prince Charles said the date of the bombings " would be etched vividly on all our minds as a brutal intrusion into the lives of thousands of people " .
He said : " The families of the victims , the survivors and the stout hearted emergency services remain very much in our thoughts and prayers .
" You are a moving example of holding together bravery in the face of such inhuman and deplorable outrage and you offer us hope for the future , " he added .
Architects Carmody Groarke said the 3.5 m ( 11.5 ft ) tall stainless steel pillars symbolised the random nature of the loss of life - how it could have been anyone travelling in London that day .
Mrs Jowell said that each column represented " a unique person and a unique grief . "
She added : " Each one casts a shadow just as they do - each one standing tall and proud just as they did , and each one will in an individual way absorb and reflect light just as they did . "
Director Kevin Carmody said the firm worked closely with the families through monthly liaison meetings to ensure the finished product was what they required .
" It took a long time to get to the strong ideas like symbolising the single and collective loss of life , " he said .
He said 26 of the stelae were grouped to represent those killed on the Underground near King 's Cross .
Other clusters represented Tube bombing victims at Aldgate and Edgware Road , with the remainder symbolic of those who died on the number 30 bus in Tavistock Square .
" Hopefully people will have an almost magnetic propulsion towards it , " said Mr Carmody .
It 's an amazing tribute to my mum and the 51 others who were so viciously and brutally taken from us

Families key to memorial design

He said it could be viewed from afar as a single entity but that as they moved closer , people would discover the significance of the four groupings and individual columns .
Though the stelae are anonymous , they are inscribed with the date , time and location of the bombings they represent .
" We 're very happy that the families are pleased with the result , " Mr Carmody added .
A representative of the bereaved families ' group said : " The memorial is a fitting tribute , honouring the 52 lives lost on 7 July 2005 , ensuring that the world will never forget them .
" It represents the enormity of our loss , both on a personal and public level .
' Horrific events '
" We hope this memorial will speak to visitors so they can understand the impact of these horrific events . "
The stelae are grouped to represent those killed in each of the four sites

Thanks to the open casting process used to make the columns , with molten stainless - steel being poured into sand moulds , each one has a unique finish .
Saba Mozakka , 28 , from Finchley , north London , was one of six family members to sit on a liaison board during the memorial 's design .
Her mother , Behnaz Mozakka , 47 , a biomedical officer , was killed on a Piccadilly line train near King 's Cross station while commuting to work .
Ms Mozakka described the memorial as " truly incredible " .
" I 'm very happy .
It 's very poignant , " she said .
" It 's an amazing tribute to my mum and the 51 others who were so viciously and brutally taken from us . "
Grahame Russell , whose 28 - year - old son Philip died in the Tavistock Square bus bombing , said the ceremony had been " extremely moving , extremely poignant " .
He added : " The speakers were outstanding .
You could see by their faces and the way they spoke that they understood the way we feel . "
In his speech , Prince Charles said he had some awareness of the loss felt by the relatives as he recalled his " deep despair " after his great - uncle Lord Mountbatten was killed in an Irish Republican Army bomb blast almost 30 years ago .
After he and Mrs Jowell addressed the memorial service , the names of the victims were read out and a minute 's silence was observed .
The prince then laid a wreath on behalf of the nation while the Duchess of Cornwall left a floral tribute for the families .
In addition to the prime minister and London Mayor Boris Johnson , Conservative leader David Cameron , Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg , former London Mayor Ken Livingstone and senior figures from the emergency services were present .
The dedication ceremony came on the same day that the Home Affairs Committee began its inquiry into the events of 7 July .
It is expected to seek evidence from senior intelligence officials as it examines the police and government response to the attacks .

Sept. 1 , 2009  --
The State Department has extended a contract with controversial private security firm Blackwater , ABC News has learned .
The contract was due to expire this month .
Sources say the department has agreed to temporarily continue using the subsidiary known as Presidential Airways to provide helicopter transport for embassy employees around Iraq until a new contract with another security company , Dyncorp International , is fully implemented .
Presidential Airways is an arm of U.S. Training Center , which is a subsidiary of the company Xe , formerly and still commonly known as Blackwater .
Officials say Dyncorp will not be fully staffed and certified in order to assume the responsibilities immediately .
Dyncorp takes over the airlift contract on Sept. 4 , but because of the delicate handoff between companies , the contract with Blackwater was extended so that the companies overlap .
" The deployment of an aviation program in Iraq is a complex challenge -- a slower transition to DynCorp taking over the task order is in the best interest of the government , " a State Department official said .
The Blackwater contract 's extension is for an indefinite period of time , but an official stressed it was " limited . "
The official said the State Department would like to complete the transition in " weeks or months . "
Once this contract expires , it will end Blackwater 's controversial presence in Iraq .
The company was banned from operating in Iraq by the Iraqi government earlier this year and the State Department did not renew its contracts for personal security details in Iraq .
The airlift contract had been allowed to continue until it was set to expire this month .
Controversial Blackwater Security Firm
Blackwater rose to infamy in 2007 when some of its guards , who were escorting an embassy convoy through crowded Baghdad traffic , allegedly fired indiscriminately , killing 17 Iraqis .
The incident sparked massive protests among Iraqis and hastened calls for a U.S. withdrawal from the country .
Five of the guards were charged with 35 counts of manslaughter and federal fire arms charges last year and pleaded not guilty in court earlier this year .
One of the Blackwater guards involved in the shooting , Jeremy Ridgeway , agreed to testify against the five Blackwater guards last November and pleaded guilty to charges of one count of manslaughter , attempt to commit murder and aiding and abetting .
A U.S. official says the U.S. informed the Iraqi government that the decision was made " because the complexity of transition from one company to the next was going to take a little bit more time . "
" They were understanding , " the official said of the Iraqis .
The U.S. embassy is dependent on the airlift capacity in order to get around the country , a need that has only increased since the U.S. military has begun to scale back its operations , officials say .
A spokeswoman for Xe did not immediately respond to requests for comment .

This time in Shibuya Streets I wanted to change the camera viewpoint and give you something fresh to look at .
To do this I took some shots in black and white .
There are some nice shots showing the fashion and relaxed atmosphere of people .
Center - gai is always popular for people to walk down and up into the top end of the Shibuya shopping area .
You can pass through Center - gai for Tokyu Hands , up towards HMV , Loft , Parco and then further up meeting up with Koen dori to to NHK and Yoyogi Park .
The weather was so perfect today .
The Autumn breeze was present bringing a fresh feel , but the sun was also out in force allowing people to wear their summer fashions again before it gets cold .
It was fun to get out and shoot some black and white pictures with the digital camera .
I have been trying a few different things with the Nikon D700 since I got it and have been pleased with the results .
I am hoping to get some new lenses and further experiment with different photo formats and scenes .
I would really like to know what you think of the black & white photos compared to the color ones ?
Also to know which photos remind you of your time in Japan or make you want to visit ?

Mussolini was working as a journalist when paid by the British Benito Mussolini may be among history 's most notorious fascist dictators , but evidence suggests he worked for British secret services during World War I. Historian Dr Peter Martland says MI5 records show it paid " Il Duce " £ 100 per week , about £ 5,000 today , to spread pro-war propaganda via his newspaper .
The Cambridge University academic made the discovery while studying the papers of former agent Sir Samuel Hoare MP .
However , Dr Martland believes Mussolini probably spent the cash on womanising .
" Mussolini was the ace womaniser and of course , he 's spent most of it on his women , " he suggests .
Dr Martland said the payments were agreed in 1917 , after Russia collapsed into the Bolshevik revolution and Italy was " smashed " at the Battle of Caporetto .
It 's good value for money - he was what the British needed
Dr Peter Martland
Fearing the war would be lost , Britain sent a team of 100 intelligence officers to Italy to " stiffen the backbone " of its industrial working classes , he said .
" These poor people are suffering in exactly the same way as the British working classes are ; hyperinflation , food shortages and a press that is not necessarily pro-war , " he said .
Mussolini 's socialist publication , Il Popolo d'Italia , carried a key voice because it served the factory workers of Milan whose output was essential for the war effort , Dr Martland said .
The tale came to light as the historian pored over 40,000 documents belonging to Sir Samuel .
A prominent Conservative , Sir Samuel would go on to become foreign secretary almost two decades later and in 1935 signed the pact that would give Mussolini - by then a bloody dictator - control over Abyssinia , the country that is now Ethiopia .
But back in 1917 , said Dr Martland , the UK was pouring £ 4 m per day into the war , so the sum paid to Mussolini was " petty cash " .
" It works .
It 's good value for money .
At that point he was what the British needed , " said Dr Martland .
As for Il Duce 's conversion from journalist to brutal fascist - " pure opportunism " , the academic concluded .

Assuming his log was actually written by him , here is my best attempt at using it to answer the obvious questions .
Disclaimer : I never met him , did n't do an evaluation of him , etc .
Basing this entirely on the log .
He exudes confidence People believe bull shit if delivered WITH CONFIDENCE .
Get it ??
My markup of Sodini 's log here .
What does Sodini talk about most in his log ?
Not women , sex , or dating , but time .
Time wasted and the lack of a future .
He was realizing he had run out of time .
Not only did he not attain his life 's goals ; he was going backwards .
He had had sex and girlfriends in the past ; now the years had slipped by , no more " hot hotties " for him .
He at least had attained a good job ; but now there was a chance he'd be laid off .
Even if he was n't , he realized that his skills as a .NET software developer were becoming obsolete .
He had found a church to be a part of ; he was then kicked out of the church .
All the things in life that defined him were going , going ... The " how to pick up women " books and courses were a Hail Mary longshot .
Note that he did n't try these in his 20s or 30s .
This was a desperate last ditch attempt at achieving something long lasting .
On the videos , it 's obvious he 's hopeful , optimistic , even excited that this might work -- maybe he had a second chance at women ?
It failed .
The only thing missing from this list would be being diagnosed with a terminal illness .
All the real things which had defined him were disappearing ; all his attempts at making real the things he imagined could define him were being stymied .
At 48 , George Sodini was watching himself disappear from the earth .
The note showed obvious anger towards specific people , e.g. family , " Andy , " pastor Rick Knapp .
Despite how much anger he had towards them , however , he never confronted them .
These individuals probably had no idea he even hated them .
He was n't a confrontational person , he could n't muster the " balls " ( his word ) to say something to them .
Instead , he vented in private : " That felt good , " he wrote after the Andy tirade .
You would n't write that if you just yelled at Andy .
This is why he put their addresses in his log- the chance someone else would harass them .
( Note the anger so many have towards Rick Knapp and religion now -- they 're taking Sodini 's side , and they do n't even know Knapp . )
In short , he was afraid of the people he hated , afraid in the way a 17 year old boy still fears his father , even though he might be stronger than him .
He was resentful of women , but despite media proclamations , there is nothing in the log indicating he hated women .
He repeatedly identified that his problem with women was himself , not them -- but he did n't know what exactly his problem was .
Nor was he afraid of women -- he was n't even particularly shy .
He liked meeting new people ; he was about to chat up to a woman at the gym .
However , he did n't really see women as people , as individuals , only as tools for his own validation .
His family , however , were real people .
Just to get the courage to kill people heafraid of , Sodini had to make practice runs ; he even " chickened out " of the plan at one point .
George Sodini was likely too afraid to confront , let alone attack , people more powerful than him .
It 's fairly typical of mass murderers to therefore choose a nameless proxy for his rage ; in this case , the symbols of his wasted years .
In the end , this was the closest level of intimacy he was going to get with them .
No. Maybe .
He had narcissistic traits , but many other traits were very non-narcissistic .
It 's hard to know -- This is the same problem with postulating any psychiatric diagnosis or label ( e.g. autism or Asperger 's . )
While possible , while it might explain his failure with women -- who knows ?-- it does not explain why hepeople .
That 's what you want to know .
He seems to have been depressed ; that might explain suicide , but not homicide .
So whether he was a narcissist or not is less important than asking why he killed people .
I can say with confidence that if he was not psychotic , the violence was the result of narcissism , that specific part of him .
There are three characteristics of all narcissistic violence : 1 . To the outside observer , it appears to be " first strike , " unprovoked , or disproportionate to the situation .
To the perpetrator , it is the appropriate amount of response to a perceived attack on identity .
( Think 9 - 11 , Columbine , etc . )
No one after a narcissistic rage says , " wow , I guess I went a little overboard . "
There is no guilt .
2 . It is a response to shame , to failure , to loss of identity .
Killing your wife 's lover probably is n't narcissistic rage .
Killing your wife is .
3 . Immersion , singlemindedness ; obliviousness to outside factors .
Whether it takes three seconds or three hours , all you think about is the violence .
The violence is the only thing protecting your identity .
Anger is not a necessary part of rage ; euphoria , elation , and even orgasm occur during narcissistic violence .
The core of all narcissism is low self esteem , specifically a misunderstanding of the potential of one 's importance in the world , but in any case Sodini did not think he had low self - esteem .
The log does n't say , " I 'm a big ugly jerk . "
It says : I look good , smell good , I have a good job , women like me .
Given that all the pieces were intact -- he could n't understand why he could n't succeed .
The reason was that the intact pieces were not put together correctly .
He does n't tan because he thinks he 's ugly , he does it because he thinks young women will like it .
But he 's 48 .
Tanning is n't going to make a 48 year old man look any better to young women than high heels on a 48 year old woman is going to entice a young man .
At that age , you 're either attractive to them , or not .
Tiny details like that do n't change the picture .
Worse , it looks bizarre to everyone else .
the part he did n't get , though he had a brief glimmer of it : " young women were brutal when I was younger , now they are n't as much , probably because they just see me just as another old man .
" He did n't overcompensate by inflating his ego , either : " i'm ok at what I do ... not at the top of the class , but I do a good job . "
No mention of how awesome his biceps are ; no disparaging the women as too stupid to realize how awesome his biceps were .
He 's fairly realistic about himself .
Prostitutes would have been a temporary physical thrill , but they would n't have provided what he needed : validation .
He knows prostitutes are in it for the money ; likely he figured a " Russian Bride " would be faking it with him as well .
The point was n't sex , it was finding someone to confirm he was worth it .
Also , these " outlets " are n't simply condemned by society , they 're made fun of .
Disappearing is bad enough ; being laughed into oblivion is much worse .
No .
Nothing is predetermined , of course , but history serves as a guide .
First , Sodini did have a date , at t least two confirmed , one a year earlier and another in May .
Second , what George was looking for was someone to love him in spite of himself ; e.g. unconditional love that he felt he did n't get from his mother ( do n't you roll your eyes , he pretty much said it himself . )
If his mom did n't love him , how was he going to get anyone else to love him ?
Answer : he'd have to convince them .
By definition , anyone he managed to get to love him could not actually love him - because he had to get her to love him .
Consider the " pick up women " books and courses .
He looked at dating as a strategy ; he needed to learn the tricks .
But he has reasonably good self - insight , so what do you think he would think if the tricks worked ?
If he succeeded in " getting " a girl , he 'd immediately diminish her as inferior : " I had to trick her to get her . "
He wrote : He thinks the confidence is a trick , not something real .
And the words one says to get girls , ahead , etc , are bullshit .
Imagine after tanning for a month and lifting weights , he met a girl at the gym who fell in love with him .
Part of his thinking would be that had he not tanned and worked out , she would n't have liked him .
Sodini was 48 .
How much longer could the tan and the muscles last ?
Not exactly , though " regressed pedophile " might be technically accurate .
His focus on getting girls " 20 years younger " , or " finding it fun talking to young kids " is just looking for someone naive enough to believe his tricks .
He clearly had a sexual interest in fully developed women .
Of course , had he managed to convince a 16 year old to like him , he would have to declare to himself : " she 's so much more mature than her years .
"
If we take him at his word , he did believe this .
However , why did he choose to believe this , yet simultaneously dismissing everything else in religion as crap ?
He chose to believe it not merely because it justified his actions , but because it confirmed he , as an individual , had existed and was worth it .
If going to heaven depended on what he did in life -- well , he did n't do anything in life , so he'd be sunk .
But if God had selected him for salvation , thenexisted , he was real , there was something about him other than his external life that made him worth saving .
His individuality alone is what got him into heaven .
Correct reasoning of the Christian logic would conclude that if knew he was saved -- his identity validated -- then he did n't need to kill anyone .
And if he did kill people , he did it from a selfish place that would imply he was n't saved after all .
It 's hard to believe that 13 years in hat church and their bible study , he did n't understand this .
He " picked and choosed " a religious doctrine that fit his life , instead of the other way around .
Insanity is a legal term , not a clinical one , and thus must be discussed using relevant laws , i.e. Pennsylvania .
Pennsylvania uses the M'Naughten test to determine insanity : Who knows ?
I can say I find no psychosis in his log ; and I 'm certain that had he gone to trial , there 'd be dueling experts saying he did or did not .
I see aspects of depression , I do n't see bipolar or OCD .
2 .
This seems incontrovertible .
He planned , changed his mind , conducted practice runs , etc .
In the interest of teaching and public discourse , I 'll concoct an insanity defense that fits the available evidence :
An insanity defense would have to show that either this was not a rationally planned operation , or else that he was ill and deluded for over a year .
So a defense might be that Sodini 's log was actually written all at once , on the day of the shooting ( note the web address includes " 20090804 " ) .
He gave no other hints to people , to internet forums , or even within his published google searches that he was thinking of shooting people .
He had bought guns , but it is n't even clear he ever fired them before that day .
He appears to have snapped suddenly , all at once , and invented a delusional backstory that made him want to shoot people .
He knew there was something wrong with him ( he had googled Avoidant and Schizoid ) and described himself as unable to find pleasure in things .
He was 5 ' 10 " , 155 lbs- though videos and pictures seem to place him considerably heavier .
Did he take steroids ?
Did he have a disease ?
In his photo he is waring a red or pink bracelet .
Breast cancer , or AIDS ?
At some point , the depression was acutely exacerbated by either the physical changes , sleep deprivation ( google searches have him up at 3 am and again at 5 am ) and then a self - reported return to drinking , possibly marijuana.etc .
Murder is wrong .
You know that , right ?
You may think it iswrong than what you 've suffered so far , but it is n't .
Next , with respect to committing mass murder : it wo n't work .
Mass murder is the violent expression of being a pussy .
The people killed are almost never the people who actually hurt you -- they are the nameless collateral damage of your fear of confrontation .
Every person who Sodini felt hurt him is still alive .
Every person he shot was nothing but polite to him , if they had any contact at all .
This is almost universally true about mass murderers .
In other words , the people who you think hurt you most got punished the least .
Is that what you wanted ?
The problem is fear .
Even with a gun , Sodini was too scared to confront the people who most sacred and enraged him .
That 's probably where you 're at , too .
Meanwhile , the scary people get to say , " whew !
" In order to beat them you have to confront the people who are actually hurting you , they hurt you .
When the bully comes around , stand up for yourself .
You may get beaten up -- you will get beaten up -- but you wo n't be a coward .
Not only will you feel good about yourself , but you will eventually terrify the bullies .
There 's nothing scarier than a guy who wo n't stay down .
Next , you should know that mass murder does n't earn you a place in history , you are n't guaranteeing immortality .
The only reason you think it does is because like most Americans , your view of history is tens of years .
Do you know who Howard Unruh is ?
Killed 13 people with a Luger .
But the crimes happened in 1949 .
Worse , the internet is the new arbiter of memory .
A hundred years from now , a person is as likely to come across the name " George Sodini " as he is someone who posts a lot of pics to Flickr , which is to say , not that likely .
The quest for immortality , like insomnia , is mostly in those who fear they have n't accomplished anything .
" I need more time . "
No , you need to do more with the time you were given .
Yes .
There 's not much , unfortunately .
The problem is n't the press , exactly ; the problem is our changed relationship to the press as our defacto historians and thought police .
They tell us the facts , but frame them in the historical context they think most applicable .
But since there is no other " media " -- most stories come from AP and Reuters , for example ; and the type of people that go into journalism are of a certain mindset , etc -- they establish the parameters and the language of discussion .
It 's fourth generation warfare , played out on TV .
We want to know about mass shooters because they have been telling us we want to know , and they produce the story in the way we want to hear it .
There are some things the press can do better : report the story straight , like a boring day on Wall Street .
No pictures of body bags , no sirens , no swat teams .
All that stuff will get out , but do n't mainstream it because then those images become the point of the story , and thus the point of committing a crime like this .
These things will leak out on the internet , of course , but that 's ok : no one is going to say , " I so want to do something that will be remembered only by crazy internet detectives on metafilter . "
( Unless the perpetrator is a crazy internet detective on metafilter . )
Never , ever , show a picture of the killer on the news ( unless it 's a manhunt . )
The public will find a picture of him if they want to , but by the media displaying it for us , it tells us we need to know it ; it tells potential murderers that if they commit a murder , their identity will be the most important part of the story .
In other words , they should report mass shooters the way they reported 9-11 -- gross generalizations about " terrorists " and little focus on the backstories of the individual perpetrators ( other than Atta , name one hijacker ) , and massive focus on emergency personnel and victims .
Hell , they do n't even celebrate it as an attack , they call it by itsThat kind of coverage does n't inspire copycats .
( It does n't inspire very much of anything , actually . )
Yes .
This is the generation thatit to happen again and again .
I defy anyone to tell me they overheard someone say the following sentence : " why would anyone want to shoot young women at a health club doing latin dance ?
It 's crazy , it just does n't make sense ! "
Anyone ?
No , this is what you hear , everywhere : " I do n't condone what Sodini did , but I can understand it ... "
That feeling is societal .
It takes on different forms , sex , politics , etc , but the form is an illusion , the substance is " I 'm not the person I thought I 'd be ; no sees me the way I want to be seen .
"
It may not be a shooting rampage -- it could be a bombing , or a " politically motivated killing " -- but it 's the same : " they " kept " me " down long enough ...
It 's social justice , narcissism style : everyone deserves what they get , and gets what they deserve .
Ah , the burger .
Labor Day grilling tradition , force of good and ease in the American diet .
We take you for granted , burger .
We assume that because you are a national culinary treasure that you are also unassailable , that you can be toyed with -- unmercifully at times -- and that you 'll still come out perfect .
But it is , in the end , we who are imperfect , o burger .
Arrogant .
Thankless .
How have we screwed with thee ?
Let us count the ways .
And then , forgive us our trespasses .
10 . McDLT
Sometimes bad ideas come with good intentions .
This 1980s McDonald 's campaign did n't fail so much because the burger was especially bad ( by McDonald 's standards , mind you ) , but because the packaging was an environmental nightmare .
The whole " keep the hot hot , keep the cool cool " strategy did n't exactly work either -- the steam from the hot side tended to wilt the cool side in short order .
Perhaps the biggest problem with this campaign , though ?
George Constanza ( Jason Alexander ) singing its praises as some sort of comically - hip hamburger Pied Piper .
9 . In 'n ' Out 's 100x100
Can you really fault a restaurant for the idiocy of its patrons ?
Is it really In 'n ' Out Burger 's fault that someone got the bright idea to take the California chain up on their offer to let customers choose how many meat and cheese pairs they want on their burger ?
Yes .
It absolutely is .
At meetings , we call this " enabling . "
8. Frozen Microwavable White Castle Cheeseburgers
Any burger -- hell , any anything -- that can be described as both " frozen " and " microwavable " can also fairly be described as " awful . "
This is one of those products that should -- by law , and enforced by angry Midwesterners with bats -- have a label that says " Warning :
While this product may visually resemble the product it is attempting to replicate , it in no other way will remind you of said product , and may in fact damage long - term memories of the original .
Eat with caution .
And maybe a dash of shame . "
7. McDonald 's Hula Burger
Back in the early 60s , Ray Croc was looking for a way to make more money on Fridays -- receipts were down at that time in Catholic areas , due to the more widely - observed tradition of eating no meat on Fridays .
So Ray came up with this massive failure of an idea , which basically replaced the meat with a slice of grilled pineapple .
Response to this varied from " pardon me , I think you forgot my burger " to " I 'm not Catholic , I 'm Hawaiian " to " This would be great for a vegetarian in the mid-90s desperately searching for any decent meat replacement . "
6. Carl 's Jr Breakfast Burger
This may be the most literal burger name in existence , because in the same way that a cheeseburger is a burger with cheese on it , this is a burger with breakfast on it .
It 's not a burger just designed to be eaten at breakfast ; it uses breakfast as a topping : fried egg , bacon , and hash browns , to be precise .
( I hear that if you ask for it , they 'll soak the bun in orange juice for you so that it 's a healthy part of a complete breakfast . )
Truly the most important burger of the day .
5. Arch Deluxe
The Arch Deluxe was McDonald 's attempt to inject a little sophistication into their menu .
" The burger with the grown up taste " was the tag line -- which did n't take into account , really , that grown - up taste pretty much precluded going to McDonalds .
It was also introduced by way of an ad campaign that featured kids saying " I do n't get it , " and even " yucky " ( which is I suppose what the girl in the attached ad is trying to communicate -- either that , or " I 'm licking your coupon " ) , which were sentiments to which adults tended to respond with general agreement and ultimate disinterest .
4. McLean Deluxe
The second " deluxe " burger from McD's on the list , this one is n't about adult tastes , but adult waists .
More specifically , this was McDonald 's low - fat burger -- 91 percent fat free , to be specific .
This dubious accomplishment ( 91 percent fat - free means 9 % fat -- not bad , but no better than the stuff you can get at the grocery store ) was made more problematic by the fact that it just plain did n't taste all that good .
And face it -- if you 're going to McDonalds , especially in the early 90s , you were n't doing it to eat healthy .
This was an irony made all too apparent by the above ad , which offered a free large fries when you bought a McLean -- sort of like getting a free coal - burning furnace with the purchase of a Chevy Volt .
3. Burger King 's Super Seven Incher
Using fellatio to sell burgers ?
There are no words .
( Except maybe : " Would you like a condom with that ? " )
2. Lady's Brunch Burger
The internet is full of lists of ridiculously bad - for - you burgers : the " what - the - hell , we all gotta die someday " Hardee 's Monster Thickburger , Ruby Tuesday 's sinister healthy - sounding - but - not Bella Turkey Burger , and the John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith of burger overindulgence : Chili's Smokehouse Bacon Triple Cheese Big Mouth Burger with Jalapeno Ranch Dressing .
But Paula Deen , Food Network 's Grande Dame of Butter , came up with something that beats them all -- her Lady 's Brunch Burger is a half - pound of beef , topped with bacon and an egg fried in butter , served with two Krispy Kreme donuts in lieu of a bun .
It 's okay that you 're both repulsed and sort of excited -- this is the brave new world of food porn .
1. Canburger
Cheeseburger in a can .
It 's a simple idea , for simple people , some of whom might not realize that cheeseburgers should n't come in a can .
But heck , it 's sort of cool in a novelty - item - not - to - be- actually - consumed sort of way .
This burger does n't just come in the can -- it 's also cooked in the can , which is supposed to protect the flavor ( though protecting the flavor of this sandwich is something akin to protecting Charles Manson from an attack in the prison showers ) .
It is , however , great for 1950s fallout shelters , neo - conservative militia stockpiling , and perhaps as a gentler alternative for those families for whom the fictional Obama Death Panels do n't sound so bad -- because if grandma eats this , she 'll lose the will to live all on her own .
A Toronto high school student who designed an orbiting space colony for 10,000 people has taken the grand prize in a NASA Space Settlement Competition .
Eric Yam , who attends Grade 12 at Northern Secondary School , beat out more than 300 students from around the world to become the first Canadian to win the contest in its 16 years .
He tied with a team from Orissa , India .
" The most challenging part was to combine all the different aspects - the technology that would work in space combined with a social design , a government system and life - support systems , " Yam said yesterday .
" He basically built a Utopia from scratch , " said math and physics teacher Gillian Evans , staff advisor on the project .
Yam 's innovative design , built as a series of stacked rings resembling a cylinder , would house a self - sustaining colony of 10,000 people and up to 300 visitors , including paying tourists , in the year 2050 .
A hotel section would include a panoramic outer gallery with transparent walls , perfect for watching the earth , moon and stars .
Yam called his design Asten , another name for the Egyptian god Thoth , master of divine and physical law .
A pdf of the design can be viewed at : http://www.tdsb.on.ca/wwwdocuments/about_us/media_room/docs/ASTEN.pdf

SPRINGFIELD – A 22 - year - old woman , who flashed $ 27,000 in cash Monday night while inside an Indian Orchard bar , was held up at gunpoint around midnight after she left the bar with a male friend and walked towards her car .
Sgt. John M. Delaney said the victim , while inside the bar , bragged of receiving the $ 27,000 from an insurance claim .
Delaney , aide to Police Commissioner William J. Fitchet , said the victims told police they were robbed by two male suspects wearing dark clothing and bandanas , one armed with what appeared to be a semi-automatic handgun .
" Lesson learned ... "
Delaney said in prepared statement .

Detectives are probing the case , Delaney said .
Cradled in his palms
The genius of Dan Brown
September 16 , 2009
Oh , so apparently some guy named Dan Brown has written some new book ?
The extract soon gets to the point :
The thirty - four - year - old initiate gazed down at the human skull cradled in his palms .
Mmm , beautiful .
“ Cradled in his palms ” .
One can feel the reverence with which the initiate is delicately holding this human skull .
But tell us more about the skull , Mr Brown !
The skull was hollow ,
That is useful information , for now I am no longer visualizing one of those solid skulls ?
like a bowl ,
Even better — hollow like a bowl , not hollow like , I do n’t know , a syringe , or an asteroid hollowed out by aliens .
The image is now irresistibly vivid !
A human skull , hollow like a bowl !
But wait , Mr Brown , why are you telling us that this particular skull is “ hollow , like a bowl ” ?
Are you subtly setting up the idea that the skull contains some liquid ?
filled with bloodred wine .
Ah — now this is why Dan Brown is Dan Brown .
A lesser author would have been satisfied with a lesser liquid — having the human skull ( hollow like a bowl ) contain , I do n’t know , some gazpacho soup or Ready Brek .
No one but Dan Brown could have thought of filling the human skull ( hollow like a bowl ) with “ bloodred wine ” .
( ( Later on we are told that “ The crimson wine looked almost black in the dim candlelight ” , but that ’s the lighting director ’s problem , so fuck you . ) )
It is an image of menacing ingenuity , through which Mr Brown is really beginning to establish a kind of superior Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom atmosphere .
The author then types on with some description of a big room , but it is no shame for us to admit that his best work is already accomplished : the concept of an initiate holding a human skull ( hollow like a bowl ) filled with bloodred wine and cradled in his palms is a kind of chorus that insists on being heard again , and it is not long before the reader is thus pleasured :
The initiate had been told every room in this building held a secret , and yet he knew no room held deeper secrets than the gigantic chamber in which he was currently kneeling with a skull cradled in his palms .
A skull cradled in his palms .
Imagine !
Almost as though it were a human infant .
I must admit my eyes glazed over again after this at the further description of the big room and whatever , but only because I was aching to see what the author would do with his inevitable third treatment of the concept “ skull cradled in his palms ” .
I was not disappointed :
Steeling himself for the last step of his journey , the initiate shifted his muscular frame and turned his attention back to the skull cradled in his palms .
Only a second - rate writer would vary such a winning formula .
The first - rate writer knows the true value of incessant repetition .
Indeed , I suspect this stunning symbol - sequence , “ skull cradled in his palms ” , must owe its majestic power to some actual black sorcery , because when I had finished reading the entire extract , I found myself cradling my own skull in my palms ?
Young girl , get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run , girl ,
You 're much too young , girl
With all the charms of a woman
You 've kept the secret of your youth
You led me to believe
You 're old enough
To give me Love
And now it hurts to know the truth , Oh ,
Young girl , get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run , girl ,
You 're much too young , girl
Beneath your perfume and make - up
You 're just a baby in disguise
And though you know
That it is wrong to be
Alone with me
That come on look is in your eyes , Oh ,
Young girl , get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run , girl ,
You 're much too young , girl
So hurry home to your mama
I 'm sure she wonders where you are
Get out of here
Before I have the time
To change my mind
' Cause I 'm afraid we 'll go too far , Oh ,
Young girl
Young girl , get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Get along , girl ,
You 're much too young , girl
Young girl , get out of my mind
My love for you is way out of line
Better run , girl ,
You 're much too young , girl
All of us could use some help increasing our productivity .
So I ’m going to share one of my best productivity secrets .
This secret can literally CHANGE YOUR LIFE !!!
Are you ready ?
Step 1 .
Buy a productivity book .
Any productivity book will do .
I use a book called “ The Now Habit . ”
It does n’t matter what book you order though , because you probably wo n’t read it .
You can use any random “ increase your productivity ” book .
Step 2 .
Look at the productivity book and tell yourself , “ If I do n’t get X done , I ’m going to have to read that productivity book . ”
That ’s it .
As far as I can discern , staring at the cover of a productivity book gives you almost as much of a motivational boost as actually reading the book .
And if staring at the cover does n’t work , then tell yourself the punishment for not getting your work done is that you ’ll have to read that dang productivity book .
Pretty soon you ’ll be off and working .
Enjoy . 🙂
Last nights Season Finale of ‘ The Office ’ ends in the epic “ Office Wedding Dance ’ ( above ) .
Leave it to ‘ The Office ’ to transcend mediums and spoof this popular viral in a way as… touching as the original .
In fact , it ’s probably more touching .
We ’ve been rooting for Pam and Jim for five seasons .
We know the Dunder Mifflin crew in an intimate way that only television ( At least , for the moment ) can create .
I wrote about the original JK Wedding Dance previously and it ’s now more important than being Sony ’s # 8 music video on YouTube ( And I bet that will rise the ranks for a few days following the Office spoof ) .
It ’s a new kind of Traditional and New Media merge – One of content and ideas rather than technical or distribution paradigms .
It sets a precedent that it ’s ok for TV to copy the Web .
Audiences will get it .
–
Think about that for a second .
It ’s the reverse of how it was and what we are used to – People on the web spoofing or coping what is on TV .
The Wedding Dance video has 27 million views .
Last nights ‘ The Office ’ had a 4.5 Nielsen Rating according to Variety .
That means 4.5 % of the 114.9 million ‘ television households in the United States ’ or 5.17 million viewers .
We can safely assume most people watching last night had seen the original Wedding Dance and would ‘ get it ’ .
The characters in ‘ The Office ’ got it and reference the RK video on multiple occasions .
YouTube videos are part of our lexicon and have been for some time now .
It ’s wide enough to work on network TV .
I ca n’t think of many other times a popular TV show has spoofed a web video .
TV characters frequently reference YouTube .
Arrested Development spoofed Star Wars kid ( 14 million views in 3 years ) but last nights ‘ The Office ’ takes it to a totally different level .
Does this further legitimize Web Video ?
At the very least , the RK Wedding video is the gift that keeps on giving to Sony .
And to think –
They almost took it down due copyright infringement .

Mr Nozette developed technology for the Pentagon and Nasa An American scientist who worked for the US defence department and the space agency Nasa has appeared in court charged with attempted espionage .
Stewart David Nozette tried to give classified information to a person whom he believed was an Israeli intelligence officer , the justice department said .
The 52 - year - old , who once had top security clearance , was arrested on Monday in Maryland by FBI agents .
The complaint does not allege Israel or anyone acting for it violated US law .
Mr Nozette , who appeared in court in Washington on Tuesday , faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted .
The scientist did not speak except to give his name .
He is next due in court at the end of the month .
' Top secret '
" The conduct alleged in this complaint is serious and should serve as a warning to anyone who would consider compromising our nation 's secrets for profit , " said US Assistant Attorney General David Kris on Monday .
According to an affidavit , Mr Nozette worked at the White House on the National Space Council from 1989 to 1990 , where he developed a radar experiment that purportedly discovered water on the Moon .
The answers contained information ... that concerned US satellites , early warning systems , means of defence or retaliation against large - scale attack , communications intelligence information , and major elements of defence strategy
US Department of Justice
He then spent 10 years at the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , where he designed highly advanced technology .
In 2000 , he set up a company that developed advanced technology for the US government , including for the Pentagon and Nasa .
" From 1989 through 2006 , Nozette held security clearances as high as ' top secret ' and had regular , frequent access to classified information and documents related to the US national defence , " the justice department said in a statement .
Last month , Mr Nozette was contacted by an undercover FBI agent posing as an Israeli intelligence officer , whom he allegedly told he would be willing to regularly answer questions about classified information in exchange for money and an Israeli passport .
Over the course of the next month , the scientist provided letters with answers containing information " classified as both ' top secret ' and ' secret ' that concerned US satellites , early warning systems , means of defence or retaliation against large - scale attack , communications intelligence information , and major elements of defence strategy " , the justice department said .
In return , Mr Nozette accepted cash totalling $ 11,000 , it added .

Alex Rosenwald , the director of media outreach for Americans for Limited Government , included NBC producer Jane Stone on a mass email to different news organizations attempting to drum up attention for content on the libertarian think tank ’s website about ACORN .
And that ’s all anybody can agree on .
ALG claims that Stone replied to Rosenwald , writing “ Bite me Jew Boy . ” NBC claims
Stone simply wrote “ Take me off this list ! ”
Steve Capus , president of NBC News , has stepped in to put a stop to ALG ’s slanderous allegations .
Or to “ protect what is indefensible with hysterical , frantic accusations , ” if you ask Carter Clews , ALG ’s director of communications .
Politico ’s Michael Calderone has been keeping up with the back and forth .
“ Somebody , on the other end , I ’m assuming , took the return stamp from the email and then put in this hateful message , ” Capus told Calderone .
“ I do n’t know who did it .
It ’s outrageous to suspect that somebody from NBC News would do it . ”
Meanwhile , Clews said that “ This email has left a digital footprint that is undeniable .
We did our due diligence .
We have confirmed that it indeed came from NBC ’s server and Jane Stone ’s email address . ”
But the NBC camp has done its own due diligence .
An NBC statement , via Politico :
Americans for Limited Government has chosen to launch an outrageous , reckless attack and smear campaign against an NBC News employee .
Faced with irrefutable evidence that our employee did nothing more than ask to be removed from an email mailing list , the organization has maliciously published a fabricated email .
Our employee never sent any such email .
She is completely innocent of the outrageous charges and is being used by an organization to make a self - serving point .
This is a shameless , hateful and defaming act which should be roundly denounced .
The he said –she said can only go on so long .
Both sides should trot out their evidence now that this has become public and Stone ’s reputation is on the line .
In the meantime , ALG has gotten some serious face time from a major news company .
But will all the buzz turn into embarrassment once the case is closed on ‘ Bite me Jew Boy ’ ?
Have a tip we should know ?

ME -210 FIGHTER --DIVE -BOMBER
The new Messerschmitt 210 ( shown in the accompanying sketches ) was first believed to be an improved model of the Me-110 , but subsequent developments have shown it to be an entirely new long - range fighter and dive - bomber .
The pilot and a radio operator , who also acts as a rear gunner , comprise the crew .
Except for size , the Me-210 bears little resemblance to the Me-110 fighter - bomber .
It is a twin - engined , low - wing , all - metal monoplane with a single fin and rudder .
The noticeable deep fuselage tapers to a very slim section near the tail .
The wings have a straight taper with rounded detachable tips .
As the drawings indicate , the cabin enclosure is very humped and ends approximately at the trailing edges of the wings .
The bomb compartment , which has a normal capacity of 4,400 pounds , is in and under the cabin forward of the leading edge of the wing .
The single - strut undercarriage and the tail wheel are retractable .
Messerschmitt 210
Slots are fitted to the leading edges of the wings , and the slotted ailerons are equipped with trimming tabs .
Strips are also fitted to the trailing edges of the ailerons for trim adjustment on the ground .
The wing flaps are of the split type .
The venetian - blind - type dive brakes are located outboard of the engines , immediately forward of the coolant radiators , and are fitted to both upper and lower surfaces of the wings .
The comparatively large - span horizontal stabilizer is not adjustable , and the elevators are fitted with trimming tabs .
The Me-210 has comprehensive armor protection and is believed to be one of the best - armored planes of its kind .
The airplane is armed with five or six guns .
The fixed forward armament is mounted in the nose and is believed to consist of two 20 - mm cannon flanked on each side by one 7.9 - mm machine gun .
The rear or lateral armament comprises two 13 - mm machine guns 131 , one mounted on either side of a barbette which joins the two sides of the fuselage amidships .
The guns fire through blisters on the sides of the fuselage aft of the trailing edges of the wings .
The entire barbette , including guns and fairings , rotates in elevation , both guns moving in unison .
For horizontal movement , one gun traverses the field of fire while the other gun is locked nearly parallel with the fuselage .
However , both guns can fire together when in a nearly parallel position .
The rear gunner aims through a heavy bulletproof glass screen and controls the barbette through a handle which moves in elevation and in traverse .
The motion of the handle is torque - amplified by an electrically driven mechanism which drives the barbette through direct gearing .
The blisters attached outside of the fuselage turn with the barbette .
They have slots in which the guns move in traverse .
Two standard reflector - type sights are used , one on either side of the fuselage .
Corrections are made to the line of sight by a mechanical vector device , the plane 's speed being set manually .
This whole arrangement of the blister gun-mountings is of considerable interest as the first known enemy attempt to produce a power - controlled armament suitable for small and fast aircraft .
Lots of people consider data centers , those great energy sucking heat producing resource hogs .
Data centers have become the PR battlegrounds for corporate sustainability .
Heads of large corporations have been known to charter jets to inspect operations of data centers and declare their interest in reducing carbon footprints .
This is somewhat overwrought ; that flight may have a larger carbon footprint that savings for a year .
Such posturing is well known ; today , I am writing of IT ’s unsustainable interactions with basic building operations .
I am not concerned today with the workstations left on all night to support overnight patches .
That too is well known .
Besides , any competent IT manager who manages his PCs by policy has had a palliative long ago .
Group policy extensions for energy management have been available for years .
The Windows 2008 server policy extensions make is straightforward to manage workstation energy use .
The rogue data center is one of the more common barriers to more sustainable building operations .
The rogue data center includes the server in the law office supply closet .
On the college campus , it includes the small Beowulf cluster under the post - doc ’s desk .
That post doc may bike to work , with a save - the planet logo on his back pack , but his rogue data center burns energy night and day and requires the building to do so as well .
Rogue data centers prevent any reasonable program of building set - backs .
Set - backs are simply doing in commercial space what a programmable thermostat does at home .
Setbacks program the building to use less energy when unoccupied , but they run afoul of heat from the rogue data center .
At UNC , rogue data centers are revealed after spring break , when even the least controlled buildings are manually set back .
They overheat and their owners are on a rampage …
But even in an environment with better control over policy and server security , the communications closets present a significant challenge to sustainable operation of buildings .
At UNC , most of the buildings have pneumatic controls .
This means they are very reliable at keeping the building at a fixed temperature all of the time .
We are trying several approaches that have recently come to market to let us do setbacks , i.e. , raise the night - time temperature in the summer .
We can put digital radio - controlled thermostats on the walls and turn them down based on a program .
We have had some problems , such as the heater coming on to heat the building up to the new temperature .
It seems that these systems need some more work
We also ran into another problem .
The communications closets in these older buildings get their air conditioning from the rest of the building .
The communications closets are filled network gear that generates a lot of heat .
When the buildings are set back , the equipment in the communications closets overheats .
For now , we are building Rube Goldberg - style work - arounds .
We are putting SNMP temperature sensors in the closets .
When things get to hot , they send alarms to the data center .
The data center can then send a standard message to the building ’s wireless retrofits to cool the building for an hour .
The needs of IT remain a regular hurdle on the road to sustainability .
Dear Mark : How to Stay Healthy in College
College students and healthy lifestyle .
On the one hand it seems like the ultimate contradiction .
Pizza boxes , Red Bull cans , Doritos bags , beer bottles , Captain Crunch at every cafeteria meal .
They ’re as much a cultural vision of college as John Belushi ’s sweatshirt .
If there were a Primal no man ’s land , you ’d think the residential campus experience would at least be a top contender .
Nonetheless , college need n’t be the physical wasteland it ’s made out to be .
And , let ’s be honest : most students do not really live / eat / drink this way .
As many students exercise regularly and eat decently as send their bodies through the wringer during their college careers .
Nonetheless , campus living is its own kind of existence , and it presents its own challenges for maintaining a Primal routine .
Not surprisingly , I get emails from college readers asking for tips on how to live a healthy lifestyle .
Here ’s one :
I love your blog and try to stick to my own modified version of the blueprint whenever possible , but lately I ’ve been finding it a lot harder .
I just started undergrad , and besides having less free time , I ’m finding it harder to eat primal foods and snacks in a dining hall .
Any tips for college students on how to stay primal ?
Any advice would be appreciated .
Thanks for all the great help !
Anna
This is an especially timely subject for me , since my daughter just started college this fall .
She went armed with a few strategies that have served her well , and the transition has taught her to be flexible in making a healthy life for herself .
With some inspiration from her and other friends ’ experiences , here are some tips for our college crowd .
As I always say , let ’s break it down … .
College Dining
The dining hall of course can be a blessing and a curse .
You have ready access to a fairly wide variety of options , and ( let ’s face it ) you do n’t have to prepare anything yourself .
Nonetheless , the majority of cafeteria food is decidedly un -Primal .
You ’ll clearly need to break from the typical patterns ( like those eight glasses of milk so many athletes fill their trays with ) and learn some strategic foraging techniques to scavenge the best in meats and veggies .
( On a side note , you ’ll actually be getting more of your money ’s worth than a student who hits the cereal bins at every meal . )
Get the lay of the land .
Figure out what food lines / stations are the best sources for meats and veggies , your Primal staples of course .
Of course the salad bar will be top on this list , and the main course offerings will usually include some kind of meat dish ( which might need de- bunning or other adaptation ) .
Is there a stir fry station ?
Soup counter ?
Sandwich section with meats you can mix in with a Primal salad ?
Learn to see the stations as less than meal offerings than ingredient sources for your own creative mixing ( e.g. chicken from the stir fry station on a fresh salad )
And do n’t forget the vegetarian section .
Although pasta , soy and rice usually reign supreme here , you can sometimes find a good vegetable stew or side dish .
Get a sense of the weekly patterns in food offerings , and adjust your strategy and anticipated menu accordingly .
Use the suggestion box ( or better yet get to know the director of food services ) .
Do n’t be hesitant about lobbying food service with some of your ideas .
They genuinely want to hear from students , and they ’ll especially love getting health conscious suggestions .
Granted , they have to keep the bottom line in mind , but they ’ll likely at least work out some compromise offerings .
Get out and explore .
Some colleges offer partial board arrangements ( so many meals a week ) or use an account balance that students tap into for each visit to the cafeteria , campus coffee shop , student union “ grill ” or other campus outpost .
This kind of flexibility can allow you to get some grub off campus when you need a break from the dining hall fare .
( Probably any student , Primal or not , could agree with this . )
Check out what the surrounding neighborhood has to offer for a quick bite , or hop on the bus and expand your horizons .
Although it ’s possible to find a good surprise or two at local burger joints , check out ethnic eateries , independent delis and the eclectic hole in the wall type diners .
You ’ll likely find more budget - conscious menus as well as varied food selections .
Create your own collection of off - campus options that you can access when needed .
Keep your own stash .
It could be as simple as a tub of Primal protein bars for the early morning run to your 8:00 class , or it could mean skipping the meal plan entirely if you like to cook for yourself .
Even if you do n’t want to nix the cafeteria all together , keep some basics on hand like fresh fruit , nuts , nut butter , and eggs .
I ’d recommend having a good supplement on hand too .
It can help cover you on compromised days and just add to your overall defenses against stress and the latest bug circulating among the campus population .
Preempt social temptation .
Thursday night pizza , weekend chips and beer , Sunday night pizza .
Am I sensing a pattern here ?
Eat before you head out on the town or to the “ gathering ” in the next dorm over .
Stash your own snack or play host yourself for a small group that does n’t mind your Primal eccentricities .
As for alcohol , of course there are more reasons than the Primal Blueprint to limit or abstain .
Nonetheless , it ’s not a bad reminder .
A few notes on other aspects of campus living …
Exercise
Just about every campus has a decent gym that ’s free to full - time students .
Access is n’t an issue , but time can be .
My daughter likes to go either in between classes in the afternoon ( when she does n’t feel she ’ll be as productive studying ) or early in the evening before she hits the books again .
The key is to find times that consistently work for you and make the date .
As busy as college can be , students are oftentimes derailed by the lack of schedule more than the actual lack of time itself .
It ’s too easy to keep putting things ( like exercise ) off because there ’s so much “ open ” time .
Make the gym ( or local trail / bike path / climbing wall / etc. ) a fixed part of your week .
Nonetheless , make it fun too .
Join an intramural sport or try out a campus yoga class .
Enjoy working out as a break from the daily grind .
Sleep
Just about every college student I ’ve ever met is guilty on this count .
Though you ’re young , you ’re still human like the rest of us .
Staying up late to study , carouse or probe the meaning of existence will eventually catch up with you .
( And , yes , I say this in part from personal experience . )
Not only will you feel like crap physically , you ’ll suffer cognitively .
( So much for late night cramming . )
Your brain ultimately needs sleep to function .
Why would you starve it ?
During sleep your brain catalogs the information it ’s received in a day ( everything from Bio 101 lecture material to social interactions ) .
It helps put together the big picture ( “ All right , maybe my roommate is n’t such an idiot . ” ) and frees up space for new information ( “ Onto the next chapter of organic chemistry . ” ) .
Of course , sleep is also crucial for your immune system .
Do yourself a favor and go to sleep an hour earlier .
( And try to do it in bed instead of slobbering all over your text books . )
It might spare you five days of misery and two missed exams .
Stress
A friend of mine who works in student life at a nearby university absolutely dreads the month of March each year .
The stress finally hits such a high point , she explains , that it ’s like an all out campus melt down .
Campus officials see a spike in roommate conflicts , residence write - ups , campus arrests , counseling usage and health clinic visits .
The real need for spring break , she says , is to get everybody the hell out of the fish bowl for a week .
( Thanksgiving break , she says , offers the same respite during fall semester . )
A combination of academic anxiety , social tension , roommate issues , sleep deprivation and cabin fever is eventually too much .
The wheels just come off the bus .
Of course March and late November are n’t the only times stress reigns on college campuses .
The key to keeping stress manageable is to maintain equilibrium as much as possible .
Keep on top of your work , get enough rest , stay healthy and get off campus now and then .
It ’s a cycle you choose : procrastination leads to cramming , leads to poor sleep , leads to stress .
Alternatively , keeping up allows for a manageable schedule with time for exercise and adequate sleep , which allows for a healthy and sustainable balance that will keep you sane while others are hanging from the rafters gnashing their teeth over midterms .
Not exactly the kind of picture you see in the campus guidebooks now , is it ?
Last but not least , and as you can imagine , I ’d recommend picking up a copy of my new book , The Primal Blueprint , to any new college student .
It contains the framework for a long and healthy life that I wish I would have had 40 years ago .
I know many Mark ’s Daily Apple readers feel likewise .
( If only , right ? … )
Let me know what you do / have done to balance a Primal lifestyle with student life .
And good luck to all of you starting or continuing college this fall .

John Gapper had a good piece in the FT yesterday called “ Goldman should be allowed to fail . ”
His conclusion is that Goldman is allowed to game the system .
It is a broker - dealer masquerading as a bank .
It takes on much more risk than a traditional bank .
It engages in different activities .
It compensates its staff differently as well .
And it is too big to fail .
Gapper says this can not be tolerated .
So , if Goldman Sachs took on more risk when its equity was held by outsiders than with its partners ’ own money , what can we expect now that the government implicitly accepts that it is “ too big to fail ” ?
Goldman has an even bigger incentive to risk other people ’s money .
This is the problem I identified last week , with the most powerful broker - dealer on Wall Street having the same privileges as the most mundane commercial bank .
Not only does the fact that it may pay $ 23bn in bonuses this year upset people , but also its incentives are skewed .
Solving this requires two things to be addressed .
First , Goldman ’s intention to operate as a institutional Wall Street firm – complete with its own hedge and private equity funds – while having government and Fed support .
Second , its tradition of setting aside half its revenues each year for employees .
Gapper also points out about Goldman Sachs is that the firm is very different than the one that went public in 1999 .
Back then sales and trading was only a third of revenue , however by 2006 and 2007 , the fixed income and currency divisions were up to two - thirds of revenue .
This year , in the first nine months , those units have contributed nearly 80 percent of the firm ’s revenue .
In Goldman ’s defense , Gapper admits that the firm is the most partner - like of all the big Wall Street firms .
Goldman probably has one of the most partner - like pay structures for its managing directors .
About two - thirds of bonuses are in restricted stock that vests over four years and its most senior partners have to hold 75 or even 90 per cent of the stock until after they retire .
Gapper does n’t believe that is enough and suggests returning to a system in which 90 % of Managing Directors ’ money is tied up in the firm until retirement .
Now , to be sure , Goldman has a huge cushion of $ 170 billion in cash for events like the ones we witnessed last Fall .
It is commonly considered the best run firm on Wall Street .
But it is still a broker - dealer .
One thing Gapper fails to mention is how a large balance sheet necessarily translates into bigger bonuses .
A lot of people have made the argument that big banks are so big because they benefit from economies of scale in activities like derivatives and they need to compete in cross - border activities .
But , the dirty little secret in corporations is that the larger a company is , the more revenue and profit it makes and this justifies much higher compensation for senior staff .
Imagine for a second you have eight firms on one side with revenue of $ 1 billion and profit of $ 100 million each and one company on the other side that is just as big as the eight collectively with revenue of $ 8 billion and profit of $ 800 million .
Who do you think makes more money , the guy running one of the eight companies or the guy running the large one ?
Size matters not just in economies of scale or competition but in paychecks as well .
In any event , Gapper believes that Goldman should not receive the benefits of the federal reserves discount window unless it is a true deposit - taking institution which carries out a central function that carries responsibilities .
The suggestion is that Goldman should be stripped of its bank holding company status unless it takes on these responsibilities .
And if it gets into difficulty in the future using this same broker - dealer business model , Gapper says Goldman should be allowed to fail .

Although the airline industry remains in a deep slump , airport commissioners on Monday approved $ 1.13 billion in construction contracts to revitalize the primary entry and departure point for overseas travelers at Los Angeles International Airport .
In one of the most visible signs that the modernization of LAX is underway , the Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners awarded two contracts to the Walsh Austin Joint Venture , which will handle the reconfiguration of the Tom Bradley International Terminal .
By early next year , travelers can expect to see construction on two new concourses and gates to accommodate the next generation of large commercial airliners .
The board also set aside almost $ 140 million in contingency funds for the project and approved the sale of more than $ 1.6 billion in revenue bonds to pay for construction and to refinance existing debt .
Advertisement
“ This action is a tremendous step forward , ” said Commissioner Walt Zifkin .
“ Nothing has really happened since 1984 .
Hopefully , it wo n’t take this long to do the next modernization project . ”
Airport officials plan to add 1 million square feet to the Bradley terminal to make room for ticket counters , security checkpoints and passenger lounges as well as expanded customs and immigration facilities .
Restaurants and retail stores will occupy a grand central hall .
The so - called Bradley West project also calls for nine new gates that will handle the latest in large commercial airliners , such the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the giant Airbus A380 , which can be configured to carry more than 800 passengers .
Two of the gates are scheduled to open in early 2012 .
The overall project is expected to be completed by mid-2013 .
Airport officials estimate that the project will employ about 4,000 construction workers .

Except for the current remodeling of the Bradley interior , the terminals have not had any major improvements since the 1984 Summer Olympics .
Over the years , the aging airport has often received poor to average marks by passengers and airlines .
“ The Bradley is the centerpiece of the current modernization program , ” said Gina Marie Lindsey , executive director of Los Angeles World Airports , the operator of LAX .
“ The project will change how the airport looks to passengers and how international passengers arrive and depart .
We are completely redoing the front door . ”
The City Council , which has consistently supported the airport revitalization plan , must approve the Bradley West project before construction can proceed .
A vote will be scheduled in coming weeks .
“ I have been pushing for the modernization in a way that will enhance the experience for passengers and the airlines , ” said Councilwoman Janice Hahn , who has insisted on additional gates at Bradley .
“ This plan does that .
This will make LAX the world - class airport we ’ve wanted . ”

Airport officials are proceeding with the Bradley West project despite a severe national recession and the worst economic downturn in the history of the airline industry .
As a result , major airports around the United States have been delaying expensive improvement projects , and airlines have been canceling and postponing orders for wide - body aircraft .
The latest forecasts by the Boyd Group , an aviation research and consulting firm in Colorado , show that the number of passengers at LAX will decline from about 59 million in 2008 to about 55 million by the end of this year .
The volume is expected to dip to 51 million in 2011 and recover somewhat by 2014 .
The passenger volume at LAX peaked at about 68 million in 2000 .
According to the Airports Council International , LAX has dropped from the sixth - busiest airport in the world in 2008 to the eighth - busiest for the first seven months of this year .
Advertisement
But airport officials say they are planning for the long term and remain optimistic that the project can be financed with revenue bonds .
LAX traditionally has had a good credit rating and a lower amount of debt compared with other major U.S. airports .
To cover the debt payments , Lindsey said , the airport must carefully manage its operations to save money , increase revenue from concessions and parking , push Congress to increase the $ 4.50 passenger facilities charge and gradually raise fees and rents for the airlines .
On average , the airlines now pay more than $ 11 in fees and rent for each passenger who boards a plane at LAX .

Lindsey said that cost could reach almost $ 20 by 2016 to help pay for the project .

GARMSIR , AFGHANISTAN – No one got blown up .
And a few hundred people actually showed up to vote .
So , by that slim measure , election day here has to be considered a success .
This town was packed with Taliban , just last year .
The fear of additional militant attacks is never far off .
American and International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) commanders have put an enormous amount of energy into securing the elections – even though President Hamid Karzai is all - but - guaranteed to be re-elected , most observers believe .
Mounting death tolls are beginning to undermine support for the Afghan war in several countries .
A relatively calm election day gives leaders from Washington to Berlin to Kabul a sign of tangible progress .
The next step is to bring the paper ballots to the provincial capitals , and then to Kabul .
International forces will devote hundreds of helicopters and trucks to bring the ballots in .
They 've even secured 2,500 donkeys to haul in votes from Afghanistan 's most isolated , hardest - to - traverse regions .
It should take two to three weeks for the ballots to be finally counted , ISAF officials estimate .
At Garmsir 's Central School , which combined 11 polling stations into a single election center , Afghan soldiers and cops frisked the turbaned men who came in twos and threes to cast their ballots .
The schoolhouse was never packed with voters – just a slow , steady trickle .
But several of those stations had recorded more than 130 ballots each , by the time this second election day since the 2001 American invasion was over .
One election worker at the Garmsir Central School , Abdul Nabi , was hoping for more at his station — maybe as many as 500 people .
But concerns about Taliban reprisals kept people away .
In the villages surrounding Garmsir , the militants put out the word , in night letters and through informants , that they would punish anyone caught with an ink - stained finger – the tell - tale sign of election participation here .
" If you paint your finger , we will cut your finger off , " they warned , according to Nabi .
Several other poll workers said they heard similar threats .
In 2006 and 2007 , British troops could n't leave their base a few hundred yards from the schoolhouse without coming under attack .
In 2008 , the Marines cleared the city center of militants .
But further to the south , U.S. Marines are still getting into daily firefights with the Taliban .
That made Sher Muhammad 's day … uneventful , to say the least .
He sits by a gravel pile , in the corner of a bombed - out agricultural school .
In front of him is a plastic blue card table , with a pad of legal - sized ballots .
But not a single one of the ballots on Sher Muhammad 's pad has been torn off ; nobody has voted as his table , despite the teams of policemen and troops surrounding the place .
Other tables in this election center , devoted specifically to Kuchi nomads , are a little busier – one has four votes , another has ten .
It 's still not enough to keep the dozen or so men anything better to do than mill around the rubble .
Not a single woman voted at either the Central School or the former agricultural installation .
Nor did I see a single woman on streets today in Garmsir .
I ask Muhammad where they are .
He laughs at me .
Women are " not allowed " to vote , Muhammad says .
" Men are afraid to come .
What do you expect from a woman ? "
Muhammad has a square hat and a whisp of a black beard under his jaw line .
He wears a powder blue overshirt , and a white bib with election boxes on the front .
Muhammad volunteered to have his picture taken ; he seems proud that he participated in the elections .
But the manager of the station asked me not to publish any images of him or any other poll worker ; the Taliban might use the pictures to target reprisals , he said .
So Sher Muhammad and Abdul Nabi went home , anonymous but unharmed in a mostly - uneventful election day .
It was enough .

President Klaus has compared EU institutions to the old Soviet bloc The Eurosceptic Czech President , Vaclav Klaus , says he wants his country to have an exemption from a key EU charter before he will sign the Lisbon Treaty .
Mr Klaus demanded an opt - out from the Charter of Fundamental Rights , similar to opt-outs agreed previously for the UK and Poland .
The demand threatens a further delay over the treaty , correspondents say .
Poland 's president is expected to sign the treaty on Saturday .
That would leave only Mr Klaus still to sign .
Mr Klaus raised fears about possible property claims by Germans expelled from the then Czechoslovakia after World War II .
EU diplomatic pressure On Thursday Mr Klaus had called for a Czech " footnote " to be added to the treaty , without specifying what it was .
He held talks in Prague on Friday with the president of the European Parliament , Jerzy Buzek .
ANALYSIS Gavin Hewitt , BBC News , Brussels
There is an element of farce creeping into the drama of the Czech Republic and the Lisbon Treaty .
We now know what President Klaus 's conditions are for signing the treaty - or rather I think we do .
To start with , he did not intend to reveal his hand today .
He feels he was pushed into it .
The Czech president is clearly irritated that , in his view , the Swedish prime minister disclosed a confidential conversation they had yesterday ...
Read Gavin 's thoughts in full After the meeting , Mr Buzek said " probably it is the same position , the same arrangement as it is now for Poland and Great Britain " - countries which negotiated opt-outs from the EU charter .
The Lisbon Treaty is aimed at streamlining EU institutions , to improve decision - making in the enlarged 27 - nation bloc .
The treaty incorporates the Charter of Fundamental Rights , which covers a wide range of EU citizens ' rights and will become legally binding once Lisbon enters into force .
That cannot happen unless all 27 member states ratify the treaty .
" Before ratification , the Czech Republic must , additionally at least , negotiate a similar exemption , " said Mr Klaus on Friday , quoted by Reuters news agency .
" I believe that this exemption can be resolved quickly . "
He said the charter would " allow ( claimants ) to circumvent Czech courts and place , for example , property claims by people expelled after World War Two directly at the European Court of Justice , " he said .
Czech tensions
Mr Klaus has said previously he will not sign the treaty until the Czech Constitutional Court rules on a new legal complaint against it , lodged by senators allied to him .
LISBON TREATY
Creates new post of EU president ( President of European Council ) New post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs
More decisions by majority vote , rather than unanimity Ratified by all member states except Czech Republic and Poland Only Ireland held referendum on it - twice ( ' Yes ' vote second time )
Took a decade of negotiations
Was intended to take effect in January 2009 The Czech parliament has already approved the treaty .
Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt , current holder of the EU presidency , said on Thursday that Mr Klaus was delivering " the wrong message at the wrong time for the EU " .
France has voiced opposition to Mr Klaus 's demand .
Poland and the UK negotiated opt-outs to ensure that the charter would not override their courts in certain areas of law .
The BBC's Rob Cameron in Prague says Mr Klaus 's announcement is likely to cause deep unease both in the Czech Republic and elsewhere in Europe .
It is the government , not the president , who negotiates international treaties and the Czechs did not ask for an opt - out when the Lisbon Treaty was drawn up , our correspondent says .
Some Czech politicians believe Mr Klaus has now stepped well beyond his constitutional remit .
One party leader said on Friday proceedings to impeach the president should start immediately .

The average British man or woman has indirectly slept with 2.8 million people , according to figures published today .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
An online calculator allows people to work out how many indirect sexual partners they have had based on the " six degrees of separation " theory .
The calculator , which uses data collected from more than 6,000 British adults , is being dubbed Sex Degrees of Separation by Lloydspharmacy , which developed it to raise awareness of sexually - transmitted infections .
People enter the age range of each partner and the calculator works out how many previous sexual partners people in that age range have had on average .
It then repeats the process for five further " generations " of partner to given an overall total .
Clare Kerr , head of sexual health at Lloydspharmacy , said : " When we sleep with someone , we are , in effect , not only sleeping with them , but also their previous partners and their partners ' previous partners , and so on .
" It 's important that people understand how exposed they are to STIs and take appropriate precautions including using condoms and getting themselves checked out where appropriate .
" A simple sexual health check will give both partners in a relationship peace of mind .
" The majority of STIs are easy to rectify , but if left untreated , the long term implications can be very serious . "
On average , British men claim to have directly slept with nine partners each while women say they have had 6.3 partners , giving an overall average of 7.65 , the pharmacy chain said .

Dear Friend of GATA and Gold :
Yesterday GATA 's Washington - area law firm , William J. Olson P.C. of Vienna , Virginia -- http://www.lawandfreedom.com/ -- filed with the Federal Reserve Board an administrative appeal of the Fed 's most recent refusal to grant us access to the agency 's records involving the U.S. gold reserve .
By letter dated August 5 , the Fed reported to us that 137 pages of documents being withheld " contain the following kinds of exempt information : ' trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential ' ( confidential commercial information ) ; and ' inter - agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency ' ( staff memoranda , draft memoranda and letters , and intra- and inter-agency communications ) .
Such information is exempt from disclosure under authority of Exemptions 4 and 5 of the [ Freedom of Information ]
Act , respectively , 5 U.S.C. 552 ( b ) ( 4 ) and ( b ) ( 5 ) . "
We construe this as an admission that the U.S. gold reserve has been put into private hands to some extent or has been compromised in some way by possession by private interests , such as financial houses that trade in gold .
Really , why should any Federal Reserve record involving the national gold reserves be confidential , except perhaps records involving the most ordinary security of the reserve 's vaulting ?
Plainly the Fed has knowledge of something that has been done with the gold reserve that the U.S. government does not want the American people and the financial markets to know .
Further , GATA 's administrative appeal notes , the Fed 's search of its records in response to our request was negligent , insofar as it did not cite at least one document involving gold swaps that is posted and publicly accessible at the Fed 's own Internet site .
That is , it seems that GATA 's lawyers looked harder for the relevant documents than the Fed itself did .
It strikes GATA as remarkable that the financial market commentators who most often disparage suggestions that central banks are intervening surreptitiously as well as openly in the gold market never have tried to put a critical question about gold to any central bank .
Even big financial news organizations have failed to do this when reporting on the gold market .
But if they ever did start asking critical questions , they would have to report that the Fed has some big secrets about gold .
It is more justification for U.S. Rep. Ron Paul 's legislation to audit the Fed .

The law was meant to protect children from explicit DVDs Retailers who sell violent video games and 18 - rated DVDs to children cannot be prosecuted because of a legal blunder 25 years ago .
Dozens of prosecutions under a 1984
Act have been dropped because the government of the day failed to notify the European Commission about the law .
But previous prosecutions will stand , according to the Department for Culture Media and Sport ( DCMS ) .
The Lib Dems said the error had " thrown film censorship into chaos " .
The Video Recordings Act ( VRA ) was brought in by Margaret Thatcher 's government and set down that videos and video games must be classified and age rated by the British Board of Film Classification .
It made it illegal to sell violent video games to children and the most explicit adult films could be sold only in licensed sex shops .
' Unfortunate situation ' Culture Media and Sport Minister Barbara Follett has written to the industry bodies to inform them the act was " no longer enforceable " .
Our legal advice is that those previously prosecuted will be unable to overturn their prosecution or receive financial recompense
DCMS
In her letter , she said : " Unfortunately , the discovery of this omission means that , a quarter of a century later , the VRA is no longer enforceable against individuals in United Kingdom courts . "
Mrs Follett said the government hoped to remedy the " unfortunate situation " as quickly as possible .
She asked the industry bodies to handle the situation with " care and sensitivity " to ensure " minimal " advantage is taken of the loophole .
This must be a massive embarrassment to the Tories
Liberal Democrats
The loophole means no - one can be prosecuted until the law is passed again and that will take three months .
A spokeswoman from the government department said retailers had agreed to keep to the rules on a voluntary basis and previous prosecutions will still stand .
" Our legal advice is that those previously prosecuted will be unable to overturn their prosecution or receive financial recompense , " she said .
' Outrageous ' delay Ministry of Justice figures for 2007 , the latest available , show 87 people were convicted under the act for offences including supplying material which should be sold only in sex shops and selling unclassified work .
The Liberal Democrat 's culture spokesman Don Foster said : " The Conservatives ' incompetence when they were in government has made laws designed to prevent video piracy and protect children from harmful DVDs unenforceable and thrown film censorship into chaos .
" This must be a massive embarrassment to the Tories , especially as David Cameron was the special adviser to the home secretary in 1993 when the law was amended . "
But the shadow culture secretary Jeremy Hunt said it was " outrageous " such an administrative error could go unnoticed for so many years .
" Much of the problem would have been avoided if they had sorted out the classification of video games earlier , as we and many others in the industry have been urging them to do , " he added .
The error was discovered during work on the UK government 's Digital Britain project , which aims to boost broadband and new media in the UK .

This text overlaps with a few of my earlier essays like Why Muslims Like Hitler , but Not Mozart .
I have had some interesting discussions with Ohmyrus , the essayist who runs the Democracy Reform blog .
He is a Chinese man who appreciates aspects of Western civilization that many Westerners have forgotten or rejected .
He is not unique in this regard .
One of the best books about European culture is Defending the West by the former Muslim Ibn Warraq , who was born in the Indian subcontinent .
As a native European it is strange to notice how some ( non-Muslim ) Asians apparently appreciate my civilization more than intellectuals in my own country do .
The Iranian - born ex-Muslim Ali Sina denounces Western Multiculturalism in his book Understanding Muhammad , which I have reviewed online :
“ If any culture needs to be preserved , it is the Western , Helleno - Christian culture .
It is this culture that is facing extinction … .
We owe our freedom and modern civilization to Western culture .
It is this culture that is now under attack and needs protection . ”
Ohmyrus believes , like myself , that the West is in decline , not just in relative terms as a percentage of the global economy or population but in real terms .
He points to structural flaws in our democratic political system , which “ tends to divide people , pitting one race against another and one economic class against another ” and is by the nature of its short election periods not well suited for long - term planning .
European civilization reached its peak when it was pre-democratic , and Muslims have found it easier to penetrate democratic than pre-democratic Europe .
In nineteenth century Britain , Queen Victoria and the aristocracy were not as powerful as their ancestors had been , but they wielded more power than today .
Power was divided between the monarch , the House of Lords and the House of Commons in Parliament .
This corresponds to what ancient political theorists such as Aristotle would have called a good balance between the monarchic , the aristocratic and the democratic elements of society .
Ohmyrus , who is a Christian , believes that one of the reasons why the Scientific Revolution took place in Europe and not in Asia is Christianity , which taught people that God had created the universe according rational laws which could to some extent be discovered and described by humans .
While the West originally enjoyed more free speech and free inquiry than most other societies , in some critical aspects related to immigration , free discourse in the West has in recent years become stifled by ideological censorship .
As he states , “ Anyone suggesting that some races are more intelligent than another is labeled a racist and even threatened prosecution for a hate crime .
Substitute ‘ heretic ’ for ‘ racist ’ and we are almost back in medieval times .
But over here in Asia , there is hardly any problem in discussing it . ”
Ohmyrus thinks that Western civilization is currently living off the cultural capital produced in earlier times when power lay in the hands of a better educated elite whose personal interests coincided with the long term interests of the country .
This may be partly true , but I personally believe that one of the greatest problems facing us today is precisely the fact that the interests of Western nation states do not always overlap with the narrow interests of the elites .
In previous generations , rich and influential individuals would often support nation states not only emotionally but also pragmatically in order to enhance their own wealth and power .
In the age of international organizations and powerful multinational corporations that wield more power than many smaller countries , this is no longer the case .
These same elites will now look to other organizations and tools to further their personal interests and careers .
The democratic system has its flaws but worked to some extent as long as there was sense of being a demos , a people with a shared identity and common ethnic interests .
This is gradually breaking down in Western countries , starting from the top .
Powerful groups frequently have more in common with the elites in other countries than they have with average citizens in their own .
Without a pre-political loyalty , emotional ties or even a pragmatic interest in supporting nation states , the democratic system becomes a vehicle for distributing favors to your friends at home and abroad , for betraying your voters and hopefully ensuring a lucrative international career along the way .
You will have few moral scruples against importing voters from abroad for maintaining power or because your business friends who provide you with financial support desire access to cheap labor .
This process is related to technological globalization but has gone further in the self - loathing West than in any other civilization .
In Western Europe , much of the real power has been transferred to the unelected organs of the European Union .
Between 1999 and 2004 , 84 percent of the legal acts in Germany – and the majority in all EU member states - stemmed from Brussels .
National elections are becoming an increasingly empty ritual .
The important issues have been settled behind closed doors .
Our daily lives are run by a bloated bureaucracy , which is becoming increasingly transnational .
In the eyes of the left - wing American theorist Noam Chomsky , “ The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion , but allow very lively debate within that spectrum . ”
In most Western countries the public has a choice between left - wing candidates who champion mass immigration and “ right - wing ” candidates who also champion mass immigration and implement the left - wing agenda at a slightly slower pace .
This is called “ freedom . ”
The mass media present a biased and ideologically filtered view of the world .
The fact that members of the media and the academia tend to be more , sometimes a lot more , left - leaning politically than the average populace is well - documented .
This situation is intensified by the fact that globalization of communications and transportation , ironically to a large extent created by European and Western inventions , puts severe pressure on our nations in ways which were unthinkable a few generations ago .
When the Christian Gospels were written down at the end of the first century AD , the population of the Roman Empire was maybe 60 million people .
This mirrors the annual population growth in the early twenty - first century .
In other words :
The global population grows by another Roman Empire every single year .
Our system was n’t designed to cope with such numbers .
Virtually all Western countries have lost control over their borders , or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the political elites , substantially aided by multinational corporations and cheaper travel , have deliberately vacated such control .
This is not a sustainable situation .
You can call your political system a democracy , a dictatorship , a republic , a monarchy or whatever you want to , but a country that does not control its territory will eventually die .
I am increasingly supporting the conclusion that the political and economic elites throughout the Western world are cooperating on dismantling their nation states in favor of a new , global world order .
Swamping their countries with immigration is one step in this planned “ creative destruction . ”
Author Bat Ye’or in her well - researched book Eurabia : The Euro - Arab Axis from 2005 documents how the European Union is actively collaborating with the Arabic - Islamic world on promoting Muslim immigration and culture in Europe .
I myself wrote a book entitled Defeating Eurabia while going through her claims , and found them to be sound .
A flaw frequently pointed out in the democratic system is that the “ common man ” is on average not smart enough to run a country , but when it comes to promoting Multiculturalism and mass immigration of alien and often hostile peoples it is in every single Western country the political , economic and academic elites who are pushing for this .
Resistance to these suicidal policies comes from the common man .
Another problem is that in the post - Enlightenment ideological environment , especially after Marxism , there is a tendency among some educated elites to view the common man as a guinea pig for their social experiments .
The West is a non-traditionalist civilization .
We have unquestionably made great advances that no other civilization has done before us , but maybe the price we pay for this is that we also make mistakes that nobody has done before us .
Organized science is a modern Western invention .
Organized national suicide , too , is a modern Western invention .
Our university system once represented a great comparative advantage for Europe vis -à - vis other civilizations .
Today that same system is undermining the very civilization that gave birth to it .
Marxists have essentially completed their Gramscian “ Long March ” through the institutions of the Western world during the second half of the twentieth century , accelerating from the 1960s on with the Western Cultural Revolution .
Young Westerners are at best taught indifference , at worst outright hatred , toward their own cultural heritage and civilization .
The irony in this is that it is precisely the more educated groups who are the most anti-Western ones because they have spent many years absorbing anti-Western teachings .
If you have one brainwashed generation then you have a problem .
If you have two brainwashed generations then you have a very serious problem .
If you have three brainwashed generations then you have a problem that is so big that it becomes difficult to solve , because few in living memory can remember how it was to have a sane worldview .
We are now fast approaching a point where young Westerners , indoctrinated with anti-Western hatred , not only do not receive a correction from their parents , but in many cases not even from their grandparents .
By then we have reached a serious cultural discontinuity .
As much as I personally loathe admitting it , Marxists and other anti-Western forces have been far more successful at staging a slow , “ permanent ” revolution in the West than they ever were at staging an armed revolution .
They have partly succeeded in their goal of eradicating Western civilization from within and are now working hard to physically eradicate the European peoples who created this civilization to ensure that it cannot be rebuilt in the future , either .
They achieved this feat not by gaining control over the means of production but over the means of indoctrination , the mass media and the education system .
Out of all the criticism against Europeans , the claim of “ Eurocentrism ” is the most unfair .
All cultures are ethnocentric to some degree .
Frankly , I would be tempted to say that the default position of mankind is that “ We are the best people , the others are barbarians . ”
I 'm not going to claim that you cannot find serious cases of bigotry in European history .
You can .
But what is unique about Europe is our ability to sometimes transcend this basic human impulse .
Even during the colonial period , Western Europeans could show an unusual degree of curiosity about other cultures and their history .
This is one of the major reasons why archaeology and comparative linguistics were invented by Europeans ; we were one of the least ethnocentric groups , yet for some reason the only ones who are denounced for our alleged ethnocentrism .
The problem is that whites are now the only ethnic group on the planet who are not allowed to retain distinct countries or pride in their heritage .
This is creating a wave of quietly simmering anger against immigration and at least as much against Western authorities , rightly perceived as indifferent or hostile to their interests .
It is debatable whether supporting a “ Christian revival ” is the right solution to this situation since Christianity promotes altruism , self - criticism and universalism , while some of the greatest problems of the white West today are caused by deranged altruism , pathological self - criticism and excessive universalism .
You can successfully track the rise and decline of Western civilization through music .
There are other ways to do this , of course , but music is as good as any , and better than most .
With the likes of Bach , Mozart and Beethoven , it is not bigotry to say that Europeans created some of the greatest music any civilization on this planet has ever done .
During the same time period we also made advances in science and technology that no other civilization had ever done before us .
There appears to be a close correlation between the sciences and the arts .
Perhaps it has something to do with cultural confidence and sense of purpose , or lack of such .
Europeans still made good music in the nineteenth century , but fewer great names were produced in the twentieth .
By the early twenty - first century , many Europeans do n’t even listen to the composers we once had .
The only people who take European Classical music seriously today are East Asians and maybe some people in the eastern half of Europe , the only part of the continent that still looks like Europe .
If you want to see a simple illustration of cultural decline you can listen to basically anything by Mozart and then turn on the TV and see rap stars cursing , doing drugs and bragging about their criminal “ gangster ” lifestyle .
Asians adopt some of the highest cultural achievements of European civilization at a time when many people of European descent themselves appear to be on the verge of forgetting them , which is symbolic on many levels .
On the other hand , Asians are more or less immune to the self - loathing of the contemporary West .
I see this as a sign that they appropriate the best aspects of the Western traditions but stay away from the worst ones , which makes sense .
China had fine instruments and a well - developed musical tradition at least as far back as the Zhou period ( 1122-256 BC ) .
The word “ music ” was written with the same character as “ enjoyment . ”
There is no direct equivalent to Mozart or Beethoven in Asia , but perhaps the fact that they have such an ancient and deeply - rooted native tradition makes in easier for East Asians to appreciate the fruits of other musical cultures .
David P. Goldman , who writes under the pen name “ Spengler ” for the Asia Times Online , thinks that “ The present shift in intellectual capital in favor of the East has no precedent in world history . ”
According to him , European Classical music “ produces better minds , and promotes success in other fields . ”
A high proportion of the students at top Western musical schools are now Koreans , Chinese and Japanese , followed by Eastern Europeans .
There are comparatively few North Americans or Western Europeans among the best instrumentalists .
According to Spengler , “ China has embraced the least Chinese , and the most explicitly Western , of all art forms .
Even the best Chinese musicians still depend on Western mentors .
[ Pianist ]
Lang Lang may be a star , but in some respects he remains an apprentice in the pantheon of Western musicians .
The Chinese , in some ways the most arrogant of peoples , can elicit a deadly kind of humility in matters of learning .
Their eclecticism befits an empire that is determined to succeed , as opposed to a mere nation that needs to console itself by sticking to its supposed cultural roots .
Great empires transcend national culture and naturalize the culture they require . ”
Albert Einstein received a thorough philosophical education by studying Kant , Schopenhauer , Hume and Spinoza in addition to mathematics and the physical theories of Isaac Newton , Michael Faraday and James Maxwell .
This taught him how to think abstractly about space and time .
He was also an enthusiastic amateur musician and would play his violin as a way of thinking through a difficult physics problem .
His mother was an accomplished pianist and pushed for him to take violin lessons .
At first he chafed at the mechanical discipline of the instruction , but after being exposed to Bach and to Mozart ’s sonatas , music became magical to him .
Author Walter Isaacson writes in his biography Einstein : His Life and Universe :
“ ‘ Mozart ’s music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe itself , ’ he later told a friend .
‘ Of course , ’ he added in a remark that reflected his view of math and physics as well as of Mozart , ‘ like all great beauty , his music was pure simplicity . ’
Music was no mere diversion .
On the contrary , it helped him think .
‘ Whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or faced a difficult challenge in his work , ’ said his son Hans Albert , ‘he would take refuge in music and that would solve all his difficulties . ’
The violin thus proved useful during the years he lived alone in Berlin , wrestling with general relativity .
‘ He would often play his violin in his kitchen late at night , improvising melodies while he pondered complicated problems , ’ a friend recalled .
‘ Then , suddenly , in the middle of playing , he would announce excitedly , ‘ I ’ve got it !’
As if by inspiration , the answer to the problem would have come to him in the midst of music . ’
His appreciation for music , and especially for Mozart , may have reflected his feel for the harmony of the universe . ”
Einstein was not as fond of Ludwig van Beethoven as he was of Johann Sebastian Bach , Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Franz Schubert .
According to Walter Isaacson , “ What Einstein appreciated in Mozart and Bach was the clear architectural structure that made their music seem ‘ deterministic ’ and , like his own favorite scientific theories , plucked from the universe rather than composed .
‘ Beethoven created his music , ’ Einstein once said , but ‘ Mozart ’s music is so pure it seems to have been ever - present in the universe . ’
He contrasted Beethoven with Bach : ‘ I feel uncomfortable listening to Beethoven .
I think he is too personal , almost naked .
Give me Bach , rather , and then more Bach . ’
He also admired Schubert for his ‘ superlative ability to express emotion . ’
But in a questionnaire he once filled out , he was critical about other composers in ways that reflect some of his scientific sentiments : Handel had ‘ a certain shallowness ’ ;
Mendelssohn displayed ‘ considerable talent but an indefinable lack of depth that often leads to banality ’ ;
Wagner had a ‘ lack of architectural structure I see as decadence ’ ; and Strauss was ‘ gifted but without inner truth . ’ ”
The Russian ex-pat author Alexander Boot was a philology graduate of Moscow University under the Communist system during the Cold War , lectured on English and American literature and wrote art criticism before getting into trouble with the KGB , the secret police and espionage organization of the Soviet Union .
Boot emigrated to the West in 1973 only to discover that the West that he admired and was seeking no longer existed .
This inspired a life - long quest for an explanation , some of it detailed in his book How the West Was Lost .
Alexander Boot has a deeply Christian way of seeing the world , which I as a non -believer obviously do not always share , but he brings fresh and unusual perspectives to analysis and to history , which can often prove fruitful .
In his view , “ Religion , for all the misdeeds committed by it or in its name , was the foundation on which Westman culture and civilization had been erected .
Destroy the foundation , and down comes the whole structure with a big thud . ”
Boot sees Western history as a prolonged internal struggle between two different beings which he calls Modman and Westman , which Modman eventually won .
Saint Paul was a Roman Christian and the first Westman .
Modman saw himself as close to divine ; Jesus Christ , God as man , had been replaced by Modman as God.
For Modman to become
God the old God had to die first .
Modman followers are introspective because their own self - expression has taken on huge proportions .
Boot traces the development of Western civilization through art and ideas , but especially music since “ nothing illuminates culture as much as music . ”
He argues that you can find the early seeds of some ideological perversions already in Beethoven at the turn of the nineteenth century , post - French Revolution , which did not exist in the compositions of Mozart or Haydn , let alone Bach .
There was a new type of artist : the conscious innovator .
Boot is not saying that music should remain unchanged .
Just like life itself , music cannot remain static .
Bach was not identical to those before him , and Haydn was not like Bach .
With Mozart , Classicism had been taken as far as it could go .
Something new would inevitably develop , but Beethoven pushed the limits in both good and bad ways :
“ Beethoven , a genius though he was , had Modman tendencies and drew not only human but even artistic inspiration from the 1789 - 1815 upheaval in France .
This manifested itself either directly , in pieces like his 3rd Symphony and the 5th Piano Concerto , or indirectly in the bravura finales of many of his other works .
In common with most Modmen , Beethoven believed that the future was knowable , plannable and rationally mouldable , which is why it had to be glorious . ”
Interestingly enough I have heard a few people from former Communist countries state that they do not like Beethoven because they sense some form of ideological megalomania underlying his music .
Personally , I would say that a man who could compose timeless and beautiful pieces of music such as the Moonlight Sonata cannot have been all bad , but it is undoubtedly true that he was not a humble craftsman like Bach was .
Alexander Boot is not claiming that Beethoven produced bad pieces , something a genius like him was incapable of doing , but he made a conscious attempt to break the old forms just for the sake of breaking them , and by doing so paved the way for more destructive personalities of lesser talent :
“ Art began to worship at the altar of subjective originality rather than objective truth .
Yet , until the nineteenth century it had been universally accepted that looking for truth was the real purpose of art .
Because of that , traditional forms had a liberating rather than constricting effect .
The artist could take the canonical foundation of his work as a given and concentrate instead on the higher goal .
As long as truth did emerge , it did not matter to the artist whether he was the first to uncover it or the thousandth .
Westman did not see life as a race , and he was free of the hubristic desire to be original at any cost . ”
This humble respect for tradition did not lead to artistic cloning , as an artist seeking a higher truth can only find a vision of it in his own soul , which means that his vision of truth will always be individual .
He was largely immune to the self - deification of Modman .
According to Boot , “ great music cannot survive in a free - market way while remaining great music ” because “ serious art was not designed , and cannot be produced , for large numbers .
If it is , it stops being serious art . ”
The twentieth century was the age of mass consumers , not the aristocratic patrons who supported Mozart , and “ As audiences became mass - produced , so did performers . ”
Consequently , “ Music had to be downgraded to the status of entertainment – serious entertainment to be sure , but not something meeting any claim to enigmatic nature . ”
Alexander Boot ’s basic conclusion is that the West is dead , but as a Christian man he also believes in resurrection and in life after death .
Perhaps that is not a bad summary .
The economic downturn affects most of us , but churches are in a particularly bad position .
They ’re reliant on tithes / donations , private school tuition fees , and a stable worshiper base .
All of those areas are getting hit hard .
Rachel Zoll explains :
Organized religion was already in trouble before the fall of 2008 .
Denominations were stagnating or shrinking , and congregations across faith groups were fretting about their finances .
The Great Recession made things worse .
It ’s further drained the financial resources of many congregations , seminaries and religious day schools .
Some congregations have disappeared and schools have been closed .
In areas hit hardest by the recession , worshippers have moved away to find jobs , leaving those who remain to minister to communities struggling with rising home foreclosures , unemployment and uncertainty .
If the churches want to survive in this climate , they ’ll have to adapt and change their old ways .
Right …
It does n’t help matters that Americans are trending away from organized religion .
Bad for them , anyway .
Good for the rest of us .
How can non-theists capitalize on this ?
One way is to provide former - churchgoers with a community for them to join — one that offers friendship , a safe place for discussion , and honesty about the world around us .
For so many people , the church is just a means to an end .
They go there because they can’t find that tight - knit community anywhere else , and if religion comes along for the ride , so be it .
This is a tremendous opportunity for us .

Where am I ?

He kept it in a Skoal can on his nightstand for years .

The Republican playbook on disinformation , obstruction , racial hatred , and disruption has n't been working .
In fact , the newest biannual national - wide , state by state polling data from Gallup , shows it 's been backfiring .
I wonder if the Republicans will change their strategy from " stand up and shout to rattle the Democrat whose town hall meeting you are trying to muck up " to " start screaming Obama was born in Kenya or Indonesia or Mexico and start throwing feces at everyone in the room . "
The have plenty to be upset about .
Their hopes to avoid a replay of the 1934 midterm congressional election and to replicate the 1966 midterms that followed the long hot summer of racial explosions and simmering Vietnam tensions , seem to be working out badly for them so far , although Republican candidates in Utah , Wyoming and Idaho have nothing to worry about .
The Gallup survey seeks to gage party affiliation changes in each state .
Earlier today I listened to pieces of an NPR interview with Nancy Miller , the creator and writer of the TV show , which is set in her native Oklahoma City .
I was especially struck by the juxtaposition of two statements that I would n't have thought would come from a Wellesley graduate .
After the Oklahoma City bombing she was happy to imagine that no one would refer to people from her state as " dumb Okies . "
A few seconds later she mentioned that she could n't understand how God could let Timothy McVeigh drive up to the Alfred Murrah Federal Building with a truckful of explosives and blow the place up .
Above I mentioned the three most self - identifying Republicans states in the country .
65 % of the voters in Wyoming cast their ballots for McCain last year ; 63 % did likewise in Utah and the percentage was 61 % in Idaho .
But even in the aftermath of the country 's worst ever right - wing terror attack , Oklahomans voted for the right - wing candidate in greater numbers than anywhere else -- 66 % voted for McCain ( or against Obama ) .
In the newest survey 47 % of Oklahomans claim a Democratic Party identity ( as opposed to 42 % Republican ) .
One 9 states had significant changes since 2008 : Gallup summarizes the data by pointing to a growth in independent voters , most of whom are favoring Democrats and Democratic policies .
" [ T ]he Democratic Party continues to hold a solid advantage in party identification in most states and in the nation as a whole .
While the size of the Democratic advantage at the national level shrunk in recent months , this has been due to an increase in independent identification rather than an increase in Republican support .
That finding is echoed here given that the total number of solid and leaning Republican states remains unchanged from last year .
While the Republican Party is still able to compete in elections if they enjoy greater turnout from their supporters or greater support for its candidates from independent voters , the deck is clearly stacked in the Democratic Party 's favor for now . "
They 're certainly doing a bit better in Alabama .
Somehow they expect their support for Insurance Industry CEOs to save their asses at the polls next year .
Sure , they 'll have lots of money flowing in from special interests but are Americans really going to vote for

Toyota 's Timo Glock will miss the Brazil Grand Prix after suffering a cracked vertebra during qualifying for the race in Japan .
The 27 - year - old German did not compete in Suzuka , but it was thought his injuries were limited to a leg wound .
However , tests revealed he also suffered a back injury in a high - speed crash in the second qualifying session .
Japanese reserve driver Kamui Kobayashi will make his F1 debut as Glock 's replacement in Sunday 's race .
The 23 - year - old stood in for Glock during Friday practice for the Japanese Grand Prix , as the German was suffering from a heavy cold .
Glock was back in the car for qualifying the following day , but he lost control at the final corner of the Suzuka circuit and hit a tyre wall .
606 : DEBATE
Hopefully he 'll make a full recovery in time for Abu Dhabi
hywelkidd
He was stretchered into an ambulance and had stitches in a a five - centimetre cut in his left leg .
" Based on the initial diagnosis , we fully expected Timo to return in Brazil , " said Toyota president John Howett .
" But unfortunately a different injury has been revealed which prevents that .
" He will remain in Germany to recover and we hope he can recuperate in time for Abu Dhabi , although at this stage the situation is not clear . "
Kobayashi competes in the GP2 Series , and joined Toyota as their test driver in 2007 .
He will be the fourth youngest driver on the grid at Interlagos , behind Sebastien Buemi , Jaime Alguersuari and Sebastian Vettel .
Bananas are a staple food for millions across Africa
Food supplies in several African countries are under threat because two diseases are attacking bananas , food scientists have told the BBC .
Crops are being damaged from Angola through to Uganda - including many areas where bananas are a staple food .
Experts are urging farmers to use pesticides or change to a resistant variety of banana where possible .
Scientists have been meeting in Tanzania to decide how to tackle the diseases , which are spread by insects .
' Big danger '
A statement from the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) said " drastic and expensive control measures " were needed .
BANANA DISEASES

These include " completely excavating entire banana fields and treating them with pesticides , or burning the plants " .
Experts say the two diseases - bunchy top viral disease and bacterial wilt - are both spread by insects and very few varieties of banana have resistance to them .
While bunchy top stunts the growth of plants by causing leaves to sprout from the top , bacterial wilt kills off plants and makes their fruit inedible .
Christopher Chemirehreh , of the Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute in Uganda , said people were particularly vulnerable in the areas where the diseases were found .
" It 's a big danger because the affected areas have the banana as their staple crop , " he told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
" So if they fail to control the bacterial wilt , their incomes are affected and their food is affected , so it 's a very big problem . "

Google is facing a major backlash from the Android community after sending a cease - and - desist order to the independent developer behind a popular Android mod .
The controversy reflects some of the licensing challenges that are raised by mobile platforms that incorporate both open and proprietary components .
It also illuminates yet another weak point in Google 's commitment to delivering a truly inclusive and open platform .
Developer Steve Kondik , known by his handle Cyanogen , is an independent Android hacker who builds custom ROM images that users can install on their Android - powered handsets .
His customizations are well - liked and bring significant improvements to the platform .
A growing number of Android enthusiasts contend that the stock platform does n't live up to expectations and that the custom ROM , particularly its performance optimizations , are essential to having a quality Android user experience .
The problem , however , is that the custom ROM ships with Google 's proprietary software components , such as the Android Market and Maps applications .
Third - party developers do not have a license to distribute these components and consequently cannot include them in custom ROMs without committing copyright infringement .
Licensing issues of this nature have always cast a shadow over ROM hacking , but major mobile platform vendors have generally been willing to look the other way because the practice is mostly harmless , largely beneficial to advanced users , and would be very difficult to stop .
Among Windows Mobile enthusiasts , for example , use of " cooked " ROMs is almost ubiquitous and a number of popular forums have emerged across the Internet to provide users and practitioners with a means of collaborating and distributing the custom ROMs .
Google , however , appears to be significantly less permissive on this front than Microsoft .
The company 's legal department objects to the Cyanogen mod on the basis of its inclusion of Google 's proprietary software .
They sent Kondik a cease and desist order compelling him to remove the mod from his Web site .
The Android enthusiast community has responded fiercely , condemning Google for taking a heavy - handed approach .
Even Google 's own Android team appears to be frustrated with the legal department 's zeal .
After the news about the cease and desist broke , Google developer Jean - Baptiste Queru posted a message on Twitter suggesting that he could be pursuing alternate employment opportunities .
Kondik expressed disgust with the entire situation , but has been working with Google to find a reasonable resolution .
He remains optimistic that he can accommodate Google 's requirements and still make his mod available to users .
In a blog entry posted Sunday , he explained how he plans to move forward .
The Cyanogen mod will no longer include Google 's proprietary applications .
Instead , users who have " Google Experience " phones will back up those applications to external media and will restore them after installing the modded ROM .
He is building a special tool to facilitate the backup and restoration process .
" There are lots of things we can do as end - users and modders , though , without violating anyones rights .
Most importantly , we are entitled to back up our software .
Since I do n't work with any of these closed source applications directly , what I intend to do is simply ship the next version of CyanogenMod as a ' bare bones ' ROM , " he wrote .
" You 'll be able to make calls , MMS , take photos , etc .
In order to get our beloved Google sync and applications back , you 'll need to make a backup first .
I 'm working on an application that will do this for you . "
The long - term solution , however , will be to replace Google 's proprietary applications with open source alternatives .
Queru launched a discussion on Google 's Android platform mailing list about the possibility of expanding the scope of the Android open source project and eventually using it as the basis for building an entirely open Android stack .
There is also a separate initiative called the Open Android Alliance which is specifically focusing on building open source equivalents for Google 's applications .
Both of these efforts appear to be constructive and nonconfrontational attempts to make the Android platform better and more open .
Google engineers are actively participating in the discussion and are generally supportive of the goals .
Google 's relationship with the Android development community has been on shaky ground since the start .
Prior to the initial launch of the G1 , the project had a closed development process and the company showed very little regard for the third - party developer community .
The situation improved when Google released the source code following the launch of the G1 , but some friction has remained .
The problem is that Android has fallen short of Google 's original commitment to a fully open platform and open devices on which users would be able to run anything .
Google 's public response to the Cyanogen controversy , posted in the Android developers blog , was somewhat disappointing .
After several paragraphs of self - congratulatory rhetoric about the openness of the platform , Google 's Dan Morrill nebulously declared that " unauthorized distribution of this software harms us just like it would any other business . "
He does n't say how third - party distribution of the software is harmful to Google or why it 's under a proprietary license to begin with in light of the company 's promise of an open platform .
Google is certainly entitled to protect its legal rights and has done exactly that throughout the course of the Cyanogen controversy .
The unfortunate aspect of this incident is that it further demonstrates Google 's unwavering apathy towards the community of third - party developers who are working to make the company 's platform better .
Android had the opportunity to be the open answer to Apple 's walled garden , but instead it 's just a walled garden with a lower wall .
WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Census Bureau on Friday dropped Acorn as a partner for the 2010 Census after two separate hidden - camera videos captured four employees of the community organization giving tax advice on running a brothel to a man posing as an aspiring politician and a woman posing as his girlfriend and a prostitute .
The Census Bureau earlier this year signed up the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now , one of the nation 's largest community groups , as a national partner for the decennial census , a role ...
The barrister told an audience at Edinburgh International Book Festival she believed the church should be “ more positive ” about permitting women to use artificial birth control as a means of regulating their fertility .
A devout Catholic who encouraged her husband , Tony Blair , the former Prime Minister , to convert from Anglicanism after he left office in 2007 , Mrs Blair has previously revealed that she uses contraception and that the couple ’s nine - year - old son Leo was conceived at Balmoral after she neglected to pack contraceptives for a stay with the Queen .
Promoting her new book Speaking for Myself , she said : “ If you look at what progress women have made in the world , one of the reasons they have been able to make progress is because they have been able to control their fertility .
“ I personally do n’t think there is anything wrong with that , and indeed without being able to control that I would n’t have been able to achieve the things that I ’ve been able to do .
“ I think it ’s a really important issue and I would prefer it if the Catholic Church took a more positive attitude towards contraception because I think there ’s a lot of difference between preventing a life coming about and actually extinguishing a life when it has come about . ”
The Catholic Church in Scotland said the barrister was wrong to suggest oral contraception did not “ extinguish ” life .
A spokesman said : “ That is exactly what the morning - after pill does , while the conventional pill can potentially do the same . ”
The church also argues that greater availability of contraception has led to a rise in promiscuity and underage sex .
Last year Pope Benedict XVI launched a strong defence of the 1968 Papal Letter of Human Life , a controversial document written by Pope Paul VI that set out the case against artificial birth control .
The spokesman added that the tide was turning against prioritising a career over family .
He said : “ Increasingly women are finding that postponing or preventing pregnancy to focus on a career leaves them unable to conceive later in life , causing many to suggest that ‘ kids then career ’ might be a more sensible choice than ‘ career then kids ’ . ”
The church warned of four major problems when it reaffirmed its opposition to contraception .
It said that birth control caused a infidelity , a general lowering of moral standards throughout society , a lowering of respect by men towards women and the coercive use of reproductive technologies by governments .
It added that the past 40 years had confirmed the fears .
The church ’s spokesman did not oppose regulating fertility but recommended a natural approach rather than ingesting large doses of synthetic hormones in the form of oral contraceptives that had physical , emotional and environmental side effects .
Mrs Blair was questioned about whether the church ’s position was being upheld , even in its European strongholds .
She replied : “ If you look at the birth rates in France and Italy and Spain it seems as though I might not be the only devout Catholic who likes to control her fertility . ”
A spokesman for the Family Planning Association said : “ It ’s incredibly important that women have safe and convenient access to contraception because it has a big effect on their life .
It ’s also important that women have the choice of all 15 methods of contraception so that they can choose what fits them and their lifestyle best . ”
Mr Blair launched an inter - faith foundation and converted to Catholocism after quitting UK politics .
He was discouraged from discussing religion by his Downing Street press secretary Alastair Campbell , who famously advised him : “ We do n’t do God . ”
I spend a lot of time profiling and optimizing Parrot and Rakudo .
Even though we have added several features to Parrot since the 1.0 release in March and the 1.4 release in July , we 've improved speed and memory use by measurable amounts .
We have n't yet reached the point of powerful , orders - of - magnitude optimizations , but we 're preparing for them .
I 've written before that I believe the single optimization principle for writing a compiler and runtime for a dynamic language is to replace as many aspects of genericity and flexibility with straight - line code as possible .
One optimization from yesterday demonstrates this in a dramatic fashion .
The oofib. pir benchmark exercises method calls and argument passing .
It also creates garbage collectable objects .
It 's a little bit heavy on math operations for a general purpose benchmark , but I like that it performs frequent invocations .
Optimizing those helps almost every real program , as does improving the garbage collector .
I normally perform profiling work with Callgrind .
I 've not found a tool more useful to count raw instruction counts in the processor .
Yesterday I tried Cachegrind instead .
Both tools are usable with the KCachegrind visualizer , making them more useful .
Where Callgrind measures the instructions actually executed , Cachegrind measures the processor cache behavior of the program .
As modern processors are so much faster than memory ( even fast processor caches ) , sometimes it 's worth trading a few cycles for fewer cache misses .
Similarly , as modern processors can have deep pipelines and perform speculative execution , rewriting code to avoid branch mispredictions can have a positive benefit on performance as well .
Branch prediction is a processor feature which analyzes a branch condition -- an if condition , for example -- and predicts where execution will go .
Speculative execution performs the operations of that expected branch even before the processor knows that its prediction is correct .
If it 's guessed correctly , there 's no penalty and a big improvement over having to wait .
If it 's guessed incorrectly , it has to throw away work .
It 's a risk , but it usually guesses correctly .
Sometimes it needs help .
Parrot 's default garbage collector is an optimized - but - clunky stop - the - world mark and sweep collector .
We wanted to replace it with a concurrent collector with better throughput before Parrot 1.0 , but the time and expertise necessary to refactor the internals to make it possible to change the GC without breaking the code for everyone else was a larger investment than we could produce in time for the 1.0 release .
( We 're in much better shape now . )
Our garbage collector tracks two similar - but - different types of objects : STRINGs and PMCs .
Think of a STRING as a chunk of binary data with an encoding and a length and a buffer .
Think of a PMC as an object .
A STRING is a single , self - contained unit .
A PMC may contain attributes which refer to other PMCs .
There are finer distinctions between them , but that 's all you need to understand now .
To simplify our GC , both STRING and PMC have a shared header called PObj .
This structure contains the garbage collector flags : what type of PObj is it ( STRING or PMC ) , is it live or free , does it have a custom mark behavior , does it have custom destruction behavior .
Note that both STRINGs and PMCs share the first two flags , while only PMCs have the latter two .
A stop - the - world mark and sweep collector starts from a root set of objects that the runtime knows are still alive .
It traverses that root set , marking everything as a live and recursing into any PObj reachable from that root set , recursing into any PObj reachable from that set , and so on , until it 's marked the entire graph of reachable objects as alive .
Then it sweeps through the pools containing all allocated objects , freeing anything not marked as live and clearing all flags .
There was a single " mark this PObj as live " function .
Whether we wanted to mark a STRING or a PMC , we called the same function , casting the object into a PObj .
The astute can pause here to say " Yes , of course , you 're throwing away information there ! "
Parrot r41447 added separate functions to mark PMCs and STRINGs as live to let the C compiler tell us if we made any mistakes about what we marked as live .
( We 've had a couple of bugs from expecting the wrong thing . )
My Cachegrind profile showed a huge amount of branch prediction misses in the PObj marking function .
Specifically , the processor could never predict whether it was marking a STRING or a PMC .
As you might expect , marking a STRING as live means only setting a flag , while marking a PMC requires checking if it has custom mark behavior and potentially recursing .
There 's no way to predict which path through the live object graph the mark phase will take , and there 's no way to predict whether the branch predictor will see a run of PMC , PMC , PMC and get on a good train of prediction or whether it'll flip back and forth between PMC , STRING , PMC and continually be wrong .
( The mark phase is deterministic for any code without random allocations , but there 's too much data to predict any pattern . )
As we now had separate functions to mark each , I pulled the guts of the single mark function into the two helper functions ... and reduced the number of branch mispredictions by over 70 % in that benchmark .
For a further optimization , I realized that there 's no need even to call the marking function for STRINGs , at least for code in the core of Parrot which can flip the flag directly .
The end result is a little bit more code -- not much , maybe a dozen lines -- but a huge increase in clarity , an improvement in simplicity , and better optimization and performance characteristics .
The compiler now helps give us warning messages where it matters most ( correctness ) , and we get better performance at a level normal profiling can't even see .
I even have the temptation to call this pattern " Replace Conditional with API . "
Limbaugh will enjoy the scorn .
But he 's a disgusting opportunist and racist .
And his acceptability - indeed total dominance - on the right is one reason decent people will steer clear of the GOP for the foreseeable future .
There is no nuance or doubt here .
This is a man who wants a race war .
Until the GOP throws him out , they deserve oblivion .
He 's a racist through and through , and if no one on the right stands up to this , they are complicit :

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration has decided not to seek legislation to establish a new detention system to hold foreign terrorism suspects , The Washington Post reported on Wednesday .
The administration will instead rely on a 2001 congressional resolution to continue to detain al Qaeda or Taliban suspects indefinitely and without charge , the Post reported , citing administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The administration has concluded that its current , court - tested detention powers are adequate to hold some Guantanamo Bay detainees indefinitely , the report said .
Senior Justice Department officials first told legal advocates and representatives of human rights organizations at a meeting last week that the administration would not pursue new legislation , the newspaper reported .
A Justice Department spokesman told the newspaper that no new ground was broken in the meeting and that the information had been previously provided by the Justice Department to the Senate Armed Services Committee .
Top Democratic lawmakers and rights advocates had signaled opposition to any new indefinite - detention system , arguing that it would expand government powers and undermine the rule of law and U.S. legal traditions , the Post said .
The newspaper said a number of academics and legislators had called for new detention authority legislation that could provide legal backing in cases in which detainees are held without charge .
There are about 229 men still held at the military prison on a U.S. Navy base in Cuba .
The United States has been widely criticized for the detention of suspects there for years without trial .
President Barack Obama has pledged to close the prison by January 2010 .
The facility was opened in 2002 by the Bush administration to house suspected militants in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001 .

Robert Conquest made two great contributions to human knowledge .
As a historian he revealed the truth about Stalin 's purges in the 1930s .
As a writer , he formulated two laws .
His First Law states : " Everybody is reactionary on subjects he knows about . "
I do n't think it is true .
I would say that everyone is a gradualist reformer on subjects they understand .
But Conquest 's Second Law is a good guide to life , and especially politics .
It says : " Every organisation appears to be headed by secret agents of its opponents . "
That is how we should analyse this pre-election party conference season .
The Liberal Democrats had clearly been infiltrated by a Conservative mole with a sense of humour .
What would be funnier , the mole must have thought , than to have the party that wants to abolish property tax and replace it with a local income tax come out for a new tax on more expensive properties ?
The Labour conference was plainly choreographed by Conservative Campaign HQ .
The one thing that united the Conservatives in Manchester last week was their private desire to see Gordon Brown stay as Prime Minister up to the election .
Hence the need for Labour , and Brown , to show resilience , determination and discipline .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The strategy for inflicting maximum damage on Labour 's chances required the Prime Minister to make a good , but not very good , speech , and for everyone to stop talking about the leadership .
Hence Alan Johnson , the Home Secretary , read like a hostage from a script drafted by Andy Coulson , just as conference opened , saying : " I have n't got that real aching desire to lead , which really is an essential quality in a leader . "
It worked a treat .
As the Conservatives converged on Manchester , they must have thought , what could possibly go wrong ?
All we have to do is pretend to come up with some policies so that people do n't say that we are completely vacuous , and David Cameron needs to make a speech that sounds serious .
A good speech – and we know Cameron can do good speeches – would lift the Tories for the final straight and put the election beyond Labour 's reach .
They reckoned without Conquest 's Second Law .
They did not realise that their conference had been planned by a Labour secret agent .
Peter Mandelson , probably .
Thus journalists were obsessed during the first few days with Europe .
The general public is not much interested in the Lisbon Treaty , nor in the precise suspect qualities of the Tories ' Polish and Latvian allies in the European Parliament .
But it gave Boris Johnson the chance to grandstand , and prevented the Conservatives getting their messages across .
Then came the two big speeches of the week , George Osborne 's and Cameron 's ; both of them brilliantly sabotaged by Mandelson .
The Shadow Chancellor proposed to save money in the parliament after next by raising the state pension age more quickly .
It was disclosed to selected journalists the day before the speech , and rather late in the day .
This had two results .
One was that much of the reporting of the plan was wrong , in that it was not until later that we realised that , while men would have to work a year longer from 2016 , women would not be affected until 2020 .
The other was that cynical bystanders such as me assumed that the purpose in briefing the story was to push Boris down the headlines .
Beyond that were two larger puzzles .
One was that the Tories are trying to cut public spending at the expense , particularly , of people on lower incomes – contradicting their claim to compassionate conservatism .
The other was that it wo n't save any money before the election after next , so it is not only damaging with low - income voters but need not be announced now .
Then there was the double agent 's triumph : the leader 's speech .
Cameron has excelled at this before .
Indeed , legend holds that he won the leadership of his party by delivering the speech of his life at the beauty - contest conference in Blackpool in 2005 .
Legend also has it that he stopped Gordon Brown calling a snap election in 2007 by making the speech of his life , the walk - and - talk performance when the text was engraved on the inside of his eyeballs .
Given that this was an odd - numbered year , therefore , it was time for Cameron to make – well , Anthony Seldon spelt it out a month ago in The Daily Telegraph : " Cameron 's speech at the party conference in early October must be the most important speech of his life . "
Last week was not , therefore , the time to come up with a dud .
Which is what he did .
I did n't like him watching his daughter skip across the playground on her first day at school .
I thought it was unwise to say : " I want every child to have the chances I had . "
As someone was bound to comment , that is going to cost a fortune in tailcoats .
When he said : " I am not a complicated person , " I thought it was n't for him to say .
I may not be the best person to judge , because I do not really like the big conference set - piece as an art form .
Despite my slavish admiration for a former prime minister , I never liked even his overwrought rhetorical presentations .
But nobody seems to have enthused about Cameron 's speech on Thursday .
That means that Cameron is the big loser from the conference season .
He was the leader with the chance to move up a gear ; with a media willing him to do it and an electorate ready to listen .
And what did he have to say ?
Big government bad ; health visitors good ; Labour has n't done enough to reverse the inequality of the Thatcher years .
He blew it .
And that means that it is not all over yet .
The really important polls last week were those showing Labour doing better against the Conservatives than Brown does against Cameron .
That means that , despite Alan Johnson 's modesty and David Miliband 's gawkiness , it is still worth Labour changing its leader .
That is what the Tories fear .
They need to be 11 or 12 points ahead in their share of the vote to win a majority in the House of Commons .
I do not believe that Labour can get that close under Gordon Brown , but could do so under another leader .

Seniors benefit more from regular walking sessions with shelter dogs than from scheduled walks with friends or a spouse .
That 's the finding from a study to be reported at the annual conference of the International Society for Anthrozoology that begins today in Kansas City .
PAW PRINT POST : Your dog might be your best workout buddy
In 12 weeks , the dog - walking seniors , ages 74 to 87 , showed significant increases in walking speed , balance and confidence , important markers for older adults to avoid the " downward spiral " that occurs when they walk less , lose lower - body strength and isolate themselves socially , says the study 's author , University of Missouri professor Rebecca Johnson , director of the Research Center for Human - Animal Interaction .
The group assigned to walk with another person five days a week , the same frequency as the dog walkers , did not do as well .
The reasons the dog walkers fared better , Johnson says : People in their 70s and 80s are devoted to volunteering , and the notion that " there was a dog that needed them " prompted them to arrive unfailingly for the walks .
But those who walked with others engaged in " discouragement of each other , " she says .
If the weather was n't good or one person was n't feeling well , they would decide to shorten the walk or not walk at all .
Seniors could benefit greatly if shelters organized dog- walking programs for senior , she says .
September 7 , 2009 – When a white cop handcuffed a black professor outside his own home we had a beer summit in the name of better race relations .
That summit addressed the number one social problem in this country since 1619 ( the date the first African slaves were sold in the U.S. )
I ’m calling for a marijuana summit .
This summit will benefit the health of millions , while saving hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars .
The federal government must concur with what we the people already know .
In the Obama Transition Team ’s own on - line poll , respondents overwhelmingly selected legalizing marijuana as our country ’s number one priority .
This May , even a Zogby poll commissioned by the conservative O’Leary Report , found 52 percent of American voters in favor and only 37 percent opposed to legalizing ( and taxing ) marijuana .
I call on Gil Kerlikowske , director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , to have a frank discussion with doctors and researchers on medical cannabis and the efficacy of various routes of administration .
Sadly , Kerlikowske seems to be using the same illogic as his predecessors in the drug office .
He recently cited a University of Washington treatment program as the information source for his position that cannabis is bad stuff .
Why ?
Because people who had a choice between treatment and going to jail chose treatment .
Duh .
I am disappointed in Kerlikowske .
I expect more from a former Seattle police chief and Obama appointee .
The chief administrative law judge of the Food and Drug Administration , in a 1988 decision , found that cannabis is one of the safest therapeutic agents known to man .
The FDA in 2005 said that liquid marijuana ( Sativex ) is safe enough to test on humans , cancer patients in fact .
The government needs to look at the types of cancers that cannabis has been shown to treat .
Chief Kerlikowske has said he wants to hear from the doctors on this .
When he does he ’ll find that we have a national organization , the American Academy of Cannabinoid Medicine , which will give him the real dope on the medical utility of cannabis .
We can tell him of the benefits that our patients have received .
I have incredible , compelling stories .
There is the 85 - year - old ex-Marine cancer survivor who was dying from starvation and used cannabis as an appetite stimulant and mood elevator .
The 26 - year - old .
hemiplegic woman with intractable epilepsy that was well controlled by cannabis .
The Vietnam vet who got surgery to remove shrapnel , due to intractable seizures , and as a result of the surgery got double vision and headaches .
Cannabis allows him to productively participate in civic affairs .
And the examples go on and on , including paraplegics with intractable pain , patients successfully treated for gastrophoresis , post - traumatic stress disorder , cyclic vomiting syndrome .
I ’ll tell him about the productive lives of my patients .
They include the principal of a high school , the mayor of a small city , a deputy sheriff , an assistant DA , a counselor at a drug treatment program , a very famous movie director , and lots of people with everyday jobs in construction , medicine , education — contractors , developers , doctors , nurses , professors .
Kerlikowske has tried to mitigate his earlier statements by saying he only meant smoked marijuana .
He was recently quoted as saying that “ the FDA has not determined that smoked marijuana has a value , and this is clearly a medical question that should be answered by the medical community . ”
Speaking as the vice president of the AACM , let me assure the drug czar that cannabis is medicine whether smoked , vaporized , sprayed sublingually , dropped sublingually , drunk in beverages , made into tea , eaten , or used topically .
Kerlikowske is wise to say he will listen to the doctors .
If he had a medical background I do n’t believe he would say it ’s okay to have intractable seizures , excruciating migraines , phantom limb pain , or to suffer with the symptoms of Crohn ’s Disease , or to die of malnutrition .
Like thousands of American physicians , he would see the medical efficacy of cannabis .
I have literally hundreds of patients with those conditions and a thousand more with chronic pain , cancer , and failed back syndrome who have benefited from the medicinal use of cannabis , smoked or otherwise .
The Drug Czar is on a listening tour .
Let ’s give him an earful .
It is not marijuana that is dangerous , but the laws which restrict research on it and make it difficult for people to use it therapeutically .
That is real risky .
We need to get the federal government out of the way , to honor the 9th and 10th Amendments to the Constitution limiting the federal government ’s authority , and to affirm that the 1925 Linder decision — recognizing the right of states to regulate the practice of medicine — still means something .
It is time for the drug czar to listen to America .
It is time for the marijuana summit .

Warren Buffett tops the list of the biggest losers among America 's richest billionaires , with an estimated $ 10 billion drop in his personal wealth over the past twelve months .
That 's the result of Berkshire Hathaway 's 20 percent stock decline .
But Buffett 's remaining $ 40 billion is still enough to maintain his number two ranking on the just - released annual Forbes 400 ranking of the country 's wealthiest people .
Microsoft founder Bill Gates , Buffett 's friend and bridge partner , also kept his # 1 position , with an estimated $ 50 billion .
That 's down $ 7 billion from last year .
They 're not alone .
Forbes says the collective net worth of the nation 's 400 richest fell from $ 1.57 trillion to $ 1.27 trillion over the year .
It 's only the fifth time that 's happened .
Gov. Dean appeared on the Dr. Nancy show this morning , and reiterated a point that polling released last week demonstrated .
SNYDERMAN : Let 's start with a recent NYT / CBS poll that showed that 65 percent of people in fact are in favor of a public option .
If 65 percent of Americans are in favor , and Congress seems to be balking , where 's the disconnect ?
DEAN : I think part of it is that the health insurance companies are giving millions of dollars to some Senators and that puts them in a difficult place .
That gives them a conflict beteween what their constituencies want and what the insurance companies that are paying their campaign money want .
And that 's part of the problem .
Look , this is a very simple thing , this public option .
It 's basically , you ought to think of it as allowing people to buy into Medicare who are under 65 .
It 's a good program , it works better -- the cost controls are much better than they are in the private sector and it makes a lot of sense .
Without a public option , this is really a waste of time and money .
To put $ 60 billion every year of the public 's money into the health insurance business is really crazy , and I think there 's going to be a huge backlash against that if that 's what they do .
If they do n't have some kind of public option with Medicare buy - in or whatever , I think this is not going to be a healthcare reform bill and there 's going to be an enormous backlash against the Democrats .

As world leaders struggle to hash out a new global climate deal by December , they face a hurdle perhaps more formidable than getting big polluters like the United States and China to reduce greenhouse gas emissions : how to pay for the new accord .
The price tag for a new climate agreement will be a staggering $ 100 billion a year by 2020 , many economists estimate ; some put the cost at closer to $ 1 trillion .
That money is needed to help fast - developing countries like India and Brazil convert to costly but cleaner technologies as they industrialize , as well as to assist the poorest countries in coping with the consequences of climate change , like droughts and rising seas .
This financing is an essential part of any international climate agreement , negotiators and scientists say , because developing nations must curb the growth of their emissions if the world is to limit rising temperatures .
Based on calculations by the International Energy Agency for 2005 to 2030 , 75 percent of the growth in energy demand will come from the developing world .
Many developing countries have made it clear that they will not sign a treaty unless they get money to help them adapt to a warmer planet .
Acknowledging that a new treaty needs unanimity for success , industrialized nations like the United States and those in Europe have agreed in principle to make such payments ; they have already been written into the agreed - upon structure of the treaty , to be signed in Copenhagen in December .
House approves Patriot Act renewal Approval sends measure to Bush 's desk before expiration RELATED YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Senate Acts of terror Harry Reid Russell Feingold or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Congress on Tuesday renewed controversial provisions of the USA Patriot Act , the 2001 law passed weeks after the September 11 attacks to help the government investigate and capture possible terrorists .
The approval in the House of Representatives , by a vote of 280 - 138 , sent the measure to President Bush for his signature .
The Senate last week voted 89 - 10 to approve the compromise package , which covers 16 provisions in the act that are set to expire on March 10 .
" At last the Patriot Act will be reauthorized .
And it 's about time , " Sen .
Jon Kyl , an Arizona Republican , said after last week 's vote .
" It will make America more secure , and that 's the bottom line . "
Three provisions of the renewed act would be reviewed in four years ; the other provisions are permanent .
" Law enforcement officials and the intelligence community will not have to guess what the law will be .
They will have the tools to fight terrorism , " Kyl said .
A version of the reauthorization bill was passed by the House last year .
But in December , Senate GOP leaders were unable to muster the 60 votes required under Senate rules to break a filibuster blocking the measure .
The filibuster was supported by most Democrats and a handful of Republicans , who insisted more changes in the bill were needed to protect civil liberties .
On Tuesday , Republicans voted in favor of the measures 214 - 13 ; among Democrats , 66 voted for the renewal , and 124 voted against it .
One Independent voted against renewal .
Some critics of the final legislation contended that it gives too much power to the executive branch .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich , an Ohio Democrat who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004 , voted against the act in 2001 and said he was " even more opposed " to the renewal .
" I rise in strong opposition to this legislation because it offers only a superficial reform that will have little if any impact on safeguarding our civil liberties , " Kucinich said in House debate , according to his Web site .
" Congress has failed to do its job as a coequal branch of government , " he said .
" The administration 's attack on our democracy has to be reigned in . "
President Bush , along with top Justice Department and FBI officials , lobbied hard for renewal of the act , calling it a vital tool in the battle against terrorism .
" I applaud the Senate for voting to renew the Patriot Act and overcoming the partisan attempts to block its passage , " Bush said last week from New Delhi , India .
" The terrorists have not lost the will or the ability to attack us .
...
This bill will allow our law enforcement officials to continue to use the same tools against terrorists that are already used against drug dealers and other criminals , while safeguarding the civil liberties of the American people . "
Bush 's statements were echoed by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
" The legislation provides additional tools for protecting mass transportation systems and seaports from attack ; takes steps to combat the methamphetamine epidemic that is sweeping our country ; and closes dangerous loopholes in our ability to prevent terrorist financing , " he said .
The measure also would create a National Security Division at the Department of Justice , he said .
Among the more controversial provisions are the " roving wiretap " portion and the " sneak and peek " section .
The first allows the government to get a wiretap on every phone a suspect uses , while the second allows federal investigators to get access to library , business and medical records without a court order .
Facing a filibuster led by Sen. Russ Feingold , a Wisconsin Democrat , the Senate compromise approved last week somewhat limits the government 's power to compel information from people targeted in terror investigations .
Senators agreed to exempt most libraries from secret demands for information and to limit a " gag rule " on other businesses that receive those demands .
( Full story )
The provisions approved by Congress initially were to have expired at the end of 2005 .
Lawmakers extended them on a temporary basis twice , most recently through March 10 .

The waggle dance performed by a returning bee lucky enough to have found a source of food is a miraculous bit of social evolution , but it does fall down when the food is inside the hive like this .
It 's an incredible thing to watch .
The dancing bee who has found food more than 100 metres or so away will describe a figure of eight on the comb , with a waggling walk in the centre of the movement .
A waggle while moving straight up the comb on which the bee and its audience stand means that the food can be found by flying towards the sun .
A waggle straight down the comb means that it is away from the sun , and diagonal waggles describe all points in between .
It ’s tough when your nice picture is ruined by a horny animal .
There ’s some part of human nature that really makes us laugh when attempted sexiness crashes and burns .
Well , I ’d like to amend that for today ’s ( similar ) list .
There ’s also some part of human nature that just loves watching animals do stuff in public that we only do in private .
It ’s why the video of the monkey scratching his ass then falling is one of the most famous clips in Internet history .
For today ’s list , I compiled 11 great photos of people that were messed up ( or , let ’s be honest , for our purposes , they were exponentially improved ) by animals doing nasty stuff in the background .
1 | That ’s a long fall
I ’m worried about purple shirt girl .
That ’s a solid 10 - foot fall , all because this elephant could n’t wait to bone .
I tore my ACL playing adult kickball .
Because of that , for the past eight months , I ’ve had to tell people I tore my ACL during a kickball game .
I ’m 30 years old .
The relevance ?
If that girl breaks her arm or worse on the fall , she has to spend the next year - plus telling people she got injured when her elephant safari- raped another elephant .
And all of a sudden my adult kickball injury does n’t look so strange .
2 | The dog is thirsty
On the bright side , all I can look at is the dog drinking out of the toilet and not those hideous tattoos of … jellyfish ?
butterflies ?
a miniature boxer celebrating a victory ?
an eye ? all of the above ?
3 | Dog humps trophy , rifle unharmed
My favorite part of this photo is that the guy appears to be trying to drag the dead buck away from his horny dog .
Once that dog is lodged in there , dragging the deer is n’t going to get him to stop .
You ’re just going to give him a bumpy ride which ’ll enhance his experience !
It ’s essentially the interspecies necrophilia equivalent of putting a quarter in a vibrating bed .
4 | A little captain in ’em
I do n’t blame the humping dog — there are so many pale white thighs being thrown around , he just pounced on the nearest pair .
5 | This might ’ve been in my ruined sexy photos list but , ya know …
After looking at this photo for a few minutes , I ’m realizing that if she just rotated like 15 more degrees , she and the dog would be in the exact same pose .
6 | Just keep looking at the camera , just keep looking at the camera
That ’s the danger of taking photos of rhinos .
They ’re so damn horny .
( The Mayor of Pun City is BACK !
Go ahead and bag on that pun .
I ’ve got a thick skin . )
7 | Real estate website mistake
I actually had this photo in an old list .
It ’s apparently from a real estate website that wanted to show off this living room … but did n’t realize there was some interracial dog sex going on in the background .
At least it distracts from the only - kinda - matching couch and chair , right ?
8 | Dogs do what dogs do
This guy ’s just getting into character .
Somewhere , this scene makes Adam Morrison weep .
9 | I gotta piss like a race horse
Best part of this photo ?
That it looks like the dog is panting and eager to run over to the stream .
x | Oh that ai n’t right
It ’s bad that this photo features a guy seemingly going to town on a deer in the background .
It ’s worse that that made me wonder whether that guy gave the leftmost deer carcass in the foreground a glory hole .
11 | The chimp ’s way too forward
I ’m not sure if this is a sign of evolution or de-evolution .

The news comes a day after rival bank JPMorgan disclosed it is on track to hand out bonuses totalling $ 29bn this year and will further ignite the debate about pay and incentives in the City , which many politicians argue helped caused the crisis that tipped the world into recession .
Marshall Auerback here .
I want to add a few thoughts on the situation in Latvia which Ed has highlighted on several occasions .
His allusion to Argentina to describe the situation in the Baltics last July was on the money .
I have a solution here out of the Argentine playbook .
In Latvia , the neo-liberal insanity continues .
The EU and IMF have told the government to borrow foreign currency to stabilize the exchange rate to help real estate debtors pay the foreign - currency mortgages taken out from Swedish and other banks to fuel its property bubble , raise taxes , and sharply cut back public spending on education , health care and other basic needs to “ absorb ” income .
Higher taxes are to lower import demand and also domestic prices , as if this automatically will make output more competitive in export markets .
But Latvia does n’t produce much to export .
The Baltic States have not put in place much production capacity since gaining independence in 1991 .
Latvia , like other post - Soviet economies , has scant domestic output to export .
Industry throughout the former Soviet Union was torn up and scrapped in the 1990s .
( Welcome to victorious finance capitalism , Western - style . )
What they had was real estate and public infrastructure free of debt – and hence , available to be pledged as collateral for loans to finance their imports .
Ever since its independence from Russia in 1991 , Latvia has paid for its imported consumer goods and other purchases by borrowing mortgage credit in foreign currency from Scandinavian and other banks .
The effect has been one of the world ’s biggest property bubbles – in an economy with no means of breaking even except by loading down its real estate with more and more debt .
In practice the loans took the form of mortgage borrowing from foreign banks to finance a real estate bubble – and their import dependency on foreign suppliers .
So instead of helping it and other post - Soviet nations develop self - reliant economies , the West has viewed them as economic oysters to be broken up to indebt them in order to extract interest charges and capital gains , leaving them empty shells .
The sad part about this whole episode is that Latvia ’s problems could be fixed over a weekend .
Here ’s what I would do :
Drop the peg to the euro , which functionally acts like an gold standard external constraint .
Do n’t answer the phone when the foreign creditors call the government .
Have the banks declared insolvent , convert their external debt to equity , and then have them reopen that way on Monday with full deposit insurance guaranteed in the now free floating local currency .
Enact a 0 % rate policy ( use fiscal policy to regulate demand going forward ) .
Offer a local currency minimum wage job that includes healthcare to anyone willing and able to work as was done in Argentina after the Kirchner regime repudiated the IMF ’s toxic package of debt repayment .
Full employment and economic prosperity would come in no time at all .
The last line is the key .
Improve employment and aggregate incomes and demand follows – as does creditWORTHINESS .
At the final stage , credit will follow .
Even a banker can figure that one out .
This advertisement asks you to imagine what these simple block formations mean .
Using shadows , they tell us that it ’s simply our imagination that makes these blocks come alive and , that through our experience , we can see anything through them .
Did you notice that the background colors were chosen to signify the sea ( blue ) or land ( green ) ?
Or that the airplane is hovering while the other three blocks are set firmly on the ground ?
Advertising does n’t get as simple ( or as meaningful ) as this .
january wants to go to the Chili ’s near the H Gates .
She loves the queso there .
Loves it even though it does n’t always come in one of those little cast - iron skillets like at regular Chili ’s and they do n’t have a “ red beer ” ( beer and tomato juice ) here like she ’s seen at the franchise ’s other midwestern outlets .
It does n’t matter that the place is noisy and crowded and the only TV is tucked way up behind the bar and she probably wo n’t be able to catch the last preseason Bears game .
The queso ’s _that _good .
While we wait for a table , she explains that she also feels a bit of nostalgia for this particular O’Hare branch of the chain :
She passes through here a lot when taking time off from acting — traveling home , say , to her parents ’ house in Des Moines around the holidays .
So it ’s fitting that she ’s here tonight , fresh from taping Oprah with Mad Men co-star Jon Hamm and at the beginning of a Labor Day break from shooting the series ’ third season .
The two of us are headed back to Los Angeles on a seven - thirty flight .
“ I ’m on vacation , ” she says as she navigates a beat - up old Nike - brand roller bag through the crowd of overstuffed patrons .
“ It ’s time to relax . ”
We order our queso and beers , and she proceeds to do exactly that .
Jones still has her Oprah makeup on and is wearing dark jeans , boots , and a skintight black top — the kind of outfit almost conspicuous in its intent not to draw attention , but no one notices her .
She curls deep into the corner of our booth , and we talk aimlessly , first about football ( “ My screen saver is a photo of me with Peyton and Eli at the Kentucky Derby ” ) and then about the constant ups and downs of her career .
“ It was great when it blew up at Cannes , ” she says of the film she ’s most proud of , The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada , directed by Tommy Lee Jones ( no relation ) .
“ But everyone thought it was a nepotism thing .
There was one journalist who asked , ‘ How is it , being directed by your father ? ’ ”
The conversation is easy , funny , and familiar , but also strange , because it ’s so damn un -Betty - Draper - like .
Jones has been around Hollywood for a decade and has had her share of memorable small performances in big films , but nothing that ’s come close to the cultural icon that is Mrs.
Draper , a character that ’s become an obsessive fixation of , and bold provocation to , male desire .
Jones has managed to occupy the character so seamlessly and convincingly that it ’s almost a career liability .
“ I ’d never really played a mom or a wife before , ” she says , “ and all of a sudden I ’m getting all these lonely mom and wife offers .
I do n’t want to get stuck . ”
But she ’s not too worried about it .
First , the emotionally inhibited ’60s housewife is such a specific role .
“ It ’s not like being on _Friends _or something , ” she says .
And being identified so strongly with her character is , in a way , a testament to the quality of her work .
Jones proudly tells the story of Jack Nicholson , with whom she acted in 2003 ’s Anger Management , having watched nearly the entire first season of the show without realizing that she was Betty Draper .
“ That was pretty awesome , ” she says of getting the call from Nicholson .
It was a kind of vindication , especially since not everyone in Hollywood has always been so positive .
“ The guy I was dating when I first got to L.A. was _not _supportive of my acting , ” she says .
“ He was like , I do n’t think you ’re going to be good at this .
So — fuck you !
He only has nice things to say now — if anything , I should thank him .
Because the minute you tell me I can’t do something , that ’s when I ’m most motivated . ”

WASHINGTON , Oct 16 ( Reuters ) -
An investigation into fraud in Afghanistan 's election has cut President Hamid Karzai 's vote tally to about 47 percent , a result that will trigger a runoff , the Washington Post reported on Friday .
Citing officials familiar with the results , the newspaper said the tally by the independent Electoral Complaints Commission was due to be finalized on Friday .
Preliminary election results issued on Tuesday gave Karzai more than 54 percent of valid votes tallied , putting him above the 50 percent threshold needed to avoid a runoff with his closest rival , former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah .
But Afghanistan 's ambassador in Washington , Said Jawad , said on Thursday that a second round of voting was " likely , " the Post reported .
In a New York Times interview published on Thursday , the ambassador said Karzai 's government was preparing for the electoral commission to announce on Saturday a runoff was necessary .
Citing a U.S. official in Afghanistan , the Post reported that ballots listing both Karzai and Abdullah Abdullah were printed in London in anticipation of a runoff and have arrived at the United Nations ' mission in Kabul .
The inconclusive August election , where widespread fraud was reported , is a factor in the Obama administration 's current review of its strategy in Afghanistan .
General Stanley McChrystal , the top U.S. and NATO commander in Afghanistan , has recommended deploying an additional 40,000 U.S. troops , beyond the 68,000 due to be in place by the end of this year .

The Hard Rock Cafe , last weekend at Vegas , showcased a Huge MultiTouch screen and some interactive in - booth experiences , some Surface tables .
It is probably the highest resolution interactive display outside of the military : Obscura Digital ’s newest , longest multitouch wall , uses three projectors to handle 100 hi-res images and videos simultaneously in realtime .
Watch it in Action :
The display is the world ’s highest resolution interactive display available to the public .
The basics are 3 HD projectors behind an 18 foot multi - touch wall .
The difference here is that the whole thing is one 6000 ( it is actually 3×1920 projectors ) pixel plate , with over 100 4 K - 6 K images / videos being displayed at one time . .
Also unique is the way it scales across GPUs seamlessly .
The display intelligently allocates room for up to 6 users , but if only one or two are using it , they each get half .
if a third steps in , the workspace is dynamically allocated .
Users can search by genre of music , type of item , year , type of music and location of the actual piece of memorabilia .

Chinese citizens and government workers have been preparing for months for their upcoming celebration of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the People 's Republic of China on October 1st .
Parts of Beijing have been shut down several times , allowing for rehearsals of a once - in - a - decade military parade , multiple artistic performances and shows , fireworks and more .
Security concerns are high as well , bringing out large details of security personnel and equipment .

But Michael Moore never let Wolf reach his punchline .
Michael Moore ’s response , which begins at 1:53 into the interview , is instantly - classic , petard - hoisting material .
First , he objects to Wolf ’s contention that anybody dislikes him .
He then challenges his tacky and uninspired host to provide him with the names of anyone who does , and he graciously offers to cook that person dinner .
Wolf , tenacious chum - seeker that he is , wo n’t let the strawman go and insists , " there are a few . "
He proceeds to call Michael a hypocrite , and Michael duly turns Wolf ’s idiotic question right back at him :
Why am I against capitalism if I ’ve done so well ?
Should n’t the question be better put — I ’m not trying to do your job for you — but would n’t the question better be , " gee Mike , you ’ve done so well , why do n’t you just kick back at the lake and enjoy your life .
Why do you care about people losing their healthcare and their jobs and all that ... you ’re not losing yours ... I wonder if there was a Wolf Blitzer 200 years ago who asked Thomas Jefferson or John Adams or George Washington , ‘hey , you know , you guys are wealthy land owners ... "
At that moment , I put myself in Wolf ’s shoes , and I thought to myself , " I really need to retire before I lose my final shred of dignity ... wait , that was my final shred of dignity ! "
Michael Moore continued for several more minutes without mercy , but I ’m not going to spoil the rest — watch the video before Wolf ’s goons take it down :

The new Narita Express train , NEX E259 , is due to start service on Oct 1 , 2009 .
When I got off the Yamanote train at Shinagawa station yesterday , I saw them practising the coupling of the train .
When the train is in operation the two parts of the service , one coming from Yokohama and the other coming from Shinjuku , get joined up at Tokyo station .
I took some video of the coupling practice session .
Not sure how many times a day they practice this , but I bet they cant wait for Oct 1 to roll around .
Here is the first section where the train comes into the platform .
after stopping for a short while , the train then moves forward the remaining few feet to dock with the other carriages before leaving for the airport .
There were quite a few people snapping photos at the station .
The front section of the train makes quite an impact .

Feminist Law Prof Maya Manian ( USF ) has posted to SSRN her article , “ The Irrational Woman : Informed Consent and Abortion Decision - Making . ” which appears in the Duke Journal of Gender Law & Policy .
Here is the abstract :
In Gonzales v. Carhart , the Supreme Court upheld a federal ban on a type of second - trimester abortion that many physicians believe is safer for their patients .
Carhart presented a watershed moment in abortion law , because it marks the Supreme Court ’s first use of the anti-abortion movement ’s ” woman - protective ” rationale to uphold a ban on abortion and the first time since Roe v.
Wade that the Court denied women a health exception to an abortion restriction .
The woman - protective rationale asserts that banning abortion promotes women ’s mental health .
According to Carhart , the State should make the final decisions about pregnant women ’s healthcare , because the State knows better than the woman herself that her ” ultimate ” role is as a mother .
Carhart ‘s woman - protective reasoning has pernicious and far reaching implications for gender equity in healthcare .
This Article critiques the woman - protective anti-abortion argument from the perspective of healthcare law .
It compares women ’s healthcare decision - making under abortion law to patient decision - making under more general law .
This Article is the first to demonstrate that the woman - protective argument against abortion is an anomaly in the law ’s treatment of patient healthcare decision - making .
It argues that the denial of pregnant women ’s decision - making capacity in abortion law unjustifiably diverges from the law ’s respect for patient decision - making capacity in both the tort law doctrine of informed consent and in constitutional law cases governing medical decision - making .
In contrast to both private and public law on patient decision - making , abortion law treats competent adult women as incompetent to make decisions about their own healthcare .
That abortion law treats women as poorer decision - makers bolsters the claim that sex discrimination underlies abortion regulations .
The full paper is available here .

This talk describes how to view live heap structures in Haskell , including sharing and unboxing information , and then to use insights on the representation of data to improve the performance and space , for the first time , of uniform polymorphic data types by changing their representation .
We ’ll use associated data types to guide regular optimizations of polymorphic structures .
The library described in this talk is available on hackage , along with the visualization tool used to build it .
There ’s also a screencast of the visualization tool in use .
This talk was originally presented at WG2.8 in Frauenchiemsee , Germany in June 2009 .
I stumbled across this video in one of my RSS feeds .
Honestly , it is difficult to believe that people like this still exist .
It is embarrassing .
It just goes to show you that religion — in the worst sense of the word — is still alive and well .
Frankly , it makes it that much more difficult to communicate the true nature of Jesus to the world .
If you ca n’t see this video in your RSS reader or email , then click here
David Wilcox , maybe my favorite singer - songwriter , captures this in his song called “ Good Man ” from the album Vista .
It says ,
Let me apologize in advance
For the way my friend behaves
He ’ll pick a fight and take a holy stance
He ’s so proud that he ’s so saved I hope you do n’t judge Jesus
By the things my friend will say
He holds a bible like a dagger
And he twists it just that way He just loves conversation — like a cat loves a bird
I guess he ’s always been a good man — in the worst sense of the word
The good knights went out to save the day
In the age of the crusades
A sharp sword on a tortured soul
They were sure the point was made
Any tool can be a weapon
If it ’s used with that intent
The devil ’s great at quoting scripture
And confusing what it meant
So all the evils done for Jesus — it is a history so absurd
But there will always be a good man — in the worst sense of the word
They ‘ jacked a plane to make a sneak attack
They were trained to die in flames
Their last words were to God above
Just to praise
His holy name For all the terror and destruction
They felt no sense of shame
You gotta wonder why religion
Can make people so insane
But their devotion was unquestioned — follow straight and never swerve
The devil always needs a good man — in the worst sense of the word ”
This is the first thing I thought of when I saw the video above .
By the way , David ’s new album , “ Open Hand ” is fabulous .
I highly recommend it .
Question :
Do you distinguish between “ religion ” and true faith ?
Do people like those in the video embarrass you ?

C# 4.0 introduces the dynamic type into the language .
The language will ship in Visual Studio 2010 .
Once a variable is declared as having type dynamic , operations on these value are not done or verified at compile time , but instead happen entirely at runtime .
Marek has been working on Mono's C# 4 implementation and it is coming along nicely .
Zoltan wrote a small " PInvoke " dynamic class using Mono's C# compiler that allows you to call C library methods like this :
dynamic d = new PInvoke ( " libc " ) ; d.printf ( " I have been clicked %d times " , times ) ;
In this case " printf " is resolved at runtime to be a method in the " libc " library .
This is similar to Python 's ctype library in about 70 lines of C# leveraging LINQ Expression , the Dynamic Language Runtime and C# 's dynamic :
The code is :
using System ; using System .
Dynamic ; using System .

Mono's C# 4 compiler so far implements optional parameters , named parameters , has support for the new covariant and contravariant specifiers and the dynamic keyword is evolving very quickly ( as shown by the example above ) .
If you want to test drive Mono 's C# 4.0 compiler , you need Mono from Git and you must pass the " - - enable - profile4=yes " argument .
Once you do this , the new compiler will be installed as dmcs on your system .

A close encounter with a kangaroo has left a far north Queensland psychologist a little jumpy .
Suzanne Habib was sitting at her desk in Atherton when the 1.5 - metre marsupial came through the front door .
Dr Habib says confusion reigned .
" I called out , ' there 's a kangaroo in my office ' , " she said .
" But then just as I called that out a couple of young guys just ran in off the street , and I thought it was their kangaroo , so I started yelling at them to get their kangaroo out of my office .
" Then I realised it was n't their kangaroo ; they had seen it come into my office and they had come to help me get it out . "
The kangaroo eventually found its way out of Dr Habib 's office .
Well , it 's been a long time coming , but I have FINALLY finished my Tetris dress , and here it is .
Here 's the back ( with iPhoto enhancement — the colors are n't really that bright ) :
Here 's the bodice , so you can see the contrast facing ( these colors are truer , too ) :
It 's just in time , too , as I 'm talking at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco today ( about Wordnik , naturally ! ) , and I hate giving a talk without a new dress .
There 's something about sewing that makes it easier to think out talks … by the way , the talk will be STREAMED LIVE ( ulp ) at 3 pm PDT , so if you want to hear me talk , tune in !
( Warning : I am shorter in real life than I am on the blog . )
If you like this dress , would you do me a favor and tweet / Facebook / delicious the link around ?
I 'm having a personal - best contest to see if this one shows up in more places than the Darth Vader dress !
UPDATED TO ADD : Thanks to Jenny at ChronicallyUncool , the Tetris fabric is now available at Spoonflower !
Even better , Jenny 's donating her percentage from the sale of this fabric to FIRST , a nonprofit that encourages kids to explore technology .

BANGKOK , Thailand —
Little is real in Patpong , a glowing bazaar and sex district here in Bangkok .
The Gucci is fake , the DVDs are pirated and the go - go girls tell every man he ’s handsome .
Drugs too are sold here openly .
Not speed or cocaine , but Viagra — or at least diamond - shaped , blue pills that resemble the real thing .
After dark , one aging female vendor displays dingy Viagra boxes at her stall to attract customers .
When a man shows interest , she dispatches a teenage runner to retrieve the pills from a secret location nearby .
The price : $ 6 per tablet , $ 4 cheaper than the average U.S. cost .
“ You want it ? ” asks the runner .
“ It ’s a good price . ”
It ’s likely too good to be true .
Counterfeit pharmaceuticals are widespread in Southeast Asia , sold for cheap on the street or in rural mom-and - pop markets .
Though Viagra is one of the most common knock - offs , it ’s much less worrisome than fake meds to fight malaria , tuberculosis and even HIV .
They often contain little or no active ingredient .
The result : Sickness , fatalities and a host of drug - resistant viruses .
“ It might contain the correct active ingredient , but the wrong dose .
Or it might contain nothing at all , ” said Clemence Gautier , consultant at the Bangkok - based law firm Tilleke & Gibbins .
The firm specializes in prosecuting counterfeiters for clients that include pharmaceutical firms Pfizer , Novartis and GlaxoSmithKline .
Thai customs police , trained by Tilleke & Gibbins to spot fakes , often set aside boxes of seized goods for the attorneys to inspect and share with clients .
Their stash amounts to 3,500 - plus knock offs , many of which look astonishingly real .
Along with convincing bottles of Stolichnaya vodka , Casio calculators and even a working motorbike — all counterfeit — raids turn up a lot of fake medicine .
The packages of “ Throatsil ” and faux - Viagra tablets stamped with the letters “ VAG ” are easy to spot .
Many others are n’t .
“ The counterfeiters are quite good at what they do , ” Gautier says .
“ All the way down to the holograms on the box . ”
The scope of counterfeit meds is difficult to gauge .
But the World Health Organization has said that , in the worst - affected parts of Southeast Asia , as many as 30 percent of pharmaceuticals are lacking the stated active ingredient .
This covers outright fakes , expired meds and even pills made improperly by well - meaning but barely regulated factories .
About 77 percent of bad meds are produced in China , according to GlaxoSmithKline .
Just this week , a Chinese national was arrested in Bangkok with nearly $ 450,000 worth of Viagra knock - offs and sex toys , which are also illegal to buy or sell in Thailand .
“ You see counterfeits coming out of Pakistan , India , China but you can have local production in any country , ” said Chris Raymond , a Southeast Asia project coordinator for U.S. Pharmacopeia , a non-profit that monitors drug quality .
“ It does n’t take a huge operation , ” he says .
“ You could do it in an apartment easily . ”
Among the biggest threats from bogus medicine is its potential to fortify viruses and create drug - resistant strains of malaria , tuberculosis or other infectious diseases .
This happens when shoddy vaccines lack enough active ingredient to kill off all the pathogens in a person ’s body .
Only the most potent germs remain — and become extremely difficult to treat .
Experts believe underground malaria meds have helped give rise to particularly vicious malaria strains around the Thai - Cambodia border .
The war against fake meds is partially backed with U.S. tax money .
Since 2003 , U.S. Pharmacopeia has maintained about 45 “ sentinel ” sites to vet out counterfeit drugs throughout Southeast Asia , work that relies on $ 25 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development .
The sites , which use secret shoppers and field kits , are focused on drugs that treat malaria , tuberculosis and other fatal diseases .
Though Viagra is one of the region ’s most counterfeited drugs , Raymond says , counterfeit antibiotics are the bigger concern .
“ Most rural farmers in provincial Laos are not getting a hold of fake Viagra , ” Raymond says .
“ But they are getting a hold of fake antibiotics and fake anti-malarials . ”
Cheap , counterfeit medicines are particularly attractive to the farming poor , who often buy from rural pharmacies .
Consumers may be aware it ’s a knock - off , Raymond says , but believe the pill has some effectiveness .
Even though the legit drugs are cheap by Western standards , the difference in cents is considerable in places such as Cambodia .
“ We ’re not talking about designer drugs for cancer , ” he says .
“ We ’re talking about really cheap pharmaceuticals that have been in their generic form for years .
But counterfeiters still have a financial incentive , even if they can undercut the competition by a couple of cents . ”

The congressional legislation intended to defund ACORN , passed with broad bipartisan support , is written so broadly that it applies to " any organization " that has been charged with breaking federal or state election laws , lobbying disclosure laws , campaign finance laws or filing fraudulent paperwork with any federal or state agency .
It also applies to any of the employees , contractors or other folks affiliated with a group charged with any of those things .
In other words , the bill could plausibly defund the entire military - industrial complex .
Whoops .
Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) picked up on the legislative overreach and asked the Project on Government Oversight ( POGO ) to sift through its database to find which contractors might be caught in the ACORN net .
Lockheed Martin and Northrop Gumman both popped up quickly , with 20 fraud cases between them , and the longer list is a Who 's Who of weapons manufacturers and defense contractors .
The language was written by the GOP and filed as a " motion to recommit " in the House , where it passed 345 - 75 .
POGO is reaching out to its members to identify other companies who have engaged in the type of misconduct that would make them ineligible for federal funds .
Grayson then intends to file that list in the legislative history that goes along with the bill so that judges can reference it when determining whether a company should be denied federal funds .
There is ‘ big bore ’ and then there is the 2 bore .
Schroeder & Hetzendorfer make a cartridge called the S&H 2 Bore Blackpowder Express .
These photos are amazing
.700 nitro express next to 2 bore and 3500 grain bronze solid
.500 S&W , .45-70 , .700 Nitro Express , 2 bore
The caliber equivalent of 2 bore ( ‘ bore ’ is generally interchangeable with ‘ gauge ’ in regard to caliber ) is 1.326 ″ or 33.68 mm !
The bronze solid bullet weights 3500 grain / 1/2 pound / 226.80 grams !
While technically fired from a rifle these are more like massive shotgun slugs : a heavy projectile at a low velocity .
The 2500 grain bronze solid leaves the barrel at 1500 ft/s and with 17487 ft·lb of energy .
Apart from the nerve destroying recoil , heavy rifle , heavy ammo and expense these big bullets slow down dramatically after entering the game and hitting bone .
A problem when hunting elephant .
They even come bigger than this .
The 1 bore has a caliber of 1.67 ″ .
The A Guage / Bore , about 2 ″ , was used for punt guns .
More info at Schroeder & Hetzendorfer .
ACE has an interesting article on the 4 bore .
UPDATE
Jay Schroeder emailed me the pricing for for the brass and bullets :
Cartridge Cases are $ 495.00 per 10 pack shipped .
Copper FN Solids are $ 295.00 per 10 pack shipped .
All components are USA made by Americans from American material .
Although it may seem expensive , you are probably not going to purchase more than one set of brass .

DRUNKEN lovers put on a steamy sex show in broad daylight - in a police station car park .
Ross Welsh and lesbian Leanne Richardson got so carried away they did n't know the public and cops were watching .
Officers based in Portobello , Edinburgh , finally had to pull Welsh , 30 , away from Richardson , 26 .
A worried member of the public reported a " naked man " before officers caught the pair performing a sex act in a car .
Welsh met Richardson while on a four - day bender to celebrate his birthday .
And despite their passion , she yesterday claimed Welsh was never her type - because she has a live - in girlfriend .
She added : " I admitted having my trousers and underwear down .
It was him that was trying it on with me .
" I did n't know him and I have n't seen him since - other than court . "
At Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday , they were both fined £ 200 after admitting a sexual breach of the peace .
Dev Kapadia , prosecuting , told the court the pair , both from Edinburgh , were caught at 4.10 pm on April 21 .
He said a woman alerted officers and when they turned into the car park , they saw a pair of naked legs - and Welsh performing a sex act .
Mr Kapadia added : " The officers asked Mr Welsh to stop but he appeared not to hear , upon which they gently pulled the accused away from Miss Richardson .
Unaware " At this point , Miss Richardson , who had her eyes closed , suddenly realised police officers were present and got to her feet and pulled up her clothing .
" The police officers indicated that both accused had been drinking and were blissfully unaware that their actions had been observed . "
Richardson 's solicitor , Nigel Bruce , said the mum - of - two had been going through a period of depression and had turned to drink .
Welsh 's lawyer , David Taylor , said : " He is obviously mortified to find himself in court at all and doubly so given the nature of the case . "
Sheriff Fiona Reith , QC , said the incident was on the " lower end of the scale " and decided not to put them on the sex offenders ' register .
Last night , Richardson revealed she was in a longterm relationship with girlfriend Josephine Samuel , 49 .
She said she gave up on men after her previous partner - who she would n't name - died and she met Josephine last year .
The pair now share a flat in Leith and Josephine insisted she has already forgiven her lover for her indiscretion .
Leanne said : " It is no secret I am gay .
After my ex-partner died I said I would never be with another guy again , then I met Josephine .
" Josephine is my partner , she is a pretty woman and I would never do anything to hurt her . "
Josephine said : " It does n't matter what has happened , we will sort things out - I have forgiven her . "

Part 2 of article
Shinui ’s election success and the fact it delivered on its promise and enabled the formation of a government without haredi parties was a traumatic event for the haredim .
For the first time , they discovered the great anger they stir and also suffered its consequences :
The Ministry of Religious Affairs was shut down , funds earmarked to yeshivas were limited , and child allowances returned to normalcy .
Part 1
We ’re coming back soon Yair Lapid Secular Israelis becoming increasingly fed up with haredi recklessness
We ’re coming back soon
There is no haredi family that was not hurt by this , and for a moment it appeared that a quiet revolution was getting underway ( manifested mostly by women joining the workforce ) that will culminate with better integration into Israeli society .
However , they forgot quickly .
Less than four years passed since Shinui ’s dissipation , and everything is back to the way it used to be .
Shas and Agudat Israeli are again enjoying the perks of power , the Religious Affairs Ministry was reestablished , and the haredi courts abuses converts , as usual .
Meanwhile , Eli Yishai sends embarrassing letters to the president , Ethiopian children are kept out of religious schools because of shocking racism , and members of the Eda Haredit sect launch a series of violent protests in the streets of Jerusalem – first directed against the hospitals that treat them and welfare services that help them , and later in a bid to force seculars to park on the sidewalk rather than in a parking lot .
Just like in the previous round , the haredim are going too far because they believe no reaction will be forthcoming .
The seculars appear to them as too weak , too indifferent , and too spoiled ; the haredim think the seculars do n’t really care .
Just like in the previous round , they ’re wrong .
Last week I spoke with former Interior Minister Avraham Poraz who told me that his mailbox has also been bombarded in recent months with “ when are you coming back ? ” emails .
Poraz is a wise man , who observes developments with the thin smile of a man who already saw everything .
“ The haredim prompted the establishment of Shulamit Aloni ’s party the same way , ” he said .
“ They always calm down for a few years , and then start over again , and every time they encounter a harsher reaction .
I wonder when they ’ll learn the lesson . ”
This op - ed is not written by an interested party .
At best , it represents the views of a protestor .
If there are any haredim out there who are reading this , they should know that they can still avert the establishment of the next Shinui .
I am not arguing , heaven forbid , that they must avoid struggles over issues that are important to them .
This is the right of every citizen in a democratic state .
However , should they continue in the current path – and mostly in the current style – they should not be surprised to see the establishments of the next secular party .
They are establishing it with their own hands .
Following my thinking about the fact that functional testing was the dividing barrier between specialized developer and tester roles , I found in the book “ Agile Testing ” by Lisa Crispin and Janet Gregory an excellent list of fears that QA teams could express against agile adoption :
“ Testers cling to the concept of an independent QA team for many reasons , but the main reason is fear , specifically :
* Fear that they will lose their QA identity
* Fear that if they report to a development manager , they will loose support and programmers will get priority
* Fear that they lack the skills to work in an agile team and will lose their jobs
* Fear that when they ’re dispersed into development teams they wo n’t get the support they need
* Fear that they , and their managers , will get lost in the new organizations
We often hear of QA managers asking questions such as “ My company is implementing agile development .
How does my role fit in ? ” .
This is directly related to the “ loss of identity ” fears . ”

So historically accurate IT ’S PRACTICALLY A DOCUMENTARY !
- Babbage lists some of the annoying questions he got asked about his engines here .
He ascribes the question about the wrong numbers sometimes to ‘ ladies ’ and sometimes to ‘ members of Parliament ’ ; having lost count of the number of times I ’ve explained to people that I can still be an animator even though ‘ it ’s all done with computers now ’
I have no problem believing this was asked more than once .
– Charles Babbage ’s many friends spent a lot of time kicking him in the shins , because every once in a while he seems to have enjoyed setting his career on fire in order to watch the pretty flames .
His friend Herschel said he should be ‘ slapped in the face ’ for Dear Royal Society of Really Important People : You Are All Corrupt Idiots ! ; I particularly like the dedication - “ I was going to dedicate this to some guy but now he ’s frantically backpedalling for some reason ! ”
Oh Babbage .
Babbage !
What are you doing ?
You are CAUSING PAIN to even your devoted friends at The Chemical Record !
By the way that review is excellent ( I say that as a devoted Babbage fanatic ) , read in conjunction with Babbage ’s Guide to the Exposition of 1851 it gives a good overview of the state of scientific societies at the time .
If you ’re into that sort of thing , I do n’t know .
It also gives a glimpse into what the placards in the Science Museum call Babbage ’s ‘ personality issues ’ .
– “ The important thing is not what they think of me , but what I think of them . ”
I know Victoria ’s font is really annoying but it ’s actually called “ The King and Queen Font ” so I had to use it .
Just this once .
– The debugging crowbar is the actual crowbar used to debug the Difference Engine rebuild !
- You can see the woven portrait of Jacquard in the background there , whose punchcard loom inspired Babbage with the idea for the Analytical Engine .
– Ladies and Gentlemen , The Cheese Story .
It ’s kiiind of like Flatland , but with .. more … cheese .
Charles Babbage , what is that doing in your autobiography ?
As Babbage was a famous raconteur , and his autobiography is full of his greatest hits , I guess he had a good reaction to it at some point .. maybe it ’s all in the timing .
I ’ve got a lot more notes , but they ’ll go on part 3 ..
I ’ve drawn most of it so should it should n’t too long coming .
Apologies are despicable and excuses more so , but in addition to the whole Giant Monsters thing I ’ve been concurrently working on another commission .
You may ask yourself , “ what could possibly equal BBC Techlab in coolness ? ” OMG I ’m not worthy !!

Two big forces in the world of VoIP are coming together in a new solution called Skype for Asterisk ( SfA ) .
The SfA solution , which entered general availability this week , combines the open source Asterisk VoIP PBX with the Skype VoIP network , providing benefits to both Skype and Asterisk users .
SfA comes at critical time for Skype , as eBay ( NASDAY : EBAY ) divests itself of majority ownership in its Internet phone unit .
While ownership is changing , usage of Skype continues to grow , with 405 million users at the end of 2008 .
" SfA is an add - on channel driver for Asterisk that leverages the power of Asterisk to route calls through the Skype community , " Peter Engler , Digium 's product manager for strategic products , told InternetNews.com .
" A soft phone or hard phone would connect to an Asterisk PBX and the call routing in Asterisk would determine the route of a call , which could be over Skype , to a traditional providers service or any other avenue the administrator sets .
All Skype features work transparently with soft phones being SIP or IAX clients . "
Asterisk is a popular open source VoIP PBX that has been making waves in the market since its 1.0 release in 2004 .
The SfA solutions work with open source Asterisk versions 1.4 and 1.6 as well as the freely available AsteriskNOW application that includes a GUI and the Linux operating system .
Commercial users of the Asterisk Business Edition will also be able to benefit from SfA .
Not all Asterisk users will be able to use SfA , however .
Engler noted that SfA is not yet available for Asterisk hardware users on either the Digium AA50 or the 3Com branded versions .
The Switchvox unified communication system , which uses Asterisk and is own by Digium , the lead commercial sponsor behind Asterisk , is not yet supported either .
Engler said that Switchvox integration is on the roadmap , but a specific release timeframe has not been announced .
Asterisk itself is open source , but SfA is not .
" SfA is not open source due to the inclusion of proprietary Skype binaries and libraries , " Engler said .
Digium has been talking about SfA since at least February of this year , and the product had an open public beta in August .
Engler said that close to 4,000 people signed up for the beta trial over the course of three beta phases .
The first phase was a small group of testers , the next group was close to 100 , followed by the open beta .
" The open beta allowed the 4,000 that signed up to try and report on SfA , of which close to 1,000 activated their license keys , " Engler said .
The beta users will pay $ 66 through the Digium Web store to get the full solution , Engler said .
While there were some challenges in getting Skype and Asterisk to work together , Engler said the teams from Digium and Skype worked well together to develop SfA , and with the assistance of beta testers , challenges were overcome relatively fast .
" The collaboration continues between Digium and Skype on the next release of SfA to add additional features , " Engler said .
" We are working and listening to our customers for these new features and priorities .
Work will continue with the same Digium and Skype teams to bring SfA to the next level of functionality and solving problems for businesses . "
The pending eBay Skype sale is not going to change the SfA roadmap either .
" The Skype sale from eBay does not affect Digium or SfA in any way , " Engler said .
" SfA is part of the Skype for Business portfolio of products , and the relationship will continue once Skype is an independent company . "
The Definitive Guide to Acing Your Schedule

Peer Pressure
In the summer of 2000 , a Dartmouth economist named Bruce Sacerdote published a paper titled Peer Effects in Randomly Assigned Roommates .
His premise was interesting : Incoming students at Dartmouth are assigned to rooms at random .
He knew , therefore , that when two roommates first arrive on campus , their behavior should have no more in common than any other pair of students .
Sacerdote ’s insight was to wait until the end of the year and then look for traits that roommates had become more likely to share than random pairs .
The idea was that these shared traits would be due to the roommates ’ influence on each others ’ behavior .
Sacerdote found that for some behaviors , such as major choice , roommates did n’t affect each other .
But for one trait in particular , GPA , they had a lot in common .
He attributed this finding to a simple idea : students ’ study habits are heavily influenced by their peers .
It ’s important that you recognize this reality , because these peer influences shape more than you might imagine about your own habits .
Like a pair of behavioral blinders , carefully slipped into place without you noticing , peer influence may have prevented you from seeing a variety of radical strategies that could greatly simplify your student life .
In this post , I want to describe one such strategy …
The Definitive Guide to Acing Your Schedule
Studying for a class starts out as a crap - shoot .
Until your first exam ( and , more importantly , your first post - exam post - mortem ) you have to take a random stab on how best to prepare .
Or do you ?
One of the “ laws ” that emerges from peer - influenced study habit formation is that you must attack each course by yourself .
Sure , you can bitch with other students in the same class , and maybe perform the occasional group study session , but in the end , it ’s you alone battling the mysterious forces of your professor and his capricious whims .
Here ’s the thing , it does n’t have to be this way .
Consider the following simple strategy for improving your performance in given course :
Setup a separate chat with your professor , your TA , and a student who took the same course in a previous semester .
In each chat session , ask the same question :
If you were to write an advice guide about doing incredibly well in this class , what would the chapters be ?
It takes around an hour to complete this exercise .
But it ’s results are near magical .
Gone is the guesswork about notetaking , reading , and how best to review .
In its place is specific advice that is tuned to the specific challenge you face .
You ’d have to be a real slacker not to do well with this treasure map in hand .
Yet almost no student does this …
With this in mind , I hope the advice in this post serves two purposes .
First , it ’s a great way to do better as a student ; so try it .
Second , and perhaps more important , it can act as a gateway that helps you move beyond the blinders of peer influence , and start seeking your own approach to mastering the college experience .
The most effective strategies for improving your student life are often also the simplest .
You just need the ability to see them .

There has been enough interest that I think we can formally declare Rota ’s Basis Conjecture to be Polymath 12 .
I am told that it is standard Polymath practice to start a new blog post whenever the number of comments reaches about 100 , and we have reached that point , so that is one reason I am writing a second post at this time .
I am also told that sometimes , separate “ discussion ” and “ research ” threads are created ; I ’m not seeing an immediate need for such a separation yet , and so I am not going to state a rule that comments of one type belong under the original post whereas comments of some other type belong under this new post .
I will just say that if you are in doubt , I recommend posting new comments under this post rather than the old one , but if common sense clearly says that your comment belongs under the old post then you should use common sense .
The other reason to create a new post is to take stock of where we are and perhaps suggest some ways to go forward .
Let me emphasize that the list below is not comprehensive , but is meant only to summarize the comments so far and to throw in a few ideas of my own .
Assuming this project continues to gather steam , the plan is to populate the associated Polymath Wiki page with a more comprehensive list of references and statements of partial results .
If you have an idea that does not seem to fit into any of the categories below , please consider that to be an invitation to leave a comment about your idea , not an indication that it is not of interest !
Matroids with No Small Circuits
I want to start with an idea that I mentioned in my MathOverflow post but not in my previous Polymath Blog post .
I think it is very promising , and I do n’t think many people have looked at it .
Geelen and Humphries proved that Rota ’s Basis Conjecture is true for paving matroids .
In the case of vector spaces , what this means is that they proved the conjecture in the case where every ( n – 1 ) - element subset of the given set of n2 vectors is linearly independent .
It is natural to ask if n – 1 can be reduced to n – 2 .
I have not digested the Geelen–Humphries paper so I do not know how easy or hard this might be , but it certainly could not hurt to have more people study this paper and make an attempt to extend its results .
If an oracle were to tell me that Rota ’s Basis Conjecture has a 10 - page proof and were to ask me what I thought the method was , then at this point in time I would guess that the proof proceeds by induction on the size of the smallest circuit .
Even if I am totally wrong , I think we will definitely learn something by understanding exactly why this approach cannot be extended .
Independent Partial Transversals
Let me now review the progress on the three ideas I mentioned in my first blog post .
In Idea 1 , I asked if the n2 vectors could be partitioned into at most 2n – 2 independent partial transversals .
A nice proof that the answer is yes was given by domotorp .
Eli Berger then made a comment that suggested that the topological methods of Aharoni and Berger could push this bound lower , but there was either an error in his suggestion or we misunderstood it .
It would be good to get this point clarified .
I should also mention that Aharoni mentioned to me offline that he unfortunately could not participate actively in Polymath but that he did have an answer to my question about their topological methods , which is that the topological concepts they were using were intrinsically not strong enough to bring the bound down to n + 1 , let alone n .
It might nevertheless be valuable to understand exactly how far we can go by thinking about independent partial transversals .
Ron Aharoni and Jonathan Farley both had interesting ideas along these lines ; rather than reproduce them here , let me just say that you can find Aharoni ’s comment ( under the previous blog post ) by searching for “ Vizing ” and Farley ’s comment by searching for “ Mirsky . ”
Local Obstructions
Idea 2 was to look for additional obstructions to natural strengthenings of Rota ’s Basis Conjecture , by computationally searching for counterexamples that arise if the number of columns is smaller than the number of rows .
Luke Pebody started such a search but reported a bug .
I still believe that this computational search is worth doing , because I suspect that any proof that Rota ’s Basis Conjecture holds for all matroids is going to have to come to grips with these counterexamples .
Note that if we are interested just in vector spaces , we could do some Gröbner basis calculations .
I am not sure that this would be any less computationally intensive than exhausting over all small matroids , but it might reveal additional structure that is peculiar to the vector space case .
Algebraic Geometry
There has been minimal progress in this ( admittedly vague ) direction .
I will quote Ellenberg ’s initial thoughts : “ If you were going to degenerate , what you would need to do is say : is there any version of this question that makes sense when the basic object is , instead of a basis of an n-dimensional vector space V , a 0 - dimensional subscheme of V of degree n which is not contained in any hyperplane ?
For instance , in 2 - space you could have something which was totally supported at the point ( 0,1 ) but which was “ fat ” in the horizontal direction of degree 2 .
This is the scheme S such that what it means for a curve C to contain S is that S passes through ( 0,1 ) and has a horizontal tangent there . ”
Let me also mention that Jan Draisma sent me email recently with the following remarks : “ A possible idea would be to consider a counterexample as lying in some suitable equivariant Hilbert scheme in which being a counterexample is a closed condition , then degenerate to a counterexample stable under a Borel subgroup of GL n , and come to a contradiction .
‘ Equivariant ’ should reflect the action of GL n × ( S n ⋉ S n n ) .
However , I have not managed to make this work myself , even in low dimensions .
In fact , having a good algebro - geometric argument for the n = 3 case , rather than a case - by - case analysis , would already be very nice ! ”
Alon–Tarsi Conjecture
Now let me move on to other ideas suggested in the comments .
There were several thoughts about the Alon–Tarsi Conjecture that the Alon–Tarsi constant L n even – L n odd ≠ 0 when n is even .
Rebecca Stones gave a formula that , as Gil Kalai observed , equated the Alon–Tarsi constant with the top Fourier–Walsh coefficient for the function detn ; i.e. , up to sign , the Alon–Tarsi constant is
Σ A ( –1 ) σ ( A ) det ( A ) n ,
where the sum is over all zero - one matrices and σ ( A ) is the number of zero entries in A .
This formula suggests various possibilities .
For example one could try to prove that L n even – L n odd ≢ 0 ( mod p ) where p = 2n + 1 is prime , because in this case , det ( A ) n must be 0 , 1 , or – 1 .
This would already be a new result for n = 26 , and the case n = 6 is small enough to compute explicitly and look for inspiration .
Luke Pebody posted the results of some computations in this case .
Another possibility , suggested by Gil Kalai , is to consider a Gaussian analogue .
Instead of random zero - one matrices , consider random Gaussian matrices and try to understand the Hermite expansion of detn , in particular showing that the coefficient corresponding to all ones is nonzero .
This might be easier and might give some insight .
Note also that in the comments to my MathOverflow post , Abdelmalek Abdesselam proposed an analogue of the Alon–Tarsi conjecture for odd n. I do not think that many people have looked at this .
Generalizations and Special Cases
Some generalizations and special cases of the conjecture were mentioned in the comments .
Proving the conjecture for graphic matroids or binary matroids would be an enormous advance .
There is a generalization due to Jeff Kahn , in which we have n2 bases B ij and we have to pick v ij ∈
B ij to form an n × n grid whose rows and columns are all bases .
Another generalization was prompted by a remark by David Eppstein : Suppose we are given n bases B 1 , … , B n of a vector space of dimension m ≤ n , and suppose we are given an n × n zero - one matrix with exactly m 1 ’s in every row and column .
Can we replace each 1 in the matrix with a vector in such a way that the m vectors in row i are the elements of B i and such that the m vectors in every column form a basis ?
Juan Sebastian Lozano suggested the following reformulation :
Does there exist a group G such that V is a representation of G and there exists g i ∈ G such that g i B i = B i+1 , and for every vector b ∈ B 1 ,
span{g0b , … , gn – 1b} = V
where gi = g i … g 1 and g0 is the identity ?
Other Ideas
Fedor Petrov mentioned a theorem by him and Roman Karasev that looks potentially relevant ( or at least the method of proof might be useful ) .
Let p be an odd prime , and let V be the F p - vector space of dimension k. Denote V* = V \ {0} and put m = | V * |/2 = ( pk – 1 ) / 2.
Suppose we are given m linear bases of the vector space V
(v 11 , … , v 1 k ) , ( v 21 , … , v 2 k ) , … , ( v m1 , … , v mk ) .
Then there exist pairwise distinct x 1 , … , x m , y 1 , … , y m ∈ V * and a map g : [ m ] → [ k ] such that for every i ∈ { 1 , … , m} we have y i – x i = v ig ( i ) .
Gil Kalai notes that the Alon–Tarsi conjecture is related to the coloring polynomial of a graph and asks if we can learn anything by considering more general polynomials such as
Π {(x i – λ e x j ) : i < j , {i , j} = e ∈ E ( G ) } ,

As a Supreme Court nominee , Sonia Sotomayor has a lot going for her : a stellar judicial record , a Yale Law School pedigree , a compelling personal history , and more trial experience than any other sitting justice .
But while she ’s clearly a bright and talented lawyer , she unfortunately lacks one of the key qualities of a successful Supreme Court justice : writing skills .
To put it bluntly , Sotomayor does n’t write very well .
Reporters have sort of danced around this problem .
The New York Times ‘ Adam Liptak charitably described her opinions as models of judicial craftsmanship that are “ not always a pleasure to read . ”
Liptak ’s analysis is something of an understatement .
Sotomayor ’s opinions read like she ’s still following a formula she learned in college and show little of the smart narratives employed by the federal judiciary ’s brightest lights .
Sotomayor ’s impenetrable legal opus stands in striking contrast to much of the work produced by the court she aspires to .
Supreme Court opinions , the best ones , are words for the generations .
There ’s a reason that so many Supreme Court justices are still quoted long after they ’ve died .
( Think of Robert Jackson , Obama ’s hero , who wrote in a 1950 opinion , “ It is not the function of our Government to keep the citizen from falling into error ; it is the function of the citizen to keep the Government from falling into error . ” )
The court ’s influence and lasting legacy is what it commits to paper .
Sotomayor may be a force of nature in the courtroom , where she ’s said to shine , but it ’s hard to imagine her going head to head in print with , say , Antonin Scalia .
The conservative justice is the master of the wicked one - liner and , while something of a smart aleck , he influences the public debate on so many issues because of his writing — whether he’s in the majority or dissenting and whether he ’s right or wrong .
Scalia ’s opinions are cited in leading constitutional law casebooks more than any other sitting justice .
In the 2002 case Republican Party v. White , for instance , he quipped , “ campaign promises are — by long democratic tradition — the least binding form of human commitment . ”
But it ’s not just his one - liners that make Scalia ’s writing so influential .
It ’s also the way he frames his arguments .
Take his dissent in PGA Tour v. Martin .
That ’s the 2001 case in which the court ruled in favor of golfer Casey Martin , who suffered from a birth defect that prevented him from walking 18 holes and who wanted to use a golf cart in professional tournament play .
Scalia wrote , “ If one assumes , however , that the PGA TOUR has some legal obligation to play classic , Platonic golf … then we Justices must confront what is indeed an awesome responsibility .
It has been rendered the solemn duty of the Supreme Court of the United States … to decide What Is Golf .
I am sure that the Framers of the Constitution … fully expected that sooner or later the paths of golf and government , the law and the links , would once again cross , and that the judges of this august Court would some day have to wrestle with that age - old jurisprudential question , for which their years of study in the law have so well prepared them :
Is someone riding around a golf course from shot to shot really a golfer ?
The answer , we learn , is yes .
The Court ultimately concludes , and it will henceforth be the Law of the Land , that walking is not a ‘ fundamental ’ aspect of golf . ”
Sotomayor ’s writing rarely hits this sort of breezy cadence .
Instead , she devotes the bulk of her legal analysis to quotes from statutes , regulations , and other opinions ad nauseam and seems unable to break away from the citations long enough to concisely synthesize the material before her .
A good example might be her opinion in Engerty Corp. v. Riverkeeper , which questioned whether the Clean Water Act allows the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) to use a cost - benefit analysis of technology available to reduce the impact of power plants on fish and other aquatic life .
( The Supreme Court overturned Sotomayor ’s decision , which was in favor of the fish , in April . )
Her opinion in the case runs 80 pages ; reading it might be good punishment for law students who show up late for class .
Early on , she devotes nearly an entire page to quoting EPA rules that instruct power plants on how to comply with the Clean Water Act .
And it takes her 2,500 words just to sum up the basis of the case .
A layperson would be hard pressed to glean from the opinion that Riverkeeper is a significant environmental opinion that puts Sotomayor squarely in the green camp .
She rules against power plants and in favor of preserving aquatic life at almost any cost , yet the opinion is remarkably passionless .
For all President Obama ’s talk about appointing a justice with a sense of empathy , the Riverkeeper opinion suggests that what he appointed is a technocrat .
The most quoted paragraph of Sotomayor ’s majority opinion is this one :
The Agency is therefore precluded from undertaking such cost - benefit analysis because the [ best technology available ] standard represents Congress ’s conclusion that the costs imposed on industry in adopting the best cooling water intake structure technology available ( i.e. , the best - performing technology that can be reasonably borne by the industry ) are worth the benefits in reducing adverse environmental impacts .
It ’s hardly one for the ages .
While the Riverkeeper opinion itself is a drag to read , it makes for an interesting point for comparison because Scalia wrote the Supreme Court opinion overturning her .
His entire opinion runs only 4,800 words , including the footnotes dissing Justice Stephen Breyer for perceived weaknesses in his dissent .
Scalia ’s opinion is also laden with the technical language endemic to these sorts of regulatory cases , but it manages to be clear and concise and , more important , convincing , because there ’s actually some original writing tucked in among all the references to section 316 ( b ) and other regulations .
Sotomayor can be forgiven if her opinions do n’t jump off the page .
She has spent her career on the 2nd Circuit , which , because its jurisdiction covers Wall Street , tends to have a disproportionate number of dull business cases that do n’t lend themselves to literary treatment .
And bad writers are hardly unique in the legal world .
The man Sotomayor will replace , Justice David Souter , has joked about his own turgid writing , suggesting that he takes the lucid opinions drafted by clerks and makes them worse .
Law school seems to have a way of turning good writers into bad ones .
In fact , Sotomayor ’s habit of quoting every last source at length in her opinions is a common tic of trial lawyers , which she was for a long time .
But writing has apparently plagued Sotomayor since college , when , the Wall Street Journal reports , she nearly flunked out of her first year at Princeton because her writing skills were so poor .
She clearly had other talents , but her inability to write an opinion that anyone wants to read could prevent her from having a lasting influence on the Supreme Court and American law .
The most brilliant jurists on the federal bench have often been those who can write well .
The nine justices of the Supreme Court are supposed to be champions of the Constitution entrusted with preserving key individual rights .
How they express their opinions can be as important as their conclusions .
Without better writing , Sotomayor runs the risk of emulating Clarence Thomas , who is probably the most conservative judge on the high court but also one of the least influential .
After all , who quotes Thomas in term papers ?
His most significant influence on the court is getting the conservatives to five votes .
Perhaps Sotomayor ’s writing deficiencies would n’t be so glaring if the competition for the job were n’t so stiff .
The woman she beat out for the nomination is a rock star of the written word .
Diane Wood , a judge on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals , was the woman on Obama ’s short list who had right - wing lawyers shaking in their boots .
She ’s the one that Federalist Society members viewed — off the record , of course — as the left ’s answer to John Roberts .
Wicked smart ,
Wood has spent the last 14 years battling some of the most brilliant conservative legal minds in the country — experience that would have served her well on the Supreme Court .
As a law professor at the University of Chicago , she has written books and law review articles , and her legal opinions bristle with intelligence and fluency , with sources far beyond the law books .
Take her dissent in a 2008 case in which the 7th Circuit ruled against a Jewish family whose condo association kept taking down their mezuzah .
Wood chastised the defendants for suggesting in legal filings that the family was trying to extract its “ pound of flesh ” from the condo board .
She wrote , “ Perhaps the defendants have not read Shakespeare ’s Merchant of Venice lately , ” noting that the “ pound of flesh ” expression was shockingly inappropriate for people trying to convince the court they were n’t anti-Semites .
She then provides a brief history of the character of Shylock , the bitter Jewish moneylender who is entitled to extract a pound of flesh from a debtor who fails to pay back his loan .
Compared with Wood ’s opinions , Sotomayor ’s definitely look second tier .
And maybe that ’s okay .
Souter created a lasting legacy on the court despite his tendency to “ put some lead ” in his copy .
A good judge does n’t have to quote Shakespeare and write beautifully to make good law .
But it does help .
Robert Hannah , who last month pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault for the September 2008 assault on 27 - year - old Tony Hunter near Washington D.C. 's Be -Bar , has been sentenced to just six months in jail .
Hannah claimed that Hunter made a
sexual advance toward him which inspired him to punch Hunter to the
ground .
Hunter died of his injuries ten days later in the hospital .
The Washington Post reports : " Before issuing his sentence , Judge Rafael Diaz acknowledged many of the letters written to the court from gay rights groups and Hunter 's family asking Diaz to sentence Hannah to the maximum 180 days .
During the hearing , Hannah told Hunter 's mother , sister and stepfather — who sat in the front row wiping away tears — that he was sorry , although he never looked at the family and kept his eyes on Diaz .
Diaz told Hannah that he was lucky that he was n't charged with homicide .
" You have to consider other options other than violence , " Diaz said .
" You could have done other [ things ] than punch or hurt someone . "
Before a marshal led Hannah away in handcuffs , Diaz also ordered him to pay $ 50 in court costs .
" We drove 300 miles to see him get six months in jail for killing my son , " said Hunter 's stepfather , John Yarborough of Franklinton , N.C. , Hunter 's home town . "

Too late in the evening .
It may be weeks before Roman Polanski 's extradition request is heard in Swiss courts .
Meanwhile , the world is gripped with confusion and outrage , a heady combination in what is shaping up as one of the great kerfuffles of our times .
" Film - makers in France , in Europe , in the United States and around the world are dismayed by this decision , " says the petition which , according to the Guardian ,
has now been signed by more than 70 film industry luminaries , including Polanski 's fellow directors Michael Mann , Wim Wenders , Pedro Almodóvar , Darren Aronofsky , Terry Gilliam , Julian Schnabel , the Dardenne brothers , Alejandro González Iñárritu , Wong Kar - Wai , Walter Salles and Jonathan Demme .
Actors Tilda Swinton , Monica Bellucci and Asia Argento , as well as producer Harvey Weinstein have also put their names on the petition .
Yesterday , Weinstein stated he was " calling on every film - maker we can to help fix this terrible situation " .
Meanwhile , the media is abuzz with speculation as to why after all these years , Polanski was arrested now .
Vanity Fair's Michael
Wolff opined that the arrest is revenge by prosecutors for the humiliation they endured after last year 's documentary Roman Polanski : Wanted and Desired depicted the circus surrounding the original case .
The LA Times however , claims that Polanski provoked the arrest by taunting law enforcement with their inaction .
They write :
Polanski's attorneys helped to provoke his arrest by complaining to an appellate court this summer that Los Angeles County prosecutors had made no real effort to capture the filmmaker in his three decades as a fugitive .
The accusation that the Los Angeles County district attorney 's office was not serious about extraditing Polanski was a minor point in two lengthy July court filings by the director 's attorneys .
The piece goes on to describe how , despite the fact that Polanski had visited Switzerland before , the widely publicized nature of his appearances at the Zurich film festival goaded prosecutors to action .
And while Polanski's victim Samantha Geimer may be " over it " a significant lynch mob is still roaming the internet demanding justice for what they remind us , was not just some private between adults indiscretion .
At Salon , Kate Harding writes a hang 'em high piece succinctly entitled " Reminder : Roman Polanski Raped a Child . "
And over at moviecitynews , David Poland rebuts seemingly the rest of Hollywood with a nice list of retorts to the " But he 's a great director who 's been through so much " arguments .
Turning back the clock , awards blogger Tom O'Neil wonders whether Polanski even deserved his best director Oscar for The Pianist , pointing out that the director of that year 's Best Picture Chicago , was strangely denied the traditional accompanying statue and ponders whether the award might have been Hollywood 's show of support to the exiled molester .
First he was for it .
Then he was against it .
Now Rep. Mike Ross is back on board with a government - run healthcare plan .
Sort of .
Ross ( D - Ark. ) , who had emerged as a leader among centrist Blue Dog Democrats opposing the public health insurance option , has suggested something his colleagues consider even more drastic – opening Medicare to those under 65 without insurance .
ADVERTISEMENT

He made the suggestion in meetings with House Democratic leaders and brought the idea to the closed - door House Democratic Caucus meeting Thursday .
" I — speaking only on behalf of myself — suggested one possible idea could be that instead of creating an entirely new government bureaucracy to administer a public option , Medicare could be offered as a choice , " Ross said in a statement to The Hill .
Medicare would then compete with private insurers across the age spectrum .
It would be open to those who do n't have insurance through their employers , the same people who would be covered by the public option already under discussion .
But Ross said he would want reimbursement for providers to be at a " much greater rate " than it is now .
Medicare reimbursement rates have been a sore point for rural lawmakers who feel that Medicare shortchanges their hospitals .
His statement went on to say that he does " not support a government - run public option " and he does " not endorse this idea " of opening up Medicare .
He said he is looking for solutions in the healthcare debate .
The hostility directed at Medicare by rural , centrist , Blue Dog lawmakers is what makes Ross 's Medicare suggestion so surprising .
He is all three – a rural , centrist Blue Dog .
Indeed he is a former co-chairman of the coalition , and is the leader of the Blue Dogs ' Health Care Task Force .
Ross 's fellow Blue Dogs distanced themselves from the Medicare idea , but handled the question gingerly .
" There has never been a discussion about that among the Blue Dogs , " said Rep . ( D - Utah ) , the Blue Dogs ' new co-chairman for communications .
And a leading liberal in the healthcare debate suggested the idea might be too liberal for most Democratic lawmakers , because it sounds like a " single - payer " concept , which Democratic leaders have rejected .
"
The idea of a public option was to provide competition , but opening up Medicare would be the precursor to single - payer , " said House Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) .
" This may be an issue of semantics , but it would be very difficult to implement .
" But Waxman and others said the idea arose from many voters being spooked that a public option would be a " government takeover . "
Medicare , however , is a popular program that people know and like .
" Why have this huge , divisive fight trying to pass a public option when you could pretty much do the same thing if you just added Medicare to the list of options in the exchange ? " said a Democratic aide .
" And the fight would be way less controversial .
" Still , Ross has been seen as a skeptic or opponent of the public option since he led a group of seven centrist Blue Dogs who blocked consideration of the health bill in the Energy and Commerce Committee , in part because of their dislike of a public option .
Talks with Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) produced the " negotiated rates " compromise .
Ross signed on with three other Blue Dogs , and the committee voted on the bill in late July .
But Ross returned from the stormy August recess and reversed his position , saying he could not support any kind of public option .
Since then , Ross has taken heat from liberals who believe he 's selling out to the healthcare industry , and conservatives who say he caved in to Waxman and Pelosi .
His prominence also brought scrutiny to his 2007 sale of his family pharmacy .
And the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington has requested a Justice Department investigation into the sale after news reports indicated that a large healthcare company may have paid him more than it is worth .
Some colleagues suggested that the political heat may have pushed Ross to change position .
But Ross said he has n't changed his position , he is just proposing alternatives to keep the process moving .
" Let me be clear , " Ross said in his statement , " I do not endorse this idea , as it was just one of many ideas we , as legislators , have brought up and discussed in the numerous , ongoing negotiations and discussions we have had on healthcare reform over the past several months . "

Politico has the story :
House Democrats dealt South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson a formal rebuke Wednesday , taking the rare step of passing a resolution of disapproval for his famous “ you lie ! ” outburst last week in the House chamber .
The vote was 240 - 179 , falling almost exclusively along party lines .
While Democrats said they were defending the rules of the House and enforcing the traditional decorum of the chamber , Republicans mounted a fierce attack on the resolution , saying it was a waste of time after Wilson had duly apologized to President Barack Obama for his outburst during a joint address to Congress .
While a resolution of disapproval is little more than a slap on the wrist , a formal roll call vote like this – permanently entered into the Congressional Record – is extremely rare .
“ What ’s at issue here is of importance to the House and of importance to the country , ” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer proclaimed during the hour - long debate preceding the vote .
“ This House can not stay silent . ”
Over the last week I 've been on a fact - finding mission to Scandinavia .
No sign of the Swedish National Bikini team ( yet ) , but I 've run into a few companies that may help determine what our always - connected lives may look like in a few years .
If Korea is cornering the market on innovative mobile hardware , then southern Sweden is teeming with amazing mobile software .
In fact , many of the coolest new phones get their grooviness in part thanks to software made by companies like The Astonishing Tribe , which makes tools that allow phone makers to stitch custom user interfaces to deeper phone functions ( like Samsung 's Omnia phones , which put a TouchWiz interface atop a Windows Mobile OS ) .
Or Scalado , which makes superefficient image processing technology used in more than 400 million digital cams and camera phones .
Those are just two of the dozens of hot mobile companies in the Skane region of Sweden , in and around Malmo .
[ Cringely takes a look at the darker side of Internet ubiquity in " The high cost of Internet ( de ) fame " | Stay up to date on Robert X. Cringely 's musings and observations with InfoWorld 's Notes from the Underground newsletter . ]
An interesting Malmo startup called Bambuser is onto something I think could change our lives irrevocably -- for good and ill .
Bambuser 's premise is brain - dead simple .
It turns your phone into a live video camera on the Internet , which essentially turns everyone who has one into a broadcaster .
If you have a handset with a hefty enough processor and relatively fast data connection , you can upload " live " video ( with up to a three - second lag ) to the Bambuser site or to a widget embedded in your blog .
Viewers can access the video on the Web or on their own mobiles , and you can store the video for later viewing .
The service is completely free ; all you need to do is sign up online and log on from your phone .
Launched about 18 months ago , Bambuser has some 60,000 users worldwide , including many in the United States , says founder Pouria Ruhi .
He calls it " the best democratization tool ever created , like Twitter for mobile video . "
And it 's not the only one .
QIK ( pronounced " kick " ) offers a lookalike service , which is used by some professional news sites as well .
That 's the theory anyway .
In these early days of not entirely high - speed mobile data , the reality is a little grainier .
Video playback can be pretty chunky and the subjects , well , fairly mundane .
Consider Carolina Gynning , a stunning Swedish brunette who posts frequently to Bambuser ( when she 's not hosting the Swedish version of " American Idol " ) .
Log on and you can view a stuttering 27 - second video of her getting her teeth drilled .
Exciting ?
Not exactly .
But that 's today .
A few years down the road , when mobile handsets with desktop - worthy CPUs and superfast connections are common , a brave new world of mobile video could emerge .
Services like Bambuser and Qik could revolutionize news gathering .
Imagine the Rodney King beating captured in real time , or the Obama inauguration as seen by 10,000 different live mobile feeds .
They will completely obliterate professional sports leagues ' monopoly on live footage ( imagine frisking 90,000 spectators for their phone cams at the Super Bowl ) .
And of course , there 's real - time porn .
I 'll let your own imagination supply the visuals for that one .
But the real changes will happen on a more personal level , as some people choose to capture their entire lives and broadcast them across the Net .
It 's not just Bambuser , which has the feel of a company started by 20 - somethings wearing ripped jeans and Chuck Taylors .
Buttoned - down companies like Mashmobile ( also based in Skane ) are building portals for major mobile carriers who want to offer customers the ability to create their own personal " mash " of photos , videos , Facebook updates , tweets , and so on -- all in one handy page that can be accessed by invitation only or completely open to the world .
Is your day - to - day existence an endless exercise in drudgery ?
Just subscribe to someone whose life is more interesting .
Of course , you have to be one hell of a narcissist -- and / or desperately hungry for your 15 minutes of fame -- to take part in this .
But there 's no shortage of folks like that ( just take a look at reality TV ) .
If they want to butter their lives all over the InterWebs , they will soon have the ability to do just that .
The problem is the rest of us .
What happens to the people who unwittingly find themselves on the other end of the camera ?
If you happen to intersect with one of these people , bits of your life may also be buttered all over the Net -- whether you like it or not .
Let 's hope you 're not doing anything illegal or embarrassing when the " lifecasters " wander by .
Finally , if you ever find yourself in Copenhagen a ) looking for a simple example of lifecasting , and b ) needing a set of wheels , stop by Baisikeli , just east of the Orstedparken .
For about $ 12 a day you can rent a Yahoo purple cruiser ( complete with a Yahoo logo ) that features a Nokia N95 camera phone inside a metal box strapped to the handlebars and a solar - powered battery pack on the rear rack .
Every minute , the bike uploads a photo taken at random to Flickr , offering a minute - by - minute photo diary of your ride .
( Along with a lot of photos of the inside of the bike shop -- I guess they forgot to turn off the camera when they got back . )
Are you ready for the mobile Webcasted future ?

Gnome 3 , which will be available to install in Ubuntu 10.04 , will mark the first radical change to the Gnome Desktop since it 's inception , thanks to it ’s “ new ” interface ‘ Gnome - Shell ’ .
Doing Things Better
On first glance , the Gnome 3 Desktop does n't seem all that different from the current default Gnome set -up .
( note : click on the pictures to view them larger . )
You ’ll notice there is no bottom taskbar and the top panel has been rearranged somewhat .
It also has , in place of the Ubuntu System Menu , an ‘ Activities ’ button …
Activities – Making Things Easier To Manage
Pressing ‘ Activities ’ takes you into an ‘ Overview ’ mode .
It ’s from here that you can open new applications , add or remove workspaces , move windows between workspaces and navigate through your recent files .
You can easily find an application or document by typing it ’s name in the search box .
This will instantly show the list of matches beneath it .
You can also launch applications by clicking ‘ browse ’ and navigating the category lists – very similar to the current system menu applet .
Adding workspaces is simple .
You just click on the circular add button in the bottom right - hand corner and a new workspace appears .
Similarly you can remove workspaces by clicking the circular minus button that is over - layed in the centre of a workspace in the overview mode .
Moving applications to a different workspace is as logical as just dragging them between panes !
It is the “ basics ” of this workflow which , in my opinion from the time I 've spent using Gnome - Shell , truly enhance the usability factor in this new “ desktop ” metaphor .
Sadly , Compiz and Gnome - Shell do n’t play nice , however this does n’t mean the end of eye - candy effects as gnome - Shell has slick animations all of it ’s own thanks to Clutter !
Quick 45sec demo : -
HTML5 ( Flash Free ) Version : -
I ’m really excited at the new possibilities that gnome - shell and gnome - 3 will take the desktop in .
Change my dear .. and it seems not a moment too soon !

On June 30 , 2009 in the Federal District Court of New Mexico , Assistant US Attorney John Anderson agreed , on the record , to Honor the Medical Marijuana Recommendation of Charles Smith of Shasta Lake , California .
Federal District Court Magistrate Judge Lorenzo Garcia further agreed to accept the State ’s proposed recommendation of a Conditional Discharge upon provision of Mr. Smith ’s Medical Marijuana Recommendation to the US Attorney ’s office .
This historic moment occurred during the federal Government ’s prosecution of cases related to the Annual Rainbow Gathering that occurs in different states around the country and involves a large Federal Law Enforcement presence .
…
This is the first time in modern history , in which it is known that the US Attorney and the Federal District Court agreed to accept medical marijuana recommendations and licenses in order to dismiss marijuana possession charges .
Some interesting news from New Mexico :
And the universe did n’t collapse .
Not only that , the story has gotten no press whatsoever .
Often , when the government refrains from doing something cruel to someone , there is n't much of a news story left to report .
This just goes to show how silly it is to assume that there 's a political imperative requiring us to continue aggressively enforcing bad drug laws .
There is n’t .
See how easy it is to just leave patients alone ?
Next time , try not arresting them in the first place .
We met Isaac and Abdi , Alima and Muslima last week in the bone - dry , stony land close to the Ethiopia - Kenya border .
They were with five nomad families who have watched all their animals die of star vation this year in a deep drought , and who have now decided their days of herding cattle are over .
After three years of disastrous rains , the families from the Borana tribe , who by custom travel thousands of miles a year in search of water and pasture , have unanimously decided to settle down .
Back in April , they packed up their pots , pans and meagre belongings , deserted their mud and thatch homes at Bute and set off on their last trek , to Yaeblo , a village of near - destitute charcoal makers that has sprung up on the side of a dirt road near Moyale .
Now they live in temporary " benders " – shelters made from branches covered with plastic sheeting .
They look like survivors from an earthquake or a flood , but in fact these are some of the world 's first climate - change refugees .
For all their deep pride in owning and tending animals in a harsh land , these deeply conservative people expressed no regrets about giving up centuries of traditional life when we spoke to them .
Indeed , they seemed relieved : " This will be a much better life , " said Isaac , a tribal leader in his 40s .
" We will make charcoal and sell firewood .
Our children will go to the army or become traders .
We do not expect to ever go back to animals . "
They are not alone .
Droughts have affected millions in a vast area stretching across Kenya , Somalia , Ethiopia , Eritrea , Sudan , Chad , and into Burkina Faso and Mali , and tens of thousands of nomadic herders have had to give up their animals .
" [ This recent drought ] was the worst thing that had ever happened to us , " said Alima , 24 .
" The whole land is drying up .
We had nothing , not even drinking water .
All our cattle died and we became hopeless .
It had never happened before .
So we have decided to live in one place , to change our lives and to educate our children . "
Parched
Kenya , a land more than twice the size of Britain , is everywhere parched .
Whole towns such as Moyale with more than 10,000 people are now desperate for water .
The huge public reservoir in this regional centre has been empty for months and , according to Molu Duka Sora , local director of the government 's Arid Lands programme , all the major boreholes in the vast semi-desert area are failing one by one .
Earlier this year , more than 50 people died of cholera in Moyale .
It is widely believed that it came from animals and humans sharing ever scarcer water .
Food prices have doubled across Kenya .
A 20 - litre jerrycan of poor quality water has quadrupled in price .
Big game is dying in large numbers in national parks , and electricity has had to be rationed , affecting petrol and food supplies .
For the first time in generations there are cows on the streets of Nairobi as nomads like Isaac come to the suburbs with their herds to feed on the verges of roads .
Violence has increased around the country as people go hungry .
" The scarcity of water is becoming a nightmare .
Rivers are drying up , and the way temperatures are changing we are likely to get into more problems , " said Professor Richard Odingo , the Kenyan vice - chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) .
" We passed emergency levels months ago , " said Yves Horent , a European commission humanitarian officer in Nairobi .
" Some families have had no crops in nearly seven years .
People are trying to adapt but the nomads know they are in trouble . "
Many people , in Kenya and elsewhere , cannot understand the scale and speed of what is happening .
The east African country is on the equator , and has always experienced severe droughts and scorching temperatures .
Nearly 80 % of the land is officially classed as arid , and people have adapted over centuries to living with little water .
There are those who think this drought will finish in October with the coming of the long rains and everything will go back to normal .
Well , it may not .
What has happened this year , says Leina Mpoke , a Maasai vet who now works as a climate change adviser with Ireland - based charity Concern Worldwide , is the latest of many interwoven ecological disasters which have resulted from deforestation , over - grazing , the extraction of far too much water , and massive population growth .
" In the past we used to have regular 10 - year climatic cycles which were always followed by a major drought .
In the 1970s we started having droughts every seven years ; in the 1980s they came about every five years and in the 1990s we were getting droughts and dry spells almost every two or three years .
Since 2000 we have had three major droughts and several dry spells .
Now they are coming almost every year , right across the country , " said Mpoke .
He reeled off the signs of climate change he and others have observed , all of which are confirmed by the Kenyan meteorological office and local governments .
" The frequency of heatwaves is increasing .
Temperatures are generally more extreme , water is evaporating faster , and the wells are drying .
Larger areas are being affected by droughts , and flooding is now more serious .
" We are seeing that the seasons have changed .
The cold months used to be only in June and July but now they start earlier and last longer .
We have more unpredictable , extreme weather .
It is hotter than it used to be and it stays hotter for longer .
The rain has become more sporadic .
It comes at different times of the year now and farmers cannot tell when to plant .
There are more epidemics for people and animals . "
' We have to change '
Mpoke said he did not understand how people in rich countries failed to understand the scale or urgency of the problem emerging in places such as Kenya .
" Climate change is here .
It 's a reality .
It 's not in the imagination or a vision of the future .
[ And ] climate change adds to the existing problems .
It makes everything more complex .
It 's here now and we have to change . "
The current drought is big , but the nomads and western charities helping people adapt say the problem is not the extreme lack of water so much as the fact that the land , the people and the animals have no time to recover from one drought to the next .
" People now see that these droughts are coming more and more frequently .
They know that they cannot restock .
Breeding animals takes time .
It take several years to recover .
One major drought every 10 years is not a problem .
But one good rainy season is not enough , " said Horent .
Nor are traditional ways of predicting and adapting to drought much use .
In the past , said Ibrahim Adan , director of Moyale - based development group Cifa , nomads would look for signs of coming drought or rain in the stars , in the entrails of slaughtered animals or in minute changes in vegetation .
" When drought came , elders would be sent miles away to negotiate grazing rights in places not so seriously hit , and cattle would be sent to relatives in distant communities .
People would reduce the size of their herds , selling some and slaughtering the best to preserve the best meat to see them through the hard times .
None of that is working now . "
Francis Murambi , a development worker in Moyale , said : " The land has changed a lot .
Only 60 years ago , the land around Moyale was savannah with plenty of grass , big trees and elephants , lions and rhino . "
Today the grasses have all but gone , taken over by brush .
Because there are fewer pastures , they are more heavily used .
It 's a vicious circle .
In the past , a nomadic family could live on a few cows which would provide more than enough milk and food .
Now the pasture is so poor that those who still herd cattle need more animals to survive .
But having more cattle further degrades the soil .
The environment can support fewer and fewer people , but the population has increased .
" [ Before ] we did not need money .
The pasture was good , the milk was good , and you could produce butter .
Now it is poor , it is not possible , " said Gurache Kate , a chief in Ossang Odana village near the Ethiopian border .
" Yesterday I had a phone call from the man we sent our cattle away with .
He is 250 miles away and he said they were all dying . "
These shifts driven by climate change are bringing profound changes .
Ibrahim Adan said : " The cow has always been your bank .
Being a Borana means you must keep livestock .
It 's part of your identity and destiny .
It gives you status .
Traditionally livestock was central to life .
The old people saw cattle as the centre of their culture .
Pride , love and attachment to cattle was all celebrated in song .
My father would never sell cattle .
They were an extension of himself . "
Now , for people like Isaac and Abdi , Alima and Muslima , all that is gone , and with it independence and self - sufficiency .
" The money economy is creeping in , as is education and the settled life , " said Adan .
" Young people see the cow now as more of an economic necessity rather than the core of their culture . "
The great unspoken fear among scientists and governments is that the present cycle of droughts continues and worsens , making the land uninhabitable .
" This is n't something that will just affect Kenya .
What is certain is that if climate change sets in and drought remains a frequent visitor , there will be far fewer people on the land in 20 years , " said Adan .
" The nomad will not go .
But his life will be very different . "
JavaScript speed is a major selling point for modern browsers , although many of the techniques employed originate from dynamic language research conducted in the 1980s .
David Chisnall discusses how these techniques work .

Over a decade ago , Netscape changed the face of the Web by providing a scripting language that ran in the browser .
Suddenly , it became possible to run programs in web pages .
The JavaScript language is heavily influenced by Self but , although Self is one of the fastest dynamic languages around , JavaScript was very slow .
Most of the time , people did nothing more with JavaScript than animate menus and make things go " Ding . "
More recently , this situation has changed .
The concept of a web application has started to gain traction , and the new breed has started doing a lot more on the client side , using JavaScript[md ] now all grown up and standardized as ECMAScript .
When a web page was just using JavaScript for animating menus , most of the CPU time was spent in the browser 's rendering engine , even with a very slow JavaScript implementation .
Now , things like Google Spreadsheets are running large numbers of calculations , and people are starting to notice when the script is slow .
For this reason , the latest browsers are all boasting about how fast their JavaScript implementations are .
A lot of the new - and - exciting improvements are implementations of research done in the 1980s on languages like Smalltalk and Self .
In this series , we 'll take a look at exactly how they work .
Interpreting or Compiling ?
Anyone who has worked on a big software project can tell you that compiling a program takes time .
A compiler first has to take a long stream of text and split it into tokens [ md ] identifiers , special symbols , keywords , and so on .
It then takes this token stream and turns it into a parse tree , which is a concrete representation of the syntactic structure of the program .
For example , the for statement in C - like languages is a simple structure containing pointers to the initializer , test , increment , and loop body .
Next , the compiler turns the parse tree into an abstract syntax tree ( AST ) .
This is similar to the parse tree , but removes syntactic sugar .
Typically , an AST might restrict itself to a single type of loop , for example .
Things like the add - and - assign operation ( += ) might be represented by a single node in the parse tree , pointing to the expression and the target , but in the AST would be represented by separate addition and assignment nodes .
The line is blurred somewhat in languages such as Lisp , Self , Smalltalk , or Io , where the concrete syntax of the language closely matches the abstract syntax , but a language like JavaScript often has several ways of expressing the same thing , so the translation from concrete syntax to abstract syntax can be quite time - consuming .
The simplest kind of interpreter runs the AST directly .
Each AST node might be represented by an object , and implement something like a " run in context " method .
To run a program , you perform a traversal of the tree , with each AST node recursively evaluating its children .
This process is very slow .
For example , to run the add - and - assign operation , you would call the method first in the assign node .
This would then call it in the add node , which would have two children , one being the original value and the other being the expression to add .
You would have to call all of these methods for a simple statement that , in compiled code , would be a small handful of instructions .
Why do people implement languages this way ?
This approach has two advantages :
It 's easy .
Code that 's easy to write is easy to make bug - free .
It 's also very small , which was very important on older browsers that were expected to run on computers with 4MB ( or less ) of RAM .
It gives very quick load times .
Load times are very important on a web page .
If a desktop application takes 30 seconds to compile , no one cares .
The author or packager will do the compiling , or maybe the end user when installing , but then it wo n't need to be done again .
If compiling makes the program run faster , spending a bit of time at the start is a huge overall gain , which is why most desktop software is still compiled ( although this situation is changing ) .
In a web browser , the perception of that 30 seconds is very different .
Imagine waiting 30 seconds after a web page had been downloaded before the scripts started working .
For a lot of sites , the user would have given up and abandoned the page before compiling finished .
Worse , the scripts may only run for a small fraction of a second of CPU time .
Even if you 're taking only one second to compile them , that still may be more time for the compiler than the AST - interpreter would take to run the script .
Although dynamic languages have been compiled for a while , many still use a halfway step , somewhere between interpreting an AST and compiling .
In this technique , the AST is compiled into something called bytecode .
This term is often used fairly generally now to mean machine code for any virtual machine , but it technically means machine code for an instruction set where every operation code ( opcode ) is one byte .
The advantage of one - byte opcodes is obvious :
It 's easy to implement them with a simple jump table .
A bytecode interpreter looks like a massive switch statement .
Each instruction is run by loading it , adding its value to a fixed address , and then jumping there .
The jump target contains code to run the instruction and then jump back to the top of the switch statement with the next instruction .
Bytecode interpreters are ( usually ) slower than compiled code , but not by much .
A bytecode instruction often maps to a short sequence of machine instructions , so the overhead from the jump table is relatively small .
A well - designed bytecode can come close to half the speed of compiled code , although 1/10 the speed is more common in real - world use .
Still a lot slower , but generating bytecode from an AST is usually very fast , so the startup time is low and performance is " good enough . "

Scientists say the Maldives face a serious threat from climate change
The president of the Maldives has said that , even though his country is under threat from climate change , he cannot afford to go to a summit on the issue .
President Mohamed Nasheed said his nation would only go to the December talks in Copenhagen if someone offered to pay for the trip .
He said the Maldives needed to be defended from the effects of global warming and rising sea levels .
But he added that the country would have to do much of the work itself .
" We ca n't go to Copenhagen because we do n't have the money , " President Nasheed told journalists .
World leaders at the summit are aiming to create a new agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol , which expires in 2012 .
Security issue
No part of the island state 's territory lies more than 2.5 m above sea level , and 50 of its islands are already severely eroding .
Mr Nasheed has criticised what he sees as a blame game at past summits
The president said this showed that climate change was not just an environment issue , but a security issue as well .
" I keep saying this : if the Europeans thought it was important to defend Poland in the '30s and ' 40s - in any threat you really have to look after your frontline states .
" Now , the Maldives is a frontline state . "
The country is planning a major clean - up of its technology and the president said parliament will shortly consider a " green tax " of three dollars per tourist per day .
President Nasheed , a former human rights activist who came to power 10 months ago , said climate change summits were at times " childish " because countries tended to blame each other over past misdeeds rather than think practically .
He hoped the Copenhagen summit would come out with positive plans , like renewable energy promotion , rather than stressing what he called negative ones like capping carbon emissions .

We 've obtained 65 " Galileoscope " kits ( http://www.galileoscope.org), a simple but high - quality telescope with which you can view mountains on the Moon , the phases of Venus , and the moons of Jupiter .
Thanks to a generous donation from our friend Eric Korpela we are able to subsidise the cost .
We are requesting a $ 10 donation ( less than half the cost of purchasing one yourself ) , and a limit of one scope per family - first come , first served .
Bring a standard camera tripod if you have one , and weather permitting , we 'll set up outside to view the stars .
If you already own a telescope ( perhaps even a Galileoscope ! ) feel free to bring it along and we 'll give you some tips on getting the most out of it .
Kids ( we recommend ages 7 and up ) are welcome at this event if accompanied by an adult .
Doors to Campbell
Hall will open at 7 pm and we 'll take you up to Room 544 for a brief talk about building the Galileoscopes , and then our grad students and postdocs will guide you through the process of building your own .
We 'll talk you through some of the things you can see in the night sky , answer your astronomy questions , and if the weather is good we 'll have stargazing outside with your new telescopes as well as any other scopes folks bring along .
We 'll wrap up around 8:30 pm .
An RSVP is not required .
Please just show up .
In the event that we run out of Galileoscopes you are still welcome to join us for stargazing and " ask an astronomer " , and hopefully we 'll inspire you to order your own Galileoscope online too !

Dr. Owen Gingerich " Kepler , Galileo , and the Birth of Modern Astronomy " 2009 is the 400th anniversary of Kepler 's Astronomia nova , and of the first astronomical use of the telescope , especially by Galileo .
I will argue that more important than Kepler 's elliptical orbits and the law of areas was his pioneering insistence on astronomy based on physical causes .
Particularly remarkable about Galileo's use of the telescope was the way in which he used his observations to challenge the traditional geocentric cosmology .
In very different fashions these two contemporary astronomers hastened the astronomical revolution and became the fathers of modern astronomy .

The average American family today carries eight credit cards .
Credit card debt and personal bankruptcies are now at an all time high .
With no legal limit on the amount of interest or fees that can be charged , credit cards have become the most profitable sector of the American banking industry : more than $ 30 billion in profits last year alone .
FRONTLINE and The New York Times examine how the credit card industry became so pervasive , so lucrative , and so politically powerful .
