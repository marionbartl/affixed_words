Amazon ’s Simple Storage Service , also known as Amazon S3 , plans to change its pricing on Nov. 1 in a move that should help it stay ahead of competing cloud storage companies .
Amazon S3 , and the larger suite of Amazon Web Services , provides the infrastructure for many of the web companies that we ’ve covered .
( As is often the case , one of the most effective demonstrations of S3 ’s importance came when it failed in February , and again in July , affecting startups like 37signals and Twitter . )
Now , other tech players are getting ready to take it on .
Google , for example , recently launched its App Engine , while Mosso ( a division of Rackspace , the only venture - backed company to hold an IPO in the last few months ) has announced plans to launch a storage service called CloudFS .
Amazon ’s official reason for the price change is lower costs associated with economies of scale , but the incentive provided by increasing competition probably did n’t hurt .
Here ’s how it will work : Instead of just charging a flat rate per unit of storage ( 15 cents per gigabyte , for example ) , Amazon has divided the pricing into four tiers , with the price decreasing as you use more storage .
That could also help it tempt more big companies , or to remain affordable for startups as they grow .
In its announcement , Amazon also touts a some impressive usage data .
S3 now stores 29 billion objects ( a computer science term for an allocated region of storage ) , up from 22 billion a quarter ago — to make that dizzyingly large number a little more concrete , that ’s four objects for every person on Earth .
During peak usage on Oct. 1 , S3 received 70,000 storage , retrieval and deletion requests .
Sounds like the Internet cloud is alive , well and busy .

Despite the star system , science is a team sport , except that sometimes a team player contributes long after he 's been sent to the minors . "
But instead of focusing on his hard luck , Prasher said he is happy for his former colleagues .
While it was perfectly within his rights not to share the cloned gene with others , Prasher said he felt an obligation to give his research a chance to turn into something significant , even if he was no longer a part of it .
" When you 're using public funds , I personally believe you have an obligation to share , " Prasher said .
" I put my heart and soul into it , but if I kept that stuff , it was n't gonna go anyplace . "
David Mark Welch , assistant scientist of evolutionary biology at MBL , said this sort of situation is a natural byproduct of working in an industry where competition for grant money can be intense .
Some grants have 100 applications but will only fund 10 requests , Welch said .
That means competition – even from fellow colleagues at the same institution – can be fierce and scientists often feel the need to keep all unpublished research a secret .
Welch praised Prasher 's actions and said many researchers are finding it easier to obtain larger grants if they collaborate instead of alienate .
" You have to put aside any sort of personal desires to be better than everyone else because if your grant is n't funded , you 're in trouble , " he said .
JERUSALEM 
The American State Department has reinstated seven Fulbright grants offered to Palestinians in Gaza for advanced study in the United States , reversing a decision to withdraw the scholarships because of Israel ’s ban on Palestinians ’ leaving Gaza for study abroad .
The American Consulate in Jerusalem sent e-mail messages on Sunday night to all seven telling them it was “ working closely ” with Israeli officials to secure them exit permits .
Maj .
Peter Lerner , spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry ’s office of civilian affairs , said the Gazans would be granted permits after individual security checks .
On Thursday the seven received e-mail messages saying the grants had been “ redirected ” because of Israel ’s closing of Gaza , an area run by the militant anti-Israel group Hamas .
The closing , an effort to punish Hamas for its rocket and mortar barrages of southern Israel , prevents Palestinians from leaving Gaza except for medical emergencies .
But after word of the grant withdrawals got out , senior American and Israeli officials expressed surprise and outrage , saying that training ambitious and talented young people under Fulbright grants was one of the ways to help blunt the appeal of radical forces in Palestinian society .
Among the many accusations some Christians direct toward atheists is the notion that we are immoral .
Without belief in their god and their bible , they argue , we have no moral foundation .
And yet , a belief system which includes the expectation that the majority of the world 's population will suffer the horrors of their hell while a select few are magically transported to some sort of heaven is considered morally just .
If this is their idea of morality , I 'd suggest that we are better off finding our moral grounding elsewhere .
To be fair , some Christians have jettisoned this concept of hell from their dogma .
They realize that it is not possible to reconcile the forgiveness they want to preach with eternal damnation .
Sadly , they seem to be in a small minority .
For many Christians , hell is a central part of their belief system ( and it shows ) .
Christians are quick to explain that their god provides everyone with a choice .
Their hell can be avoided by conforming to the will of their god .
But how is this choice - do what I say or suffer for all eternity - a moral exemplar ?
I am reminded of an abusive parent and see little evidence of love here .
Most of all , I am concerned about what Christians ' hell - belief does to their interactions with nonbelievers in the present .
How can I expect to be treated as an equal , worthy of respect and dignity , when interacting with someone who is convinced that I am destined for the worst sort of punishment they can imagine ?
And not only am I destined for this fate , but I am assumed to deserve it !

HONG KONG  China ’s Health Ministry on Friday announced a nationwide inquiry into the safety of all infant formulas , as a team of investigators from six government agencies descended on the milk powder factory that produced formula now linked to one baby ’s death and kidney problems in at least 50 others .
The producer of the suspect formula , the Sanlu Group , recalled 700 tons of it after determining Thursday that it had been contaminated with melamine , an industrial chemical .
The official Xinhua news agency cited Zhao Xinchao , the vice mayor of Shijiazhuang , in Hebei Province , where Sanlu is based , as saying that the police had questioned 78 people , including dairy farmers and milk dealers .
The police suspect that some may have diluted milk with water to increase the volume for sale to Sanlu , and then added melamine to disguise the dilution , Mr. Zhao told the news agency .
A common industrial test for the protein content of dairy products or animal feed gives an inaccurately high reading if melamine is present .
WASHINGTON 
The government is trying to convince consumers that dollar coins are greener than the dollar bill .
The U.S. Mint is spending about $ 12 million on a pilot project to promote the presidential dollar coin by appealing to Americans ' duty to protect the environment while saving the government money .
The campaign , which may be expanded nationwide , stresses that coins last longer than dollar bills , are recyclable and could save tax money if more people used them .
" You 'll want to get out and do your part , too , " says one of the TV ads , which features an animated Statue of Liberty buying a hot dog on the streets of New York City with two dollar coins .
In addition to TV , the four - month program includes radio , Web and newspaper advertising , and partnerships with banks and retailers that are giving out the coins as change .
Ads featuring the gold - colored coins are even plastered on city buses and trains .
It is starting in four cities — Austin ; Charlotte ; Grand Rapids , Mich . ; and Portland , Ore. — and may be expanded if successful .
The Mint will be closely tracking bank orders for the coins in the four cities through November to gauge the program 's success .
" The ultimate measure right now is how many more dollar coins get ordered and get put into circulation , " Mint Director Ed Moy says .
Dawn Walker , training general manager at Bruegger 's Bagels in Charlotte , says people are asking for the coins after she put up signs advertising that they carry the dollars featuring U.S. presidents .
The favorable response has been a surprise , she says , noting people rejected the coin featuring Sacagawea , which preceded the presidential series .
" It 's a great idea , " she says of the Mint program .
She says being involved is good public relations for the bakery .
The Mint 's campaign is the latest attempt by the government to get consumers to spend , not just collect , dollar coins .
But it 's unclear if after decades of largely rejecting the money , consumers will respond .
In the past , consumers and retailers have complained dollar coins were too heavy and more difficult to carry compared with bills and too close in size to quarters , leading to confusion .
Many cash registers do n't have a slot to hold the coins .
" Until Congress decides to stop the dollar bill , these efforts are going to be difficult to succeed , " says François Velde , economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and co-author of the book The Big Problem of Small Change .
Greater use of dollar coins instead of bills in everyday transactions would save the government hundreds of millions of dollars a year .
Coins last about 30 years , more than 16 times longer than dollar bills do .
Dollars vs. quarters
The Federal Reserve estimated in 1995 that replacing dollar bills with coins would save $ 500 million a year .
The savings would likely be much bigger today , because there are far more $ 1 bills in circulation now .
" The saving potential is very large , " Velde says .
The Mint has a constant reminder of its uphill battle :
The agency holds in storage more than 92.7 million uncirculated Sacagawea dollar coins created in 2000 and 2001 .
The presidential dollar coin program , which began with George Washington in February 2007 , is similar to the state quarters program .
The Mint is introducing four $ 1 coins each year depicting the presidents in the order in which they served .
The program is set to run at least through 2016 and will include only presidents who have died .
Despite the popularity of the state quarter program , the presidential dollar coins have not taken off , and interest appears to be waning .
Federal Reserve banks , which buy coins from the Mint based on demand from banks that serve consumers and businesses , bought 96 million of the Andrew Jackson coins , the seventh and latest in the series .
That is less than half the amount of Washington coins ordered .
One-quarter of the 2,513 adults surveyed online by Harris Interactive last March said they had seen the dollar coins .
Only 13 % favored the coins over paper dollars .
" Obviously , it has not worked particularly well by putting coins into the mainstream , " says Rep. Mike Castle , R - Del. , who originated the state quarters and led the effort for the presidential dollar coins .
He says he had hoped that more people would be asking for the coins at their local stores .
The Mint has made some headway while spending about $ 7 million on marketing the presidential dollar coin before the four - city pilot program launched in August .
The marketing budget has been devoted to more grass - roots efforts , such as launch events for each of the coins .
The Mint has also been promoting education programs about the presidents in conjunction with the coins ' releases .
A number of transit systems , including New York City's , are giving change in dollar coins .
Moy says their research shows that about two - thirds of Americans have at least heard of the dollar coins and notes that there have been far more orders for the presidential dollar coins than for Sacagawea .
The government of Ecuador , which uses the dollar , ordered $ 2.24 million of Sacagaweas during the first week of September , helping reduce the Mint 's stockpile .
Studies , including those from the Government Accountability Office , the investigative arm of Congress , have found that consumers will embrace dollar coins only if dollar bills are pulled from circulation .
Other countries have done away with their low - denomination bills .
Canada has replaced its one - dollar and two - dollar notes with coins .
In Europe , the smallest euro paper note is 5 euros , or the equivalent of about $ 6.70 .
Congress is responsible for determining the nation 's currency .
" Human beings are creatures of habit and Americans even more so , " Moy says .
" The United States is lagging behind , but we eventually think we will catch up . "

VIA may be ditching its traditional motherboard business , but it looks like its not wasting any time in stepping up its efforts to get its more specialized boards and chipsets into as many devices as possible , and it's now taken advantage of the Taipei International Robot Show to show off their potential for robotics .
Leading the way is Lynxmotion 's Johnny 5 robot above ( yes , that 's actually its name ) , which has been outfitted with VIA 's new EPIA P700 board and VX800 unified chipset just for the show .
That , VIA says , offers a whole host of advantages over other systems , including " far easier " software development .
Of course , VIA also sees plenty of potential beyond hobby kits , with it also showing off an EPIA Mini-ITX - based version of the Vecna Battlefield Extraction - Assist Robot ( or BEAR ) , and it touting the benefits of its Pico - ITX platform for all sorts of " extremely space constrained robotics designs .

" Pluralitas non est ponenda sine necessitate , " I say .
No , no , do n't flee in fear of Latin , I am merely referring here to that well - known notion called Occam 's razor .
Its guiding principle is often summarized as : " All other things being equal , the simplest solution is the best . "
What I want to show you in this column is the confusion that comes about in science and the reporting of science when you try to find a simple solution to what increasingly looks like a complex problem .
Think of it as being sliced and diced — and then fricasseed — by Occam 's razor .
That issue at hand is the attempt to narrow down the cause of Type 1 diabetes — formerly known as juvenile diabetes — which has a variety of incidence rates around the world .
Unlike Type 2 diabetes , whose cause is strongly associated with excess weight , up until now scientists have not been sure what causes Type 1 .
Then in late June what was described as a " new " study came out that linked increasing rates of the disease in children to the amount of sunshine they are exposed to .
Ergo , the closer to the equator you lived , the less likely you were to get the disease .
The paper then suggested that this could be linked to lower levels of vitamin D , which sunlight creates in the body , and accordingly vitamin D deficiency is the likely cause of Type 1 diabetes .
And this meant a potential cure was at hand .
" The research suggests that Type 1 diabetes may be preventable with a modest intake of vitamin D3 for children , ideally with five to 10 minutes of sunlight around noontime when good weather allows , " said Cedric Garland , University of California at San Diego professor of family and preventative medicine , and one of the authors of the report .
And accordingly , doctors and nutritionists should prescribe vitamin D to all kids living in higher latitudes " without further delay . "
U - shaped curve , a ' smile '
To help make the argument , the study had a graphic showing a U - shaped curve , which one reporter described as a " smile " graph .
It was alleged to show low diabetes Type 1 levels in kids living near the equator and higher levels as you moved toward the less sunny poles .
So what 's the problem ?
The first thing to know is that the American authors themselves had n't generated any of their own data , but had taken incidence levels collected around the world and first published by Finnish researchers in a 2000 paper .
Only , when you looked carefully at that data you found yourself scratching not just your head , but every scratchable body part .
It turns out that the area on the planet with the highest level of Type 1 diabetes is the sunny , sunny Italian island of Sardinia .
Novosibirsk in Siberia ( think a locale situated north of Flin Flon ) , had an incidence rate less than one - third that of Kuwait , two - and - a - half times lower than Puerto Rico , and below that of Sao Paolo and parts of Tunisia .
Huge disparities existed between what amounted to next - door neighbours .
The rate in Puerto Rico was about 17.4 new cases yearly per 100,000 kids , but in Cuba the rate was 2.9 new cases .
Ethnicity made a monumental difference .
No place in China had a high rate , even when you travelled to Harbin — which is north of most of Mongolia and on a line with Ottawa .
Nonetheless , Harbin 's rate was less than a quarter that of Hong Kong , which is situated more than 2,800 kilometres to the south .
Not to mention that the estimated rates in the Finnish paper for Sao Paolo were roughly the same as in Tierra del Fuego , some 5,000 kilometres to the south .
With this jumble of data in hand , the Finnish researchers rather humbly wrote : " The earlier reported polar - equatorial gradient in the incidence does not seem as strong as previously assumed , but the variant seems to follow ethnic and racial distribution in the world population . "
In other words , while there is some general increase as you move toward the poles , it now looks as if something genetic is the chief cause of this disease .
Doing the math
Finally , the American paper had an odd bit of statistical jiggling .
The Finnish paper reports on boys and girls , and then gives a combined average yearly incidence number for both .
The California paper only produced the boys ' data .
What 's going on here ?
What explanation did the San Diego group have for the high rates in Sardinia , the low rates in Novosibirsk , and the Puerto Rico - Cuba paradox , the Sao Paolo and Tierra del Fuego disconnect ?
I e-mailed Garland and asked , and he replied that the data was confusing .
" We are extremely interested in the high rates of Type 1 diabetes in Sardinia .
It is anyone 's guess about the reasons .
Our guess is that it could be that some residents of the island have an unusual dietary intake pattern , or a higher - than - usual prevalence of an inborn defect in metabolism of vitamin D that interferes with absorption , metabolism or action of vitamin D. "
As to Novosibirsk : " Here we also must guess , as there is no international database on vitamin D supplements .
Low rates at high latitudes are likely to be due to vitamin D supplements or cod liver oil that are given to children to prevent rickets . "
Puerto Rico and Cuba ?
Again a guess : " Puerto Rico , as a U.S. territory , has a modern development level .
Air conditioning is available in the cities , and many people work indoors and are free from most required outdoor work that involves exposure to the noonday sun , " he replied .
" Cuba is less developed from an economic perspective .
Many Cubans must work outdoors in agrarian activities , such as sugar cane culture and cutting , which requires them to be outdoors in the sun near noon .
These factors could increase the dose of UVB for Cubans per unit of solar UVB available compared to citizens of Puerto Rico . "
The paper itself tried to explain the high rates in Kuwait as a function of people — most notably women — covering up and not getting high doses of sun exposure .
Clearly , nothing seems simple or obvious .
So why the two different interpretations of the data ?
" Different people sometimes see different patterns .
We recognized a signature pattern of data points by latitude that is in general associated with vitamin D deficiency diseases , " Garland wrote in an e-mail .
There was no explanation of why the Finnish interpretation had n't been mentioned .
But the most interesting answer related to why the boys were used .
" Because Type 1 diabetes occurs equally in males and females , we chose to display data only on males in order to save space , " he said .
That really does n't make any sense , because all you have to do is put in a single combined data point .
But I have another explanation — Tierra del Fuego .
A tiny survey there found only boys with the disease — four of them .
Far end of smile flattened
It was the only group in the survey of 51 regions for which there were no male / female numbers provided .
This created an incidence rate of 20 per 100,000 .
The Finnish group responded to this by an averaging of males and females — my guess based on the rates in the rest of the country .
This reduced the new incidence rate to eight per 100,000 — the same as in Sao Paulo .
If you use the eight figure , the far end of the smile graphic which now goes through Tierra del Fuego gets flattened .
The visual punch of the findings , the cause - and - effect line , dissolves .
Given all these contradictions , complications and confusions , why does Garland insist on a vitamin D connection ?
Why use an Occam 's razor approach to reduce diabetes Type 1 to a simple explanation when the data does n't suggest simplicity ?
You must understand that Garland and his brother Frank have been arguing since the early 1980s that lack of vitamin D causes cancers of various sorts .
They are now part of a group of scientists and nutritionists leading the charge to increase vitamin D dosages for people for a host of health reasons .
That is to say , they look at the world through a vitamin D deficiency lens , and I think what they see in the data is what they want to see .
While there is a statistically valid trend toward increasing Type 1 incidence as you leave the poles , there are literally dozens of places that go against that trend .
Accordingly , it seems to me to insist on a vitamin D / sunlight connection is to turn Occam 's razor into Occam 's sledgehammer .
Media ignored apparent disconnect
And how did the media report this tangle , these contradictions , these mysteries ?
How did they temper the paper 's " take vitamin D now " message for parents worried about their children 's future health ?
I could not find a single media source that reflected on the apparent disconnect between sunlight and disease incidence .
The words China or Cuba or Sardinia or Novosibirsk never appeared anywhere ( media coverage can be seen at Google News using the search terms " Garland + vitamin D + diabetes " ) .
No one talked about the contradictions highlighted by the Finns in their paper — a paper , by the way , freely available on the internet .
No one seemed to ask why only boys were included in the graph .
Why ?
My only conclusion is that it is easier to report and get published a simple truth than a complicated one , and that when given a chance journalists would rather look at headline - pleasing scientific conclusions than headline - displeasing scientific data .
Think of that as the basis of what I call Strauss ' Media Blindfold Principle .
And think of me as an old data grump .

The investigation looked at the Minerals Management Service A US government report has accused some interior department officials of unethical conduct while doing business with the oil and gas industry .
The report says several workers at the agency that collects drilling royalties received gifts from energy companies .
Some employees also partied with energy company representatives , having sex and taking illegal drugs , the report said .
The findings come as the US Congress is considering legislation to expand offshore oil drilling .
The report was the result of a two - year , $ 5.3 m ( £ 3 m ) investigation by the Department of the Interior 's inspector general , Earl Devaney .
Employees said they felt that in order to effectively perform their official duties , they needed to interact in social settings with industry representatives to obtain ' market intelligence '
Earl E Devaney , Inspector - General , US Department of the Interior
MMS Oil Marketing Group investigation ( 193KB )
The alleged improprieties occurred between 2002 and 2006 , and involved 19 former and current employees at the offices in Denver and Washington of the department 's Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) .
The officials were involved in the " royalty - in - kind " programme under which energy companies barter oil and gas to the government in return for permission to drill on federal land .
Mr Devaney 's investigation uncovered a " culture of substance abuse and promiscuity " by a small group of individuals " wholly lacking in acceptance of or adherence to government ethical standards " .
He said a third of the 55 staff at the Denver office were found to have socialised with and received a wide array of gifts from companies with which they were doing business .
US federal employees are banned from receiving gifts above $ 20 .
Several members of staff in one office admitted to illegal drug use as well as being " engaged in brief sexual relationships with industry contacts " , he added .
" Sexual relationships with prohibited sources cannot , by definition , be arms - length , " Mr Devaney said in his report .
Taxpayers deserve to have confidence that their interests are being protected
Sen Jeff Bingaman
The inspector general said that many of those questioned did not believe federal government ethics standards and department policies had applied to them because of their " unique " role .
" Employees said they felt that in order to effectively perform their official duties , they needed to interact in social settings with industry representatives to obtain ' market intelligence ' , " Mr Devaney said .
A senior Democrat said it appeared that officials who were supposed to be looking out for taxpayers had instead been corrupted by gifts and a culture of ethical failure .
" American taxpayers deserve to have confidence that their interests are being protected when it comes to collecting royalties from the production of public oil and gas resources , especially given the potential for expanded domestic drilling , " said Sen Jeff Bingaman , chairman of the Senate Energy Committee .

Villa 1 , a woodland house in the Veluwe Zoom area near Arnhem in the Netherlands designed by architects Powerhouse Company , has been nominated for the Dutch Design Awards , which will be announced this weekend .
Beneath the glazed top floor is a sub- terranean living space in the basement .
The project has been nominated for the AM NAi prize 2008 and the ´best private interior ´category of the Dutch Design Awards .
The following information is from Powerhouse Company :
--
Powerhouse Company 's Villa 1 nominated for two design awards
Villa 1 of the Powerhouse Company has received nominations for two important Dutch Design awards ; the AM NAi prize 2008 and the Dutch Design Award 2008 .
Villa 1 was Powerhouse Company 's first commission after its foundation in 2005 .
The villa was completed at the beginning of this year .
Powerhouse Company also designed the garden , the interior and a couple of furniture pieces .
Set in the woodlands of Holland , the program of Villa 1 is oriented optimal towards the views on the terrain and the sun .
Half of the program is pushed below ground to meet local zoning regulations .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. stocks on Thursday sprinted to fresh five - year lows , with the major indexes slammed for a seventh straight session as financial shares and General Motors Corp. tanked and global credit woes spurred panic - stricken investors to flee equities .
" There are only two things that will turn this market around :
One is any sign that the credit markets are thawing out , and the second is we finally find a level at which stocks have finally become too cheap , " said Art Hogan , chief market strategist at Jefferies & Co .

JACKSON , Miss . 
As a Democrat running for the Senate in the Republican stronghold of Mississippi , Ronnie Musgrove faces a challenge that was summed up in the angry words of a middle - aged white voter doing business at the courthouse here this week .
“ I would n’t vote for him if he was the last man on earth , ” said Roger Case , an employee of a fire - extinguisher company , as Mr. Musgrove campaigned a few yards away .
Blacks in the courthouse beamed at Mr. Musgrove , a lanky former governor ; whites , mostly , looked the other way .
Mississippi has not elected a Democrat to an open Senate seat since 1947 , but that is not stopping the Democratic Party from heavily financing a major effort here , one of a handful of states  including North Carolina , Minnesota and possibly Oregon  it thinks it can pull from Republicans this fall in a reach for the filibuster - proof 60 - vote majority .
More than $ 3 million has been spent by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to support Mr. Musgrove ; turn on a television here and the candidates can be found flailing at each other ’s ethics , morals and probity in what local analysts say is a never - seen - before barrage of negative advertisements .

AIG executives , back from their spa retreat and British hunting trips , are busily back at work throwing tax dollars into the furnace .
In little over a month , the company has accessed $ 90.3 billion ( nearly three - quarters ) of the $ 122.8 billion in credit lines extended by the Fed in exchange for an 80 % stake in the company .
AIG chief Edward Liddy said that the company may soon have to ask for more money if the company is forced to post more collateral for bond holdings that it guaranteed but that are now being downgraded .
Under extreme pressure from NY Attorney General Andrew Cuomo , AIG has agreed to put a hold on paying out performance bonuses to former and current executives .
The impact of the AIG collapse is being felt far and wide .
Thirty municipal transit agencies , including those in Atlanta , Chicago , DC , San Francisco , and Los Angeles , are facing the prospect of being forced to come up with hundreds of millions of dollars .
The crisis is a result of complicated ( but legal ) tax dodges between the transit agencies and private banks ( explained here in the Washington Post ) .
Basically , the banks paid the agencies large sums upfront that would be repaid in installments over time .
Exploiting a loophole in the tax code , the banks saved hundreds of millions in taxes , but split the profit with the transit agencies .
The deals were guaranteed by AIG , but now that the insurer is on the skids and the federal government has declared an end to the tax dodge , the banks are demanding that cash - strapped transit agencies hand over hundreds of millions in cash in the next few weeks .
The demands may actually be a bargaining tactic to force Congress to extend the tax breaks .

Russia to create electromagnetic super weapon
Defense strategists place their stakes on high - tech weapons .
Nearly all superpowers of the world conduct their works in the development of such weapons .
It transpired recently that Russian scientists developed a generator , the capacity of which is comparable to that of a nuclear unit .
It is a genuine scientific breakthrough , and it is already clear that the defense industry will not be the only field where the new super device is going to be used .
Russia to create electromagnetic super weapon
An individual , who is miles away from physics and is only familiar with home electricity , will not be able to imagine the power of several billions of watts .
It will be even harder to imagine that such power can be generated by a device that is fit to be placed on a table .
“ The devices generating such power – billions of watts – used to be very large in size before .
This appliance has a very short impulse , which makes it possible to have it on a desk – it is a very compact device , ” the Director of Lebedev ’s Institute of Physics , Vice President of the Russian Academy of Sciences , Gennady Mesyats said .
Mikhail Yalandin , one of the creators of the miraculous machine , said that the scientists had assembled two of such devices in Yekaterinburg – a bigger and a smaller one .
Never before had a relatively small device ever been able to generate electromagnetic impulses the capacity of which could be comparable to a huge water power plant .
It is ten times as much as any foreign - made analogue .
The new device can be used practically anywhere .
The invention will let specialists create radar telescopes and radars of new generation .
Missile troops and defense departments on the whole will most likely be the first customers to order the appliance .
The new generators can also be used to check the stability of large energy objects and systems .
The device is capable of imitating the strays which appear as a result of a lightning strike or even a nuclear blast .
It is impossible to take photographs or film a video of the new generator in action because it immediately puts all electronic devices out of order .
The research that was used for the creation of such a device can be applied in the development of electromagnetic weapons .
“ No one has ever studied biological effects of such impulses .
It is obvious that it affects the electronic equipment near it .
Computers or cell phones have to be screened from such radiation , ” Mikhail Yalandin , a senior specialist of the Institute of Electrophysics said .
The device was called Nika , which means ‘ victory ’ .

A tank fires at militant movement detected at the edge of the town of Loi Sam
Entering the combat zone , we drive past mile after mile of flattened buildings , crops and trees , razed to prevent ambushes .
Even still , soldiers are on high alert , watchful for possible attacks .
They race down the road at top speed , firing occasional rounds from the guns mounted on the backs of their vehicles .
Cobra attack helicopters circle overhead .
This is the tribal area of Bajaur near the Afghan border , or rather a small part of it .
The Pakistan army has wrested control of a 38 km ( 24 - mile ) region from the Taleban , and it has given us rare access to the frontline .
We arrive in the town of Loi Sam , now in ruins .
Militants here were targeted by the air force and artillery , followed by a ground offensive that lasted five days .
Civilians fled long ago - hundreds of thousands have been displaced by the fighting .
Key crossroads
A tank guards one of the approaches to the town , firing whenever there is movement in the distance .
Already a bulldozer has begun clearing away the blasted shells of buildings .
" You have to either occupy or remove the structures , " says one soldier , " otherwise the militants will return to them once we 've left . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
For the army , this is a crucial victory : Loi Sam lies at a key crossroads between Afghanistan and Pakistan .
From here local and Afghan insurgents could launch attacks in both countries .
" The militant activities from this tribal agency were radiating in different directions , towards Afghanistan , the rest of the border region and [ Pakistan 's ] settled areas , " says army spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas .
" Now we have this area under control , it will affect militant activities elsewhere , and we 'll capitalise on that . "
" The worst is over , " agrees Maj Gen Tariq Khan , who is in charge of the offensive .
" I think we have turned the corner . "
Guerrilla warfare
The battle has been slow and deliberate .
It took six weeks for the army to secure the road from the headquarters of the local security forces , the paramilitary Frontier Corps ( FC ) , to Loi Sam , a distance of 13 km .
Troops fought compound to compound in a terrain ideal for guerrilla warfare .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The Taleban has made extensive use of bunkers and tunnels which connected different compounds .
One commanding officer , Maj Kamal , took me 5 m underground for a tour of the network .
He says his men blocked 20 or 30 passageways , including one that stretched 100 m to a stream .
Many in Bajaur trace the roots of the uprising to a suspected US missile strike on an Islamic seminary , or madrassa , in November 2006 , which killed around 80 people .
That radicalised local Islamists , they say , who were reinforced by militants from other Pakistani tribal areas .
There was also an influx of fighters from Afghanistan .
Until and unless Afghanistan is made stable , you can do a million development activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , and there will be no result
Shafir Ullah
Government representative in Bajaur
Villagers take on Taleban
The battle for Bajaur was triggered when the FC tried to re-establish a check post in Loi Sam in early August .
Fierce resistance led to the siege of the FC base before the army was called in .
Like other army officers , Maj Gen Tariq
Khan criticises unilateral US air strikes on suspected insurgent targets as deeply counter productive .
But , he says , during the Bajaur operation there has been improved intelligence sharing and co-ordination with coalition forces , which has reduced cross - border militant infiltration from Afghanistan .
" We 've seen practical on - ground adjustments in relevance to our operations , " he says .
" I 've got a very positive response and I feel we 've set up some system in which we 're in some kind of regular touch , and I think that 's the way to go . "
Hearts and minds
Now that the fighting has subsided , attention is turning to reconstruction and development : acknowledgement that winning hearts and minds in the impoverished tribal region along the border is essential to fighting the insurgency .
But that wo n't be enough , says Shafir Ullah , the government representative in Bajaur who deals with tribal elders .
" The reasons [ for the insurgency ] are poverty , backwardness and others , but the real problem is linked with Afghanistan , " he says .
" Until and unless Afghanistan is made stable , you can do a million development activities in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas , and there will be no result . "
The Taleban have been pushed back - the army claims it has killed 1,500 - but they have n't been defeated .
Two soldiers were killed by rocket fire in Loi Sam shortly after we left the town , bringing the army 's death toll to 75 .
Nearly 100 civilians have also died , says Shafir Ullah .
One hillside post is so exposed to Taleban fire that the soldiers have dug in for protection .
Forty men can fit in the massive bunker at any one time , a few are saying their prayers and reciting the Koran in a makeshift underground mosque when we visit .
This is not a popular war in Pakistan : some have criticised the military for killing fellow Muslims .
Others accuse it of fighting " America 's War " .
But the army insists it is fighting to defend Pakistan , not just responding to US pressure for action against the Taleban .
Even as dusk falls artillery guns continue to pound militant positions .
The war in Afghanistan has spilled over into Pakistan .
This is the other , rarely seen , side of the battle against the Taleban .

Scientists are understandably concerned about the impact that thawing and decaying permafrost will have on the world ’s climate .
Methane is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) , and there ’s a massive amount of organic matter stored in the world ’s permafrost , up to 1/ 6 the entire amount of carbon in the atmosphere just in North America ’s permafrost , never mind offshore methane hydrates and permafrost in Asia that is already showing signs of melting .
And now the New York Times and Bloomberg , among others , are telling their readers that arctic permafrost may not hasten global warming .
Unfortunately , while they ’re technically correct , there ’s also a great deal more going on than just a competing scientific paper about whether or not permafrost will impact global heating .
First , let ’s examine the two article ’s titles ( which are representative of other articles on the same study in the journal Science ) .
The NYTimes article is titled “ Permafrost May Survive Global Climate Change , New Evidence Suggests ” and the Bloomberg article is titled “ Arctic Permafrost May Not Hasten Global Warming , Study Says ” .
In both cases , however , the titles state more certainty about permafrost than the actual scientific paper , and in fact the NYTimes article has a quote from one of the paper ’s authors that contradicts the article ’s title :
“ But I do n’t want people to think we do n’t have to worry about global climate change , ” Dr. Froese said .
“ The top couple of yards of permafrost are still quite likely to melt as temperatures warm , and there is plenty of carbon stored in them . ”
In other words , some of the permafrost is likely to survive while the rest of it is likely to thaw and start releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere .
In addition , the authors of the paper appear to have gone looking for the oldest permafrost and ice they could fine , not necessarily the most representative sample of the ice .
According to the Bloomberg article :
The soil examined is the oldest - known permafrost in North America , the research said .
If we take this statement on face value as an accurate statement of the paper ( and since I ca n’t find the actual paper free online , just its abstract , I ’ll have to ) , then this means something that neither article discusses : if the oldest permafrost is 700,000 years old , that means all of the rest of the permafrost has thawed at least once between today and 700,000 years ago .
Dr. Froese says that all the other permafrost has thawed out since 700,000 years ago at least once .
There ’s a massive amount of carbon in the upper two meters of permafrost in North America alone .
So yes , some permafrost may survive global climate change , and the little bit of still frozen permafrost that survives wo n’t release what little carbon it holds into the air to hasten global warming .
But for some reason , my concerns about thawing permafrost dumping gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere have n’t been alleviated .

Abrupt climate change is when the climate of a region , possibly even the Earth as a whole , hits a so - called tipping point and the climate changes irreversibly and rapidly .
According to an article in Science Daily , abrupt climate change is now being studied by several U.S. national labs .
Specifically , the national labs will be looking at the mechanisms that would lead to abrupt climate change , as well as what the world ’s climate would likely look like after the change occurred .
Specifically , the article says that the labs are looking at the following “ Four Horsemen of the Apocolypse ” :
instability among marine ice sheets , particularly the West Antarctic ice sheet ; positive feedback mechanisms in subarctic forests and arctic ecosystems , leading to rapid methane release or large - scale changes in the surface energy balance ; destabilization of methane hydrates ( vast deposits of methane gas caged in water ice ) , particularly in the Arctic Ocean ; and feedback between biosphere and atmosphere that could lead to megadroughts in North America .
In the event that the entire 3.8 million cubic kilometers of ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt suddenly , sea levels globally would rise between 4 and 6 meters ( 13 to 20 feet ) , flooding huge amounts of coastline .
If this was on top of the expected Greenland melting , the total combined sea level rise would be more like 11 to 13 meters ( 36 to 43 feet ) .
If you want to see what that would do the coasts around the world , this site is a great visual reference .
The big concern with the subarctic forest and permafrost positive feedbacks is a shutdown of the Gulf Stream and other oceanic currents that keep Europe reasonably temperate and habitable .
The concern with the thawing of methane hydrates is that they ’ll release massive amounts of methane into the atmosphere in the Arctic ( where the hydrate deposits are most vulnerable to release due to other effects ) and kick global heating into overdrive as well as kill off some of the world ’s most productive ocean regions .
And megadroughts in North America could turn the high plains into a sand dune desert as it has been in the past or change the yearly monsoon rain patterns rapidly in unpredictable ways ( local flooding , years of drought , lowered water table , etc. ) .
The point of all this is to understand what the warning signs of abrupt climate change are early enough to be able to stop it .
Because , by definition , if any one of these four things happens , it ’ll overwhelm civilization ’s ability to adapt , at least for a while .
The High Plains turning into a sandy desert as the thin topsoil blows away in a megadrought does n’t sound good to me , especially when there ’s an example of what it might look like already happening in Oklahoma .
— — —-
According to the London Independent , scientists have just completed a voyage along Russia ’s entire Arctic coast and discovered something unexpected and very bad : methane is being released from hydrate deposit in large quantities .
As discussed above , massive releases of methane into the air is one of the concerns about abrupt climate change , and the article says that there are areas off the Russian cost where methane concentrations in the air and water are 100 times greater than the normal background level .
According to the article , the areas affected by higher than usual methane concentrations cover “ several tens of thousands of square kilometres , amounting to millions of tons of methane , ” possibly equal in magnitude to previous estimates of methane emissions from the entire global ocean .
And for the first time , instruments recorded methane being released in such large concentrations that the seawater was n’t able to dissolve the gas entirely before it reached the surface , creating “ chimneys ” of methane bubbles from the ocean bottom to the surface .

Another study that came out recently discovered something that bodes poorly for companies and individuals hoping to use plants as carbon offsets .
According to the study , as reported by the Christian Science Monitor , heat - stressed plants in at least one ecosystem ( Oklahoma prairie ) not only do n’t absorb as much CO 2 as they do under baseline climate conditions , but they also do n’t absorb as much CO 2 the following year either .
If these results hold for other ecosystems as well , then this could lead to long - term problems with carbon offset accounting and climate modeling .
There are already questions about how well boreal forest absorbs CO 2 , and if all ecosystems are found to be sensitive to relatively short hot spells like the Oklahoma prairie was , then CO 2 absorption will become an even bigger unknown than it already is .
— — —-
Arguably , the largest single unknown in all climate models is insufficient knowledge of how global heating will affect the water cycle .
Warmer weather means more water vapor in the air , which may mean more clouds and higher reflectivity of solar energy – or , with the addition of aerosol pollution , more localized heat as clouds reflect the heat back at the surface .
Similarly , more water vapor means more precipitation of all kinds , meaning more flooding , but also potentially more snow .
According to New Scientist , new data shows that reduced pollution and warmer temperatures as a result of higher greenhouse gas concentrations has brought about higher precipitation .

In May , the Carboholic reported that Cisco DeVries of Berkeley , California had thought up a way for the city of Berkeley to help homeowners pay for photovoltaic panels on their homes – assess the cost in property taxes .
According to the NYTimes last week , Mr. DeVries ’ proposal was unanimously approved by the Berkeley city council .
The pilot program is only expected to work for about 50 homes , but if successful could be expanded to hundreds or thousands of homes and to other high cost home improvements like adding insulation throughout the walls and / or replacing single - paned windows with double - paned windows .
The expected cost to homeowners who opt in is about another $ 180 in property taxes that will stay with the home even if the owners sell the home and move , but some amount of that increase would be offset by lower utilities bills .
And according to the article , this plan is being watched closely by mayors and city councils around the country for possible implementation in their own cities and towns .
And , if it works out , all the home remodeling will provide thousands ( or more ) of new green construction jobs .

According to Canada.com , environmental groups and some investors are suggesting that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) require companies who extract oil from Canadian tar sands to report the impacts of such extraction on the climate .
The SEC announced plans to reclassify tar sands as oil resources instead of the current “ mining ” resource classification , and the letter that the investors and environmental groups sent was in response to this announcement .
According to the article , the letter says that the signatories are worried that tar sands will ultimately become “ uneconomic ” .
The article quotes Meritas CEO Gary Hawton as saying “ We think investors should be made fully aware of those risks , ” and that those risks include “ financial , environmental , social and ‘ reputational risks . ' ”
In response , Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers vice - president of markets and fiscal policy Greg Stringham said the following :
“ Investors can inform themselves through the government of Canada ” about carbon emissions and other costs facing oilsands projects as they can with all the other issues associated with biofuels or natural gas production or off - shore ( resources ) .
All of that is readily available to the investor , so it does n’t have to be in the SEC regulation . ”
In some sense , Stringham is right – the information is available , and hard - core investors will probably look it up .
But I wonder how many investors ever research beyond the most basic documents that they ’re mailed every year .
They should , but most will not .

Nanotechnology is not a single technology in and of itself , but is rather an set of technologies and processes that enable other advances .
According to Science News , a new nanotech - enabled method to convert sorbitol to hydrocarbons has been demonstrated .
This technology uses 2 - nanometer specks of a platinum - rhenium alloy on pure carbon to produce gaseous oxygen and hydrocarbons under laboratory conditions .
The produced hydrocarbons can be converted into gasoline or used as feedstock for plastics and other chemicals .
The main advantage of this production method is that at least one form of sugar can be converted into traditional fuels like gasoline directly instead of relying on bacteria or yeast to biologically produce ethanol , a fuel that is difficult to handle and lower energy , and this might lead to truly renewable and sustainable sources for gasoline .
There are a number of significant problems , however .
First , sorbitol is the only sugar this new chemistry works with , and so more research needs to done to expand the number of sugars this process is effective on .
Second , according to the article , Stefan Czernik , senior scientist at the National Bioenergy Center of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , says that , while producing sorbitol from cellulosic feedstock is possible , it ’s not cheap either in either economic or energy balance terms .
Third , the catalysts use a platinium - rhenium alloy , and those two metals are among the most expensive metals there are .
And fourth , the process needs to be scaled up from the laboratory to the scale of industrial fuel production .
In other words , there ’s a lot more research here that needs to be done , but if the researchers have the time and money to do the research , their new nanotech - enabled chemical process has great potential .

Cecilia left this comment on my blog :
hi
I just recently discovered your blog & visit daily .
I am so undecided about this election … I read what your saying & I totally agree with you , but then I speak to someone on the right & then I agree with them .
I am having such a hard time with this election …
I cant seem to find anything to help make up my mind .
Can anyone help ?
Thanks !
Oh Cecilia , bless your heart .
We have only been at this for two years , sweetheart .
There were over 40 debates during the primaries and most recently we have had three Presidential debates and one Vice Presidential debate .
Honey , I trust you can read .
Please do because this is important .
And I am not trying to be mean or dismissive .
It really is that important and you need to read about this stuff and believe me there are piles of stuff out there .
But … if you are not going to read anything else , I hope you ’ll chew on this :
Let ’s start with John McCain .
Picking Sarah Palin was John McCain ’s first big decision after winning the nomination .
In an earlier interview McCain said he did n’t know much about the economy but he would probably pick a Vice President who could help him on that .
Palin ?
Really ?
Palin .
She went to five colleges and finally got an undergraduate degree in journalism .
And if you have watched her interviews with journalists , you have to wonder how much of that degree sank in .
Sarah Palin – definitely not the sharpest tool in the shed .
She was mayor of Wasilla – a city population of 7,000 .
Then off to the governor ’s mansion in a state with a population of 700,000 .
Honestly , there are more beavers in Alaska than people .
But this is the person who is going to explain the complexities of one of the largest economies on the globe to John McCain .
I ’m pretty sure they do n’t have enough fingers and toes between them to count that high .
( By the way , I say one of the largest economies because under George W. Bush ’s Confederacy of Dunces the European Union flew past us . )
Now let ’s talk about taxes .
John McCain is working overtime to scare the hell out of all the Joe the Fill - in - the - Blank ’s out there .
He ’s trying to fool them into thinking that they actually make enough money to be worried .
That is the biggest joke the Republican party has managed to play on the good people of America .
Most of us do n’t even make enough money in a life - time to afford the membership into that club .
The idea of a progressive tax where the wealthy pay more in taxes than the poor is nothing new .
Not even close .
In fact 81 % of economist agree with the concept … and here is a real eye opener – until he crapped his pants about losing this election John McCain supported the concept as well .
Trust me , that dog do n’t hunt .
He will say anything to win at this point .
De-regulation of banks ?
He was for it , but now is against it .
He was for privatization of social security and now he is against it .
He was for the estate tax and now he is against it .
He used to have a spine and now he does n’t .
If I hear that McCain is a Maverick one more time I just might throw myself to the floor and break a hip .
A maverick is an independent individual who does n’t go along with a group or party .
If John McCain ’s a maverick I am one of those cheerleaders on the sidelines of Harold ’s beloved Dallas Cowboys .
Nobody seems to dispute that the Republican party led by George W. Bush got us into this mess but what everybody seems to forget is that Sarah Palin and John McCain are Republicans .
Look , when the Religious Right came knocking at the door of the RNC Membership Round - Up , someone should have turned out the porch lights and told everyone inside to be quiet until they went away … the same thing I do when those nice looking boys on bicycles with bibles come to my door .
But the Republicans opened that door , invited them in and now they have to live with that decision .
Cecilia , when was the last time a politician brought a tear to your eye… moved you deep in your soul ?
Honestly when was the last time you really felt that Americans could do anything if we put our hearts and minds to it ?
I am an old lady .
Most of my life politicians have moved me .
Most of my life I have felt that Americans can do anything if we put our hearts and minds to it .
It ’s been 8 long years .
I had almost forgotten what that felt like .
Thank you Barack Obama .
Thank you .
If you are undecided – and I am at a complete loss for how you could be – please consider the following :
Which party has been screaming terrorist , socialist , Marxist , murder him and kill him … and which party has been talking about hope and unity .
Which party has been throwing everything but the kitchen sink at you everyday for the past two weeks hoping to scare you into thinking that there is an Un - American part of the country … and which party has been sayng that there is no red America and no blue America but only the United States of America .
Which party thinks war is the answer to everything … and which party has suggested that maybe we need to sit down and talk this out to see if peace is possible .
Which Presidential candidate just gave a speech accusing Barack Obama of delaying the World Series game .
I mean of all things .
In fact , that is a lie .
But my god , that is the McCain talking point for the day ?
That ’s a small thing I know , but when Harold hears something on TV about sports , that ’s a big thing in our house .
So he checked .
It was a lie .
But McCain is counting on you to not check to see if he was telling the truth .
He is counting on Americans to be fat and lazy .
And as silly and ridiculous as that little lie is … what more do you need ?
He will lie to you to get your vote .
So tell me again why you are undecided ?
Oh yes I forgot .
The terrorists are going to get us .
Folks , I ’m tired of living in fear .
Life is too short .
How about we try hope and optimism again and see how that works .
It created the greatest nation in history and the world is better for it .
Thanks for stopping by everyone .
If I find out that you did n’t take the time to vote , I will ask Matthew to ban you from this web page blog .
I mean it .
Really .

Each winter , most of us break out extra blankets and sweaters to stay warm .
In the same way , it 's a good idea to outfit your home for winter weather .
You can get your windows ready for the cold by taking steps to block drafts , and then add even more insulating power by hanging window treatments such as thermal drapes or window quilts .
Take these easy steps now , and you can save energy and lower your heating bills this winter !
Window Basics
A good place to start winterizing your windows is to investigate whether they need basic repairs or air sealing measures .
If you 've noticed a draft coming from one or more of your windows , you 'll probably want to start by sealing the leaks with caulk , foam , or heat - shrinking plastic ?
all available at most hardware stores .
Also remember that some styles of windows are more energy efficient than others .
If your home has single - pane windows , you might consider investing in new high performance windows .
Although new windows are an expensive purchase , they pay for themselves over time in lower energy bills .
If you 're ready to buy new windows , try these tips to find the best type for your needs .

Window Dressing
No matter what style of windows you have , they 're often the weak spot in your home 's envelope , because the glass does n't slow the transfer of heat .
To provide more insulating power , turn to insulated window coverings .
Commercial products .
You can find many brands of shades and drapes that are designed to provide extra insulation for your windows .
To compare products , look for window treatments that advertise their R- value , the higher the number the better the insulation they provide .
Feynman has often been described as a raconteur and I am sure he deserves that epithet without me justifying it or otherwise .
The reason he was called so was because of his extremely direct manner of explaining , in the simplest of terms , some of the most complex concepts of advanced physics .
His video lecture series was one of those myriad events which further reinforced his stature as a clear - headed genius .
Now , that is not as trivial as it may seem at first .
In my opinion , and arguably in an objective sense as well , the true measure of genuine understanding of any subject is the ability to express it without equivocation or self - doubt .
No doubt eloquence , directness of approach and pithiness are characteristics which are often innate ( and cultivable to a great extent through practice ) but these attributes notwithstanding , the skill to present the matter at hand in a fluid and intelligible manner – caressing the topic with the confidence and prowess of a professional and actually putting forth all the salient points without diluting the content , is true raconteurism .
Feynman was adept at that but recently I discovered another genius who actually surpasses him in this regard .
Come forth , Joshua Bloch !
To the true technologist , Joshua Bloch requires no further introduction .
He is the master and creator of the Java Collections framework ( which is one of the finest components of the Java platform ) , the java.lang .
Math package , the ‘ assert ’ mechanism ( amongst others ) and indeed has gone on to greater stature and achivements as Principal Engineer ( with special emphasis on being the Java guru in - house ) at Google .
I had heard of him before through his publications such as Effective Java , Java Puzzlers and Concurrency in Java and yet had never had the inclination ( call it laziness if you will ) to actually read past the titles .
The thought that came to my mind was “ Yet another Java book … how many of these darned things am I supposed to read before I actually master this constantly mutating platform ? ” .
This bring to mind another powerful concept that made sense to me long after I had been exposed to it .
It is called the ‘ Paradox of choice ’ .
The video is available here .
It is an excellent talk by Barry Schwartz .
Quite non-technical but I feel it has begun to be more pertinent to this industry than any other ( and will only continue to be more so ! ) .
As it so happened , one lazy afternoon when I was casually browsing through some Google Techtalks online , I came across this rather innocuous sounding title – “ How to design a good API and why it matters ” .
It would be a whole six months before I would watch that video !
When I finished watching that hour of pure technological operatic genius , my first reaction was that of dejection .
Yes , dejection at seeing the video end so soon !
The whole hour had gone off so smoothly and everything in the meantime just made such clear sense that it was nothing short of amazing .
I had been deeply engrossed in some major coding work in my current project and wished that I had seen this video two months back !
Uncannily though , I discovered , to my own smug contentment , that I had already followed most of the principles that were enunciated in the talk .
Some of the pertinent points that he puts forth are as follows and struck me as particularly useful are as follows :
1 . Whenever in doubt , leave it out !
This makes perfect sense .
As he says , every programmer who develops at least a module is an
API developer because the methods and the public components of his module form the contract
for any clients that actually use his module .
This maxim follows the logic that a component can
be added to an API later on , but can never be removed without breaking
existing functionality .
This also implies that any ‘ doubtful ’ functionality can always be harnessed
on later .
2 . The ideal size for a method paramater list is three or lesser .
If there are more , split
them and / or use helper classes
The example that he provides ( of a Win32 API call to draw a simple window ) in the video says it
all .
I found this principle very useful ( in retrospect ) when I was designing my modules ( I will
have a series of blogs on that very soon ) and was often in a bit of a quandary about the exact
scope of my utility methods .
The requirements at that point of time were pretty
much solidified and yet the use - cases were not yet finalized .
So it was more of a trade - off
between usability and genericity which leads us straight to the next
point .
3 . If the API makes everyone equally happy and leaves everyone equally unsatisfied ,
it ’s done its job
It ’s always a tight balance when designing an API – whether to make it extremely powerful ( and
invariably for a select group of stakeholders ) or to make it powerful enough ( and
thus for the majority of the stakeholders ) .
The latter is always preferred irrespective of the
scope of the applicability of the API .
The case which is moot in this regard is the VMware API –
generic enough to be almost bloated and yet powerful enough to be used by any client .
More
on the VMware APIs in upcoming weeks .
4. Exception handling is not just an escape mechanism but a means of controlling
the system flow
Now this is one part of the talk where Joshua could not allocate any time at all .
Considering
that the whole hour - long talk was filled with absolutely no pauses and no wastage of time , this
goes to show how the topic deserved more time than the standard hour allocated for Google
Techtalks .
Nonetheless , in my current project , this was the hardest nut to crack .
Exception
handling is an even finer balancing act than the design of the contract of the modules ( i.e. , the
methods ) as there is a huge state - space of possible control flow / processing paths .
The sad
truth is that this is often the part which is most often neglected .
I , however tried to have a
fairly robust and generic mechanism whereby there was a Exception class
with a corresponding ERROR code interface , which was placed in a common module so as
to allow clients to access and throw specific error codes .
The level of granularity is still being
refined as I find more use - cases and corner - cases .
In my opinionated opinion , the design
of the exception handling mechanism is the true measure of good or bad design .
5. Document ! Document !
Document !
Joshua recommends documenting every class ( what an instance of it represents ) , every method
( this forms the contract of the class after all ! ) , every parameter and return type ( mentioning the
types and units of the parameters ) .
How important this is can be estimated by this
example –
In my current project , I have over 400 , 000 lines of Java code modularized into a
dozen projects and hundreds of packages and sub-modules .
The real eye - opener is that there is
absolutely no documentation whatsover .
Okay , that sounded harsh .
Let me rephrase it thus –
There is not a single line of useful documentation .
If it were not for my considerable
intellectual gifts and a generally consistent design , it would be impossible to decipher the whole
mish - mash much less augment the functionality !
6 . Watch the video paisan !
In closing , I could go on about how profound my experience was watching this video and I could ramble on about about the merits of the whole experience ( gosh , it ’s almost sounding like I had a technological seance … which would n’t be far from the truth !
😉 ) but this post has already gone on too long and I am tired !
Just kidding …
I am busy in my epiphanic reading of ‘ Effective Java ’ , ‘ Java Puzzlers ’ and ‘ Concurrent Programming in Java ’ .
Peace !
One of the presenters at the recent C4 Mac developers conference made a point about Apple that is incredibly relevant to how the company is viewed , especially by the media and rabid Apple fans .
To paraphrase his statement , in dealing with Apple , one should never assume that the company is being malicious when its behavior can be just as easily explained by incompetence .
These days , there are a lot of iPhone developers — and users — who are suddenly rooting for incompetence .
Because when it comes to the entire machinery of the App Store , something is terribly wrong .
It ’s not something you may even notice today if you ’re an average iPhone user .
But in the end , if things do n’t change , what ’s happening right now may seriously weaken the iPhone as a platform and enable Apple ’s competitors to get the upper hand when it comes to dominating the smartphone market .
To say that those responsible for the administration of the App Store are actually incompetent is pure hyperbole .
Setting up the App Store has been a gargantuan task .
I know people enjoy assuming that complicated tasks are actually quite simple , but let ’s be real here .
In a very short period of time , Apple had to roll out a complete third - party development environment for programmers ( while still trying to get all the screws tightened on the iPhone 2.0 software — and look how well that turned out ) .
It had to set up a new infrastructure for selling software via iTunes and get all the legal documents and payment methods worked out .
And for some very good reasons , Apple created an application - approval process .
That ’s a lot of stuff in a very short period of time .
This year has been a tough one for Apple , and in many different venues we ’ve seen the company struggle with its success and its rapid growth .
Apple can only do so much , and with the App Store and iPhone development , it may have bit off more than it could chew .
But what was it to do ?
Macworld was certainly at the head of the line of pundits and developers who were banging their drums , demanding that Apple open the iPhone up to third - party development as soon as possible .
Apple certainly felt that pressure — as well as the opportunity to really transform the iPhone and iPod touch through a third - party development system .
But now that Apple has opened up the iPhone , we ’ve got a situation that ’s full of chaos and confusion and hurt feelings .
And it ’s time for Apple to explain what it ’s doing .
What ’s happened
If you have n’t been following the soap opera , let me give you a recap .
Apple has always said there would be limitations to what it would allow in the App Store .
Steve Jobs ’ slide during his roll - out of the App Store included the following traits that would prevent a program from appearing on the App Store : “ Porn , privacy , bandwidth hog , unforeseen , malicious , illegal . ”
Here ’s what Jobs said : “ Now , will there be limitations ?
Of course !
There are gonna be some apps that we ’re not going to distribute .
Porn , malicious apps , apps that invade your privacy .
So there are gonna be some apps that we ’re gonna say no to , but again , we have exactly the same interest as the vast majority of our developers , which is to get a ton of apps out there for the iPhone . ”
The first issue with Apple ’s filtering process is that it has frustrated developers by causing delays in getting apps up on the App Store .
Developers can wait weeks after submitting a finished product or update before it ’s rolled out to customers .
The second , and much larger issue , has to do with Apple not being clear on its policies about accepting and rejecting applications .
In fact , saying Apple ’s policies are unclear is quite an understatement .
They ’ve been confusing , arbitrary — and cloaked in mystery due to Apple ’s blanket iPhone non-disclosure agreement ( as my colleague Dan Moren writes about today ) .
Apple accepted ( then later rejected ) NetShare , an application that shares your iPhone ’s digital cellular connection with your Mac .
That use violates AT&T ’s terms of use , so removing the NetShare from the App Store made some sense .
( There ’s an entire conversation I could have about how AT&T is stupid not to offer connection - sharing a la NetShare as an add - on to the standard iPhone contract , but we ’ll save it for another day . )
Apple also killed off an app called I Am Rich that did nothing but cost $ 1000 .
This points out the importance of the App Store having a solid return policy , if nothing else .
But then things got weird .
Apple rejected an app that shows a butcher knife and makes a shocking noise .
And an app that makes fart noises .
And a comic book with some graphic content .
Some developers reported having their applications rejected for not following Apple ’s interface guidelines .
And then things got downright ridiculous .
Apple rejected the application Podcaster , because it duplicated “ the functionality of the Podcast section of iTunes . ”
Funny , I do n’t see that in Apple ’s list of items that would bar a program from the store .
In fact , one of the biggest limitations of the iPod app on the iPhone is its inability to update podcasts without connecting to a computer .
The Podcaster app was improving on Apple ’s lackluster implementation of its own technology , and got kicked out of the store because of it .
Next up : MailWrangler , a simple app that lets you view your Google Mail from multiple accounts .
It was rejected for duplicating Apple functionality “ without providing differentiation or added functionality , which will lead to user confusion . ”
Horrors !
But I did n’t see “ user confusion ” on that slide at the App Store announcement event .
Why this is terrible
I ’d like to believe that these things are happening because Apple ’s still trying to get its act together , and not because it ’s decided to exert Soviet - style control over the App Store , blocking out all potential competition .
But here ’s the thing :
Even if that ’s true , developers are getting fed up .
( To hear from a developer about this very topic , check out our latest Macworld Podcast , featuring Rogue Amoeba ’s Paul Kafasis . )
Now you , as a user , may say something along these lines :
Why does it matter to me ?
Maybe these developers are a bunch of spoiled brats , and they should just shut up and keep making money hand over fist from the App Store like those guys who wrote Trism .
If you do n’t want to sympathize with developers , let me rephrase it to describe how this will affect users :
If developers are afraid to write programs for the iPhone that are n’t games , to - do lists , and tip calculators , for fear that all their hard work will be wasted by a malicious or capricious Apple rejection notice , they will stop writing programs for the platform .
And the well of innovative , interesting iPhone software will dry up .
But that ’s not all .
Some of them will turn to more open platforms , such as Google ’s Android , and start taking their good ideas there .
Which could transform phones running Android into full - featured devices that simply do more cool stuff than the iPhone , no matter how hard Apple tries to write its own software to catch up .
Which could , in time , lead to the iPhone becoming a marginalized and limited product , all of its potential exhausted by the idiocy of Apple ’s tight - fisted control of the App Store .
Yes , friends , I do think it ’s that serious .
If what we ’re seeing now is Apple policy — in other words , maliciousness instead of incompetence — it risks the entire future of the iPhone platform .
What Apple must do
Let ’s not kid ourselves :
There are plenty of people in Apple who know exactly what Apple needs to do to fix this .
The only question is , are they the ones in charge ?
If they are , then Apple ’s probably just waiting for the right time to announce that it ’s all been a big misunderstanding and now everything ’s hunky - dory .
But just for the record — and just in case Apple ’s behavior really is malicious rather than incompetent — let ’s go over what needs to be done .
( And before I start my list , let me recommend that you read the essay on this topic by Wil Shipley of Delicious Monster if you have n’t already , because Wil ’s got it right . )
First and foremost , Apple needs to come out with crystal - clear guidelines for the App Store .
If a developer invests tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in app development , they need to know that their app wo n’t be rejected .
Even if the guidelines are brutal and draconian , if they ’re clear and enforced consistently , nobody will be left holding the bag like the developer of Podcaster .
But let ’s go beyond that .
As Shipley writes , the right way to handle the App Store is to make it a free market .
( This is the approach Google is taking with Android , by the way . )
As Shipley writes : “ Publish all software submitted to Apple , as long as the software is n’t actively harmful to users , illegal , and does not violate Apple ’s agreements with cell phone vendors .
Period . ”
Apple needs to protect iPhone users from illegal and malicious software , absolutely .
But beyond that ?
It should not be Apple ’s job — nor is it in the company ’s best interests — to be an arbiter of taste .
( If Apple is concerned about children and the easily offended , might I suggest a voluntary ratings system for all apps , so developers can warn off such users ?
iTunes already has content warnings built into it for other media types and even some apps . )
In other words , if someone wants to write a fart - generation app , let them .
If someone wants to write a butt - ugly e-mail client that only connects to Yahoo Mail , let them .
Let the users ( and , here ’s an idea , those of us who write software reviews ) sort the wheat from the chaff .
Good ideas will flourish .
Bad ideas will , too , if they ’re popular enough , and that ’s okay .
But the bottom line is this : as long as developers have no reasonable expectation about what will happen when they submit software for App Store review , the platform will suffer .
Developers will get frustrated and shift development resources elsewhere .
And most importantly , it does n’t have to be this way .
Or as long - time Mac developer Brent Simmons put it the other day : “ Someone is making a mistake .
This behavior is definitely beneath the company that makes the software and hardware I adore and love developing for . ”
As always , the ball is in Apple ’s court .
For the sake of the iPhone ’s massive potential , here ’s hoping that Apple does the right thing , and soon .
Boy Genius just unveiled shots of what is very likely the Kindle 2 .
Notice the follow - up to the snowspeeder - like original Amazon e-book reader is more rounded , more early - iPod in its proportions , but still white with the same basic screen .
The cool sparkly LCD status bar seems to be gone , a joystick has replaced the clickwheel , and the other buttons are smaller for fewer accidental page turns .
No word on the availability of this baby , of course .
As you might expect , Boy Genius has quite a few more pictures , and more details too , so feel free to drop on over there to have a look .
We 'll be here when you 're ready to comment . [ BGR ]

Stewart : Palin can even make ' doggone genocide ... sound folksy ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Wednesday October 8 , 2008
Print This Email This Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin has started dragging old attacks on Barack Obama back into the campaign , insisting , " It 's really important for Americans to start knowing who the real Barack Obama is . "
The Daily Show's Jon Stewart , however , was more interested on Tuesday in finding out who the real Sarah Palin is .
" Excuse me , woman we met six weeks ago , " he asked .
" We want to know about you .
Is your husband a crazy secessionist ?
Did you fire that guy for not firing the guy you wanted him to fire ? "
Palin recently told a booing audience , " Our opponent is someone who sees America as imperfect enough to pall around with terrorists who targeted their own country .
...
One of his earliest supporters was a man , who -- according to the New York Times -- was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that , quote , launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the US Capitol . "
" Is there anything this woman can't make sound folksy ? " asked Stewart wistfully .
" ' And let 's not forget about that doggone genocide in Rwanda . ' "
Stewart then showed photos of William Ayers , the " domestic terrorist " to whom Palin had referred , in both his long - haired Weather Underground appearance of 40 years ago and his current innocuous - looking bald and bespectacled persona as a professor at the University of Chicago and " recipient of the 1997 Chicago Citizen of the Year Award . "
" I 'll tell you , " noted Stewart , " you know who might be very interested to hear about Barack Obama 's political ties to a former inciter of violence ?
An angry mob . "
Stewart then turned to Daily Show " senior polling analyst " John Oliver for insight , asking " Why is it really getting ugly ? "
Oliver explained that the election now depends on the 8 % of the voters who are still undecided and they " fall into a variety of categories . "
He displayed a pie chart breaking them down into the Chronically Insuecture , Racist Democrats , Attention Seekers -- and a whopping 45 % of Stupid .
The Stupid , Oliver explained , are " the swingest of the swing voters -- and they , as they always do , will decide this election . "
" Do stupid people vote ? " asked Stewart .
" Certainly , some will forget to , " acknowledged Oliver .
" Many will make simple mistakes -- eat their ballots , go into the voting booth only to urinate and leave . "
" But some will vote " Oliver emphasized , and " only personal attacks affect them .
...
And on November 4th , the election will be in their hands . "

Researchers hope the laser can help them get their hands on samples from Mars .
The search for past life on Mars just got a new tool in its tool belt with an instrument that zaps bits of minerals off rocks and analyzes those pieces for the remains of living cells .
NASA orbiters and rovers have found abundant evidence that liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars , and that evidence of water raises the possibility that the red planet once harbored life , even if only tiny microbes .
Other missions have looked at the question of life on Mars more directly .
The U.S. Viking missions of the 1970s and ' 80s tested Martian dirt for life directly , but did n't find it .
NASA 's Phoenix Mars Lander is approaching the end of its mission to analyze the ice - rich dirt of Mars ' arctic region for signs of organics .
But what scientists would really love is to get their hands on a sample of Mars and bring it back to Earth .
That 's where this instrument , which is being developed by researchers at the Idaho National Laboratory ( INL ) , would come in .
The instrument uses a " point - and - shoot " laser technique called laser desorption mass spectroscopy to analyze mineral samples .
The researchers focus a laser beam on a spot less than one - hundredth the width of a pencil point and the laser knocks off microscopic fragments of the mineral .
If there are any organics in the sample , the mineral fragments react with them to form ions ( atoms or molecules that have lost or gained an electron ) .
The instrument 's mass spectrometer can detect the ions and the team can study the pattern they create to see if it shows any signatures that could belong to specific biomolecules .
With funding from NASA 's Astrobiology program , INL 's Jill Scott and her team have been running tests with the instrument and what she calls " Earth analogs of Martian rocks " to see which minerals are the best bets for finding a strong signal in a Martian sample .
It will also give future missions to Mars a guideline for what minerals to pick up and bring home ; Scott 's team will be able to tell NASA , " Here 's your most promising choices .
Go after these . "
" Some minerals just do n't work well , " Scott said .
Iron oxides particularly do n't work , which Scott said is " too bad " because Mars is what she calls " the rust planet . "
So far , halite ( or rock salt ) and jarosite give distinct patterns when zapped if they have organic molecules in them .
The team has also tested thenardite samples take from the evaporated Searles Lake bed in California .
Thenardite is thought to be a component of the Martian surface and because it is left behind when lakes dry up , its presence could in a sample could mean that water — and hence life — was once present in the area .
Scott and her team also created artificial thenardite samples containing traces of stearic acid , which is left behind by dead cells , and glycine , the simplest amino acid used by life on Earth .
( Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins . )
All of the experiments showed a distinct ion pattern that did n't appear when thenardite was tested alone , suggesting that the pattern was showing a signature of the added biomolecules .
The biomolecules could be detected at concentrations as low as 3 parts per trillion , the researchers recently reported in the Geomicrobiology Journal .
Such high sensitivity is crucial to the search for signs of life on Mars because those signs could be very small .
" They 're probably going to be few and far - between , " Scott said .
NASA is planning on flying a different laser to zap rocks on the upcoming Mars Science Laboratory mission .
The laser will also give of dust that can be analyzed by mass spectrometers to learn their composition .
Why it 's better
There are other techniques that can detect organics in rocks , but they require extracting the organic material from samples , which can be " very sample - consuming and time consuming , " Scott said .
You can only bring so many samples back from Mars , and you do n't want to waste what you have , Scott said .
These other methods would also be impractical to do on Mars itself because of all the sample preparation involved .
" If you 're going to be doing this on Mars , you 're not going to want to do sample preparation , Scott said .
Scott and her team would like to work on making the instrument smaller so that it could be sent to Mars , opening up the sampling possibilities , but for now they lack the funding .
They are also working to improve the laser on the instrument , which is now only ionizing about 10 % of all the biomolecules in a sample .
This step would improve the instrument 's detection capabilities .
" There 's still a lot to be done , " Scott said .

The most cherished dream of conservative Washington is that liberalism can somehow be defeated , finally and irreversibly , in the way that armies are beaten and pests are exterminated .
Electoral victories by Republicans are just part of the story .
The larger vision is of a future in which liberalism is physically barred from the control room - of an " end of history " in which taxes and onerous regulation will never be allowed to threaten the fortunes private individuals make for themselves .
This is the longing behind the former White House aide Karl Rove 's talk of " permanent majority " and , 20 years previously , disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff 's declaration to the Republican convention that it's " the job of all revolutions to make permanent their gains " .
When I first moved to contemplate this peculiar utopian vision , I was struck by its apparent futility .
What I did not understand was that beating liberal ideas was not the goal .
The Washington conservatives aim to make liberalism irrelevant not by debating , but by erasing it .
Building a majority coalition has always been a part of the programme , and conservatives have enjoyed remarkable success at it for more than 30 years .
But winning elections was not a bid for permanence by itself .
It was only a means .
The end was capturing the state , and using it to destroy liberalism as a practical alternative .
The pattern was set by Margaret Thatcher , who used state power of the heaviest - handed sort to implant permanently the anti-state ideology .
" Economics are the method ; the object is to change the soul , " she said , echoing Stalin .
In the 34 years before she became prime minister , Britain rode a see-saw of nationalisation , privatisation and renationalisation ;
Thatcher set out to end the game for good .
Her plan for privatising council housing was designed not only to enthrone the market , but to encourage an ownership mentality and " change the soul " of an entire class of voters .
When she sold off nationally owned industries , she took steps to ensure that workers received shares at below - market rates , leading hopefully to the same soul transformation .
Her brutal suppression of the miners ' strike in 1984 showed what now awaited those who resisted the new order .
As a Business Week reporter summarised it in 1987 : " She sees her mission as nothing less than eradicating Labour Party socialism as a political alternative . "
In their own pursuit of the free - market utopia , America 's right - wingers did not have as far to travel as their British cousins , and they have never needed to use their state power so ruthlessly .
But the pattern is the same : scatter the left 's constituencies , hack open the liberal state and reward friendly businesses with the loot .
Grover Norquist , one of the most influential conservatives in Washington and the " field marshal of the Bush plan " , according to the Nation magazine , has been most blunt about using the power of the state " to crush the structures of the left " .
He has outlined the plan countless times in countless venues : the liberal movement is supported by a number of " pillars " , each of which can be toppled by conservatives when in power .
Among Norquist 's suggestions has been the undermining of defence lawyers - who in the US give millions of dollars to liberal causes - with measures " potentially costing [ them ] billions of dollars of lost income " .
Conservatives could also " crush labour unions as a political entity " by forcing unions to get annual written approval from every member before spending union funds on political activities .
His coup de grâce is that the Democratic Party in its entirety would become " a dead man walking " with the privatisation of social security .
Much of this programme has already been accomplished , if not on the precise terms Norquist suggested .
The shimmering dream of privatising social security , though , remains the great unreachable right - wing prize , and the right persists in the campaign , regardless of the measure 's unpopularity or the number of political careers it costs .
President Bush announced privatisation to be his top priority on the day after his re-election in 2004 , although he had not emphasised this issue during the campaign .
He proceeded to chase it deep into the land of political unpopularity , a region from which he never really returned .
He did this because the potential rewards of privatising social security justify any political cost .
At one stroke , it would both de-fund the operations of government and utterly reconfigure the way Americans interact with the state .
It would be irreversible , too ; the " transition costs " in any scheme to convert social security are so vast that no country can consider incurring them twice .
Once the deal has been done and the trillions of dollars that pass through social security have been diverted from the US Treasury to stocks in private companies , the effects would be locked in for good .
First , there would be an immediate flood of money into Wall Street ; second , there would be an equivalent flow of money out of government accounts , immediately propelling the federal deficit up into the stratosphere and de-funding a huge part of the federal activity .
Business elites
The overall effect for the nation 's politics would be to elevate for ever the rationale of the financial markets over such vague liberalisms as " the common good " and " the public interest " .
The practical results of such a titanic redirection of the state are easy to predict , given the persistent political demands of Wall Street : low wage growth , even weaker labour organisations , a free hand for management in downsizing , in polluting , and so on .
The longing for permanent victory over liberalism is not unique to the west .
In country after country , business elites have come up with ingenious ways to limit the public 's political choices .
One of the most effective of these has been massive public debt .
Naomi Klein has pointed out , in case after case , that the burden of debt has forced democratic countries to accept a laissez - faire system that they find deeply distasteful .
Regardless of who borrowed the money , these debts must be repaid - and repaying them , in turn , means that a nation must agree to restructure its economy the way bankers bid : by deregulating , privatising and cutting spending .
Republicans have ridden to power again and again promising balanced budgets - government debt was " mortgaging our future " , Ronald Reagan admonished in his inaugural address - but once in office they proceed , with a combination of tax cuts and spending increases , to inflate the federal deficit to levels far beyond those reached by their supposedly open - handed liberal rivals .
The formal justification is one of the all - time great hoaxes .
By cutting taxes , it is said , you will unleash such economic growth that federal revenues will actually increase , so all the additional government spending will be paid for .
Even the theory 's proponents do n't really believe it .
David Stockman , the libertarian budget director of the first Reagan administration , did the maths in 1980 and realised it would not rescue the government ; it would wreck the government .
This is the point where most people would walk away .
Instead , Stockman decided it had medicinal value .
He realised that with their government brought to the brink of fiscal collapse , the liberals would either have to acquiesce in the reconfiguration of the state or else see the country destroyed .
Stockman was candid about this : the left would " have to dismantle [ the government 's ] bloated , wasteful , and unjust spending enterprises - or risk national ruin " .
This is government - by - sabotage : deficits were a way to smash a liberal state .
The Reagan deficits did precisely this .
When Reagan took over in 1981 , he inherited an annual deficit of $ 59bn and a national debt of $ 914bn ; by the time he and his successor George Bush had finished their work , they had quintupled the deficit and pumped the debt up to more than $ 3trn .
Bill Clinton called the deficit " Stockman 's Revenge " - and it domin ated all other topics within his administration 's economic teams .
With the chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan himself speaking of " financial catastrophe " unless steps were taken to control Reagan 's deficit , Clinton was soon a convert .
He got tough with the federal workforce .
So - called virtues
George W Bush proceeded to plunge the budget into deficit again .
Indeed , after seeing how the Reagan deficit had forced Clinton 's hand , it would have been foolish for a conservative not to spend his way back into the hole as rapidly as possible .
" It 's perfectly fine for them to waste money , " says Robert Reich , a former labour secretary to Bill Clinton , summarising the conservative viewpoint .
" If the public thinks government is wasteful , that 's fine .
That reduces public faith in government , which is precisely what the Republicans want . "
In 1964 , the political theorist James Burnham diagnosed liberalism as " the ideology of western suicide " .
What Burnham meant by this was that liberalism 's so - called virtues - its openness and its insistence on equal rights for everyone - made it vulnerable to any party that refuses to play by the rules .
The " suicide " that all of this was meant to describe was liberalism 's inevitable destruction at the hands of communism , a movement in whose ranks Burnham had once marched himself .
But his theory seems more accurately to describe the stratagems of its fans on the American right .
And the correct term for the disasters that have disabled the liberal state is not suicide , but vandalism .
Loot the Treasury , dynamite the dam , take a crowbar to the monument and throw a wrench into the gears .
Slam the locomotive into reverse , toss something heavy on the throttle , and jump for it .
Mainstream American political commentary customarily assumes that the two political parties do whatever they do as mirror images of each other ; that if one is guilty of some misstep , the other is equally culpable .
But there is no symmetry .
Liberalism , as we know it , arose out of a compromise between left - wing social movements and business interests .
It depends on the efficient functioning of certain organs of the state ; it does not call for all - out war on private industry .
Conservatism , on the other hand , speaks not of compromise , but of removing its adversaries from the field altogether .
While no one dreams of sawing off those branches of the state that protect conservatism 's constituents - the military , the police , legal privileges granted to corporations - conservatives openly fantasise about doing away with the bits of " big government " that serve liberal ends .
While de-funding the left is the north star of the conservative project , there is no comparable campaign to " de - fund the right " ; indeed , it would be difficult to imagine one .
" Over the past 30 years , American politics has become more money - centred at exactly the same time that American society has grown more unequal , " the political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have written .
The resources and organisational heft of the well - off and hyper - conservative have exploded .
But the org anisational resources of middle - income Amer icans . . . have atrophied .
The resulting inequality has greatly benefited the Republican Party while drawing it closer to its most affluent and extreme supporters . "
In this sense , conservative Washington is a botch that keeps on working , constructing an imbalance that will tilt our politics rightward for years , a plutocracy that will stand , regardless of who wins the next few elections .
And as American inequality widens , the clout of money will only grow more powerful .
As I write this , the lobbyist - fuelled conservative boom of the past ten years is being supplanted by a distinct conservative bust : like the real - estate speculators who are dumping properties all over the country , conservative senators and representatives are heading for the revolving door in record numbers .
Plutocracy
The Democrats who have taken their place are an improvement , certainly , but for the party 's more entrepreneurial leaders electoral success in 2006 was merely an opportunity to accelerate their own courtship of Washington 's lobbyists , think - tanks and pressure groups staked out on K Street .
Democratic leaders have proved themselves the Republicans ' equals in circumvention of campaign finance laws .
Throwing the rascals out is no longer enough .
The problem is structural ; it is inscribed on the map ; it glows from the illuminated logos on the contractors ' office buildings ; it is built into the systems of governance themselves .
A friend of mine summarised this concisely as we were lunching in one of those restaurants where the suits and the soldiers get together .
Sweeping his hand so as to take in our fellow diners and all the contractors ' offices beyond , he said , " So you think all of this is just going to go away if Obama gets in ? "
This whole economy , all these profits ?
He 's right , of course ; maybe even righter than he realised .
It would be nice if electing Democrats was all that was required to resuscitate the America that the right flattened , but it will take far more than that .
A century ago , an epidemic of public theft persisted , despite a long string of reformers in the White House , Republicans and Democrats , each promising to clean the place up .
Nothing worked , and for this simple reason : democracy cannot work when wealth is distributed as lopsidedly as theirs was - and as ours is .
The inevitable consequence of plutocracy , then and now , is bought government .

Our New Web Sites
Visit our new web site for the work commencing in year 2008 under our Phase II NSF expansion grant , including the many new projects created under that grant .
And see the pages Transforming Instruction in Undergraduate Mathematics via Primary Historical Sources ( TRIUMPHS ) for continuing work commencing in 2015 to develop primary source projects ( PSPs ) and mini-PSPs for the content of all regular courses for mathematics majors , pre-service teachers , and other STEM discipline majors .
Any instructor of computer science or mathematics is invited to test any of our projects in the classroom for courses in discrete mathematics , combinatorics , graph theory , algorithm design , logic , abstract algebra , foundations of mathematics , or the history of mathematics .
Here is a list of projects to be written under a Phase II expansion proposal .
For further information , contact either Jerry Lodder or Desh Ranjan above .
This site offers written curricular materials , based on primary historical sources , for beginning and advanced undergraduate courses in discrete mathematics and computer science .
Such courses , which often cover combinatorics , deductive reasoning ( logic ) and algorithmic thought , draw a variety of majors , ranging from computer science , mathematics , the physical sciences and engineering to secondary education .
Traditional methods of instruction follow `` The Modern American Discrete Mathematics Text , '' which although thorough and mathematically precise , present the material as a fast - paced news reel of facts and formulae , often memorized by the students , with the text itself offering only passing mention of the motivating problems and original work which eventually found resolution in modern concepts such as induction , recursion , or algorithm .
Our site offers written projects for a course in discrete or finite mathematics with the projects containing excerpts from primary sources for students to read along with a sequence of directed questions which illuminate how the source develops key mathematics ideas .
Particular advantages of the historical approach include providing context and direction for the subject matter , honing the students ' verbal and deductive skills through reading the original work of some of the greatest minds in history , and the rediscovery of the conceptual roots common to discrete mathematics and computer science .
Additionally , students practice the skill of moving from verbal descriptions of problems to precise mathematical formulations , and must often recognize an organizing concept for a detailed procedure .
Such abilities are vital not only for mathematics and the sciences , but especially today for software engineers , who must translate a verbal request into precise code changes , and then realize what effect these changes will have on the global structure of a large program or a body of interacting programs .
When working on an historical project , a student spends one to two weeks , either as an individual or in a group , writing a detailed paper , with two or three projects together counting for a significant percentage ( about 50 % ) of the course grade , and often taking the place of two one - hour examinations .
A written paper allows the students to organize their own thoughts , react to the original sources in much the same way as the contemporaries of the historical masterpiece , and explore the development of ground - breaking ideas .
The written historical project builds naturally on the idea of calculus projects [ CG ] , used extensively here at New Mexico State University .
To exemplify the historical approach , what better way to see induction in action than to read from Blaise Pascal 's ( 1623 -- 1662 ) ``Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle ' ' [ P1 ] , in which Pascal notices a pattern in the ratio between consecutive entries in the same base of his triangle ( Pascal 's Twelfth Consequence ) , and then claims that the pattern holds in every base of the triangle , since if it holds in a given base , then it persists to the next base .
It would be a wonderful exercise for students to read Pascal 's original statement , explore its truth with a few concrete numerical values , and then grapple with the logic behind what today is known as induction .
The students ( and teachers ) witness first hand the genesis of abstract concepts , and with a bit of historical background , realize that Pascal was motivated by solving actual problems of his day , such as computing the odds in a game of chance , or finding the summation of powers , with the eventual goal of computing area under curves .
Another advantage to reading Pascal 's original work is that the ratios between consecutive entries that he derives lead to the modern formula for binomial coefficients , a formula which is often announced today without exploration of its historical origin .
By contrast , modern textbooks often give an abstract logical formulation of induction first , and then , as homework , simply ask the students to verify statements the ( textbook ) author already knows to be true , such as the sum of i 2 from i = 1 to n is ( 1/3 ) n 3 + ( 1/2 ) n 2 + ( 1/6 ) n , without mentioning why or how anyone discovered or originally proved this formula .
It is being increasingly recognized that an historical point of view can provide context , motivation and direction to mathematics courses .
For instance , an historical perspective is being advocated in teaching calculus [ K1 , K2 , R1 , R2 ] , while original source materials are being incorporated in a variety of ways into calculus instruction [ L1 , O ] , and new texts are emphasizing the importance of studying original sources [ BG , Ca , F , K3 , K4 , LP ] .
Also see the web page ``Teaching with Original Historical Sources in Mathematics ' ' .
This site , however , focuses on historical projects for undergraduate discrete mathematics courses .
While there are presently excellent accounts of the history of algorithms such as [ Ch ] , or the history of logic [ Da , Gr ] , such texts do not focus on the needs of undergraduates and contain no curricular materials ready for classroom use .
The benefits of an historical point of view have been explained very convincingly by Miguel de Guzmán , President of the International Commission on Mathematical Instruction , in his talk at the 7 - th International Congress on Mathematics Education [ Gu ] :
WHAT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS AND OF THE PARTICULAR SUBJECT CAN OFFER US :
A human vision of science and of mathematics : not just truths , methods , techniques coming from nowhere , not just facts and skills without soul , without history , but the results of the efforts of persons motivated by deep interest and passion ; not as godlike science , but human and so incomplete and fallible ; the human side of the great discoveries and discoverers .
A frame in which all elements appear in their right place : not facts centuries apart in their origin presented together in the same bag without a single remark , but explorations in their own context and with their own motivation ; past fashions in order to be able to understand present fashions ; the deep connections along time of the different leitmotivs of the mathematical symphony .
A dynamical vision of the evolution of mathematics : the motivation and driving forces at the roots of the ideas and methods of the subject ; the primordial creativity around each particular subject , its genesis and its progress , . . . .
If a series of any number of lines be given , which exceed one another by an equal amount , and the difference be equal to the least , and if other lines be given equal in number to these , and in quantity to the greatest , the squares on the lines equal to the greatest , plus the square on the greatest and the rectangle contained by the least and the sum of all those exceeding one another by an equal amount will be the triplicate of all the squares on the lines exceeding one another by an equal amount .
The project then asked the students to rewrite the statement using symbolic logic .
Such an exercise meshes well with a first chapter on logic in many discrete mathematics texts , which often include homework problems such as ``Write the statement ` If it is cold and raining , then I will stay home ' in symbols , using the predicates , P : It is cold , Q : It is raining , R : I will stay home . ''
A particular drawback of modern textbooks is their lack of motivation , perspective and context .
Why not apply symbolic logic to the very statements which historically drove the development of mathematics , allowing the students to hone their verbal and deductive skills on significant problems ?
A second project , ``In the Words of Archimedes II , '' built on the first by asking students to verify Archimedes ' statement about the sums of squares using ideas from his original proof , a proof which did not involve induction .
A third project , ``In the Words of Pascal , '' presented Pascal 's bold statement about the sums of arbitrary powers taken from a translation of Sommation des Puissances Numériques [ P2 ] , and asked the students to prove , now using induction , that the sum of ik from i = 1 to n is a polynomial in n of degree k +
1 . Although the project did not ask for the coefficients of this polynomial in explicit form , a few students became fascinated with this problem , and essentially anticipated the first three Bernoulli numbers .
Homework problems in a standard text almost never elicit such a response from students .
A future project in this direction will investigate Jakob Bernoulli's ( 1654 --1705 ) original work on summations [ Be ] .
Guram Bezhanishvili has written a major project on Georg Cantor 's ( 1845 --1918 ) revolutionary ideas concerning infinite sets using excerpts from Cantor 's memoir Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of Transfinite Numbers [ Cn ] .
The project , `` Are All Infinities Created Equal ? '' ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , begins by asking the students to identify certain properties of ``naive set theory ' ' as explicated by Cantor , and then write these observations using modern notation .
The project continues with a comparison of the cardinality of various infinite sets , such as the set of rational numbers , and the set of real numbers in the interval [ 0 , 1 ] , and concludes with the observation that certain infinite sets are larger than others ( 2 to the aleph naught is greater than aleph naught ) , a paradigm - breaking idea about the infinite .
Additionally , Jerry has introduced logic in a beginning discrete mathematics course [ L2 ] via Alan Turing 's ( 1912 --1954 ) original paper ``On Computable Numbers with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem ' ' [ T ] .
Through the first project , ``An Introduction to Turing Machines ' ' ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , the students witness an idea which is the forerunner of a programmable computer , a Turing machine , and in the second , ``Turing Machines , Induction and Recursion ' ' ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , they observe how the concept of recursion arises naturally when writing a Turing machine to perform a basic operation such as multiplication of positive integers .
Moreover , induction is used to verify that the output of the machine is correct .
At the conclusion of the Turing projects , a student from an under represented minority remarked : ``I thought this course would just be about numbers , but instead , I learned how computers started . ''
Another student , when describing the projects , claimed `` That 's how I learn . ''
The first two Turing projects deal with the construction and design of Turing machines to perform certain computational tasks , and remain at an introductory level , primarily to serve the needs of a beginning course in discrete mathematics .
Of course , Turing 's original motivation was to solve Hilbert 's decision problem , which Turing masterfully does in [ T ] , and in so doing , he develops the idea of a universal computing machine ( known as a compiler or an interpreter today ) .
The third project in this sequence , `` The Universal Computing Machine ' ' ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , outlines Turing 's logical construction of this device , and is well - suited for an intermediate or an advanced undergraduate course in logic , discrete mathematics , or computer science .
A fourth project in this sequence , `` The Decision Problem ' ' ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , offers Turing 's ( negative ) solution to this issue , which today has become known as the halting problem in computer science .
These last two Turing projects were used recently in an intermediate discrete mathematics course , at the conclusion of which student comments reveal : ``I found the two projects to be challenging and extremely pertinent to computer science . ''
`` The two projects that dealt with the Turing machines and the halting problem gave me insight and understanding of the origins of computer science . ''
During the Autumn semester of 2003 Jerry Lodder developed two projects for an introductory course in discrete mathematics which trace the development of binary arithmetic from the Enlightenment to the electronic age .
The first project ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) begins with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz 's ( 1646--1716 ) work on binary numeration , offering excerpts form his 1703 publication ``Explication de l'arithmétique binaire , qui se sert des seuls caractères 0 et 1 , avec des remarques sur son utilité , et sur ce qu'elle donne des anciennes figures Chinoises de Fohy , '' ( An Explanation of Binary Arithmetic Using only the Characters 0 and 1 , with Remarks about its Utility and the Meaning it Gives to the Ancient Chinese Figures of Fuxi ) [ Ge , p. 223--227 ] [ Le ] .
For Leibniz , binary numbers represented a confluence of several ideas , including order , harmony , a candidate for his universal language ( lingua generalis ) , an analogy of creation with 0 denoting nothing and 1 denoting God , and an interpretation of the ancient Chinese text of divination the Yijing ( I - Ching or Book of Changes ) in terms of binary numeration [ Sw ] .
Leibniz also cites an ease of calculation with base 2 numbers , particularly for multiplication and division , which do not require the memorization of a multiplication table or methods of trial and error , as is often the case for long division in base 10 .
The project continues with a brief account of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer ( ENIAC ) developed at the University of Pennsylvania 's Moore School of Electrical Engineering during the years 1943 -- 1945 , and discusses its use of base 10 arithmetic , requiring the storage of a multiplication table for numbers between zero and nine [ Go ] .
The next generation of computing equipment , the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer ( EDVAC ) , heavily influenced by the ideas of John von Neumann ( 1903 - - 1957 ) , performed arithmetical calculations in base 2 .
The project provides excerpts from von Neumann 's 1945 white paper ``First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC ' ' [ vN ] , in which he too cites the ease of calculation as an advantage to binary arithmetic , as well as an economy of representing numerical values with this system .
Moreover , the EDVAC is a model for a ``universal computing machine '' in the sense of Turing [ T ] .
This project , ``Binary Arithmetic : From Leibniz to von Neumann '' ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) is ideal for beginning students in discrete mathematics , particularly those with no previous knowledge of base 2 calculations .

The second project on binary arithmetic ``Arithmetic Backwards from von Neumann to the Chinese Abacus '' ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , builds on the first , beginning with von Neumann 's claim that a high - speed vacuum tube computer performs arithmetic most efficiently in base 2 .
The project then proceeds in a chronologically reverse order , next examining Claude Shannon 's ( 1916 --2001 ) design of circuits for computations in Boolean algebra and logic .
The project provides excerpts from Shannon 's 1938 paper ` `A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits ' ' [ Sh ] , and asks the students to construct the circuits necessary for binary addition .
A careful study of these examples provides motivation for writing logic statements in what today is known as ``disjunctive normal form , '' a concatenation of sub- statements with the connective ``or , '' where each sub - statement contains only negations and the connective ``and . ''
The project continues with the realization that writing a number in base 2 often requires many digits , and examines an alternative base that can be easily converted to base 2 .
Surprisingly a Chinese abacus provides the ideal tool for computations in base 16 , which the students are asked to realize on their own by exploring all possible values that can be represented by bead arrangements on a single bar of this type of abacus .
As an in - class activity while the project was assigned , we discussed base 10 addition and subtraction on an abacus , with the base 16 analogues of these operations left to the students .
Today hexadecimal notation ( base 16 ) is common place in computer science , and serves as shorthand for binary numbers , with the conversion between base 2 and base 16 a simple operation .
With Leibniz 's interest in China and the interpretation of the hexagrams of the Yijing in terms of binary numeration , the Chinese abacus provides a pleasing confluence of historical , cultural and computational ideas for the second project , particularly as a tool for place value arithmetic in a two - power base .
Concerning the benefits of teaching with historical sources , at the conclusion of the course , students wrote : `` You get an understanding of why you are doing something . ''
`` It ties in better , links can be made . '' `` Gives meaning to problems .'' `` We can understand why we do certain things in certain ways . ''
David Pengelley has authored a project track to teach induction from Pascal 's ``Treatise on the Arithmetical Triangle , " ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , where Pascal proves that certain patterns occur in his triangle via a logical argument that would later become known as induction .
Desh Ranjan has written ``Counting Triangulations of a Polygon , " ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) , which develops the sequence of Catalan numbers from a simple observation of Lamé .
Desh 's project contains David 's translation of a letter from Lamé to Liouville , which serves as the primary source for this work .
Hing Leung has completed a project ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) that outlines the reduction of two - way deterministic finite automata to one - way automata via the work of Shepherson , and builds on the notion of a Turing machine .
Additionally , Guram Bezhanishvili has outlined Church 's thesis using excerpts from the work of Gödel , Kleene and Turing , which establish that general recursive functions coincide with Turing computable functions ( pdf file ) ( ps file ) .
The teaching community is invited to use any of the above projects in relevant mathematics or computer science courses .
Typically two or three projects , chosen around a specific theme , such as Turing machines , are used in a one - semester course , with the projects counting for a significant portion ( 40 % - - 50 % ) of the course grade .
For each project the students are given one to two weeks , working as an individual or in groups of two or three , to produce a written paper addressing the issues raised in the project .
Each project usually replaces an in - class examination .
For further general information about the use of projects see [ CG ] .

So now for the question of the moment : Is Michael Phelps the greatest Olympian ever ?
He ’s won more total gold medals than any other Olympian , and he ’s won more gold medals in one Olympics than any other .
So , how about it ?
The guys at the Yahoo !
Sports blog have decided to tackle this question , and I rather agree with their assessment .
Not yet .
I think Carl Lewis is the greatest – he won gold medals over the course of four Olympics from 1984 to1996 .
He ran the sprints .
He ran relays .
He won medals in the long jump .
So I ’m up for saying that if Phelps can come back in 2012 and win some more gold , then he can be the greatest , but until then , I ’m sticking with Lewis .
Some of the Phelps detractors are arguing that since he ’s only swimming , and since there are so many swimming events , then it ’s easier for him to win medals than it is for other athletes .
And anyone who says this is a moron .
It ’s theoretically possible for this to happen in track – just run the 100 - meter sprint , the 200 - meter sprint , and the 400 - meter .
Do the hurdles at various meters , run the relays , then try the long jump – Carl Lewis did n’t run the longer events , but he did the 100 - meter , the relay races , and the long jump .
This is the equivalent of what Phelps just did , racing at different lengths , and with different strokes .
If you want to argue that Phelps is n’t the greatest Olympian of all time , fine .
I ’ll listen to the arguments – as I said , I ’m sticking with Carl Lewis for the present – but please come up with a better argument than he ’s just a swimmer .
And speaking of Phelps , for any of you who did n’t see Friday night ’s 100 - meter butterfly , here ’s some still underwater still photos of the finish from Sports Illustrated .
Now you ’ll understand what people mean when they say Phelps won by a fingernail .
******************
It seems to me that , at every Olympics , there is a judging controversy in gymnastics .
And this time it occurs over the tie - breaking procedure that knocked America ’s Nastia Liukin from a tie for the gold medal to the winner of the silver .
I do n’t really care about the controversy .
I just wanted to use this as a chance to remark upon the class and grace of the U.S. gymnasts .
After what has happened , it would be easy for the girls to whine about the scoring , or to allege grand conspiracies like Marta Karolyi , but they have chosen to not go that route , and I find that refreshing .
Sports Illustrated quotes Liukin saying that “ I know I did n't have my best routine , but I had the same exact score as she did , which makes it a little harder to take …
I still do n't understand how they broke the tie , but that 's the rules , and you just have to play by them . ”
And I appreciate that grace and class .
******************
Let ’s give a shout - out to LaPorte ’s Kerron Clement who was part of the U.S. medal sweep in the 400 - meter hurdles .
Clement got the silver .
This was the first sweep of the event in the Olympics by a team since the United States pulled off the trick in Rome in 1960 .
And Katy ’s Cat Osterman teamed with Jennie Finch to lead the U.S. softball team to victory .
The 9 - 0 victory moved the Americans into the medal round .
The U.S. has pretty much dominated softball this Olympics – winning six games by shutout with five of the games ended early because of the mercy rule .
They have outscored the competition 53 - 1 , and there are still two games left to play .
The American ’s have pretty much dominated softball in the other Olympics , which is probably why this is the last Olympic competition for softball .
*******************
Does anyone else out there think that the Brazilian women ’s beach volleyball team learned their lesson last night ?
According to the NBC announcers , Misty May - Treanor and Kerri Walsh were having a pre-match workout on one of the practice courts when the Brazilians demanded they leave so they could have the court .
May - Treanor and Walsh agreed , then proceeded to kick their asses 21 - 12 , 21 - 14 in their beach volleyball match ( this was the 107th consecutive win ) .
I ’m not sure who May - Treanor and Walsh play next , but since it ’s for the gold , I ’d advise that team to not piss them off beforehand .
*******************
Tonight ’s Olympic TV brings us the tape - delayed women ’s 400 - meter finals with America ’s Sanya Richards favored to become the first U.S. women to win the 400 since Valerie Brisco Hooks in 1984 .
The world ’s fastest man , Usain Bolt , will be racing in the 200 - meter semifinals ( also on tape delay , as are all of the track - and - field events shown in prime time , though , if I ’m reading my schedules correctly , there is a chance that America ’s Lolo Jones will be trying for the gold in the woman ’s 100 - meter hurdles during prime time ) .
There will also be some more men and women ’s gymnastics , though I ’m pretty sure you can also find those scores on the internet today .

Military chiefs should " should hang their heads in shame " over the death of a British paratrooper in a landmine explosion , a coroner said today .
Corporal Mark Wright in a picture released by the army
Andrew Walker ruled the blast that killed Corporal Mark Wright , 27 , was caused by the " downwash " from a Chinook helicopter sent to rescue a platoon stranded in an unmarked Afghanistan minefield .
Walker gave a narrative verdict at the conclusion of a two - week inquest at Oxford coroner 's court .
He said Wright 's death could have been avoided but for a lack of equipment , which he said " was simply about money " .
He said it was " lamentable " that the UK was not equipped to stage an effective rescue .
Wright , from Edinburgh , died from a landmine blast as he went to help an injured colleague at Kajaki , in Helmand province , on September 6 2006 .
He was posthumously awarded a George Cross for bravery .
Six other soldiers were injured ; three of them lost limbs .
Walker said serious failures contributed to Wright 's death , including the lack of UK helicopters in Afghanistan fitted with a winch , the downwash from the Chinook sent to the minefield , and the delay in sending a suitable helicopter .
There was a lack of batteries for radios at observation posts , which reduced the soldiers ' ability to communicate , and soldiers had no information about the minefield .
He said soldiers ' training to locate and mark mines failed to use the latest technology .
Walker described Wright as " an exceptional soldier " who acted with " unhesitating courage " .
" This selfless courage forms part of a tradition within our armed forces and Cpl Wright will continue to be an inspiration for those who follow .
" That a brave soldier is lost in battle is always a matter of deep sadness but when that life is lost where it need not have been because of a lack of equipment and assets , those responsible should hang their heads in shame . "
The soldiers , from 3rd Battalion the Parachute Regiment , became trapped in a minefield after a sniper , Lance Corporal Stuart Hale , strayed into the unmarked area .
Hale lost a finger and part of a leg when a mine exploded .
Wright and his colleagues went to help Hale and radioed base for help .
Lieutenant Colonel Stuart Tootal , the battalion 's commander who was at the base , told the inquest his demand for a US Black Hawk rescue helicopter was initially rejected by the Nato command in the country and he felt he had no choice but to send a Chinook without a winch .
When the Chinook approached , the troops feared it would land on a mine and screamed for it to go away – but their pleas went unheeded and the helicopter 's downdraft caused a mine to explode , wounding Wright and the man next to him .
In spite of injuries to his chest , face , arms and neck , Wright continued to give first aid to his colleagues and tried to maintain morale and keep calm .
Three hours later the men were picked up by two Black Hawk helicopters but Wright died of his injuries before reaching the field hospital .
The Ministry of Defence is understood to be negotiating compensation with Wright 's family and the soldiers who were injured .
After the inquest verdict was announced , Wright 's father , Bob , and mother , Jem , said they were proud of the courage shown by their son and his colleagues .
Bob Wright said it had been painful to listen to the " catalogue of errors " that led to his son 's death .
" The coroner has made recommendations that must be followed .
Jem and I do n't want any other families to experience the loss of their child in similar circumstances . "
The family 's solicitor , Paul Harrington , said the Wrights wanted lessons to be learned from the " systemic failures " that led to their son 's death .
The Ministry of Defence should urgently plan better rescue procedures , he said .
The commander of joint helicopter command , Rear Admiral Tony Johnstone - Burt , said he was confident that current resources were able to meet the required tasks .
Johnstone - Burt , who is responsible for the provision of all battlefield helicopters and crews to Afghanistan and Iraq , said all UK helicopters in Afghanistan were now fitted with winches .
Helicopter winches were not used to extract people from minefields , however , " because of the lethal risks involved " .
He said : " In the spirit of our shared efforts in Afghanistan , resources are pooled across the countries fighting there .
In addition to UK Chinook , Apache , Sea King and Lynx helicopters , our forces can also access significant numbers of other types of helicopters provided by our allies . "
ST . PAUL , Minnesota ( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican Party 's vice presidential nominee , on Wednesday night addressed the 2008 Republican National Convention .
Here is the text of the speech :
Gov. Sarah Palin on Wednesday praised John McCain as a " true profile in courage . "
Gov. Palin : Mr. Chairman , delegates , and fellow citizens , I will be honored to accept your nomination for vice president of the United States .
I accept the call to help our nominee for president to serve and defend America .
And I accept the challenge of a tough fight in this election against confident opponents at a crucial hour for our country .
And I accept the privilege of serving with a man who has come through much harder missions , and met far graver challenges , and knows how tough fights are won , the next president of the United States , John S. McCain .
Watch Palin accept the nomination »
It was just a year ago when all the experts in Washington counted out our nominee because he refused to hedge his commitment to the security of the country he loves .
With their usual certitude , they told us that all was lost , there was no hope for this candidate , who said that he would rather lose an election than see his country lose a war .
But the pollsters ...
The pollsters and the pundits , they overlooked just one thing when they wrote him off .
They overlooked the caliber of the man himself , the determination , and resolve , and the sheer guts of Senator John McCain .
The voters knew better , and maybe that 's because they realized there 's a time for politics and a time for leadership , a time to campaign and a time to put our country first .
iReport.com :
What do you think of Palin 's speech ?
Our nominee for president is a true profile in courage , and people like that are hard to come by .
He 's a man who wore the uniform of his country for 22 years and refused to break faith with those troops in Iraq who now have brought victory within sight .
And as the mother of one of those troops , that is exactly the kind of man I want as commander - in - chief .
I 'm just one of many moms who will say an extra prayer each night for our sons and daughters going into harm 's way .
Our son , Track , is 19 .
And one week from tomorrow , September 11 , he 'll deploy to Iraq with the Army infantry in the service of his country .
My nephew , Casey , also enlisted and serves on a carrier in the Persian Gulf .
My family is so proud of both of them and of all the fine men and women serving the country in uniform .
So Track is the eldest of our five children .
In our family , it 's two boys and three girls in between , my strong and kind - hearted daughters , Bristol , and Willow , and Piper .
And we were so blessed in April .
Todd and I welcomed our littlest one into the world , a perfectly beautiful baby boy named Trig .
You know , from the inside , no family ever seems typical , and that 's how it is with us .
Our family has the same ups and downs as any other , the same challenges and the same joys .
Sometimes even the greatest joys bring challenge .
And children with special needs inspire a very , very special love .
To the families of special - needs ...
To the families of special - needs children all across this country , I have a message for you :
For years , you 've sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters .
And I pledge to you that , if we 're elected , you will have a friend and advocate in the White House .
And Todd is a story all by himself .
He 's a lifelong commercial fisherman and a production operator in the oil fields of Alaska 's North Slope , and a proud member of the United Steelworkers union .
And Todd is a world champion snow machine racer .
Throw in his Yup 'ik Eskimo ancestry , and it all makes for quite a package .
And we met in high school .
And two decades and five children later , he 's still my guy .
My mom and dad both worked at the elementary school in our small town .
And among the many things I owe them is a simple lesson that I 've learned , that this is America , and every woman can walk through every door of opportunity .
And my parents are here tonight .
I am so proud to be the daughter of Chuck and Sally Heath .
Long ago , a young farmer and a haberdasher from Missouri , he followed an unlikely path -- he followed an unlikely path to the vice presidency .
And a writer observed , " We grow good people in our small towns , with honesty and sincerity and dignity , " and I know just the kind of people that writer had in mind when he praised Harry Truman .
I grew up with those people .
They 're the ones who do some of the hardest work in America , who grow our food , and run our factories , and fight our wars .
They love their country in good times and bad , and they 're always proud of America .
I had the privilege of living most of my life in a small town .
I was just your average hockey mom and signed up for the PTA .
I love those hockey moms .
You know , they say the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull ?
Lipstick .
So I signed up for the PTA because I wanted to make my kids ' public education even better .
And when I ran for city council , I did n't need focus groups and voter profiles because I knew those voters , and I knew their families , too .
Before I became governor of the great state of Alaska I was mayor of my hometown .
And since our opponents in this presidential election seem to look down on that experience , let me explain to them what the job involved .
I guess -- I guess a small - town mayor is sort of like a community organizer , except that you have actual responsibilities .
I might add that , in small towns , we do n't quite know what to make of a candidate who lavishes praise on working people when they 're listening and then talks about how bitterly they cling to their religion and guns when those people are n't listening .
No , we tend to prefer candidates who do n't talk about us one way in Scranton and another way in San Francisco .
As for my running mate , you can be certain that wherever he goes and whoever is listening John McCain is the same man .
Well , I 'm not a member of the permanent political establishment .
And I 've learned quickly these last few days that , if you 're not a member in good standing of the Washington elite , then some in the media consider a candidate unqualified for that reason alone .
But -- now , here 's a little newsflash .
Here 's a little newsflash for those reporters and commentators : I 'm not going to Washington to seek their good opinion .
I 'm going to Washington to serve the people of this great country .
Americans expect us to go to Washington for the right reason and not just to mingle with the right people .
Politics is n't just a game of clashing parties and competing interests .
The right reason is to challenge the status quo , to serve the common good , and to leave this nation better than we found it .
No one expects us all to agree on everything , but we are expected to govern with integrity , and goodwill , and clear convictions , and a servant 's heart .
And I pledge to all Americans that I will carry myself in this spirit as vice president of the United States .
This was the spirit that brought me to the governor 's office when I took on the old politics as usual in Juneau , when I stood up to the special interests , and the lobbyists , and the Big Oil companies , and the good - old boys .
Suddenly , I realized that sudden and relentless reform never sits well with entrenched interests and power - brokers .
That 's why true reform is so hard to achieve .
But with the support of the citizens of Alaska , we shook things up .
And in short order , we put the government of our state back on the side of the people .
I came to office promising major ethics reform to end the culture of self - dealing .
And today , that ethics reform is a law .
While I was at it , I got rid of a few things in the governor 's office that I did n't believe our citizens should have to pay for .
That luxury jet was over - the - top .
I put it on eBay .
I love to drive myself to work .
And I thought we could muddle through without the governor 's personal chef , although I got to admit that sometimes my kids sure miss her .
I came to office promising to control spending , by request if possible , but by veto , if necessary .
Senator McCain also -- he promises to use the power of veto in defense of the public interest .
And as a chief executive , I can assure you it works .
Our state budget is under control .
We have a surplus .
And I have protected the taxpayers by vetoing wasteful spending , nearly $ 500 million in vetoes .
We suspended the state fuel tax and championed reform to end the abuses of earmark spending by Congress .
I told the Congress , " Thanks , but no thanks , " on that Bridge to Nowhere .
If our state wanted to build a bridge , we were going to build it ourselves .
When oil and gas prices went up dramatically and filled up the state treasury , I sent a large share of that revenue back where it belonged : directly to the people of Alaska .
And despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists , who kind of liked things the way that they were , we broke their monopoly on power and resources .
As governor , I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people .
I fought to bring about the largest private - sector infrastructure project in North American history .
And when that deal was struck , we began a nearly $ 40 billion natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence .
That pipeline , when the last section is laid and its valves are open , will lead America one step farther away from dependence on dangerous foreign powers that do not have our interests at heart .
The stakes for our nation could not be higher .
When a hurricane strikes in the Gulf of Mexico , this country should not be so dependent on imported oil that we 're forced to draw from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
And families cannot throw more and more of their paychecks on gas and heating oil .
With Russia wanting to control a vital pipeline in the Caucasus and to divide and intimidate our European allies by using energy as a weapon , we cannot leave ourselves at the mercy of foreign suppliers .
To confront the threat that Iran might seek to cut off nearly a fifth of the world 's energy supplies , or that terrorists might strike again at the Abqaiq facility in Saudi Arabia , or that Venezuela might shut off its oil discoveries and its deliveries of that source , Americans , we need to produce more of our own oil and gas .
And ...
And take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska :
We 've got lots of both .
Our opponents say again and again that drilling will not solve all of America 's energy problems , as if we did n't know that already .
But the fact that drilling , though , wo n't solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all .
Starting in January , in a McCain - Palin administration , we 're going to lay more pipelines , and build more nuclear plants , and create jobs with clean coal , and move forward on solar , wind , geothermal , and other alternative sources .
We need ...
We need American sources of resources .
We need American energy brought to you by American ingenuity and produced by American workers .
And now , I 've noticed a pattern with our opponent , and maybe you have , too .
We 've all heard his dramatic speeches before devoted followers , and there is much to like and admire about our opponent .
But listening to him speak , it 's easy to forget that this is a man who has authored two memoirs but not a single major law or even a reform , not even in the State Senate .
This is a man who can give an entire speech about the wars America is fighting and never use the word " victory , " except when he 's talking about his own campaign .
But when the cloud of rhetoric has passed , when the roar of the crowd fades away , when the stadium lights go out , and those Styrofoam Greek columns are hauled back to some studio lot ...
When that happens , what exactly is our opponent 's plan ?
What does he actually seek to accomplish after he 's done turning back the waters and healing the planet ?
The answer -- the answer is to make government bigger , and take more of your money , and give you more orders from Washington , and to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world .
America needs more energy ; our opponent is against producing it .
Victory in Iraq is finally in sight , and he wants to forfeit .
Terrorist states are seeking nuclear weapons without delay ; he wants to meet them without preconditions .
Al Qaida terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America , and he 's worried that someone wo n't read them their rights .
Government is too big ; he wants to grow it .
Congress spends too much money ; he promises more .
Taxes are too high , and he wants to raise them .
His tax increases are the fine print in his economic plan .
And let me be specific :
The Democratic nominee for president supports plans to raise income taxes , and raise payroll taxes , and raise investment income taxes , and raise the death tax , and raise business taxes , and increase the tax burden on the American people by hundreds of billions of dollars .
My sister , Heather , and her husband , they just built a service station that 's now open for business , like millions of others who run small businesses .
How are they ...
How are they going to be better off if taxes go up ?
Or maybe you are trying to keep your job at a plant in Michigan or in Ohio ...
Or you 're trying -- you 're trying to create jobs from clean coal , from Pennsylvania or West Virginia .
You 're trying to keep a small farm in the family right here in Minnesota .
How are you -- how are you going to be better off if our opponent adds a massive tax burden to the American economy ?
Here 's how I look at the choice Americans face in this election :
In politics , there are some candidates who use change to promote their careers , and then there are those , like John McCain , who use their careers to promote change .
They are the ones whose names appear on laws and landmark reforms , not just on buttons and banners or on self - designed presidential seals .
Among politicians , there is the idealism of high - flown speech - making , in which crowds are stirringly summoned to support great things , and then there is the idealism of those leaders , like John McCain , who actually do great things .
They 're the ones who are good for more than talk , the ones that we 've always been able to count on to serve and to defend America .
Senator McCain 's record of actual achievements and reform helps explain why so many special interests , and lobbyists , and comfortable committee chairmen in Congress have fought the prospect of a McCain presidency from the primary election of 2000 to this very day .
Our nominee does n't run with the Washington herd .
He 's a man who 's there to serve his country and not just his party , a leader who 's not looking for a fight , but sure is n't afraid of one , either .
Harry Reid , the majority of the current do - nothing Senate ... he not long ago summed up his feelings about our nominee .
He said , quote , " I ca n't stand John McCain . "
Ladies and gentlemen , perhaps no accolade we hear this week is better proof that we 've chosen the right man .
Clearly , what the majority leader was driving at is that he can't stand up to John McCain and that is only ...
... that 's only one more reason to take the maverick out of the Senate , put him in the White House .
My fellow citizens , the American presidency is not supposed to be a journey of personal discovery .
This world of threats and dangers , it 's not just a community and it does n't just need an organizer .
And though both Senator Obama and Senator Biden have been going on lately about how they 're always , quote , " fighting for you , " let us face the matter squarely :
There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you .
There is only one man in this election who has ever really fought for you in places where winning means survival and defeat means death .
And that man is John McCain .
You know , in our day , politicians have readily shared much lesser tales of adversity than the nightmare world , the nightmare world in which this man and others equally brave served and suffered for their country .
And it 's a long way from the fear , and pain , and squalor of a six - by - four cell in Hanoi to the Oval Office .
But if Senator McCain is elected president , that is the journey he will have made .
It 's the journey of an upright and honorable man , the kind of fellow whose name you will find on war memorials in small towns across this great country , only he was among those who came home .
To the most powerful office on Earth , he would bring the compassion that comes from having once been powerless , the wisdom that comes even to the captives by the grace of God , the special confidence of those who have seen evil and have seen how evil is overcome .
A fellow ...
A fellow prisoner of war , a man named Tom Moe of Lancaster , Ohio ...
... Tom
Moe recalls looking through a pinhole in his cell door as Lieutenant Commander John McCain was led down the hallway by the guards , day after day .
And the story is told , when McCain shuffled back from torturous interrogations , he would turn towards Moe 's door , and he'd flash a grin and a thumbs up , as if to say , " We 're going to pull through this . "
My fellow Americans , that is the kind of man America needs to see us through the next four years .
For a season , a gifted speaker can inspire with his words .
But for a lifetime , John McCain has inspired with his deeds .
If character is the measure in this election , and hope the theme , and change the goal we share , then I ask you to join our cause .
Join our cause and help America elect a great man as the next president of the United States .
Thank you , and God bless America .
Thank you .

Marathon runner Arien O'Connell will be a winner after all .
O'Connell ran the fastest time in last Sunday 's Nike Women 's Marathon , but when she finished she was told she could n't be awarded first place because she had n't run in the " elite " women 's group , which was given a 20 - minute head start .
O'Connell said she was contacted early this morning by a Nike representative who said they were going to award her a trophy and recognize her as a winner .
Not the winner - " a " winner .
Notice the distinction .
" She told me they had been getting lots of calls and e-mails , " said O'Connell , a fifth - grade teacher in New York City .
" She said they were going to send me the same prize as the one awarded to the winner . "
O'Connell 's story , which first appeared in Tuesday 's Chronicle , set off a firestorm of controversy , most of it directed at corporate sports giant and race sponsor , Nike .
O'Connell said the Nike representative also said that the sports shoe corporation had also decided to eliminate the " elite " category in the annual San Francisco event and would let everyone start at the same time .
The annual event is billed as the largest women 's marathon in the world with 20,000 entries .
O'Connell ran the race in 2 hours , 55 minutes and 11 seconds .
The fastest woman in the elite group ran it in about 3 hours , 6 minutes .

Dead Space is a rare , fully satisfying single - player only experience .
One that nails the action - horror gameplay , if not so much the actual Dead Space is a rare , fully satisfying single - player only experience .
One that nails the action - horror gameplay , if not so much the actual horror .
It 's actually not a scary game .
Even with all of it's dark corridors and grotesque monsters I never found anything here that gave me any sort of fright .
That may be a big disappointment for the horror enthusiast looking for the next thing that will scare them out of their pants , but there are still plenty of reasons to play it .
For starters they nailed the atmosphere .
The sense of loneliness and desperation complement the gameplay well .
The sound is phenomenal and the graphics have aged remarkably well .
The story does n't evolve too much beyond it's " stranded and looking for a way out " setup , but there bits that hint at a larger mythology and what few characters there are were very well written .
When it comes to the gameplay this is some of the most satisfying action I 've experienced from the horror genre .
The gunplay feels great and your limited resources mean that it always feels like you 're just barely scraping by .
There are enough items scattered around to keep you going to the next checkpoint , but conserving your supplies is still necessary for survival .
New enemies are introduced at a steady pace .
The fact that you have to target and remove their limbs in order to actually kill them means these are more than just generic bullet sponges .
Add in some special powers that tie into some great puzzles and you have an experience that stays fresh and tense all the way through .
The only flaw I can find with the gameplay would be the mobility , or lack thereof .
Your character " Isaac " is n't the fastest or most agile dude .
This is n't a problem most of the time because you do n't deal with too many enemies at once .
However when the action gets more crowded and these surprisingly fast enemies have you cornered , you 'll find yourself wishing Isaac would pick up the pace and get out of the way .
A simple dodge - roll would have gone a long way .
For what it lacks in actual horror , it makes up for with a well - paced story and mostly excellent gameplay .
It might not be scary and it does have it 's frustrating moments , but for the most part this is an excellent game .
One with a fairly decent length ( I beat it in a little over 8 hours ) and high replay value .
Dead Space is worth your time , horror fan or not .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush signed into law on Monday a controversial bill that would stiffen penalties for movie and music piracy at the federal level .

The law creates an intellectual property czar who will report directly to the president on how to better protect copyrights both domestically and internationally .
The Justice Department had argued that the creation of this position would undermine its authority .
The law also toughens criminal laws against piracy and counterfeiting , although critics have argued that the measure goes too far and risks punishing people who have not infringed .
The Recording Industry Association of America and Motion Picture Association of America backed the bill , as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
“ By becoming law , the PRO - IP Act sends the message to IP criminals everywhere that the U.S. will go the extra mile to protect American innovation , ” said Tom Donohue , president and CEO of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Counterfeiting and piracy costs the United States nearly $ 250 billion annually , according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce .
Rick Cotton , general counsel for NBC Universal , said the bill would give movie and music makers more tools to fight what he called a “ tidal wave ” of counterfeiting and piracy of everything from medical devices to automobile parts to media by organized crime .
“ That is at the core of what this discussion is about , ” he said .
“ It is not about teenagers . ”
Cotton said he did not expect an IP czar to be named before Bush ’s term ended in January .
Richard Esguerra , spokesman for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said he was relieved to see lawmakers had stripped out a measure to have the Justice Department file civil lawsuits against pirates , which would have made the attorneys “ pro bono personal lawyers for the content industry . ”
But the advocacy group Public Knowledge had argued that the law went too far , especially given that fair use of copyrighted material was already shrinking .
Public Knowledge particularly opposed a measure that allowed for the forfeiture of devices used in piracy .
“ Let ’s suppose that there ’s one computer in the house , and one person uses it for downloads and one for homework .
The whole computer goes , ” said Public Knowledge spokesman Art Brodsky .
Brodsky argued that , at best , the bill was unnecessary because the recording and movie industry had the right to take accused infringers to court .
“ There ’s already lots and lots of penalties for copyright violations , ” he said .
“ They ’ve got all the tools they need . ”

Currently , I ’m still a big fan of Digg .
Through Digg I ’ve found sites that I check out almost every day – sites like Huffington Post , Copy Blogger , Gas 2.0 , etc. , so , I ca n’t say that I have n’t benefited from Digg ’s existence .
But now that I ’ve gotten that out of the way , I have to admit , lately I have become less and less enchanted with Digg .
The main reason being , Digg has slowly evolved into nothing more than an online version of some terrible , exclusive high school clique .
Now , before you accuse me of being nothing but a whiner — you would be only partially correct in that accusation ; I can do things other than whine — please let me explain where I ’m coming from .
THE SAME USERS DOMINATE THE HOMEPAGE
What do the following user names have in common ?
MrBabyMan , diggboss , MakiMaki , msaleem , uptick , SirPopper , badwithcomputer , numberneal , zaibatsu , and insaincain02
Give up ?
Well , go check out Digg ’s homepage and chances are , of the 15 submissions , I think it ’s safe to bet that five or six of the articles have been submitted by the aforementioned users .
And the worst part is , it ’s like this almost every time you go to Digg ’s homepage .
For a site that has 3 million users , it ’s kind of odd / frustrating that the same 25 users have a pretty strong stranglehold over the homepage .
THE SECRETS REGARDING BURIES
As you probably know , I run another site called Daily Fuel Economy Tip , which has grown over the past two years to have a pretty decent following .
The last three submissions made to Digg have all received over 300 Diggs , were listed in the “ Hot in All Topics ” section and were almost always at or near the top of the “ most comments ” section .
They also all failed to make the homepage and simply disappeared for no apparent reason .
If someone or some group of users are continuously burying submissions from my site , I would like to know about it .
I want to know not so I can go on some sort of vindictive burying campaign against said users , rather I would like to be able to contact them and ask how I can improve my site and / or content so that they find it “ Digg worthy . ”
However , because Digg treats this with a shroud of secrecy , I ’ll simply stop getting my hopes up when my submissions cross the 300 Digg plateau .
THE WHOLE “ AURA ” OF DIGG
I think this might be what bothers me the most .
Digg itself , as well as its “ power users ” seem to have this whole sort of elitist aura surrounding them .
They ’re working behind the scenes , doing their little networking , pulling strings , keeping everything a secret from you .
I understand the idea of keeping the algorithm proprietary – after all , you would n’t expect Google to let you in on how they run their business , right ?
That being said , it would be nice if Digg would explain themselves regarding how it came to be that the same 25 users dominate the site .
WHAT TO DO ?
There ’s really no point in bitching and moaning if you do n’t attempt to provide some solutions to the perceived problems .
So , here ’s my shot at it :
GIVE MORE DETAILS REGARDING BURIES .
Ok , so maybe Digg does n’t have to go so far as to tell me who has buried my submissions , but it would be great if they would at least let me know how many times my submission has been buried .
I think most users would find this information useful , so in the future , I could avoid submitting similar stories .
CHANGE THE FRIEND SYSTEM .
I thought the whole point of Digg was to set up a system so that the best , most interesting stories would make it to the homepage .
The way the system is set up now , it ’s really all about who your friends are and who you shout to over what you submit .
This leads me to …
DO NOT ALLOW BLIND DIGGING OR BURYING .
If someone does not click the link to the submitted article , they should not be allowed to Digg or bury a submission .
After all , is it really possible to tell if you like or dislike an entire submission based on Digg ’s headline and brief description section ?
Pretty doubtful .
So , that ’s my beef with Digg as well as my solutions to fix the system .
On that note , I ’m going to go ahead and submit this now , and subsequently spend the next 12 hours hoping it does n’t get buried ( which it probably will ) .

Precipitation - Hardening Stainless Steel
The precipitation - hardening stainless steels are iron - nickel - chromium alloys containing one or more precipitation hardening elements such as aluminum , titanium , copper , niobium , and molybdenum .
The precipitation hardening is achieved by a relatively simple aging treatment of the fabricated part .
The two main characteristics of all precipitation - hardening stainless steels are high strength and high corrosion resistance .
High strength is , unfortunately , achieved at the expense of toughness .
The corrosion resistance of precipitation - hardening stainless steels is comparable to that of the standard AISI 304 and AISI 316 austenitic alloys .
The aging treatments are designed to optimize strength , corrosion resistance , and toughness .
To improve toughness , the amount of carbon is kept low .
The first commercial precipitation - hardening stainless steel was developed by US Steel in 1946 .
The alloy was named Stainless W ( AISI 635 ) and its nominal chemical composition ( in wt . %) was Fe-0.05C - 16.7Cr-6.3Ni-0.2Al-0.8Ti .
The precipitation hardening process involves the formation ( precipitation ) of very fine intermetallic phases such as Ni 3 Al , Ni 3 Ti , Ni 3 ( Al , Ti ) , NiAl , Ni 3 Nb , Ni 3 Cu , carbides , and Laves ( AB 2 ) phases .
Prolonged aging causes the coarsening of these intermetallic phases , which in turn causes the decline in strength , due to the fact that dislocations can bypass coarse intermetallic phases .
There are three types of precipitation - hardening stainless steels :
• Martensitic precipitation - hardening stainless steels , e.g. , 17-4 PH ( AISI 630 ) , Stainless W , 15 - 5 PH , CROLOY 16-6 PH , CUSTOM 450 , CUSTOM 455 , PH 13 - 8 Mo , ALMAR 362 , IN - 736 , etc. ,
• Austenitic precipitation - hardening stainless steels , e.g. , A - 286 ( AISI 600 ) , 17- 10 P , HNM , etc. , and
• Semiaustenitic precipitation - hardening stainless steels , e.g. , 17-7 PH ( AISI 631 ) , PH 15 - 7 Mo , AM - 350 , AM - 355 , PH 14 - 8 Mo , etc .
The type is determined by the martensite start and the martensite finish temperature ( M s and M f ) as well as the as- quenched microstructure .
During the heat treatment of precipitation - hardening stainless steels , regardless of their type , austenitization in the single - phase austenite region is always the first step .
Austenitization is then followed by a relatively rapid cooling ( quenching ) .

Despite VA Claim of Changed Policy , Vet Group Forced to File ' Emergency Motion ' as Barriers Erected to Keep Non-Profit Group From Registering Vets at San Francisco Facility ...

Despite last week 's agreement by the Dept. of Veteran Affairs to follow federal law --- after months of pressure from vet groups , members of Congress , and the public --- and relent to allow voter registration drives on the department 's federal facilities , The BRAD BLOG has learned that the department is continuing to block non-partisan groups access to our wounded warriors in order to sign up voters .
With most voter registration deadlines for the general election just one month away , the continuing stonewall , in this case by the San Francisco VA , continues to outrage .
The non-partisan Veterans for Peace organization has now been forced to file an emergency motion with the court in order to gain access .
They contacted us this morning with the following statement ...
Preminger Seeks Enforcement of Court Mandate Against VA Interference with Voter Registration Drives By Scott Rafferty , attorney | Press Release
PUBLISHED : September 15 , 2008 WASHINGTON – On September 12 , 2008 , the San Francisco VA prohibited Veterans for Peace ( “ VFP ” ) from registering voters , even though a recent “ directive ” instructs local officials to “ facilitate ” nonpartisan groups who wish to register voters .
VFP is 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) humanitarian and educational organization .
VA officials told VFP that their visit would be delayed for at least 12 days by an investigation into each visitors “ political activities ” and a tuberculosis test , which requires two medical appointments .
This violates a February 2008 court mandate .
In February 2008 , the Federal Circuit in Washington held that VA cannot impose special requirements on visitors because of the content of their message .
The Federal Circuit ruled that the VA cannot use its rule against “ unauthorized demonstrations ” to interfere with voter registration unless there is physical “ disturbance ” that also offends “ decorum and decency . ”
Today ’s emergency motion seeks to enforce that order .
" Having registered only 414 veterans nationwide , the VA needs all the help it can get , " notes the press release from VFP , which continues in full below ...
Steve Preminger , a California labor organizer , has litigated for four years to ensure that all veterans living on VA property have access to voter registration .
Judicial review of VA actions is split between the Federal Circuit in Washington and the federal district courts , enabling the VA to take inconsistent positions – telling each court that the other has jurisdiction .
As a result , neither court has reviewed the VA ’s use of “ directives ” instead of rulemaking processes that require the VA to consider public comments .
“ The VA has played legal ping - pong for four years , ” said Preminger ’s attorney , Scott Rafferty .
Rafferty explained today ’s motion : “ Even political parties can register voters on VA campuses , because the Federal Circuit unanimously rejected the VA ’s position that is can ban ‘ partisan activity ’ that was n’t a criminal ‘ disturbance . ’
By excluding the nonpartisan Veterans for Peace , the VA shows that the VA is interested in keeping veterans from voting , not preventing ‘ partisan activity , ’ which it has no right to do .
“ The time - critical issue is giving every veteran a chance to register before the deadlines next month , as the VA promised to last May .
Having registered only 414 veterans nationwide , the VA needs all the help it can get .
“ Veterans ’ experience in war gives them a powerful voice .
The VA wants to stop them from using their right to speak out and to vote .
The VA knows that many veterans oppose the Administration ’s conduct of the War , the overextension of the military , and its inadequate support for returning warriors . ”
Mr. Preminger attempted to register voters on a nonpartisan basis on April 15 , 2004 .
The Democratic Party joined the suit to protect the rights of members and potential members who were confined to the nursing home and had no assistance in obtaining and completing voter registration forms .

Sen . Hillary Rodham Clinton is conceding the Democratic presidential nomination to Sen. Barack Obama , as party leaders and strategists began to openly oppose the former first lady ’s aggressive efforts to join the ticket .
“ Senator Clinton will be hosting an event in Washington , D.C. , to thank her supporters and express her support for Senator Obama and party unity , ” the Clinton campaign said in a statement Wednesday night .
The event is set for Saturday .
A series of other events Wednesday consolidated Mr. Obama ’s power over the party as its de facto nominee - a continuing surge of superdelegate endorsements , statements by party elders that the race is over , and his naming of a vice - presidential team , which brought about the inevitable debate over Mrs. Clinton as a running mate .
Former President Jimmy Carter told a British newspaper that choosing the former first lady , who has refused to concede defeat , would be “ the worst mistake that could be made . ”
He told the Guardian that since half of each Democrat ’s supporters do n’t like the other , Mr. Obama would run the risk of “ the worst of both worlds . ”
Pennsylvania Gov. Edward G. Rendell , a Clinton supporter , disputed the notion that Mrs. Clinton ’s strong second - place finish gives her leverage on the all - but - certain nominee .
“ There ’s no bargaining .
You do n’t bargain with the presidential nominee .
Even if you ’re Hillary Clinton and you have 18 million votes , you do n’t bargain , ” he said .
The former first lady agreed to back Mr. Obama during a lengthy conference call with “ impatient ” House Democrats on Wednesday , the Associated Press reported .
Obama aides said their team had no scheduled plans for the candidates to appear together .
Mr. Obama on Wednesday night attended a $ 2,300 - per- person fundraiser on New York ’s Park Avenue , which he called “ our first post - nomination event ” to applause and whistles .
At the event , attended by “ Sex and the City ” star Sarah Jessica Parker among other celebrities , Mr. Obama repeated his recent praise of Mrs. Clinton , saying his daughters will grow up taking for granted that a woman can be president .
“ Your junior senator from New York engaged in an extraordinary campaign , ” he told the crowd .
“ Now that the interfamily squabble is done , all of can focus on what needs to be done in November . ”
Also Wednesday , Mr. Obama swiftly compiled a three - member team to lead his vice - presidential search : choosing Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and former deputy attorney general Eric Holder to join Washington insider Jim Johnson .
Meanwhile , Democratic strategists offered answers to the question :
What ’s in it for Mr. Obama to pick Mrs. Clinton as his running mate ?
“ Not much , ” Democratic strategist Bud Jackson said .
“ I ’m not able to offer many good things .
Barack Obama campaigned on change ; he campaigned on many things that Hillary Clinton represents . ”
Said party strategist Jim Duffy : “ He is a fresh face , and she ’s anything but that .
To put her on the ticket really conflicts with his core message of a new politics . ”
Mr. Obama on Wednesday picked up another 21 endorsements from superdelegates , to add to the 51 who announced their support Tuesday , as many Democrats also sought to move past the divisive primary season and prepare for battle with Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
“ Our focus now is on victory in November and on giving Barack Obama every ounce of our support , ” eight previously uncommitted Democratic senators said in a statement .
Another statement issued by top party leaders who have remained neutral - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California , Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Deanand West Virginia Gov. Joe Manchin III , head of the Democratic Governors Association - sounded a similar note .
“ Democrats must now turn our full attention to the general election , ” they wrote .
While Mrs. Clinton spent a mostly quiet day visiting her campaign headquarters in suburban Virginia to thank her staff for their efforts , Mr. Obama was greeted as a hero when he returned to Capitol Hill .
Democratic lawmakers swarmed him , patted his back and shook his hand .
The victor and the loser met awkwardly at a Washington hotel , where both were addressing a pro-Israel group .
“ I just spoke to her today and we are going to be having a conversation in the coming weeks , and I ’m very confident how unified the Democratic Party ’s going to be to win in November , ” Mr. Obama told reporters on Capitol Hill , adding that it was “ not a detailed conversation . ”
An aide described the encounter as “ cordial . ”
Mrs. Clinton is making an open bid for the No. 2 slot , refusing to concede defeat Tuesday after Mr. Obama secured enough delegates for the nomination and directing her supporters to weigh in on her Web site .
Before she rides off into the sunset , among other things , she wants a prominent role in securing her signature issue , universal health care ; help retiring her massive debt ; and a front - row spot in the party ’s convention in August .
On Tuesday , after Mr. Obama reached the magic number of delegates to secure the nomination , Mrs. Clinton refused to acknowledge the milestone , instead demanding “ respect ” for her nearly 18 million supporters .
On her campaign blog Wednesday were dozens of anxious pleas for her to stay in the race until the summer nominating convention in Denver , when Mr. Obama would officially accept the party nod .
“ Hillary , do not give up !
Let ’s go all the way to the convention ! ” one supporter wrote in the comments , before veering into all - capital letters : “ Denver ! Denver ! Denver ! ”
Despite advice from party leaders that Mr. Obama not choose his former rival , several Democratic strategists said there are still advantages to building what many party faithful call “ the dream ticket . ”
For instance , Mrs. Clinton far outperformed Mr. Obama in big Democratic states crucial to a win in November , and drew huge support from working - class whites and Hispanics .
“ She brings a healthy constituency to the table that Obama obviously had a lot of trouble with , ” Mr. Duffy said .
Then there ’s women - the core of the former first lady ’s supporters .
White women preferred Mrs. Clinton over Mr. Obama by 24 percentage points in this year ’s Democratic contests , according to exit polling .
Some women are threatening to stay home or cross over to support Mr. McCain , and he angered feminists in a January debate when he said dismissively , “ You ’re likable enough , Hillary . ”
So would putting Mrs. Clinton on the ticket appease women ?
“ No .
He gets nothing but an unbelievable headache and a disaster for his campaign , ” said Dick Morris , who worked as a pollster and adviser in the Clinton White House .
“ I do n’t think he gets a single vote , ” he said , adding that the vocal party activists vowing to stay home or switch sides are “ just Hillary ’s people trying to chant that reaction . ”
“ I do n’t think that that ’s how voters feel , and I do n’t think that putting Hillary on the ticket would appease them at all . ”
Then there ’s Bill Clinton .
On Tuesday , when the nation ’s final primaries were being held , he called a reporter a “ scumbag . ”
Throughout the campaign , political pundits opined that he had done more harm than good , angering blacks in South Carolina and eventually being dispatched on far smaller - scale campaign duties .
“ The Obama campaign would have to make strict rules , you know , about what President Clinton could and could not do during the campaign , ” Mr. Rendell said .
“ For example , the Obama campaign would have to control his schedule ; where he would go into , what states . ”
Mr. Duffy said that bringing Mr. Clinton back into the White House , even as a spouse , would present some real difficulties .
“ There are huge questions about his life , where he earns his money , and all of that would have to be vetted , ” he said .
Then there ’s the question of loyalty - Mrs. Clinton did , after all , want the top slot , and might not put her heart into the role of vice - presidential candidate .
“ The Clintons present huge questions the Obama people would have to answer in their own mind as to what role they would play and would they be loyal No. 2s , ” Mr. Duffy said .
“ You do n’t want to spend all your life wondering what the person in the No. 2 slot is doing . ”
Mr. Obama will campaign in Virginia on Thursday , attending a noon town - hall forum in Bristol with former Gov. Mark Warner , who is favored to win one of the state ’s U.S. Senate seats in November and whose support could help Mr. Obama in one of the presidential battleground states .
The senator from Illinois will be in Northern Virginia for an evening rally at the 25,000 seat Nissan Pavilion in Bristow .
He will be accompanied there by Gov. Tim Kaine and Sen. Jim Webb , who have won Virginia ’s last two statewide elections and been the objects of much vice - presidential speculation .
Mr. Obama said at last night ’s fundraiser that he had n’t had time to sort through his thoughts about Mrs. Clinton ’s expected concession : “ This weekend , I ’m going home , talk it over with Michele and we ’re going on a date . ”

( CNN ) -- Barack Obama on Monday called for tapping into strategic oil reserves as part of his plan to provide relief from high gas prices .
Barack Obama says he has a plan to reduce the country 's dependence on foreign oil .
Obama has previously said he was opposed to using the strategic reserves , but on Monday he proposed selling 70 million barrels of oil from the reserves in order to lower gas prices .
Speaking before a crowd in Lansing , Michigan , the senator from Illinois said the country 's " addiction to oil ... is one of the most dangerous and urgent threats this nation has ever faced . "
Obama unveiled his energy plan , which includes a windfall profits tax on big oil corporations that would be used to provide a $ 1,000 rebate to people struggling with high energy costs .
" You wo n't hear me say this too often , but I could n't agree more with the explanation that Sen.
McCain offered a few weeks ago .
He said , ' Our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been 30 years in the making , and was caused by the failure of politicians in Washington to think long term about the future of the country , ' " Obama said .
" What Sen . McCain neglected to mention was that during those 30 years , he was in Washington for 26 of them .
And in all that time , he did little to reduce our dependence on foreign oil , " Obama said .
The Democratic presidential candidate said he wants to eliminate the need for oil from the Middle East and Venezuela within 10 years .
See what goes into oil prices »
" To do this , we will invest $ 150 billion over the next decade ... and leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy that harnesses American energy and creates 5 million new American jobs , " he said .
Obama outlined three steps he'd take to meet that goal :
Build fuel - efficient cars and have one million 150 mile - per - gallon plug - in hybrids on the roads within six years
Require that 10 percent of the country 's energy come from renewable sources by the end of his first term
Call on businesses , government and the American people to meet the goal of reducing the demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade .
" So there is a real choice in this election -- a choice about what kind of future we want for this country and this planet , " Obama said .
McCain on Monday said Obama 's " misguided policies would result in higher energy costs to American families and businesses and increase dependence on foreign oil . "
One of the differences between McCain and Obama on energy is that McCain is in favor of exploring options for offshore drilling .
Obama has spoken against offshore drilling , but last week he said he would be willing to compromise if it were part of a more overarching strategy to lower energy costs .
McCain said offshore drilling is a " vital part " of dealing with the energy challenge .
" We have to drill here and drill now -- not wait and see whether there 's areas to explore , not wait and see whether there 's a package that needs to be put together , but drill here and drill now , " McCain said .
Obama said that McCain thinks the country can " drill our way out of this problem .
He reiterated his charge that McCain has ties to big oil -- saying " he raised more than $ 1 million from big oil just last month . "
The Obama campaign made that accusation in a television ad released Monday .
Watch the ad »
McCain surrogate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney blasted the ad as being " dishonest . "
" That 's really sad , " he said on CNN's " American Morning . "
" I did n't know that Obama had stooped to dishonesty . "
Watch Romney call Obama ' dishonest ' »
Romney said it was dishonest because corporations cannot give contributions to candidates and because employees of oil companies have also donated to Obama .
The Washington Post reported that McCain received $ 1.1 million from oil and gas industry executives and employees in June -- three - quarters of which came after he called for lifting the ban on offshore drilling on June 16 .
Obama 's ad sources the Washington Post and the Center for Responsive Politics , which showed that Obama has received about $ 345,000 from the oil and gas industry this year .
Meanwhile , the McCain campaign made fun of Obama 's energy proposal Monday by distributing tire pressure gauges reading " Obama 's energy plan " to McCain 's traveling press corps .
The gag was meant to mock Obama 's remark last week that " making sure your tires are properly inflated " could help conserve gasoline .
McCain supporters in Michigan distributed the same gauges at Obama 's energy speech in Lansing .
The campaign also blasted Obama for his apparent shift on strategic oil reserves .
Obama last month said he did not think the country should use the strategic oil reserves " at this point . "
" I have said and , in fact , supported a congressional resolution that said we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve , but the strategic oil reserve I think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency , " he said on July 7 .
McCain 's campaign said that Obama 's stance was strictly political , not sound policy .
In a conference call before Obama 's speech , his campaign said Obama looked at the issue and " he recognizes that Americans are suffering . "
Obama 's address in Lansing comes as he kicks off " Energy Week " -- with stops planned in Ohio and Indiana where gas prices and rising heat bills will be on the agenda .

McCain is spending Monday focusing on small business while in Pennsylvania .
He 'll turn his attention to energy at an event in Michigan this week .
On Tuesday , he 'll visit the Fermi 2 nuclear power plant outside Detroit for an event promoting his call for an increase in similar plants .
CNN 's Paul Steinhauser , Steve Brusk and Peter Hamby contributed to this report .

McCain surrogate Sen. Lindsey Graham tells CNN the McCain campaign is proposing to the Presidential Debate Commission and the Obama camp that if there 's no bailout deal by Friday , the first presidential debate should take the place of the VP debate , currently scheduled for next Thursday , October 2 in St. Louis .
In this scenario , the vice presidential debate between Joe Biden and Sarah Palin would be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined , and take place in Oxford , Mississippi , currently slated to be the site of the first presidential faceoff this Friday .

MELBOURNE : Less noisy cars could be tricking a driver to think he is driving slower than he really is , according to Australian researchers .
Mark Horswill and Annaliese Plooy of Queensland university report their findings in a journal ' Perception ' .
" The main design principle of making cars these days to be as quiet as you possibly can , is actually a real problem for road safety , " Horswill was quoted saying in ABC report .
He said engineers and car manufacturers reduce the level of noise inside cars because they think it distracts the driver or interferes with the car 's entertainment system .
However , these latest findings suggest this is a " questionable " claim .
" By doing that you 're systematically removing the cues that people are using to judge their speed , " he said adding " They 're feeling more safe and they 're getting a sensation of going slower ... but of course the danger is still there . "
In their study , Horswill and Plooy presented participants with pairs of video - based driving scenes and asked them to judge their speed .
The participants heard either in - car noise at the level it occurred in the real world , or reduced in volume by 5 decibels .
This is equivalent to the difference between the sound you would hear in a noisy car with the windows down and the sound you would hear in a luxury car with the windows up .
The researchers found that the change in noise shifted people 's speed perception .
" When the noise in the car is made quieter , people think they 're going about 5 kilometres an hour slower than they would otherwise , " Horswill said .
Horswill said he first got the idea for the study while driving in a luxury car lent to his research team .
" It was the poshest car we ever had , " he said .
" We found that we were accidentally going way over the speed limit very very fast , but inside the car it was so nice you barely had any sensation of movement at all , " he added .
Horswill said his conclusions are also supported by other studies .
He has previously studied people 's perception of appropriate speed as they watched video - based driving scenes , from the point of view of the driver .
People were asked whether they would go faster or slower than the videoed driver as the noise of the moving car was adjusted .
" When we turned the car noises down , people chose to drive faster , " Horswill said who also studied to show that driver of a high performance car will drive faster than those driving a lower performance car .
" It 's pretty clear that if people are given a car that is more powerful then they will drive it faster and more dangerously , " he said .
Why the Republican Party needs to Split
As far as I remember , the Republican Party consisted of both the conservative and the religious groups .
This party was often called the " right wing " or just the " right " for short .
However , an interesting change has occurred in the past few years .
The Republican Party has leaned more to the right , meaning that the party has become neo-conservative ( " neocon " for short ) with the religious and pro-corporations portions of the party gaining much more power .
As a result and in my opinion , the Republic Party has become less conservative .
Traditionally , conservative meant fiscal responsibility , support of old fashion values , and support of small businesses .
In my opinion , this is everything that the modern Republican Party no longer supports .
Apparently , the Republican Party now supports socialism for large companies ( such as banks , credit , housing , and insurance companies ) and is no longer interested in balancing the budget or lowering the U.S. National Debt .
Additionally , they continue to support economic stimulus package that have been proven to not work for the middle class and small business owners .
This is why I think that the current Republican Party desperately needs to split into two parties .
I envision a new Fiscal Conservative Party ( let me be the first to name this new party ) that returns to the old fashion values of demanding a balanced yearly budget from our government , a consistent lowering of the growing National Debt , and truly support small businesses instead of large corporations and their lobbyists .
These are the values and concerns that I think most Americans will stand behind and vote for .
Unlikely the current Libertarian Party that wants to completely rebuild the economy of the United States , the Fiscal Conservative Party would be more concerned with fixing the economy .
For instance , when Libertarian Party members say they want to dissolve the Federal Reserve for causing the current major economic catastrophe and for making the economy worse , most Americans have no understanding what that means and have no desire to understand it either .
Furthermore , when Libertarian Party members say they want a more strict interpretation of the Constitution , most Americans just do not understand what this means .
Thus , the Libertarian Party , with similar values to the Fiscal Conservative Party , is primarily for the educated elite and not supported by most Americans .
However , if the Fiscal Conservative Party presents itself as the party to fix the economy , stop budget deficits , and solve the long term issue of the National Debt , then I believe much more Americans will support this party .
If dissolving the Federal Reserve is proven necessary to fix the economy , then that is what the party and politicians will decide without the need to educate the average American before receiving their support .
Additionally , the splitting of the Republican Party would more easily attain a much larger number of supporters than any other 3rd party in existence and probably re-assimilate most of the people who have recently left the Republican Party too .
I think I have several very sound reasons for splitting the Republican Party .
Additionally , I believe that my idea will make a viable 3rd party that would probably gather more support than the current Republican Party , as well as better addressing the most pressing issues of the United States .

Millionaire rock stars are traditionally more synonymous with conspicuous consumption than the workers ' struggle .
But artists including Robbie Williams , Radiohead and The Verve are among those who might be about to swap sex , drugs and rock 'n 'roll for banners , braziers and manifestos - having formed a new organisation to stand up for their rights .
Among the dozens of founder members of the Featured Artists ' Coalition are Radiohead 's Thom Yorke and Red Wedge veteran Billy Bragg , - who did after all record There is Power in a Union - but also former Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour , The Klaxons , DJ Paul Oakenfold , Craig David , Iron Maiden and the Kaiser Chiefs .
All argue that the new organisation , to be launched tomorrow at the In the City conference in Manchester , is vital to represent their interests as the music industry is turned on its head by digital distribution .
Damon Gough , of Badly Drawn Boy , said : " I think with the digital age and record companies dispersing and disbanding , young bands need a governing voice that will support them and help protect their work . "
The organisation will " speak with one voice to help artists strike a new bargain with record companies , digital distributors and others ... by engaging with government , music and technology companies , and collection societies , arguing for fair play and , where necessary , exposing unfair practices " .
The industry has been revolutionised since Napster sparked panic by bringing illegal file sharing to a mass audience 10 years ago ; CD sales have collapsed and digital downloads have soared , but they have failed to make up the gap .
But while the digital revolution was traumatic for big labels , it has opened up new possibilities for artists , especially those with established fanbases .
The coalition will campaign for a fairer deal on copyright , cited by Radiohead as one of their reasons for leaving EMI last year and releasing In Rainbows as an attention grabbing " pay what you can " download .
Guitarist Ed O'Brien said : " For us , this is a no - brainer and we believe all artists and musicians should be signing up . "
The band 's co-manager , Brian Message , said it would allow new artists to benefit from the experiences and clout of more established ones .
Message said up and coming artists no longer saw signing with a major record label as the only way forward .
New artists tended to be much more savvy about business because they had built up a fanbase online , promoted their own gigs and released their own demos .
The Featured Artists ' Coalition , the term given to " primary named performers " on recordings , will be headed by an independent chairman with six artists , three managers and representatives from the Musicians ' Union and Equity .
It will have a six - point manifesto , including fair compensation after deals between labels and technology companies , and a " use it or lose it " approach to copyright so that recordings do n't go unreleased .
As the utopian dream of the digital age - removing barriers between artist and fan - gives way to a more complex reality , artists fear they are in danger of being cut out of the loop between record labels and technology giants .
They are concerned about offerings such as MySpace Music , which has given big labels a share in its new ad - supported streaming service , and Nokia 's Comes With Music , which will pay labels part of the subscription price in return for unlimited downloads .
Message said a memorandum of understanding between the government , internet service providers and labels ignored the rights of artists .
Jazz Summers , manager of The Verve , said that while there had always been industry bodies to represent record labels , managers , publishers and live promoters , there had never been a group to represent the artists .
" Every meeting I go to , I look around the table and there are 20 or 30 people , but no one representing the artist , " he said .
" This is not about bashing record labels .
But it is about recognising that the interests of the record label and the artist are not always aligned . "

Nearly a year ago I wrote about something I called " sensible naming " with respect to GPUs .
It was at the time of the Radeon HD 3800 series launch where AMD unveiled a much cleaner , simpler way of naming its cards .
Gone were the suffixes ( for the most part ) and instead what we were left with was this :
A family name , Radeon HD , followed by a four digit number .
With the exception of the X2s , AMD has stuck to its naming system without fault .
In fact , AMD has done such a good job with keeping the names clean that things are the way they should be : the internal codenames are more difficult to remember than the actual names of the cards ( e.g. RV770 vs. Radeon HD 4870 ) .
NVIDIA however , just has n't gotten the hint .
The GT200 launch gave us two simply named cards : the GeForce GTX 280 and GTX 260 , but it did n't take long for NVIDIA to confuse the marketplace with the launch of the GeForce 9800 GTX +.
I hoped that the naming silliness was limited to the older GeForce 9 GPUs , but today it extended into the GTX lineup .
It 's called the GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 .
Holy nomenclature Batman
The GeForce GTX 260 Core 216's name is actually quite descriptive , albeit absurdly long .
The GeForce GTX 260 part we already know from the GT200 launch , the Core 216 suffix just indicates that the GPU has 216 " cores " ( also playing on Intel 's new Core i7 naming for Nehalem , due out later this year ) .
Why NVIDIA did n't just call it a GeForce GTX 265 or 270 is beyond me .
To make matters worse , we 'll see companies adding their own suffixes to the already extended name .
For example , EVGA sent us their Core 216 called the EVGA GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 Superclocked Edition .
Perhaps it 's some conspiracy to increase the salary of writers who get paid by the word .
GTX 280 GTX 260 Core 216 GTX 260 9800 GTX + 9800 GT Stream Processors 240 216 192 128 112 Texture Address / Filtering 80 / 80 72/72 64 / 64 64 / 64 56 / 56 ROPs 32 28 28 16 16 Core Clock 602MHz 576MHz 576MHz 738MHz 600MHz Shader Clock 1296MHz 1242MHz 1242MHz 1836MHz 1500 MHz Memory Clock 1107MHz 999MHz 999MHz 1100MHz 900MHz Memory Bus Width 512 - bit 448 - bit 448-bit 256-bit 256-bit Frame Buffer 1GB 896MB 896MB 512MB 512MB Transistor Count 1.4B 1.4B 1.4B 754M 754M Manufacturing Process TSMC 65nm TSMC 65nm TSMC 65nm TSMC 55nm TSMC 55nm Price Point $ 420 - $ 500 $ 279 $ 250 - $ 300 $ 200 $ 130 - $ 170
If you remember the diagram below from our GT200 review you 'll see that a GeForce GTX 280 has ten clusters of 24 stream processors ( the little blue blocks ) , for a total of 240 SPs or " cores " .
The GeForce GTX 260 has eight of those clusters ( called Texture / Processor Clusters or TPCs ) , bringing its total up to 192 SPs .
The Core 216 , as you can guess , has nine clusters or 216 SPs .
NVIDIA just enabled another TPC on the Core 216 ( or alternatively , disabled a TPC on a GTX 280 ) .
The GeForce GTX 280 , 10 TPCs , 240 SPs
The GeForce GTX 260 Core 216 , 9 TPCs , 216 SPs
The GeForce GTX 260 , 8 TPCs , 192 SPs
The extra TPC also gives the Core 216 another 8 texture address and filtering units , but the rest of the chip 's makeup remains the same , even down to the clock speeds .
The Core 216 runs its core , shader and memory clocks at the same frequencies as the vanilla GTX 260 .
Priced at $ 279 , the Core 216 is a direct competitor to AMD 's Radeon HD 4870 - selling at a similar price .
The GTX 260 will continue to exist although selling at a cheaper price point and naturally with more processing power , the GTX 280 remains unaffected .
For many people the sight of Russian tanks streaming across a border in August has uncanny echoes of Prague 1968 .
That cold war reflex is natural enough , but after two decades of Russian retreat from those bastions it is misleading .
Not every development in the former Soviet Union is a replay of Soviet history .
The clash between Russia and Georgia over South Ossetia , which escalated dramatically yesterday , in truth has more in common with the Falklands war of 1982 than it does with a cold war crisis .
When the Argentine junta was basking in public approval for its bloodless recovery of Las Malvinas , Henry Kissinger anticipated Britain 's widely unexpected military response with the comment : " No great power retreats for ever . "
Maybe today Russia has stopped the long retreat to Moscow which started under Gorbachev .
Back in the late 1980s , as the USSR waned , the red army withdrew from countries in eastern Europe which plainly resented its presence as the guarantor of unpopular communist regimes .
That theme continued throughout the new republics of the deceased Soviet Union , and on into the premiership of Putin , under whom Russian forces were evacuated even from the country 's bases in Georgia .
To many Russians this vast geopolitical retreat from places which were part of Russia long before the dawn of communist rule brought no bonus in relations with the west .
The more Russia drew in its horns , the more Washington and its allies denounced the Kremlin for its imperial ambitions .
Unlike in eastern Europe , for instance , today in breakaway states such as South Ossetia or Abkhazia , Russian troops are popular .
Vladimir Putin 's picture is more widely displayed than that of the South Ossetian president , the former Soviet wrestling champion Eduard Kokoity .
The Russians are seen as protectors against a repeat of ethnic cleansing by Georgians .
In 1992 , the west backed Eduard Shevardnadze 's attempts to reassert Georgia 's control over these regions .
The then Georgian president 's war was a disaster for his nation .
It left 300,000 or more refugees " cleansed " by the rebel regions , but for Ossetians and Abkhazians the brutal plundering of the Georgian troops is the most indelible memory .
Georgians have nursed their humiliation ever since .
Although Mikheil Saakashvili has done little for the refugees since he came to power early in 2004 - apart from move them out of their hostels in central Tbilisi to make way for property development - he has spent 70 % of the Georgian budget on his military .
At the start of the week he decided to flex his muscles .
Devoted to achieving Nato entry for Georgia , Saakashvili has sent troops to Iraq and Afghanistan - and so clearly felt he had American backing .
The streets of the Georgian capital are plastered with posters of George W Bush alongside his Georgian protege .
George W Bush avenue leads to Tbilisi airport .
But he has ignored Kissinger 's dictum : " Great powers do n't commit suicide for their allies . "
Perhaps his neoconservative allies in Washington have forgotten it , too .
Let 's hope not .
Like Galtieri in 1982 , Saakashvili faces a domestic economic crisis and public disillusionment .
In the years since the so - called Rose revolution , the cronyism and poverty that characterised the Shevardnadze era have not gone away .
Allegations of corruption and favouritism towards his mother 's clan , together with claims of election fraud , led to mass demonstrations against Saakashvili last November .
His ruthless security forces - trained , equipped and subsidised by the west - thrashed the protesters .
Lashing out at the Georgians ' common enemy in South Ossetia would certainly rally them around the president , at least in the short term .
Last September , President Saakashvili suddenly turned on his closest ally in the Rose revolution , defence minister Irakli Okruashvili .
Each man accused his former blood brother of mafia links and profiting from contraband .
Whatever the truth , the fact that the men seen by the west as the heroes of a post - Shevardnadze clean - up accused each other of vile crimes should warn us against picking a local hero in Caucasian politics .
Western geopolitical commentators stick to cold war simplicities about Russia bullying plucky little Georgia .
However , anyone familiar with the Caucasus knows that the state bleating about its victim status at the hands of a bigger neighbour can be just as nasty to its smaller subjects .
Small nationalisms are rarely sweet - natured .
Worse still , western backing for " equip and train " programmes in Russia 's backyard do n't contribute to peace and stability if bombastic local leaders such as Saakashvili see them as a guarantee of support even in a crisis provoked by his own actions .
He seems to have thought that the valuable oil pipeline passing through his territory , together with the Nato advisers intermingled with his troops , would prevent Russia reacting militarily to an incursion into South Ossetia .
That calculation has proved disastrously wrong .
The question now is whether the conflict can be contained , or whether the west will be drawn in , raising the stakes to desperate levels .
To date the west has operated radically different approaches to secession in the Balkans , where pro-western microstates get embassies , and the Caucasus , where the Caucasian boundaries drawn up by Stalin , are deemed sacrosanct .
In the Balkans , the west promoted the disintegration of multiethnic Yugoslavia , climaxing with their recognition of Kosovo 's independence in February .
If a mafia - dominated microstate like Montenegro can get western recognition , why should n't flawed , pro-Russian , unrecognised states aspire to independence , too ?
Given its extraordinary ethnic complexity , Georgia is a post -Soviet Union in miniature .
If westerners readily conceded non-Russian republics ' right to secede from the USSR in 1991 , what is the logic of insisting that non-Georgians must remain inside a microempire which happens to be pro-western ?
Other people 's nationalisms are like other people 's love affairs , or , indeed , like dog fights .
These are things wise people do n't get involved in .
A war in the Caucasus is never a straightforward moral crusade - but then , how many wars are ?

If you are in the market for a non -iPhone cellphone that has the features / look of an iPhone , then look no further than this iPhone clone .
Unlike the Instinct , this cellphone could very well be the real iPhone killer .
According to Electronista , the device could be running a hacked version of Windows Mobile , however , it mimics most of the iPhone 's features , right down to the music player .
Either way , it 's still fun to watch , and to see how long Apple takes to sue them .

China 's greenhouse gas pollution could double or more in two decades says a new Chinese state think - tank study that casts stark light on the industrial giant 's role in stoking global warming .
Researchers abroad estimate that China 's carbon dioxide emissions now easily outstrip that of the United States , long the biggest emitter .
By 2020 , China 's burning of fossil fuels could emit carbon dioxide equal in mass to 2.5 billion metric tonnes of pure carbon and up to 2.9 billion tonnes , depending on varying scenarios for development and technology .
That compares with global carbon emissions of about 8.5 billion tonnes in 2007 .
The U.S. Oak Ridge National Laboratory estimated that the United States emitted about 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon in 2007 , compared to China 's 1.8 billion tonnes .

Keep in mind : these are That means some little guy with a clipboard goes around counting the number of factories and adding up their official output .
Real figures are probably much higher .
Real figures would include slash and burn agriculture , burning of waste , backyard smelters and stills , and other " unofficial " sources .
The truth is that the United States emits a fair amount of carbon , but the rest of the world -- especially the third world -- has surpassed us .
The only solution to global warming , carbon emissions , climate change , pollution , ecocide and all other environmental problems : reduce the human population .
People should be more scared than mad , Paulson says
At Wednesday 's House hearing , Rep. Steve LaTourette cut to the chase , summing up the frustration of members who think their constituents are n't getting the gravity of the situation from the dispassionate Bernanke and Paulson show .
LaTourette began talking about " my guy on the couch " back home in his district who was hassled by his boss and angered about doubts he 'll be able to get a new car , keep his job , retain his credit card and save for his daughter 's education .
" He 's scared because he 's the first generation who can't pass on the American dream to his daughter , " said the Ohio Republican -- adding , " In order to accept this plan ... he needs to be more scared . "
Paulson obliged .
“ He should be angry and he should be scared – and I think right now he ’s angrier than he is scared , ” said Paulson “ And it puts us in a difficult position — no one likes to be painting an overly dire picture and scaring people , but the fact is that if the financial markets are not stabilized the situation can be very severe as it relates not just to his current situation – but keeping his job … this is a serious situation and one he should be concerned about . ”

STOCKS SOAR BUT RECESSION A THREAT
Stock markets gave a thumbs up to government action .
Japan ’s Nikkei surged more than 14 percent -- the biggest one - day gain in its history -- while European shares rose nearly 6 percent and U.S. stock futures had the Dow Jones opening sharply higher .
“ Investors are peeping out of their bomb shelters , ” said Sean Callow , currency strategist at Westpac .
Many stock markets shed as much as 20 percent last week as panic gripped and experts said while financial meltdown may have been averted , the threat of a wide and deep recession had not .
German investor sentiment declined sharply this month , the heavyweight ZEW research institute survey showed , although many responses were given before Berlin ’s bank package was announced .

MONEY MARKETS EASIER
Some relief was evident in money markets .
Libor rates for overnight dollars were fixed at 2.18125 percent , down from 2.46875 on Monday , while the interbank cost of borrowing three - month dollars had its biggest fall since March and three - month euros charted the largest fall this year .
In Britain , banks bid for less than half the 40 billion pounds of three - month cash offered by the Bank of England , suggesting the clamor for funds there had been reduced by the government ’s bank recapitalization plan .
But some 600 banks hoovered up 310 billion euros at a European Central Bank auction , rather than run the risk , as they might see it , of lending to each other .
Bush also said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will insure most new debt issued by banks and expand insurance to cover non-interest bearing accounts .
He insisted the government ’s steps would be limited and temporary .
That move appeared aimed at unlocking credit markets .
The U.S. plan marks a quick about - face for Washington policymakers , who until recent days had been focusing on soaking up bad assets via a $ 700 billion fund approved by Congress .
original iPhone needs is Web apps ! " />
When 2016 was over , Apple announced that its app store business generated well over $ 28 billion in sales that year .
While that includes sales of software for its desktop operating system , it does not include the vast quantity of applications that are given away for free ( many of which enable some sort of transaction when run ) .
By any measure , the app store is big business , and an app - store - like ecosystem has now been part of any mobile OS for years .
One of the striking things about this is that , if you believe Steve Jobs , none of this was ever supposed to be .
When the original iPhone was introduced , Jobs announced its development environment : Web apps .
There ’s no SDK that you need !
You ’ve got everything you need if you know how to write apps using the most modern Web standards to write amazing apps for the iPhone today .
So developers , we think we ’ve got a very sweet story for you .
You can begin building your iPhone apps today .
Jobs , of course , was famous for dismissing something as irrelevant right until the moment that Apple was ready to enter that market .
The tight deadlines for putting something as complicated as iOS together undoubtedly left some of its SDK in a state of flux , and all of it was poorly documented — things were likely good enough for internal app development , but not the developer community .
It was easy to see Jobs ' promotion of Web apps as a strategic announcement , meant to put off developer demands while the SDK was cleaned up .
But various interviews that have come out since suggested that Jobs really meant it — in this case , his intense desire for control won out .
He ( correctly , to a degree ) figured that Apple would end up being put in a position where it would have to vet all the third - party applications .
At the time , he did n't believe his company was in a good position to do so .
Once Jobs changed his mind , the SDK was released .
Quickly , it was easy to see some of the arguments that forced this change on him .
The similarities between the iPhone SDK and the MacOS were extensive : both relied on Objective - C and had similar programming models .
This meant that any iPhone developer would be well equipped to produce desktop applications and , in many cases , the two could share some of their code .
And the lessons learned in making the SDK run on mobile processors and in limited memory could be translated to making the MacOS more efficient .
The two environments have cross pollinated regularly since .
It 's obviously worked out that way .
There 's a lot of applications available for the Mac desktop that would n't have been made if it were n't for experience gained on the iPhone .
And it's hard to imagine Apple 's Swift seeing much interest and uptake if it were n't for the iPhone developer community .
So with the iPhone turning 10 this week , we wanted to offer a walk down developer memory lane .
Below you 'll find our original review of the iPhone SDK that ran on October 1 , 2008 .
While it was n't meant to happen , in retrospect this review captures a lot of the reasons it did .
Prying into the SDK
Over the last few months , those of us who registered with Apple and downloaded the iPhone SDK have been in on a remarkably well - kept secret .
Word leaked as each new update of the SDK was released , and some sparse details about Apple 's progress slipped out , but only the roughest of outlines of the software that runs the iPhone and enables its applications made it through the nondisclosure agreement that Cupertino required .
Now , Apple has lifted the NDA , and developers are finally able to talk a bit about what we 've learned .
This wo n't be a comprehensive overview , but it should give a feel for the capabilities and limits of the iPhone and its OS , and the challenges developers face in working within those limits .
The termination of the NDA actually ends one of the biggest constraints on iPhone development : the inability of developers to talk among themselves .
With no way to share tips , techniques , and documentation , and with the SDK itself somewhat buggy and in flux , developers would run into roadblocks where something was n't working and it was impossible to tell what was at fault — your code , Apple 's code , or simply the documentation .
It will be very liberating to not have to resort to informal , off - the - record queries with the developers you happen to know , and this will probably produce a second surge of application releases in the near future .
Apple 's insistence on an NDA is even more confusing given that the SDK was given out freely to anyone who took the time to register , and open posting of development issues was permitted on an Apple - hosted discussion board .
So it 's really hard to understand what Apple achieved with a policy that had a primary effect of hurting the developers the company was ostensibly welcoming to the platform .
That rant aside , Apple 's SDK reveals far more about the device than any of the company 's statements , and it provides some insight into what it took to cram OS X onto a mobile device .
It also reveals a bit about how Apple , given what amounts to a redo on Cocoa , has aggressively pushed its software design philosophy onto its developers .
Inside OS - X Mobile
The iPhone simulator that 's part of the SDK comes with information about what 's inside the OS itself .
It does n't appear to host a full version of the OS , but what it does have can be assumed to be present on the actual device , since developers are expected rely on it ; this includes the frameworks in / System / Library .
Developers have access to all of these , like CoreGraphics and AddressBook , with one exception : IOKit , which is primarily used to create hardware drivers .
It 's there , and presumably Apple is using it , but developers do n't get to do anything with it .
There 's also a very extensive collection of private frameworks .
There are a lot of things that can be inferred from what 's in there , but it 's an exercise I 'll leave to the readers , who can examine the entire list :

If there are any command - line executables included in the iPhone ( and jailbroken apps suggest there are ) , the SDK does n't let on about them .
But it does indicate OS - level support for just about anything a Unix application could want , as man pages are included for all the software libraries present , and these go well beyond what might be expected .
The ability to manipulate kernel extensions is gone , but applications can track filesystem changes through kqueue / kevent capabilities .
The sysctl functions are present , which do allow a degree of manipulation of the basic operating system functions .
For something that 's not supposed to support background processes , it was surprising to see functions like exec , fork , and daemon .
It 's clear that Apple has left the pieces in place for enterprising coders to work around this limit , although any such apps seem unlikely to show up in the App Store .
Alternately , the company could flip the switch on this capacity should they introduce a device with greater processor and memory resources .
There 's also a fair number of oddballs among the routines , like a man page that reads , " These routines emulate the System V menu library .
They were not supported on Version 7 or BSD versions . "
These menus are normally only encountered within a terminal environment , so Apple 's decision to include them suggests that the iPhone provides a far more complete Unix environment than they 're currently allowing access to .
If you jailbreak the first generation iPhone OS , you can run a very functional terminal on it , and this ability does n't seem to have gone away .
Tools of the trade
Since the NeXT days , Apple has provided developers with the tools they need for building applications : Xcode ( formerly Project Builder ) and Interface Builder .
Instead of creating something new for the iPhone , the folks in Cupertino have modified these tools to work with the new platform .
The modifications include a new set of project templates that handle some common classes of applications .
Within Xcode , developers have access to a set of template files for some of the more commonly subclassed objects , including views and controllers ( more on those below ) .
Interface Builder allows a drag - and - drop layout of the user interface , and coders can set the behavior of these UI items and hook them to the classes that manage their activity .
In the first few releases , support for the iPhone was almost nonexistent , but it has steadily improved and appears to be nearly complete .
Developers who jumped in early were left performing most of the work in code , and they 'll have to decide whether it 's worth going back and ripping out this code in order to base their application on Interface Builder instead .
With 10.5 , Apple introduced Instruments , a suite of performance - monitoring tools based on Sun's DTrace software , that can find things like memory leaks and processor - intensive sections of code .
Apple has modified them to also operate on the iPhone simulator and on any hardware that 's connected to the development box , be it the phone or an iPod touch .
This last feature is pretty important , since the simulator runs some code much faster than the actual hardware .
The Senate is poised to clear legislation Wednesday evening to reauthorize Amtrak for the first time since 1997 and renew rail safety programs , CQ Politics reports .
[ Update 1 : H.R. 2095 passed in the Senate and will move onto the White House for President Bush ’s signature ]
[ Update 2 : CQ Politics has reported that President Bush has agreed to sign the package .
House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee ranking Republican ranking John L. Mica says he is now trying to convince Bush to sign the bill quickly so that it will be the Republican administration overseeing request for proposals from private companies for the development of high speed rail . ]
>> More on trains at Green Options
The bill , an amended rail safety measure , authorizes significant new funding for Amtrak at $ 5.3 billion in capital grants , $ 2.9 billion in operating grants and $ 1.9 billion for intercity passenger rail over five years .
The House approved the final version on Sept. 24 .
The legislation would also toughen rail safety programs , including mandating rail companies to equip their cars with sensors to help avoid crashes ( a provision that gained new - found support following the train collision that killed 25 people in California last month ) .
The Bush administration threatened to veto the Amtrak bill that the House passed back in June , but has yet to comment on the measure now being considered by the Senate .

One of the more ornate abandoned places in the world this railway station in Abkhazia is a stunning relic from the collapse of the Soviet empire .
Soviet era train stations were often overdone marble monuments to the working man and this was no exception .
Abkhazian railways consist of a 185 - kilometre ( 115 mi ) main line along the Black Sea coast and a 36 km ( 22 mi ) branch to Tkvarcheli [ 1 ] .
It connected Russia ’s North Caucasus Railway with Georgian railways prior to 1992 , however the connection with Georgia was severed as a result of the War in Abkhazia .
The railway is administered by the state - run Abkhazskaya Zheleznaya Doroga company .
At the beginning of 2008 there was one regular long - distance train Moscow - Sukhumi and occasional freight traffic .
The railway system of Abkhazia was isolated in the 1990s due to the blockade imposed by Russia .
The Russian military relies on railroads to deploy heavy weapons and armor to the battlefield .
The acute military , strategic and tactical importance of the railroad system in Russia explains the existence of special Railroad Troops whose task is to keep the tracks in order during and in preparation for war and to organize makeshift armor battlefield disembarkment points .
In July 2008 Russian troops repaired 54 km of Soviet - built tracks with 20 tunnels and bridges south of the Abkhaz capital Sukhumi to the coastal town of Ochamchire .
The railroad was out of use since the early 1990s , a period which witnessed the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Georgia - Abkhaz war .
At a colorful official ceremony in Dranda , south of Sukhumi , the commander of the Railroad Troops General Sergei Klimets told journalists that the railroad operation was “ purely humanitarian ” to help the people of Abkhazia .

Colbert looks for solutions to ' total financial extinction ' David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Thursday September 25 , 2008
Print This Email This Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert attacked the thorny problem of how to fix the nation 's financial crisis on Wednesday and attempted to determine whether or not a $ 700 billion bailout will really help .
" We are on the brink of total financial extinction , " Colbert began .
" Thank god , just a few hours ago Senator John McCain stood up and showed us he has the grit and resolve to lead America through this dark time .
...
He is suspending his campaign . "
" I , for one , cannot think of anything more presidential , " commented Colbert .
" Being president demands suspending all kinds of things .
Habeas corpus .
Gitmo prisoners .
...
Of course , cynics are going to say McCain is just using this crisis to appear presidential while ducking Friday 's first presidential debate . "
Insisting that McCain " does not care about politics , " Colbert briefly joined him by suspending his own show , sitting quietly in the dark , sighing " Country First , " and drinking a bottle of beer .
However , he gave that up when informed the financial crisis had n't automatically ended as a result .
Colbert then turned to the testimony of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , who told Congress on Tuesday that Americans " got put on the hook by the system we have , the system we all let happen , the system that Congress , the administration , future administrations let exist . "
" Do you hear that ? " ranted Colbert .
" The real blame lies with future administrations .
...
How dare they will have ! "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke further explained that the figure of $ 700 billion is only a guess , because " just as when you sell a painting at Southeby 's ... nobody knows what it 's worth until the auction 's over . "
" Art is an excellent analogy , " applauded Colbert , " because I think a lot of people are looking at our economy now and saying , ' My five year old could have done that . ' "
Colbert finally brought on New York Times business columnist Joe Nocera and asked him , " Tell me ... how this bill can save the economy . "
" It 's going to save the economy because there 's nothing else , " Nocera replied sadly .
" It 's the last thing they got .
If this does n't work , we 're in ... "
" $ 700 billion is the last thing they 've got ? " interrupted Colbert .
" I think it could be more like a trillion two , a trillion three , " Nocera replied .
" They do n't know how much the stuff is worth that they 're going to buy , and they 're pretty much going to make it up as they go along . "
When Colbert asked why the government can't just fix the problem the way it fixes everything else , by cutting taxes again , Nocera explained , " That was the old days .
Now it 's the today day , and you can't do that any more .
...
We 're out of money and we have these giant debts and you can't make believe any more . "

Many people with heart disease try to banish fats , but they 're missing out on lots of foods that can protect the heart .
Avocados , nuts , fish , olive oil -- they 're all fatty , and they can all help keep you alive .
But other fats act as napalm to the heart .
You can't protect your heart by simply counting fat grams , says Alice Lichtenstein , director of the cardiovascular nutrition laboratory at the USDA 's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging .
" It 's the type of fats that matter . "
Fats to avoid
Trans fat :
An artery - clogging element of partially hydrogenated oils , trans fats are found in many fried foods , commercial baked goods , and stick margarine .
These fats increase your LDL ( bad cholesterol ) while lowering your HDL ( good cholesterol ) , weakening your natural defenses against heart disease .
Harvard researchers have estimated that banning trans fats from the American diet could prevent some 228,000 heart attacks each year .
Saturated fat :
While it is n't quite as destructive as trans fat , saturated fat is much more abundant .
The saturated fat in meat or dairy products encourage a buildup of plaque in the arteries by increasing LDL ( bad cholesterol ) levels in the blood .
A recent study found that saturated fat also inhibits the anti-inflammatory benefits of HDL ( good cholesterol ) , while fats from fish , grains , and nuts boosted it .
Heart - healthy fats
Unsaturated fats :
The types of fats found in olive oil , canola oil , nuts , avocados , and fish can actually clear LDL while boosting HDL .
A study by Harvard and Johns Hopkins researchers found that swapping a diet high in carbohydrates for one that 's high in unsaturated fats improved the cardiovascular profile of 164 adults over a six - week period .
The unsaturated fat diet decreased blood pressure , increased HDL , caused no significant increase in LDL , and lowered triglycerides .
Omega - 3 fatty acids : Found in cold - water fish , omega - 3 fatty acids have been shown to prevent blood clots , lower blood pressure , and slow the buildup of plaque in the arteries .
Large studies suggest that this fat can lower the risk of heart disease by more than 35 percent and can reduce the risk of sudden death from heart attack by more than 50 percent .
The landmark Lyon Diet Heart Study found that heart attack survivors who adopted a Mediterranean - style diet -- low in red meat and dairy but rich in olive oil , nuts , fish , whole grains , fruits , and vegetables -- lowered their risk of heart attacks , sudden death , and cardiac events by 50 percent to 70 percent .

Forthright 's Favourite Words
I 've often been consulted by those wishing to express their love for a particular word , such as defenestration , sesquipedalian , syzygy or aglet .
While these are all fine choices , I 've chosen fifty of my favourites from the International House of Logorrhea and put them here , with pronunciation , etymology and full definitions .
Some of the criteria that I use to find a really great rare word are : it has to be pretty rare ( less than five occurrences per 1 million words of text ) ; it should be very euphonious ( it has to sound good ) ; it should be of use in a modern context , if not necessarily usable on a daily basis ; it should not have a simple one - word synonym ; it should not be so long and complex to be useless in conversation .
The majority of the words are nouns ( most rare words are ) , though there are also verbs , adjectives and adverbs .
Most are derived from Greek or Latin , though with a smattering of French , Italian , Arabic and , of course , native English terms .
Aegrotat 'ee - gro-tat , n ( Latin aegrotat , he or she is sick , 3rd person singular of aegrotare , from aeger , sick ) A medical certificate of illness excusing student 's sickness .
Rarely used today except in Britain , and then only in the context of degrees and courses considered as passed by a student too ill to finish the appropriate material .
Aegrotat is the only surviving remnant of the Latin verb aegrotare .
Almacantar al - me - ' kan - ter , n ( Arabic almuqantarat , the sundials )
A circle of altitude , parallel to the horizon .
An astronomical term , used to describe imaginary lines in the sky by which an astronomer determines the height of a star in the sky relative to the horizon .
Many Arabic loanwords to English begin with the prefix " al " , which in Arabic simply means " the " .
Amphigory am - ' fi - ge - ree , n ( French amphigouri , of unknown origin )
A nonsense verse .
Specifically , a poem designed to look and sound good , but which has no meaning upon closer reading .
The term ' amphigory ' could be applied to large segments of modern poetry , except that its authors probably actually believe that what they are writing is something other than a meaningless trifle .
Barathrum ba -' rath - rum , n ( Latin , from Greek barathron )
An abyss ; an insatiable person .
The second meaning , probably more popular than the first , derives from the metaphor of a bottomless pit , which characterises the stomach of some people , such as my brother .
Boustrophedon boo - strof - 'ee - don , adj and adv ( Greek , from bous ox and strophe a turning )
Of writing , alternating left to right then right to left .
Not a word with a great deal of utility , unless you study ancient inscriptions , but very descriptive .
I like the metaphor of an ox ploughing the field back and forth from one direction to the other .
Cancrizans ' kang - kri-zanz , adj ( Latin cancrizare to move backwards , like a crab )
Moving backwards ; especially , of a musical canon , repeating the theme backwards .
While sometimes used in the general sense , cancrizans is most commonly used to refer to a particular type of baroque composition known as a crab canon , the most well - known of which is by Bach and is part of his Musical Offering - one of my favourite pieces of music .
Carfax ' kar - faks , n ( Latin quadrifurcus , four - forked )
A place where four roads meet ; an intersection of main roads at the center of a town .
Despite its appearance , it has nothing to do with cars or faxes , but is an anglicisation of the older Latin term .
Now largely forgotten except in a few place names in the UK , but there 's no other word to represent the main intersection in a town .
Colophon ' kol - e- fon , n ( Latin , from Greek kolophon , summit , finishing touch )
A publisher 's emblem or inscription , usually found at the beginning of a book .
Everyone has seen these insignia , which once were very elaborate but have been downplayed by modern publishers .
It used to be that the colophon of a book also listed the author 's name and the date and place of publication .
Delenda de -' len - da , n pl ( Latin , neuter plural of gerundive of delere , to delete )
Things to be deleted or destroyed .
The term is best known from the Latin phrase " Delenda est Carthago " , or " Carthage must be destroyed " , spoken by Cato the Elder in 157 B.C. after perceiving that Carthage might pose a threat to the Roman Republic .
In this age of censors and shredders , delenda is rare , but most definitely not at risk of being deleted from dictionaries .
Diaglyph ' die - a - glif , n ( Greek , dia through , and glyphein to carve )
A figure etched or engraved into a flat surface of a gem , stone or other object .
Used in contrast with cameo , which is carved in relief , with the figure jutting out from the flat base .
Synonymous with intaglio , a term derived from Italian , and perhaps somewhat more common .
Enchiridion en- kie - ' rid - ee - on , n ( Greek , from en in and cheir hand )
A book carried in the hand for reference , especially one used for music or theology .
Etymologically , it 's a book that is meant to be able to be carried in one 's hand , which today probably encompasses most books , but , ironically enough , not all ' handbooks ' .
What a strange language we have ... Episemon ep - i -' say - mon , n ( Greek , a badge , from epi , on , and sema , a sign )
A badge or characteristic device - in this sense , it is synonymous with and etymologically identical to the Latin - derived insignia .
However , episemon also means one of three obsolete Greek letters ( vau , qoppa and sampi ) used solely in the Greek alphabetical numeral system .
I just had to put something in this list related to my academic work on numerals .
Famulus ' fam - yoo - lus , n ( Latin , a servant )
A private secretary or attendant .
Used especially to describe an assistant to a magician or scholar .
I particularly like this word not only because it sounds more refined than ' lackey ' or ' Hey , you ' , but because of its applicability to graduate students in a modern context .
Farrago fe -'rah - go , n ( Latin farrago , mixed fodder , from far , grain )
A confused mass of objects or people ; any disordered mixture .
This is an excellent term to describe the chaos evident in a crowd , jumble sale , or any drawer in my home .
It 's not just a mess , but adds the extra context of confusion and clutter .
Galimatias gal - i -' may - shi-us , n ( French , gibberish )
Nonsense ; a confused mixture of unrelated things .
This very cordial - sounding word is extraordinarily useful in contexts where one wishes to inform someone that their ideas are bafflingly ridiculous and incoherent without seeming overly impolite .
It combines the senses of ' incoherent ' and ' ridiculous ' into a unique and useful term .
Growlery ' growl - er-ee , n ( English ; cf. Dutch grollen , to grumble )
A retreat for times of ill humour .
This term has largely become obsolete , which is strange , given that so many people seem to have a place to go when they are in a bad mood - a place to be alone and think .
It 's similar in meaning to the Latin - derived sanctum sanctorum , with the added connotation that the individual in question is going to the place to be alone while upset .
Haecceity hek -' see - i- tee , n ( Latin , from haec , this )
The aspect of existence on which individuality depends ; the hereness and nowness of reality .
First coined by the philosopher Duns Scotus , haecceity is that sense one gets of being in the present tense , the pure experience of a single moment in time .
No other word has such subtle connotations .
In addition , it sounds and looks very interesting .
Hecatomb ' hek - a - toam , n ( Greek hekatombe , from hekaton one hundred and bous ox )
A large sacrifice or slaughter ; the killing of one hundred animals or people .
Hecatomb , like decimate , is a word for killing involving the number to be killed , but has now come to mean a more general slaughter of many people .
Not only does it sound appropriately ominous and grave , but , in this age , it seems all too likely that it may remain useful in the future .
Imbroglio im - ' broal - yo , n ( Italian , confusion , from imbrogliare to confuse , embroil )
An intricate , confusing or disturbing situation ; a confused mass or heap .
Imbroglio is close to predicament in meaning , only with a remarkable sound ( especially its Italian soft ' g ' ) and the added connotation of confusion and entanglement .
It is to be preferred enormously over the anglicised ' embroilment ' .
Incunabulum in - ku - ' nab - u-lum , n ( Latin incunabula , swaddling - clothes , from in in , and cunae a cradle )
An early printed book ; an early version or stage ; the cradle or birthplace of something .
While initially ( and still occasionally ) used today to refer to the books printed at the dawn of the printing press ( prior to 1500 ) , it can also be used in other , more general senses , with great usefulness today .
For instance , we might call Project Gutenberg an incunabulum of the Internet .
Jeremiad jer - i -' my - ad , n ( From Jeremiah , reputed author of the Book of Lamentations )
A lamentation or prolonged complaint ; an angry or cautionary harangue .
Poor Jeremiah !
He writes one complaining letter to God , whines about the state of the world , gets it published in the most popular book of all time , and his name is forever attached to the concept of complaining and lamenting one 's fate .
I think there 's a moral message in there somewhere , but I have n't figured out yet what it is .
Kenspeckle ' ken - spek-l , adj ( Scottish English , from Old Norse kennispeki power of recognition )
Easily recognizable or distinguishable ; conspicuous .
This word sounds very interesting , and is all the more remarkable because it is etymologically unrelated to the similar - sounding and synonymous conspicuous ( Latin con , an intensive , and specere , to look ) .
Kenspeckle is mostly used in Scotland and northern England these days ; perhaps it should enjoy greater currency .
Liripipe ' lir - i- pipe , n ( Late Latin liripipium ; ultimate origin unknown )
The long tail of a graduate ’s hood ; a part or lesson committed to memory .
Liripipe is one of those mysterious words for things that you never knew had a name .
In its first sense , it is only useful to amaze your friends at graduation ceremonies , where many older - style hooded gowns have them .
The second sense is perhaps more useful , but also used only rarely today .
Lucubration loo - ku - ' bray - shun , n ( Latin lucubrare , from lux light )
Study or composition lasting late into the night .
This is a fantastic word for the activities of ' night owls ' such as myself , without synonym or parallel and having a striking sound .
Though it 's mostly used facetiously today , I see no reason why lucubration should not be restored to its proper glory .
Let 's all help take back the night !
Mascaron ' mas - ke-ron , n ( French masque , a mask , from Italian maschera )
A grotesque face on a door - knocker .
Everyone 's seen and used them , but I 'll bet you did n't know there was a word for this .
Not only does it have a remarkable sound , but it 's the sort of thing that really ought to have a word .
Related to mask , mascaron may ultimately derive from the Arabic maskharah , a jester or man in masquerade .
Miasma mi -'az - me , n ( Greek , pollution , from miainein to stain , pollute )
Foul vapours emitted from rotting matter ; unwholesome air or atmosphere .
I can safely predict , with the current state of the environment , that miasma may become a much more common word in the next fifty years as it becomes a more common state of affairs .
It has an appropriately gaseous and foul - sounding name , adding to its linguistic appeal .
Mumpsimus ' mump - si-mes , n ( A blunder for Latin sumpsimus , we have received )
A view stubbornly held even when shown to be wrong ; one holding such a view .
In an old story , it 's said that an ignorant priest , knowing the sound of the Latin Mass but not speaking the language , said the meaningless ' mumpsimus ' instead of ' sumpsimus ' .
When corrected , he is said to have replied , " I will not change my old mumpsimus for your new sumpsimus " .
This learned joke has lasted five centuries in the form of this fine - sounding word .
Nepenthe ni-' pen - thee , n ( Greek , from ne- not , and penthos grief )
Something , such as a drink or a drug , capable of making one forget suffering .
First mentioned in Homer 's Odyssey as a potion capable of erasing all bad memories .
By extension , the use of nepenthe today largely reflects the reputed powers of alcohol to get rid of the memory of one 's woes .
Whether or not this actually works ( other than temporarily ) , the word is marvellous .
Omphaloskepsis om - fe - lo - ' skep - sis , n ( Greek , from omphalos navel and skepsis query , doubt )
Navel - gazing .
This extraordinarily rare word is not normally used literally , but instead to refer to the sort of introspective self - analysis all too common in academia and pop psychology .
A favourite pastime of postmodern philosophers , especially when used facetiously to refer to the habit of mentally considering everything while ignoring the real world .
Orphrey ' or - free , n ( Old French orfreis , from Latin auriphrygium Phrygian gold )
Gold or other rich embroidery , especially that found on clerical vestments .
I admit that there is n't that much use for this word today , given that most priests do n't have highly embroidered vestments anymore .
Nevertheless , the fine sound of this word suggests that it needs to be revived and possibly expanded in meaning .
Panopticon pan -' op - ti - kon , n ( Greek , pan - all and optikon for seeing )
A prison where all inmates can be watched from one point ; an exhibition room .
The panopticon was an idea of Jeremy Bentham .
If a single guard post is erected in the middle of a circular prison , all cells can be seen from that point .
Unfortunately , the idea never caught on , though the word was used to apply to a royal exhibition in London roughly organized on such a scheme .
Peccavi pek - ' ah - vee , n ( Latin peccavi I have sinned )
An admission of sin or guilt .
Not only is this word 's meaning unique , and its sound very interesting , but it gave rise to the most witty multilingual pun of all time .
In 1843 , when Sir Charles Napier sent a preliminary dispatch of a single word : " peccavi " .
The reason : his military victory and conquest of the province of Sind ( now in Pakistan ) .
His message : " I have Sind " .
Phrontistery ' fron - tis - te - ree , n ( Greek phrontisterion , from phrontistes a thinker , from phroneein to think )
A thinking - place ; a place for study .
I simply had to include ' phrontistery ' on this list .
It was first used by Aristophanes to apply to the school of Socrates , and was somewhat mocking in tone .
A peculiar ( and under - used ) term , I hope to reclaim it for thinking people everywhere .
No other term is synonymous , and its intellectual if pompous sound merely adds to its charm .
Pilgarlick pil - ' gar - lik , n ( English , peel + garlic )
A poor wretch ; used whimsically and self - pityingly to refer to oneself .
Originally , pilgarlick was used to refer to a bald or balding person ( hence its etymology , one 's bald head looking like peeled garlic ) .
Since then , it has come to be used mostly in self - reference , when one is lamenting one 's lot in life .
There truly needs to be a term like this in common use .
Quincunx ' kwin - kunks , n ( Latin quincunx , from quinque five , and uncia a twelfth part )
An arrangement of five things with four at the corners of a square and one in the middle .
The unique meaning and peculiar sound of this word , coupled with the fact that it is a pattern seen on cards and dice , are the reasons for it making my list .
Such a symbol was at one time used for the Roman fraction 5/12 , thus explaining its etymology .
Redivivus red -i-' vee - vus , adj ( Latin , from red - again , and vivus alive )
Resuscitated , come to life again .
There are plenty of words to describe coming back to life ( renaissance , resurrection ) , but none so pleasant - sounding as this one .
Used largely in literary and formal contexts , it is taken straight from the Latin term of the same meaning .
It is , I think , an ideal term to be used in place of ' renaissance ' to refer to things newly restored to popularity .
Rhadamanthine rad-e - ' man - thine , adj ( Greek , from Rhadamanthos , a judge of the lower world )
Like a stern judge ; rigorously just and severe .
Sometimes found capitalised , this word means not only conservatism but also strict legalism and harsh punishment , thus reflecting the attitudes of many judges today just as it did in ancient Greece .
Rhadamanthos was ( with Minos and Aeakos ) , one of the three judges in the underworld to whom one would plead one 's case after death on the basis of one 's character and deeds .
Good luck !
Selcouth ' sel - kooth , adj ( Old English sel ( d ) cuth , from seldan seldom , and cuth , known )
Strange ; unfamiliar ; marvellous .
Combining the sense of strangeness with that of wonder , selcouth is a fantastic self - referential word , being both marvellous and ( to most English speakers ) entirely unfamiliar .
No word is really synonymous with it , and it reflects very well the sense of wonder and amazement at seeing something truly new and unusual .
Enjoy it !
Sisyphean sis - i -' fee-an , adj ( Greek , from Sisyphus , king of Corinth )
Laborious , endless and futile .
This term , sometimes capitalised , derives from the story of the legendary king Sisyphus , who was condemned after his death to perpetually roll a huge stone to the top of the hill , only to have it roll back each time he neared his goal .
Sisyphean is a marvelous adjective to describe much of the work done in the world today .
Skeuomorph ' skyoo - e - morf , n ( Greek skeuos vessel , tool , and morphe , shape )
A retained but no longer functional stylistic feature .
This term was originally used in architecture and archaeology to refer to a feature whose origin was functional , but whose only vestige was as a decorative ornament .
It is of great use today as imitation seams , supports and other things are applied to bits of plastic that came directly out of a mould .
Spatchcock ' spach - kok , v or n ( English , probably from dispatch and cock )
To insert into a text too hurriedly or inappropriately ; a fowl stuffed and cooked immediately after killing .
This is probably my favourite word of all time .
Though there 's little use for it any more as a noun , the idea of hurriedly killing , stuffing and cooking a bird has enormous metaphorical value .
As a verb , spatchcock is a term that should be picked up and used by every editor who has ever had to read a manuscript that has been prepared in such a manner .
Tantivy tan -' tiv-ee , adv ( Imitation , either of a hunting - horn or horses ' hooves )
At full gallop ; headlong .
Tantivy is most often used today as an adverb , but can also be used as a noun ( a hunting - cry ) , an adjective ( swift , speedy ) and an interjection ( the sound of the horn or of horses ' hooves ) .
Its remarkable range of meanings seems all the more remarkable in that no one really knows the origins of this peculiar but mellifluous word .
Tintinnabulate tin - ti -' nab - you - late , v ( Latin tintinnabulum a bell , from tinnire to jingle )
To ring ( as a bell ) ; to tinkle .
This fantastic word describes the sound of bells ringing just as well for us as it did in Roman times .
When it is used today , it is usually facetiously , with the rather less satisfactory if shorter choices ring , tinkle and jingle serving day - to - day functions .
A real shame , given the remarkable sound of this fine word .
Tregetour ' trej - e- ter , n ( Old French tresgetour , from tresgeter , from Latin trans across and jetere to throw )
A juggler , trickster or deceiver .
Originally used to describe a type of jester or juggler , tregetour , though now archaic , eventually came to mean someone who uses cunning tricks to deceive others ( sometimes but not limited to stage performances ) .
A useful poetic word for a magician , but also a more pleasant - sounding name for a huckster or con man .
Ultracrepidate ul - tre - ' krep - i- date , v ( Latin , from ultra , beyond , and crepida , sandal )
To criticize beyond sphere of one ’s knowledge .
This very interesting - sounding and useful word for a common practice has a very interesting etymology .
In a Roman story , a cobbler criticised the sandals in a painting by the painter Apelles , and then complained about further parts of the work , to which Apelles is said to have replied , " Ne sutor ultra crepidam " , or , roughly , " The cobbler must not go beyond the sandal " .
As true today as it was then .
Vilipend ' vil - i- pend , v ( Latin vilis , worthless and pendere to weigh )
To despise ; to make light of ; to disparage mockingly .
Related to vile and vilification , vilipend is a word that implies disparagement , slander or criticism , but usually with a fairly light and mocking tone .
A particularly good term to refer to a certain style of literary and academic mockery - and God knows there are enough people out there who need to be vilipended .
Widdershins ' wid - er - shinz , adv ( Low German weddersins )
Counterclockwise ; in the contrary direction .
You might ask why I 'd include this obsolete adverb ( used only facetiously and in some Scottish dialects ) , when it has a perfectly good synonym .
To this , I point out that the day may soon come when clocks with hands are obsolete , at which point we may need to revive this word to alleviate the confusion .
Also spelled and pronounced withershins .
Xenium ' zee - ni-um , n ( Greek xenos guest , host , stranger )
A gift made to a guest or ambassador ; any compulsory gift .
As I 'm writing , the Christmas season approaches , reminding me of the necessity of a word to reflect a gift you 're obliged to give rather than one you really want to .
Whenever you go to the wedding of a stranger or an enemy , think of this word and smile .
My gift of ' xenium ' to you is most definitely desired .
Yare yair , adj ( Old English gearu or gearo , ready , prompt )
Marked by quickness and agility ; nimble ; prepared ; easily handled .
It 's basically obsolete anymore , but this fantastic short little gem is very useful .
It reflects the sense of preparedness and mental quickness one feels from time to time - the feeling that one is ready to face the world and its challenges , and that anything is possible .
Try it , use it - I think you 'll like it .
Zetetic ze -' tet - ik , adj or n ( Greek zetetikos , from zeteein to seek )
Proceeding by inquiry ; a search or investigation ; a skeptical seeker of knowledge .
A term originally used to refer to Pyrrhonists , a group of ancient Greek skeptics , it has come to mean both the process of inquiry and one who so proceeds .
A zetetic is thus a sort of intellectual agnostic who , while seeking greater truths , is always wary of falsehood .
( Latin , he or she is sick , 3rd person singular of , from , sick ) ( Arabic , the sundials ) ( French , of unknown origin ) ( Latin , from Greekand ( Greek , fromox anda turning ) ( Latinto move backwards , like a crab ) ( Latin , four - forked ) ( Latin , from Greek , summit , finishing touch ) ( Latin , neuter plural of gerundive of , to delete ) ( Greek , through , andto carve ) ( Greek , fromin andhand ) ( Greek , a badge , from , on , and , a sign ) ( Latin , a servant ) ( Latin , mixed fodder , from , grain ) ( French , gibberish ) ( English ; cf.

Return to the Phrontistery
Dissociative identity disorder is considered by some to be a better term for " multiple personality disorder . "
It does avoid some of the negative stereotypes associated with the prior label , but ....
All right .
I admit it .
I hate this term .
It makes me incoherent with the hating .
Blah !
Misinformation !
False premises !
Bibble !
Myths and stereotypes !
Wibble wibble !!
Let 's explore why .
The Oligarchy of Psychiatry
The United States is the only country which relies on the term " dissociative identity disorder " and all of its attendant connotations .
Dr. Ralph Allison , a forensic psychiatrist who specializes in multiple issues , has witnessed the shift in terminology over the years .
He writes that in the committees to revise the DSM for its fourth edition DSM - IV ) , the psychiatrists who specialized in teaching and research rather than working with patients :
" decided that the patients had the major mental problem of believing that they had more than one personality .
The goal of therapy should not be integrating the various personalities , but getting the patients over their false belief ( delusion ) that they had other personalities at all ....
I heard one of these teachers say in public , ' Everybody is born with only one personality .
Therefore , there can be no such thing as a Multiple Personality Disorder . ' "
" This amuses me greatly .
There is absolutely no scientific basis for such a claim , first of all .
Second of all , most people are not " born " with a recognizable personality ( or personalities ! ) in the first place !
Babies differ in temperament , but formation of identity involves many , many neural connections that occur AFTER birth .
Whether a single self or several are developed depends on many factors . "
As ac_hyper remarks , The term " dissociative identity disorder " was adopted only in the United States , with the hope that everyone else could be persuaded to change their terminology to follow suit .
The rest of the world uses the ICD : International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems .
The DSM - IV was put together with the idea that it might be chosen to serve as the ICD 's section on " mental disorders . "
However , it was not , and the other great swathes of humanity on our planet ( as well , for that matter , as much of the United States ) continue to mostly use " MPD , " with just a note in the ICD under " multiple personality disorder " mentioning that " dissociative identity disorder " is a synonym .
The problem that I see occurring in the often contradictory body of information on multiple issues is that many therapists are basing their ideas on just one multiple system , or a handful , that they 've seen over the years , and assuming that any similarities they find are true for all multiples , and trying to teach this as gospel to their colleagues .
It 's difficult for many people to understand the experience of being multiple without either being multiple themselves or knowing someone who is .
I think it 's especially important to be ( or know people who are ) very self - aware .
Like anybody else , each multiple system and each person within that system are very individual .
Often the various ideas out there about MPD / DID are based on one therapist knowing a few people who are in therapy because they are dealing with a major crisis , trauma , or seeking greater self - awareness , still sifting through their own possible explanations and ideas about who they are .
This has led to myths like :
With all these myths , is n't anything about it true ?
" ... When I think of what has been written so far about multiplicity , I sense a terrible gap .
There are the chillingly cold - blooded studies of pathology , and the warmer , more kindly therapeutic texts ( many of which are maddening , hilarious , or both to actual multiples ) .
There are also accounts of actual cases written by professionals , which strike me as a combination of boasts and rip - offs .
And then there is the writing already done by multiples : the autobiographies that focus on the horrors , and others that focus on the healing .
And there are emotional outpourings too , written by multiples for each other .
Each serves its own purpose , but what 's missing is the dailiness , the odd but telling textures of multiplicity . "
- Jane Phillips , The Magic Daughter
Hopefully , I can fill in a little of this gap here .
Like the experiences of being Latino or transgendered , much of what 's left over after the stereotypes are dismantled is highly individual .
There are actually many similarities between the experiences of multiples and transgendered people , not least the fact that many a person in a multiple system can say that they are literally a woman trapped in a man 's body ( or vice versa ) .
I know this from personal experience , as my gender identity has been heavily informed by the fact that I share my awareness with people of lots of different genders .
But as I study American Sign Language , I start to see more and more similarities between my own experiences and the experiences I hear from people in the Deaf community .
And as I discuss multiplicity and life with a friend of mine who 's intersexed and multiple , we start to find similarities between some common experiences of both those communities as well .
I think that what we all have in common is the experience of being what I call medicalized minorities : groups whose experiences and very existence are labeled disorders or disabilities and who the medical community helpfully would like to wipe out .
In books like Oliver Sacks ' " Seeing Voices , " for example , about the Deaf community , and in writings from the Deaf community itself , many Deaf people talk about how doctors proudly say they could wipe out Deafness eventually , and how many babies with partial hearing are given painful and expensive cochlear implants on the off chance that it might improve their hearing later , even though it destroys their ability to hear without it .
I get a strong sense , from Deaf literature , that being Deaf is good , is a fine experience , that many Deaf people are happy with their lives and that the only problems with being Deaf are those that the hearing world creates for them .
I hear similar things from most of the multiples I know : a focus on pride , on self - exploration , and on building community together .
What it 's like for us ; or , How it began
I first learned about what it was like to be multiple through someone in whom I was interested , a genderqueer boy who was just coming out on a mailing list I ran .
He lived not too far away , and I offered him a place to crash so he could go to a local queer youth conference .
Upon his acceptance , I began to read everything I could of his website and online journal .
Much of that dealt with the experience of being multiple .
I suppose the main things I learned were : in a general sense , that everyone in his system was a real person ; and in a specific sense , who they were and how they worked ( or did n't work ) together .
I read Amber 's calm teenage normalcy , Lily 's wild young abandon ( and fondness for stolen butterfly gifs ) , Jo 's bold radical activism , Chris ' brave anger and humor .
And many others ; overlapping circles of inner abusers and controlling figures .
Politics .
I never found it very hard to tell who was out , although some people blurred together to my outsider 's eye .
I studied everything they had to say online and found mannerisms , speech patterns , beliefs , and interests that were specific to different people .
Then I watched for those .
This is , I think , what I would advise anyone to do who wants to get to know the people in a given system : just pay them a great deal of attention , be willing to ask respectful questions , and be willing to guess wrong sometimes .
They suggested , when we became an " item , " that I join a mailing list for multiples .
At first I was embarrassed and apologetic about being there , but soon I found that we all had a lot in common .
Too much in common .
I began to make little lists like this :
( from the fall of 2000 )
I wonder about the memory thing , how I will have no idea I told someone something or had a certain conversation and either vaguely remember it when pressed later , or not at all .
I wonder deeply about the buzzy - head feeling & the time I had that feeling and could not stop reacting to things with apparent anger though I was not angry and had no idea I sounded mad & today I was feeling very angry as well in that separate from me way and then it left and abruptly it seemed as though I had been on muni forever - like both of our memories of the time at once ?
I wonder about the adjoining sense of small child temper tantrum ( at the prospect of not seeing Morgan in facilitator training ) and about my many tantrums as a little kid and about the other day when I let a little kid co-consciousness come out to play with Connor
I wonder about my extreme sense of dissociation between high school and college and my struggle to remember who I was in high school and what it was like and what I did and smooth the break between them
I wonder about the talking to myself at length and how I used to hear snippets / words before falling asleep
I wonder about the feeling of laughter that wells up even before a joke made mentally is done
Is the sometime sense of totally being present and outgoing in a room produced by someone inside me ?
Sometimes I pay attention to who I am and run my mental fingers over the bumps between me's .
And I wonder about my inner world and my writing style which feels like channeling something ... and the houses ....
I know I will feel like a copycat / delusional but I think reading about this stuff and knowing multiples just gave me words to use that made these things clear .
These were largely compiled of things I knew , but did n't want to admit to myself .
I would suddenly realize that something with " kaleidoscope " in it would be a good system name for us , and then remember that that was ridiculous because I was n't multiple .
Ha !
Finally , too much evidence piled up for me to ignore .
I subscribed a second email account to the list and introduced myself , anonymously , as someone who thought they might be multiple .
I laid out all the things that made me question it .
Everyone said , " It sure sounds like it ! "
What does it look like to others ?
One of my closest friends once commented ,
" You know , one of the great things about you being multiple is that I can be really boring .
I can show you the same things like 10 times and I 've got a good chance that it 'll be new and exciting .
This is certainly true in our case , and it works in reverse too .
Despite a high level of shared awareness and shared memory , and a lot of commitment to not telling the same story to the same person more than once , our roommate has several times had to say , " Yes , you 've shown me that before .
About ten times . "
( Apparently the sign for helicopter is just far too fascinating for us to hold in . )
Daniel , in another multiple system , was telling us the other night that of their two roommates , the one who does n't know they 're multiple handles it so much better than the one who does .
Apparently the roommate - who - knows gets freaked out if she realizes she 's talking to someone different .
Their other one , though , comes out with statements like ,
" Are you okay ?
You 've gotten all quiet and focused again .
You know , I know it 's not about me , but sometimes you seem really different .
The way you react to things changes , or you sound different , or you get very quiet ... sometimes you even have kind of an accent , maybe it 's a European accent .
And I know it 's not about me , I just wanted to make sure it meant you were okay . "
I think she knows more than she realizes -- or more than they realize she does .
Multiples often go unnoticed because few people know what multiplicity looks like and many are barely even aware of its existence .
Many systems also put a great deal of energy into seeming " normal , " often because their own experiences and the messages they get from their culture ( whatever culture (s ) that might be ) tell them it is not safe to be different .
For example , our roommate , when pressed , said that all he really notices about us being multiple is that sometimes we get more swishy , and sometimes we forget things he 's told us and it 's really frustrating .
We teased him about how he does n't notice the kids being out because he is a kid himself , and he staunchly insisted that he's at least 12 now and that he does notice , because we get excited about silly things .
" As far as I know , I 'm not multiple . "
A lot of people start out with statements like that .
For me , it runs along the scary line of " I can't tell you what your experience is - but I feel like I know , because I had that same experience - but I can't tell you what your experience is ! "
It 's like when I was in high school and I used to think I could n't be bi , because bisexuality was something else - it 's just that I can't decide who 's cuter , the hot girl over there or the dancer boy I like .
It 's the kind of thing that makes for good jokes on Will and Grace .
" He 's not a convict !
He 's just a white - collar guy who embezzled a little money and has to spend some time in prison so he can think about what he did . "
" Oh really ?
Does he happen to have a brother who is n't gay , but likes to sleep with men ? "
To help those who might be questioning a little themselves at this point , I 'd like to show you something that someone wrote after reading this .
It has some more excellent examples of things we experience as " multiple stuff . "
I do have a few quirks that I 'm sure certain multiples can relate to .
First there 's the clothing issue ; I change my outfits often when I 'm home , and the styles can vary in an extreme sense .
I often put something on in the morning , only to feel by the afternoon that it 's totally WRONG somehow .
I also tend to dress in " themes " : sometimes I really feel like a teenager so I 'll put on my baggy jeans and Rainbow Brite T - shirt and sparkly eye shadow .
Sometimes I feel like a very serious adult , so I just wear jeans and a plain sweater .
Other times I feel very hippie / crunchy , so I do the whole flowered - skirt - with - Docs thing .
Lately I 've been into vinyl and fishnets , which is both a new development and a revisitation of my freshman year in high school ( when I really wanted to embrace my inner goth aesthetic , but was prevented from doing so my my overly conservative parents ) .
Then there 's the feeling I get sometimes , especially at work , that I 'm running some sort of program .
It 's like I can converse with co-workers about one thing while simultaneously having a very long thought process about something totally unrelated .
It 's like mental multitasking , and could possibly be related to ADHD .
Words come out of my mouth sometimes with unconscious fluidity -- inside I 'll feel insecure , but outwardly I 'm knowledgeable and casual .
And sometimes the opposite is true : I 'll have something perfectly clear in my head , but when I try to express it , I hesitate and stammer and get annoyed at myself for not saying what I meant to say .
I also seem to have a very strong inner child .
Again , this could be the ADHD talking .
I will be sitting at my computer at home and suddenly get the urge to go jump all around the room .
Like , literally I 'll start jumping up and down .
And all the while I 'm feeling this incredible joy , like just being alive is the coolest thing in the world .
I still skip down the street sometimes without caring if anyone thinks I 'm weird .
In my actual childhood , things were sometimes dark , but the " kidness " I 've held on to is an extremely positive force within me .
Positive , but sometimes a bit stubborn .
I have many internal conversations that go something like this : Kidness : " This is BORING .
I wanna play on the Internet !
I wanna get up and run around the building ! "
Grownup : " We can't do that now , we 're at work , we need to focus . "
Kidness : " But I do n't want to sit still !
And this stuff does n't make any SENSE ! " Grownup : " Stop bothering me , I need to get back on track . "
Kidness : ( sulks ) " Fine , but I 'm NOT going to make it any easier for you to do your work ! "
Of course I do n't literally hear voices or anything , but I do have a sense of conflicting desires .
The odd but telling textures
Q : How many " alters " does it take to change a light bulb ?
A : One to change the bulb , one to change it back , three to argue over whether they want it light or dark , one to throw the light bulb against the wall to hear it crash , one to clean up the mess , four to go shopping for new bulbs and come home with stocking , licorice , Disney movies , popcorn and masking tape , one who insists it " IS " the light bulb and does n't understand why everyone always wants it to change and can't it just be itself ....

These days , I often hear people unconsciously say things that seem ( to me ) to reek of multiplicity .
A friend of mine , who as far as I know is n't multiple , told us ,
" Why do n't I just kill myself ?
Jerry thought .
Wait !
That was not his thought !
Where had that come from ? "
This was one of the big signs that we were multiple : all the long internal conversations .
When I was younger , I remember reading all these books about people who were telepathic , or possessed , or under mind control or whatnot .
And there was always some part like , And we were all , always , totallyby this .
How did all these people know the thoughts were n't theirs ?
How could theythey had n't thought that ?
It's
Or so the argument went .
Books , books , damned books .
They told us other people could distinguish their own thoughts , and then they confused the situation by showing people having arguments with themselves .
Terry Pratchett has an excellent portrayal of someone who begins by having arguments with herself and finally turns out to be totally multiple , across several books - Lords and Ladies and Carpe Jugulum in particular .
He likes to describe her as " Agnes , who is really in two minds about everything . "
Some time before I read that , in the process of figuring it all out , I wrote this :
For me it feels rather like there 's this me that I 've always thought of as me - whoever " me " is , let 's not get into that .
And the more I think about multiplicity and learn about people 's experiences with it , the more I feel sort of breaks or bumps in the " me " that I thought was so singular .
( Which I 'd always thought covered quite a bit of ground , too . )
And as I think about them , I can recognize different areas they cover .
Like , I watch my own behavior and notice when something that I say - which always seems perfectly normal to me - sounds like a total asshole thing to say when it comes out .
And not just like I stick my foot in my mouth , but more like when there 's a certain amount of time that this behavior continues .
I 'll say something , and notice that I 'm being an asshole , and notice a disconnection between who I was thinking of as " me " and who 's making a decision to say something really inappropriate that they think is funny .
( Which I often also think is funny - but I would n't say it because it 's mean or whatever . )
For us , there are two major aspects to being multiple : the inner conversations and relationships , and the outer lives lived and negotiations made about who gets to do what when .
Recently , the question arose of whether to take a creative writing class , and it struck me how many different ways I can describe the internal communication around it .
We went downstairs for break during our sign language class , and passed a flyer for a creative writing class .
My immediate thought was " oh no ! " because I knew it would be another thing to add to our schedule .
And all these other people went " oo ! " and stopped to read it .
And it turned out that it was once a week , right after our sign class , and that the author had even written a play called " The Incest Project . "
( Well , we did n't know it was a play - it just listed " The Incest Project " among her works and we thought , " That might be promising . " )
And I was like , " Okay , we can discuss it .
Talk amongst yourselves , I 'm going to go move the car . "
And I thought we should probably draw out a schedule of what our days look like now and what they would look like if we took that class ( an idea which I later realized actually came from the kids ) .
But back in class when we were drawing the schedule chart , I started to feel all this stress and anxiety around the possibility of taking the class .
( actually , it took me a minute to even figure that much out about where it was coming from . )
And I was all , " Okay , what 's going on ?
We 're doing the chart like you wanted .
If it 's too much , we just wo n't take the class .
It 'll be fine either way .
Chill . "
And I think whatever kid was around ( I think I 'll blame Abigail ) realized at the same time that it was weird that she was freaking out about that .
And she was all , yeah , why am I freaking out about this ?
And she thought about it and said " I think that I would be really sad if we did n't take the class , too .
I think it 's cause I really really want to take that class . "
Which I thought was pretty smart and self - aware .
And I realized that we 've been wanting to take a creative writing class for literally years , and are always kind of jealous of our friends who get to take them all the time and major in that subject now , and we really need a class like that to give us deadlines or we just do n't write , and stuff .
And we did end up taking it , which is good .
And like , that 's the language I would normally use to think about it and describe all that .
But I could also describe it like ...
I decided to draw up a chart of what it would be like with and without the extra class , and I started feeling really stressed out .
It seemed like a lot of anxiety , which is pretty unusual for me right now -- or maybe it 's just that I notice it when it happens instead of considering it a constant background noise -- and I finally stopped to figure out where it was coming from .
I thought it seemed like it was coming from some kids in here .... let 's see , how do I describe what that feels like to me ?
I think it 's like ... when I stop to really experience an emotion I 'm having , instead of just tuning it out , I can get a sense of who it comes from .
If it 's my own , it feels much more vivid to me when I connect with it like that , and I can usually figure out why I 'm feeling it .
If it 's some kid's ( and they 're most often the ones whose emotions flood through into the rest of us , possibly because they 're much more free with , or less able to control , what they 're feeling ) I usually get a sense of " kidness " attached to it .
It 's a more intense sadness or anger or joy sometimes , or it 's connected to things that a kid is ( or would be ) upset about and I 'm not .
It 's another question of boundaries , too ; it took us all some time to learn what our own feelings felt like and to connect with them enough to think " Wait , am I really angry or sad about that ?
Or is that someone else 's feeling ? "
So I felt this anxiety , and I wondered what the cause was .
And I thought , when did I start feeling this ?
And it was about when I was drawing up this schedule .
So I figured out that there was a kid who was stressing out about taking this new class .
And I thought , " Why ? ! "
Because it did n't make sense , or really , because I did n't want it to make sense that people would still be stressed out about it because damnit I thought I had magically gotten all the decision - making under control with The Drawing of a Chart .
Because I 'm a Virgo .
And I sort of listened in the kids ' direction ... which is vague - sounding enough , right ?
It 's like ....
If I 'm going to tell my roommate that the electric bill is late or that I bought him a present or that Johnny Cash died , I can think about him , get a feel for how I know him in my head , and get a sense of what his reaction is going to be .
If he 's there in person , I can get a more accurate sense of how he 's feeling by reading his body language and just taking a moment for some kind of empathy and understanding of him .
This is a very long description of something that many people do with each other all day long ; I 'm describing it in such detail cause it 's basically what I do to figure out what other people in here are feeling or telling me .
I just sort of " tune in . "
( Which was a total mindfuck when I first started exploring the possibility that I was multiple .
It made it very easy to think that whatever I heard or felt must be some product of my deranged writer 's mind .
I 'm just too imaginative , right ?
But I learned to suspend my judgment of myself on that count at least , and wait and see for things to become clearer to me before I started deciding it all was or was n't real . )
So I listened and got the sense that whichever kid was around was n't sure why they were upset either .
And I suppose that it 's basically like tuning in a radio ; bothering to listen to others is like turning the dial , on good old non-digital radios that is : the reception gets better and I can slowly hear things more clearly .
Not that I 'm hearing things .
Not that there 's anything wrong with hearing things .
And I could hear her thoughts in response to me as she tested her feelings and thought about taking the class and how that felt and thought about not taking the class and how that felt , and came to the conclusion that the anxiety was because our assumption had been that taking it would be stressful , but she thought that not taking it would be really sad too .
All this in maybe thirty seconds of class time .
Boundaries : Where the Rules End and I Begin
I think that the tricky thing for many of us in here has been learning our own boundaries , learning how to understand what belongs to each of us and what belongs to someone else in here .
I think that that is a problem for a lot of people ; it 's hard to figure out whether or not you 're multiple if you do n't yet know where you end and others begin .
Until that happens , many multiples find themselves in foggy chaos .
We struggle to figure out who each of us is and who else is in here with us , what they are doing and what they want from life , and of course , whether that 's going to interfere with our own plans .
Often this is confounded by self - doubt and fears .
This is probably even more true for multiples who have been abused in some way .
When our boundaries in any relationship are systematically destroyed , whether by accident or on purpose , especially when we are just developing a sense of our own boundaries in the world , how can we have a sense of ourselves as people ?
And how much less of others sharing our mental or physical space ?
They say that codependency is a disease caused by trauma .
And , of course , one often - cited description of codependency is " not knowing where I end and where you begin . "
Think about how much harder it is to find that boundary between people when there 's no clear physical boundary to begin with , or when there are natural reasons to know most of what they 're thinking and feeling .
This is one reason that it makes me very sad to see people who have only had exposure to the traditional clinical model of multiplicity , who talk about people as " alters " or " pieces . "
I know from experience that people in a multiple system - especially one with a traumatic history - often do n't even see themselves as whole , worthwhile people , much less treat other people in their system that way .
A lot of therapy out there works with that perception to dehumanize them even further , determined to have everyone give up their lives and their selves before they 've had any chance to live .
It terrifies us .
A lot of systems find a clash between what the fronters ( the person or people who are most often out in the world ) want , and the desires and needs of others in there with them .
In our case , the person who was fronting most when we came to terms with being multiple held on very tightly to that position , wanting to control what other people saw us doing and saying .
Ze ( and this is being written partly by zir ) had a total codependent freak - out about it , and tried to know everything about everyone and obsess about what they were all doing and fix and control it all ... much to everyone else 's displeasure .
We have a theory that this is often the case : that the people who end up being the fronters in multiple systems often place themselves in that role because they need to oversee and control everything to feel safe .
( There are twelve - step meetings for that , you know ! )
Negotiating the day - to - day world
Now , fortunately , after a lot of negotiation and experimentation ( and , all right , many of those meetings ) we 've gotten to a place where there is n't necessarily any one " fronter , " where it 's more that we all have our chunks of time to do what we want and other time where we all try to do what is necessary .
In fact , we realized the other day that even if Dani is ( sometimes , egotistically ) considered the fronter in everyday life , Precisegirl is definitely the " fronter " on everything2 , both as the person who does the most work here and the one who keeps an eye on how we 're all presenting ourselves .
( What a blow to my ego !
One minute , I 'm the boss of everyone , the next I rank lower than Duck , who 's rarely out , because she 's funnier ! )
Many people in that role find themselves the subject of great resentment from other people in their system who they have been semi-consciously trying to keep in check : kids who never get to play , people of all ages who never get to talk to their friends , people with different ideas about relationships or different sexual orientations who have long been thwarted .
Sometimes it takes a lot of work to get to a place where people can let go of each other and figure out how to share the collective life safely .
It can also be terrifying for people to be out , because ( as some of our kids in here say ) " What if people see you ? "
We want to be known as individuals , but we do n't want people to notice us there ; it 's a difficult contradiction to deal with .
Partly our reticence has to do with not being able to control what people think of us -- but wanting to -- more codependence .
Partly it 's the fear that if they realize they 're talking to someone different than they perhaps think they are , they ( like Daniel 's roommate ) will be afraid of us , and not want to talk to us anymore .
The effort of negotiation can also affect outside communication .
As someone I know who is just beginning to deal with her multiplicity has observed , in the tangle of accomodating others and being co-conscious and all talking at once , we both end up saying things that are just the average of what two or three people inside wanted to say -- so they end up being what nobody wanted to say .
On the other hand , sometimes the multiplicity works for us .
I often find that we are multitasking with amazing efficiency because one person is writing email and thinking about our plans for tonight while another is doing research online and transcribing stuff for work .
And while many of us have ended up staying late at work or " forgetting " something important because other people were out , there have also been many times that one of us would have forgotten something , or could n't find something , or was n't sure what the plans were for the day , only to be saved by someone else yelling out ( inside ! )
" I left your book under the desk , " or " Check the cookies before they burn ! " or " Hey dumbass !
You have to meet Sarah in fifteen minutes ! "
Besides , we 're much better at making decisions now that we know about each other .
There was a time ... and by a time , I mean about twenty - two years ... when small decisions took forever to make .
We would stand in the ice - cream store for half an hour trying to decide between mint chocolate chip and pralines ' n ' cream , or spend forever trying to choose which book to take home as a prize for the bookcount .
Once we realized why this was , we could actually negotiate over what flavor to get , or reassure each other that a bad decision was n't the end of the world .
We came up with some ground rules .
If everyone wants mint chocolate chip except Cat , she can have her cone of New York blueberry cheesecake because that must mean she rarely gets her way .
If Rose wants to wear her long black skirt to school and Mouse wants to wear the kittycat shirt , they either wear both , or decide which of them has the greater need , or decide that one will be worn now and one later that day .
It still takes a while sometimes , but not half as long as it did when we were groping around in the dark for some kind of reason for all these different impulses .
If you 're reading all this and wondering whether it 's possible that you might be multiple , well ... certainly it is .
It can be a good thing ; and while it can be very scary to first question it ( like questioning anything about one 's identity ) , if you are multiple , you may find that you 're all a lot happier knowing about it .
For us , it has opened the door to a self - awareness and enjoyment of our lives that we could never have had in the previous years of switchy confusion and guesswork .
There are a lot of good websites and books out there where people talk about being multiple ; some of them are listed at the end of this writeup .
And of course , you can always /msg us .
Bitter_engineer has suggested here that " I suppose the message is this : if you have dissociative identity disorder , trust no one , not even yourself . "
I think that actually , it 's incredibly important to trust yourself , and yourselves , and each other .
You may not be able to trust anyone yet , and you may have people in your system or in your life who are harmful to you ( or vice versa ) .
But unless we learn to trust and work together with those who are trustworthy and work around those who are n't , our lives really do end up being disordered .

The French nuclear giant Areva yesterday confirmed there was a radioactive leak from a broken pipe at a nuclear fuel plant in south - eastern France , a week after a uranium spill at another of its plants polluted the local water supply .
The latest incident comes as an embarrassment to the French government as it struggles to contain environmentalists ' anger and reassure residents near its nuclear plants that they are safe .
Earlier this week the government ordered safety tests on the water table around all of France 's 59 nuclear reactors .
Areva is at the forefront of President Nicolas Sarkozy 's quest to export French nuclear technology around the world , including to Britain .
France is one of the world 's biggest atomic energy nations , generating more than 80 % of its electricity from nuclear power .
The newly discovered leak at a plant in Romans - sur - Isère in the Drôme region came from a damaged pipe which safety authorities said might have ruptured a number of years ago .
Areva , a state - controlled firm which makes nuclear reactors and deals with uranium , said the leak came from a buried pipe transporting liquid uranium and that the crack in the tubing was " several years old " .
France 's nuclear safety authority , the ASN , said the leak did not reach the ground water and that there was no sign of contamination .
It said initial tests showed no impact on the environment because the quantity of uranium was very small , around a few hundred grams .
Areva is also responsible for running the Tricastin power plant , in the nearby Vaucluse area , where a uranium leak occurred last week when a tank was being cleaned .
Drinking well water , swimming and water sports in the area were banned , as well as irrigating crops with the potentially contaminated water .
Both leaks ranked as a level - one incidents on the seven - point scale of nuclear accidents .
The ASN criticised Areva for the handling of the Tricastin leak , saying it delayed communication of the problem and its security measures were unsatisfactory .
After admitting the safety lapse , Areva this week sacked the director responsible for the site and announced an internal audit .
If you follow politics , is seems that whenever you turn around , you are confronted by an instance of Republican hypocrisy .
In the midst of the scandals and issues concerning Sarah Palin and her family and pregnant daughter , John McCain is quoted by the Wall street Journal as saying :
–“ This is a very personal matter for the family .
We should all respect the love they have for the child and the desire all parents would have for their children ’s privacy . ”
–“ The media should respect Bristol ’s privacy .
That ’s always been the tradition and practice when it comes to the children of candidates . ”
.
.
.
–“ The children of candidates do not choose to run for office and be thrust into the spotlight . ”
-----
That is a noble sentiment , one with which Barack Obama agrees .
If only McCain had been consistent when the family in question belonged to an incumbent from the party opposite .
I rediscovered this snippet from a John McCain speech during a Republican Dinner in June 1998 published in the June 25 , 1998 version of Salon :
" Why is Chelsea Clinton so ugly ?
Because her father is Janet Reno . "
------
You can make an argument that discussing a teen 's pregnancy in the context of whether abstinence only policies work is a legitimate question and issue .
What legitimate issue is being discussed in McCain 's above attack on Chelsea ?
This is one of the things that makes being a Democrat so difficult .
Do you dive into the muck and allow yourself to use the same disgusting methods the Republicans use to make political points and win elections , or do you let them get away with their tactics and lose ?
Perhaps , some will say , this question is a false dilemma .
Perhaps by not employing those tactics , you can win .
I 'm not convinced and I would cite the Swiftboat veterans for lies in 2004 as my proof .
McCain 's stated beliefs and positions are rife with reversals , flip flops , and doing and saying anything just to get elected .
McCain really wanted to have Lieberman as his Vice President , but settled for a lightweight to appease his base .
McCain really is pro amnesty for illegal aliens , but his party made it clear he would not win the nomination if he stuck with his principles so he gave up on them .
He was involved in the Keating Five scandal , so to try to salvage his reputation , he called up Democratic Senator Russ Feingold to create campaign finance reform legislation .
He attacked a teenaged Chelsea Clinton but cries foul about Sarah Palin 's children being the subject of a debate .
This is the way of John McCain and the Republican Party .
I wonder how many people remember the " Compassionate Conservative " slogan of the Bush 2000 campaign ?
None of these Republican slogans mean anything .
McCain is now talking about change and putting people & the country first .
Again , it means as little as his current statement that he doesnt believe in involving the children of candidates or politicians .
McCain 's only value is saying what he needs to win .
We do n't need another guy like that in the White House .
• Blasts during Ramadan killed six Muslims • Police link three arrested to opposition youth wing
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
Three people said to be Hindu activists were arrested yesterday in connection with bombings that killed six Muslims during Ramadan last month in the west of the country .
Police in Maharashtra state investigating the two attacks on September 29 said the three were part of a group of extremist Hindus with links to the youth wing of the nationalist Bharatiya Janata party , India 's main opposition party .
Five people died in one of the explosions , in a crowded market near a mosque in Malegaon , 175 miles north - east of Mumbai , while a teenager lost his life in Modasa , in neighbouring Gujarat , when a bomb exploded in a predominantly Muslim area .
Both came after a wave of deadly bombings apparently directed at middle - class Hindus in Indian cities and claimed by Islamists .
The government had considered banning some extremist Hindu groups for inciting violence but backed off after groups of men armed with guns took to the streets of big cities in protest .
" These blasts do not fit into the pattern of Muslim terror groups .
And in most cases we have credible evidence to link it to Hindu groups .
But the question is , how pro-actively are we willing to investigate ? " one unnamed officer told local media .
The news comes after an upsurge in violence that has seen Hindu mobs rampage through Christian villages in the eastern Indian state of Orissa , leaving more than 40 people dead .
More than 20,000 Christians in the district of Kandhamal fled their homes for state - run camps .
Christians who have lost their homes have been told they can return only if they convert to Hinduism .
At a press conference in the Indian capital yesterday a nun said she had been raped and paraded naked in Orissa by a rampaging mob of Hindus in August .
" The police failed to protect me .
They were friendly with the attackers and tried to prevent me from filing [ a charge ] ) .
They abandoned me , " said the nun , who was swaddled in scarves to remain anonymous .
She called for the central government 's investigating arm to launch an inquiry into the attacks , defying an order from the country 's top judges to cooperate with local police .
" I have no faith in the [ state ] government or the police , " she said .
The anti-Christian violence this summer spread across four states , including Karnataka , the capital of which is Bangalore , India 's information technology capital .
This month Nicolas Sarkozy , the French president and current European Union president , said he had serious concerns over the " massacres of Christians " .
Kancha Ilaiah , professor of political science at Hyderabad 's Osmania University , said the violence was part of a disturbing trend .
" The Hindu fundamentalists have a long history of trying to play politics with religion in India , " he said .
" They claim Muslims are terrorists but the Hindu groups openly distribute weapons in India . "
One of the best parts of my trip to Lego and exploring their factory was the minifig production lines , where the head and body of the most famous toy citizen in world gets painted and assembled at uncanny speeds .

• First , the raw plastic material is put into the molds to create all the parts : the head , the torso , the minuscule hands , the hips , and the left and right arms and legs , plus any minifig complements , like helmets or tools .
• The head and torsos are always decorated .
This is a complicated process that makes the minifig the most expensive part of any Lego set .
This is why sets like the Death Star diorama are among the most expensive .
The stamping of the colors is usually made in several passes .
In older times , the faces always had the same designs .
Today , however , they have different features that require different layers ( personally , I like the classic ones more than the ones with different faces ) .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
• Once they are decorated , the torsos are put into the body assembly machine , where the left and right arms are put into them mechanically .
The same machine then places the hands inside the arms with absolute precision at lightning speed .

• The torsos are then taken to the packaging production line , where they are put together in the bags along with the head , hair / helmet / hat , and legs with hips .
Before , the machines also connected the heads and legs , so the Lego aficionado would find the minifig complete inside the box .
Now , however , this is left for the player except for the vintage minifig set , which comes with the minifigs completely built .
Stay tuned for tomorrow ’s special features on the 30th Anniversary of the Lego minifig .

Don Stewart , Duncan Coutts and Simon Marlow ended the Haskell Symposium yesterday with a wonderful session about the future of Haskell .
Don and Duncan began with an acknowledgement of the importance of libraries to the health and future of the Haskell language community .
A long - standing need for a central source of good libraries was met about 18 months ago with the development of the Hackage package database .
Since its introduction , we have already seen roughly 750 open source Haskell packages published .
As an indication of how effective Hackage is at making leading - edge research available quickly , Don cited Jean - Christophe FilliÃ¢tre ’s functional implementation of the Garsia - Wachs algorithm ( paper , slides ) .
He presented this work at the ML Workshop on Sunday .
Nicolas Pouillard ported the ML code to Haskell a day later , and published it on Hackage immediately .
The next piece of the library puzzle has two motivations :
to get the developers of GHC out of the business of library maintenance , so they can focus on compiler hacking ; and
to broaden the set of libraries that Haskell hackers can depend on their OSes and distros to provide .
Don , Duncan and Isaac Potoczny - Jones are working on a library platform for Haskell .
This will begin life based on the current extralibs bundle , currently a grab - bag of somewhat random libraries .
As the platform evolves , it will undergo milestone releases every six months , and the set of libraries that it includes will broaden over time .
Libraries will be added based on their popularity and quality .
The idea for the platform is that as a Haskell developer , you ’ll be able to download a Haskell platform release on a specific date and get a family of stable , useful , liberally licensed , mutually compatible , and portable libraries that you can immediately use to develop applications in .
Downloading and installing the Platform , and other libraries , is now a simple task , based on Duncan ’s hard work on the cabal - install command .
It downloads , builds and installs both the library or app and all of its dependencies given a single command , “ cabal install myPackageName ” .
Developers can voluntarily report build results back to Hackage , which subsequently publishes them .
This lets you glance at a package ’s build reports before downloading it , to see whether anyone has had success with it on your platform before .
Uploading a new or updated library to Hackage is almost as simple : build a tarball with “ Setup sdist ” , then upload it with “ cabal upload dist / myPkg - 1.2.tar.gz ” .
Over the coming year , the Hackage developers will be extending the features of the central package database , to include voting and feedback features .
This will help users of packages to determine in advance whether they ’re getting solid code , and to share any good or bad experiences they ’ve had .
Simon Marlow gave a very encouraging talk about the future of the Haskell language standardisation process , Haskell Prime .
In spite of sterling work on his part and a substantial amount of work from others , he estimates that after three years , the process is perhaps 10 % complete .
Rather than get mired in gloom , the committee met a few evenings ago and came up with an outline for a change to the process .
The fundamental problem with the old process was its goal : to produce a complete revision of the language definition .
Given the large number of activities that each committee member was participating in , it was simply not going to be possible to get them all together for a long enough period to settle all of the proposals .
Instead , the intention is now to move to a more modern style of development : to issue annual addenda to the language standard , each containing incremental changes to the current language definition .
The details have not yet been decided upon , because only about half of the committee members are at ICFP , but Simon and his colleagues will be working to refine the proposal over the coming months .
Simon then changed tack , and discussed some of the changes that we can expect to see in GHC over the coming 18 months .
Much of this work will focus on making multicore performance better and more consistent .
John Dias ( a student of Norman Ramsey ) is leading an effort to replace GHC ’s back end and code generator .
This is particularly exciting , as the new back end will be based on top - notch dataflow optimization research , and there ’s clearly plenty of scope to improve the quality of both scalar and numeric code .
GHC 6.10.1 ( now in public beta ) introduces two promising changes for multicore programs :
Simon ’s new parallel garbage collector .
This is still a stop - the - world collector , but it will collect the heap using multiple threads .
Manuel and his colleagues have a technology preview of Data Parallel Haskell .
If you program to the library APIs , it ’s possible to get good parallel speedups now , but the vectoriser is a bit broken , so parallel array comprehensions do n’t work so well .
Some performance limits on GHC ’s threading support have been eliminated : it can now run a million or more threads concurrently , without breaking a sweat .
What further changes can we expect to see ?
Simon intends to work on concurrent garbage collection , using per-CPU nurseries .
This will move us away from the current stop - the - world model , and should make an enormous difference to performance and scalability on multicore systems .
The par combinator needs an overhaul : its activation cost is currently too high to let us sprinkle it about liberally .
combinator needs an overhaul : its activation cost is currently too high to let us sprinkle it about liberally .
Parallel profiling will help to characterise the performance and scaling properties of parallel programs , and to identify the sources of space leaks that can sometimes be introduced with par .
It ’s hard to overstate how exciting all of these changes are .
Libraries breathe life into a language .
Between the Platform initiative , the continued growth of the library community , and the refinement of Hackage , Haskell is quickly acquiring a stable , high quality family of libraries that developers can depend upon .
The language standardisation process is about to become sustainable , and will no longer be logjammed .
This means that popular language extensions will start to become available in other compilers , which should foster an increase of friendly competition between compiler development teams .
Facilitating competition is both exciting and important : huge strides were made in performance during the early 1990s when there was a three - way race between GHC , HBC , and the Yale Haskell compiler .
With its foci on data parallelism , improved code generation , better profiling , and multicore performance and scaling , GHC is the most exciting vehicle for innovation in high - performance parallel and concurrent code .
As a Parthian shot , I have been astounded at the number of people at this year ’s ICFP who come from outside academia .
Many of these people are n’t even using functional programming at work : they came out of curiosity ; and because they wanted to get involved in the community .
They are all tremendously excited about the energy and intellectual ferment involved , and at the welcome they ’ve received from the academics .
And talking to the academics , they ’re thrilled to now be the focus of so much interest .
There has been a marked change in the tone of ICFP recently , and it is in my estimation by far the most exciting annual conference in technical computing .
The next five years are going to be absolutely tremendous for functional programming .
Tests are code , doctests are n't
In my last post I explained why I think narrative - style tests make poor unit tests .
That alone is a good reason not to write unit tests in Python 's doctest format .
Here are more reasons why I do n't like doctest for writing tests .
Writing test infrastructure becomes harder ( any multi- line statement , like defining a class or even a function , becomes awkward ) , but test code benefits from factoring logic out just as much as any other code — and that means classes and functions .
( any multi- line statement , like defining a class or even a function , becomes awkward ) , but test code benefits from factoring logic out just as much as any other code — and that means classes and functions .
Doctests require contortions to fit the way they compare output , like using sorted ( ... ) when comparing dictionaries to get a deterministic comparision .
This detracts from readability .
In xUnit , a simple , obvious , and clear assertEqual would just work .
In doctests , if this fails : >>> foo == bar
True then you get a completely unhelpful error , but doctest leaves you with little choice if you have dynamic values that vary between test runs .
Again , this Just Works in xUnit with assertEqual .
In general , xUnit custom assertions are more flexible and readable than doctest 's output matching .
As Guido said on python - dev in July :
This is an example of the problem with doctest -- it 's easy to overspecify the tests .
I do n't think that whether the repr ( ) of a Decimal uses single or double quotes should be considered a spec cast in stone by doctests .

In general , xUnit custom assertions are more flexible and readable than doctest 's output matching .
As Guido said on python - dev in July :
It 's hard to see an overview of the tests at glance .
With a doctest file , individual tests are typically introduced by a sentence or three .
Conventions vary from file to file .
There 's no tool I know of that can give me an outline of the unit tests in a doctest file .
In contrast , almost every code editor I know of has at least one way to display an outline of the classes and methods of a Python file , which gives a good overview of unit tests written in the xUnit framework .
( And if your editor can't do it , there 's always the amusingly named testdoc . )
This sort of outline is useful as it gives you a summary of all the conditions being explicitly tested .
This helps you spot gaps in coverage , understand what the code being tested can do , and know where the most appropriate place to add a particular new test is ( if you can't easily browse the existing tests , people will just add them in arbitrary places like the end , making the test file a disorganised , unnavigatable swamp ) .

Doctest is a mini-language with ugly corners and outright bugs .
You cannot start expected output with an ellipsis .
The syntax for blanklines in expected output ( “ < BLANKLINE > ” ) is ugly .
The syntax for toggling various doctest features inline ( “ #doctest : +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL ” ) is worse .
The language is outright buggy in places — the following doctest passes : >>> print ' hello ' ... print ' world ' hello
This one passes too : >>> assert True ... garbage >>> print 1 1 Testing APIs like pyunit can and do have ugly corners and bugs too , but the scope for problems is larger with a mini-language .
I 've never heard of an outright syntax error being silently ignored by pyunit !
I might be more forgiving of doctest 's quirks if it was n't almost 10 years old already .
But that 's not all .
A more fundamental reason why I dislike doctests is that tests are code , and code works better in a .py file than a . txt file .
There are a couple of reasons for this :
Tool support .
Text editors already know how to syntax highlight .py files correctly .
Pdb works better with normal code ( in doctests the capturing of stdout confuses the prompting ) .
I can use standard profiling tools .
I can run PyChecker and Pyflakes on .py files .
I can use ctags .
I can use bicyclerepairman .
I can use pydoctor or epydoc .
There are many more examples .

Tests are code , and code needs organisation .
Tests suites in many ways are just like any other code : logic gets reused .
Normal python modules provide well - known , effective ways to manage this : you can make classes that inherit from other classes , you can create modules for storing common utility functions , etc .
But you can't import code from a doctest .
Defining a function , let alone a class , in a doctest just plain looks weird .
And because code is code even inside a doctest , sometimes you want to refactor it .
Gerard Meszaros ' xUnit Test Patterns book is subtitled “ Refactoring Test Code ” because tests need refactoring too .

Gerard Meszaros ' xUnit Test Patterns book is subtitled “ Refactoring Test Code ” because tests need refactoring too .
Prose is n't always a good substitute for comments in the code .
A commonly stated benefit of doctests is that they make prose easier to write — but equally they make code comments and docstrings harder to write .
In a Python file you can write : class Thing ( object ) : " " " Docstring . " " " # Comment .
In doctests , you have to write >>> class Thing ( object ) : ... " " " Docstring . " " " ... # Comment .
Those tedious “ ... ” mean that almost every single code snippet I 've seen in a doctest has lacked even a single comment or docstring , even when they really needed it .
A prose preamble is n't always the best place to explain code .
Tools can be improved to cope with doctest ( for instance I heard that my pdb problems may be solved in Python 2.5 ) , but new tools are continually being invented , and I want to be able to use those too .
For instance , the 2to3 tool for converting Python 2.6 code to the upcoming Python 3.0 does n't fix code in doctest files .
And I still can't do “ set filetype=doctest ” in vim , which is hardly a new tool .
With sufficiently improved tool support and infrastructure many ( but not all ) of my concerns would be reduced .
For instance , it would help if there were a way to easily reset all state during a long doctest , so that different parts of the same file could be independent .
And then it would be good if there were also then a convenient way to put names on these independent sections .
But you 'd still be left with a design that gently encourages people to do things a worse way ( write a big story ) , and you'd be reinventing the wheel : xUnit already gives you those things .
In my experience many developers with the best of intentions will produce poor unit tests with doctest because of the way it subtly encourages bad practices .
One bad habit I 've seen over and over again is copying - and - pasting helper functions , even large , complicated ones , from doctest to doctest .
Is it because it 's not “ real ” code , so the instinct to organise it and avoid duplication does n't trigger ?
Is it because there 's no obvious home for helper functions , because a doctest is not a module ?
I wish I knew .
I do not think doctests are evil .
The doctest format is fine for some things .
For “ page tests ” ( e.g. using zope.testbrowser , as demonstrated here ) , where there 's a narrative of a user story driving them , doctests are a pretty good fit .
They can be good for writing testable documentation ( which is not the same as tests and documentation mixed together ! ) too .
But those things are n't unit tests .
I 've mentioned this book a couple of times , and I do recommend it :
Title xUnit Test Patterns : Refactoring Test Code Author Gerard Meszaros Website http://xunitpatterns.com/
You can find it on Amazon here .
If nothing else , reading it encourages thinking about the way you write tests , and ways you could do it better .
So despite the hype , I do n't think doctest has an advantage over xUnit in producing readable tests .
Code needs to be clear ( including an appropriate amount of docstrings and comments ) whether or not it 's test code .
If your developers are n't writing clear code , you have a serious problem : you are sure to have difficulty maintaining that code .
It is just as possible to write incomprehensible tests using doctest as it is using TestCase classes with test methods .
I know this because , unfortunately , I 've seen plenty of both .
Writing good tests is a skill that takes time and practice to learn .
Using doctest is obviously not a silver bullet .
Not using doctest is n't a silver bullet either , but I do think it 's usually the better choice .
— Andrew Bennetts , October 2008
From the good old days , when they were seen together , John McCain waves as he anxiously awaits his good friend back in August of 2005 , back when Katrina was wiping out New Orleans .
Sure looks like McCain is the most excited to be Bush :
Like George Bush , John McCain has nothing to offer the American people .
So , as predicted , the vicious , negative attacks against Obama are on their way .
But , an AP analysis from Liz Sidoti , who has close ties to the McCain campaign ( she used to ride on the bush with McCain and knows his favorite donuts ) actually explains why : McCain wants all of us to forget about the bad economy .
Easy for a guy who does n’t know how many houses he owns .
Not so easy for people trying to hang onto their one home .
For all the talk coming from the McCain campaign about “ associations , ” the one association that truly matters this year is the one between George Bush and John McCain .
The McCain camp ca n’t hide that one .
And , they ca n’t make people forget the economic crisis .
McCain ’s attacks ring especially shrill and hollow when the country is worried about an economic collapse :
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton counters that McCain will try to distract voters from the economic crisis by launching character attacks .
Clearly , McCain ’s campaign believes that focusing on McCain ’s biography and record is n’t enough and making Obama supremely unacceptable in voters ’ eyes may be the Republican ’s best _ if not only _ shot at winning the presidency .
The risk : Voters could be turned off if McCain goes too far .
From his national headquarters to his campaign plane , McCain ’s staff has been discouraged by the difficult environment over the past two weeks in which the race dynamics were largely out of their control _ discouraged but no less determined to win .
Advisers contend that McCain is rebounding following Palin ’s strong debate performance Thursday that quieted GOP critics who questioned her qualifications after several TV interview missteps .
Independent analysts say she improved her image and staunched the ticket ’s bleeding .
Congress approved the bailout plan one day later , and advisers hope the issue now will fade ; McCain had struggled to strike the right chord amid the crisis .
But there was no indication that other campaign topics would overtake the issue and more economic woes are possible ; the nation lost 159,000 jobs in September and Americans will soon open their third - quarter 401 ( k ) statements .
McCain is counting counting on Americans to be stupid this year .
But , most Americans are too pissed to fall for the same old tricks this time .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc posted a sharply lower quarterly profit on nearly flat sales , but its shares rose 8 percent on the Internet media company ’s plan to cut at least 10 percent of its work force to save costs .

Yahoo , the leading provider of online display advertising , said on Tuesday it planned to cut at least another 10 percent of its roughly 15,000 - strong global work force , and reduce its expense - run rate by around $ 400 million by the end of 2008 .
The planned job cuts of more than 1,500 employees expand an earlier cut of roughly 1,000 jobs , or 7 percent , that Yahoo made in February .
Chief Financial Officer Blake Jorgensen said Yahoo was prepared to further cut jobs and other expenses in 2009 if the economy continues to deteriorate .
Yahoo is cutting its work force in high - cost markets and hiring aggressively in lower - cost locales such as Eastern Europe , India and Southeast Asia .
“ The stock is up , ” Cowen & Co analyst Jim Friedland said .
“ It ’s not up on better - than - expected results .
It ’s up on a lack of a complete meltdown in the business , ” he said .
The Silicon Valley - based Web pioneer said net income for the third quarter tumbled to $ 54.3 million , or 4 cents per diluted share , from $ 151 million , or 11 cents per diluted share .
Gross revenue , including payments to affiliated websites that carry Yahoo ads , edged up 1 percent to $ 1.79 billion .
Net revenue was $ 1.325 billion , compared with the average Wall Street estimate of $ 1.37 billion , according to Reuters Estimates .
Wall Street was looking for a profit , on average , of 8 cents per share , according to Reuters Estimates .
Net revenue forecasts had ranged from $ 1.29 billion to $ 1.43 billion , the same data showed .
Yahoo President Susan Decker said the company struggled as corporate brand advertisers scaled back spending on Web marketing promotions , not only in the United States but also across Europe and Asia .
Marketers in the travel and retail industries have been canceling some contracts , she said .
“ We are still seeing a weakening trend in some Asian markets , ” Decker said .
Yahoo co-founder and Chief Executive Jerry Yang put a brave face on the situation , saying that while its premium display advertising business was declining , Yahoo appeared to be gaining market share as buyers consolidated their spending .
“ I am encouraged that most advertisers who are still spending in this environment are spending with Yahoo , ” Yang said .
GLOOMY OUTLOOK , NARROWING OPTIONS
Yahoo forecast fourth - quarter gross revenue at between $ 1.773 billion and $ 1.973 billion .
That represents a decline of 3 percent to a modest growth of 8 percent from the year - earlier quarter ’s $ 1.83 billion .
“ I had been predicting they would reduce their guidance for ( the fourth quarter ) but they really whacked it , ” said Martin Pyykkonen , an analyst with Wunderlich Securities .
“ It had been in the mid-teens , now it ’s just barely over 2 percent for revenue growth in the fourth quarter , normally a seasonally strong one , ” he said , referring to the midpoint of the percentage growth Yahoo has forecast .
Shares of Yahoo gained 7.7 percent to $ 13 in extended trade on the results , after closing 6.1 percent lower at $ 12.07 on Nasdaq .
But despite the rebound , the stock remains at 5 - year lows as hopes earlier this year that Microsoft might acquire Yahoo for $ 33 or more per share have dissipated for now .
Free cash flow fell to $ 215 million from $ 231 million in the 2008 second quarter and $ 310 million in the year - earlier quarter .
Analysts said that while the latest downturn in Yahoo ’s business has forced the Sunnyvale , California - based company to make sweeping cutbacks , these cuts are likely to further damage its competitiveness with Internet market leader Google .
“ They do n’t have much of a choice , but it ’s likely to hurt Yahoo ’s longer - term growth , ” Friedland said .
Excluding one - time items such as the costs of fending off a proxy campaign by Carl Icahn to force Yahoo back into talks with Microsoft Corp on a possible merger , quarterly profit rose to $ 123 million , or 9 cents a diluted share .
For the September quarter , the company said it ran up $ 36 million in merger , consulting and legal costs related to its on - again , off - again talks with Microsoft , an aborted proxy fight with activist investor Carl Icahn , and its bid to win regulatory approval for an ad sales deal with Google Inc .
Icahn subsequently joined the Yahoo board .
Yahoo and Google recently agreed to delay their advertising deal amid competitive concerns by the U.S. Justice Department but Yang .
Way to much time on their hands .
Warning : semi-graphic video and not appropriate for all audiences .
The Museum of the Moving Image recently launched what is basically our new favorite website : " The Living Room Candidate , " a repository of ( embeddable ! ) presidential campaign ads spanning Stevenson v Eisenhower through Obama v McCain .
So , so much fun for political and advertising junkies .
Also it is the history of how the United States of America killed itself .
This ad will make you cry .
It 's Michael Dukakis responding to unfair attacks from George H. W. Bush .
It 's also every loser Democrat since Humphrey .

To complement the imminent ( ie. sometime next year ) publication of the Refactoring in Ruby I ’ve been working on a little software tool called ‘ reek ’ .
Reek scans ruby code — either source files or in - memory Class objects — looking for some of the code smells discussed in the book .
Right now it can detect ( certain forms of ) :
Long Method
Large Class
Feature Envy
Uncommunicative Name
Long Parameter List
Utility Function
Nested Iterators
As time goes by I ’ll be adding checks for more smells , and I hope to make the current checks a bit more sophisticated .
But in the agile spirit of going ugly early , the current very early version is available for you to experiment with .
To get the tool :
gem install reek
To run it :
reek file1.rb file2.rb ...
If you try it , please let me know what you think and what you ’d like the next version to do !
You can browse the reek project ’s code repository at http://github.com/kevinrutherford/reek/tree/master or http://rubyforge.org/projects/reek/, both of which are clones of the same Git repository .
Other Ruby tools operating in this same space include Marty Andrews ’ Roodi , and flay and flog from the seattle .rb folks .
All of these tools have been made possible by the excellent ParseTree gem from the amazingly productive folks at seattle.rb .
Looks like Ruby code quality is a hot topic right now , which I think is great news .
The human Buzz Lightyear ...
The man about to cross the Channel on a wing and a prayer
Most of the passengers on this morning 's flight LX345 from Heathrow to Zurich will not think twice when they hear the captain trotting out the usual blurb over the loudspeaker .
They will be unaware that , a fortnight from now , that same pilot will be attempting one of the boldest flights of modern times .
And Captain Yves Rossy of Swiss International Air Lines will not be in his Airbus A320 on that occasion .
He will be flying an eight foot strip of carbon fibre strapped to his back and powered by four small engines from a model aircraft .
Swiss professional pilot Yves Rossy is the world 's first man to fly with fitted jet - fuel powered wings strapped to his back
If all goes well , he will be the first man in history to cross the Channel as a human jet .
If it does not go according to plan , he could find himself floating in the busiest shipping lane in the world .
Or worse .
But having jumped out of more planes with more strange contraptions attached to him than almost anyone alive ( or dead ) , Yves is full of confidence .
Not only will he have three parachutes on his back but , just the other day , he managed to fly the same distance as the Channel using his latest prototype and land safely .
However , on that occasion , he was flying over his native Switzerland , where he did not have to worry about oil tankers and tides .
' If I calculate everything right , I will land in Dover - but if I get it wrong , I take a bath , ' he says cheerfully when we meet at his suburban home outside Geneva .
' So I must ask the Big Bird up above in Heaven to help me . '
Yves Rossy is a real - life Buzz Lightyear , the winged character in the Oscar - winning film Toy Story , who takes to the skies with a cry of : ' To infinity and beyond ! '
Classical scholars might prefer the analogy of Daedalus and Icarus , the mythical ancient Greek characters who fled captivity in Crete with man-made wings ( Yves would , doubtless , prefer to be compared to Daedalus , who made it , rather than Icarus , his son , who flew too close to the sun , melted his wax bindings and crashed to his death ) .
His latest creation is so extraordinary that he has even been classified as a UFO .
It required several meetings with the Swiss government before Yves managed to prove that he was not an ' unidentified flying object in Swiss airspace ' .
Out interpid reporter : Robert Hardman tries on the wings
' Perhaps some people think I am mad , ' says the former fighter pilot .
' But I do not play with death .
I want to survive .
I will not do anything stupid . '
Really ?
The plan is that on or around September 24 , Yves will climb into a light aircraft somewhere near Calais with his wing firmly strapped on to his back and a live television crew from the National Geographic Channel filming his every move .
When the plane is at 8,000 ft , he will fire up the four little jet engines attached to the underside of the wing and then jump out .
In the plane , the wingtips are always folded or Yves would not fit through the door .
Once in the open air , he will pull a cord and the two spring - loaded ends will snap open to give him a full wing span of just over eight feet .
He will open up his engines , dive for a few seconds to pick up a speed of around 200 mph and then level out at around 5,000 ft before flying in a straight line at roughly 115 mph to England .
As long as the wind is not above 10 mph in the opposite direction , he should have enough juice to get him to Kent .
There , he will pull his parachute ripcords and drop safely on to Blighty 's fair shores .
It all looks fairly simple on paper .
But if so , how come no one else has done this before ?
I have come to Geneva to find out .
To infinity and beyond : Toy Story character Buzz Lightyear
The technology is James Bond - meets - Thunderbirds , so I expect to discover a huge hangar full of boffins in white coats and headphones glued to computer screens .
Instead , I find a basement garage containing a windsurfer , a mountain bike , a motorbike , a punchbag , water - skis , mountain skis , snowboards , scuba kit - and a thing that looks like an aerofoil off the rear end of a racing car .
This is more of a toy cupboard than a cutting - edge laboratory .
Yves laughs at the comparison .
' I love my toys .
I am still a big child , ' says the 49 - year - old son of a railway manager and a farmer 's daughter .
He has lived alone since his 12 - year marriage ended in divorce two years ago .
He remains friendly with his ex-wife , Nadia , but says that there is no room for anyone else in his life right now .
With no children , he devotes all his spare time away from his airline job pursuing his ultimate quest : creating a jet - powered wing capable of vertical flight so that , one day , man really can soar and dive and fly like a bird .
At the moment , he can only fly horizontally because of a fundamental technical problem : in order to achieve sufficient vertical thrust , the engines require more fuel than the wing can actually carry .
' But we are working on new engines , new systems , ' says Yves .
' In my lifetime , I hope that I will be able to jump off a cliff and just fly up into the sky . '
Of course , man can already fly quite happily dangling beneath a hang - glider or a microlight .
The concept of strapping a rocket to your back is not new , either .
A so - called ' jetpack ' was used in the 1965 Bond film , Thunderball .
' I did try a jetpack under controlled conditions but it was very unstable , ' says Yves dismissively .
' It lasts only for 30 seconds and can travel only 150 metres .
It 's not flying . '
He does not merely want to travel above the ground .
He is a purist who wants to fly like a bird .
Yves has been flying since joining the Swiss Air Force as a 17 - year - old cadet .
Over many years , he flew the full range of fighter jets ( neutral it may be , but Switzerland has always maintained a well - equipped air defence ) .
He moved on to the national carrier , Swissair , flying a Boeing 747 all over the world .
In due course , he was promoted to the rank of captain in the airline 's Airbus fleet .
At the same time , though , he took up skydiving and then skysurfing - jumping out of a plane with a parachute on his back and a surfboard on his feet .
' In a plane , you are surrounded by computers and shielded from the air .
But I wanted to fly naked .'
He competed in the world skysurfing championships and , in 1995 , he decided to experiment with a wing on his feet .
It nearly killed him when it flipped over and got caught in his chute leaving him with ten seconds to cut it free .
It was an important lesson .
' Birds do not fly with wings on their feet so we should not either . '
He designed a harness and strapped a new , longer wing to his back instead of his feet .
' That was a major breakthrough because I finally had the feeling that I was flying .
In 2002 , I crossed Lake Geneva twice in a day and that was when I decided I wanted to try to cross the Channel . '
Yves was not alone .
Others were trying similar stunts .
In 2003 , Austrian parachutist Felix Baumgartner managed to cross the Channel with a wing on his back by jumping out at 28,000ft and then gliding from England to France with the wind ( and a very rich sponsor ) behind him .
But Yves had always wanted to fly , not glide .
And he wanted to fly from France to England .
Yves is adamant that he wants to follow the route of his hero , Louis Bleriot , who set off from Calais in 1909 and became the first man to fly across the Channel .
He knew that power would be essential .
So , he teamed up with a German company which makes engines for model aeroplanes .
They developed a small jet the size of a Thermos flask with a thrust of 49lb .
With four of those attached to the wing , Yves found he had cracked the power problem .
As long as he stayed below 9,000 ft , he could fly more like a bird than ever before .
The Swiss aviation authorities , however , told him he was breaking the law .
' They could not decide what I was .
With no wing , I was a parachutist .
With a wing , I could be a hang - glider .
But they had no category for a wing with an engine so , they called me a UFO .
' Eventually , I persuaded them to give me a special licence .
It was only because I am a professional pilot and former fighter pilot .
Otherwise , they would say I was crazy . '
The jury is still out in that regard .
Money continued to be a problem .
Yves says that he was spending all his spare cash - around £ 25,000 a year - on his project .
But then , last year , the Swiss watchmaker , Hublot , came on board as a sponsor .
He gradually managed to fine - tune the capacity of his fuel tanks and the distances he could cover .
Finally , a few weeks ago , he flew for 13 minutes - enough to see him safely across the Channel .
The big dream was finally on .
I ask Yves to put on his kit and it is quite an operation .
He climbs inside a fireproof body suit and puts on his fireproof boots with the extra ankle protection .
The engines will be blazing by his feet but , when he lands with his parachute , his ankles will take the strain .
Next on is the parachute - all three of them .
There is a ' braking ' chute , a main chute and a reserve chute .
The wing has a chute of its own in case Yves has to jettison it .
' I would not want it to hit someone on the head .
It comes down more slowly than me . '
His helmet contains various sonic altimeters which beep noisily at certain heights .
The loudest is the 1,800 ft warning .
If he has not got his chute open by then , he is in trouble .
Finally , he puts on his wing .
He has to reverse into a gap in the middle which is moulded precisely to suit his dimensions .
Then he straps it all on .
He looks like an enormous fly , waiting to buzz off .
I try it on but , being tailor - made , it does n't fit my frame .
Today , the wing weighs a hefty 66 lb but that is because it is empty .
When he jumps out of that plane later this month , fully loaded with kerosene , it will weigh nearly nine stone .
Hence ,
Yves keeps to a strict fitness regime .
Having trained as a mechanic in his youth , he does all his own repairs and servicing at a local engineering plant .
The wing tips need new metal strips so he carefully loads his pride and joy into his people carrier and we drive along the shores of Lake Geneva to the factory where he starts cutting bits of metal by hand .
Yves admits that his technology is still pretty basic .
' In years to come , people will think this is a piece of s*** , just as the early hang - gliders were pieces of s***.
But we will improve and one day , I hope , many people will have one of these . '
His achievements have already been noted and one of his early prototypes sits proudly in Switzerland 's Museum of Transport .
Yves is not a celebrity - ' no one stops me in the street ' - but most people are rather proud of their home - grown rocket man .
' People look up and they recognise the wing , not the guy beneath it . '
He is not bothered about fame .
If he really wanted to promote himself , he would call himself ' Rocketman ' or ' Jetman ' - names the media have already given him .
Instead , he insists on giving the project the rather innocuous title of ' Fusion Man ' .
He is keener to promote the technology than himself .
He even wrote to the producers of James Bond offering his equipment - for free - for use in future films .
He was rather saddened when the only reply , months later , was a strongly - worded lawyer 's letter .
' They said they had no interest in my technology so that if anything similar appeared in a future film , I would have no legal claim .
It is a sad sign of the times .
It is always the officials who get in the way of everything . '
You do not cross Yves Rossy .
He says that one of the most painful periods of his life was the collapse of Swissair in 2001 .
For several months , he found himself jobless until the new Swiss International Air Lines was born .
He has never forgiven the Swiss bankers who killed the old national carrier , so much so that when he found one of them on his plane the other day , he ordered the man off the flight .
The banker refused and a huge row with the bosses ensued .
Yves was grounded for a week .
' I have no regrets .
We must stand up to these disgusting , arrogant people . '
So , I have no doubt that Yves will give the Channel his best shot .
If he succeeds , he will have made aviation history .
If he runs out of fuel , he will get wet .
Either way , he cannot delay his attempt beyond September 28 .
He may be one of the boldest aviation pioneers .
He may be following in the footsteps of Louis Bleriot .
But , on September 29 , he is the duty pilot on Flight LX8100 to Luxor in Egypt .
And he would n't want to delay anyone 's holiday .
• Jetman Live will be on National Geographic Channel , September 24 or 25 ( conditions permitting ) .
Joe Lieberman acknowledges that he needs to ask for " his maker 's " forgiveness after stabbing the Democratic party in the back .
Andrea Mitchell : " We 're only hours away from the holiest day in the Jewish calendar .
I wish you and your family a good fast . "
Lieberman : " Thank you , Andrea .
I wish you the same and Lord knows I have a lot to repent for . "
Mitchell : I 'm not going there , Senator .
That 's between you and your maker .
Multiple Mathematical Intelligences 1 Multiple Mathematical Intelligences ``Brain's Math Machine Traced to 2 Circuits . ''
This was the New York Times 's take ( Sandra Blakeslee , May 11 ) on a report in the May 7 Science by S. Dehaene , E. Spelke , P. Pinel , R. Stanescu , and S. Tsivkin .
The report , ``Sources of Mathematical Thinking : Behavioral and Brain - Imaging Evidence ' ' , demonstrates that there are at least two different loci in the brain involved in arithmetic and that the two loci do different things .
Exact calculation is accompanied by a ``large and strictly left - lateralized activation in the left inferior frontal lobe ' ' .
Approximate calculation tasks activate a region in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule .
The mathematical mind : exact calculation locus in the
left inferior frontal lobe ; approximate calculation
locus in the bilateral inferior parietal lobule .
These two loci are also associated with other mental activities :
The left inferior frontal lobe is also activated during verbal association tasks ; the behavioral aspect of this research , a set of experiments with bilingual subjects , shows that in fact exact calculation is language linked , whereas approximate calculation is not .
The authors remark that bilateral inferior parietal loci are also activated during visually guided hand and eye movements and mental rotation .
In an essay in the same issue of Science , Brian Butterworth points out that the proximity of the areas that control finger movements and approximate calculations ``raises the possibility that these brain regions contribute to finger counting and finger calculation ... and prompts the suspicion that the parietal lobes , in the course of development and learning , come to support the digital representation of numbers . ''
Presumably this refers to a preverbal ideation of number , with the first three fingers coming to represent the equivalence class 3 , etc .
The report concludes with a discussion of the evolutionary difference between exact calculation and approximate .
``Symbolic arithmetic is a cultural invention specific to humans , and its development depended on the progressive improvement of number notation systems .'' i.e. , of mathematical language .
``Approximate arithmetic , in contrast , shows no dependence on language ...
An interesting , though clearly speculative , possibility is that this language - independent representation of numerical quantity is related to the preverbal numerical abilities that have been independently established in various animal species and in human infants . ''
``Together , these results may indicate that the human sense of numerical quantities has a long evolutionary history , a distinct developmental trajectory , and a dedicated cerebral substrate .
In educated humans , it could provide the foundation for an integration with language - based representations of numbers .
Much of advanced mathematics may build on this integration . ''
Dehaene goes deeper into the philosophical , humanistic , and pedagogical implications of his research in an Edge piece : `` What Are Numbers , Really ?
A Cerebral Basis for Number Sense ' ' .
Multiple Intelligences .
From the point of view of teaching and learning mathematics , it is interesting to situate this research in the context of ``multiple intelligences ' ' .
This is a circle of ideas developed by Howard Gardner in a series of books starting with Frames of Mind : The Theory of Multiple Intelligences in 1983 .
( Gardner also is featured in an Edge piece : ``Truth , Beauty , and Goodness : Education for All Human Beings : A Talk with Howard Gardner ''. )
His classification is based on an empirical effort to understand all human mental abilities .
The seven intelligences he proposed - spatial
linguistic
logical - mathematical
musical
intrapersonal
interpersonal
bodily - kinesthetic - are each ``a capacity , with its component processes , that is geared to a specific content in the world ( such as musical sounds or spatial patterns ) ' ' .
This quote is from his Reflections on Multiple Intelligences : Myths and Messages , where he also mentions that ten years later he proposes adding to the list an eighth intelligence , that of the naturalist .
The experimental results of Deheane , Spelke , and their collaborators strongly suggest that mathematical ability must involve at least three of Gardner 's intelligences : the logical - mathematical ( by definition ) , the spatial , and the linguistic .
The concept of multiple mathematical intelligences was put forth , almost at the same time , in a work called Math for Smarty Pants by Marilyn Burns ( Little , Brown & Co. , 1982 ) .
She remarks , ``Being smart in math can mean several things , and different things .
`` There are some kids who are whizzes at dealing with numbers .
They do arithmetic fast , really fast .
...
`` Then there are the kids who are great with shapes , who can `see ' things easily in their heads .
...
``Some kids are good at strategy games and puzzles that do n't have much to do with either arithmetic or shape , but have more to do with thinking logically to figure things out .
...''
When I came across Burns 's book I was very pleased to see explicitly written out , for the first time , what I had felt as a mathematician for many years : there are different kinds of mathematical minds .
Besides helping me make sense of a career spent in departments with logicians , analysts , and algebraists , it made me very receptive to the ``rule of three '' as propounded by the members of the Harvard Calculus Consortium , which has become the Rule of Four in the second edition of their Calculus : `` Where appropriate , topics should be presented geometrically , numerically , analytically and verbally . ''
It makes sense to access as many intelligences as are available .
... and Multiple Mathematical Personalities ?
One aspect of the phenomenon that neither Gardner nor the Dehaene - Spelke team seem to have gone into is the correlation between the various intelligences and personality traits .
In a department of research mathematicians where the mathematical intelligences , at least , can be assumed to be present in their most extreme form , there is considerable evidence of a correlation , which may not be noticeable in the general population , with various personality types .
Without going into too many specifics , let me tell the story of a mathematician , a male , who changed fields early in his career .
When his wife was asked at a cocktail party what her husband did ( this probably dates the story ) , she said : `` He 's a logician .
But , '' she quickly added , ``he used to be a topologist . ''

Critics of the filtering plan fear it will slow net speeds
Is the Rudd government about to erect a Great Firewall of Australia - introducing a form of internet censorship that will infringe upon the freedom of computer users to browse the worldwide web ?
That is the concern of online civil liberties groups , as the Rudd government prepares plans for a field trial of internet service provider ( ISP ) filtering products , with a view to introducing them nationally .
ISP filtering is the blocking of certain sites which the government deems illegal or inappropriate , and is the central plank of the Rudd government 's " Plan for Cyber - Safety " .
The official watchdog , the Australian Communications and Media Authority ( ACMA ) has been conducting laboratory tests of six filtering products , and the government plans a live trial soon .
" Although the internet has opened up a world of possibilities and benefits for Australian children , " noted communications minister Stephen Conroy when he announced his intention to police the internet earlier in the year , " it has also exposed them to continually emerging and evolving dangers that did not previously exist . "
The aim , he said , was to create a safer online environment for Australian children .
Web feed
But the government has been very tight - lipped about its plans .
That information vacuum has been filled on the blogosphere by concerned internet users .
Much of the angry online chatter and speculation has centred on whether internet users will be able to opt - out of the filtered " clean feed " .
China is known for operating tight control over net access Senator Conroy has stated that Australians would be given the opportunity to opt-out , and that the scheme would therefore not be mandatory .
But a network engineer from one of Australia 's leading net suppliers , Internode , has challenged that assertion , arguing that there would be two black - lists .
One would contain unsuitable and harmful material for children ; the other would include inappropriate material for adults .
Mark Newton of Internode wrote in an online forum : ' The much - touted ' opt - out ' would merely involve switching from blacklist number 1 to blacklist number 2 .
Regardless of your personal preference , your traffic will pass through the censorship box . '
Senator Conroy has since indicated that there would be a two - tier system : a mandatory one that would block all " illegal material " and an optional tier that would block material deemed unsuitable for children , such as pornography .
Watch dogs
The opponents of ISP filtering have practical as well as philosophical concerns .
Firstly , there are worries about online censorship .
The website , " No Internet Censorship for Australia " asks : " Do we really want the Government of the day deciding what Australian adults can and can't see ?
Do we want Australia to join a censorship club in which Burma , China and North Korea are the founding members ? "
Then there is the problem of what online free speech advocates call " censorship creep " .
It is easy to mix up a site criticising child sex tourism and one promoting child sex tourism .
Dale Clapperton , EFA " Even if the filtering system only targets child pornography to begin with , we have no confidence it will stay that way , " says Dale Clapperton of the online civil liberties organisation , Electronic Frontiers Australia ( EFA ) .
" It will be subject to creep .
Everyone with any lobbying clout will be after the government to ban their pet peeve websites . '
These fears are exacerbated by the political balance of power in Canberra .
Though the governing Labor Party has a comfortable majority in the House of Representatives , it has to rely in the upper house , the Senate , on the Greens , an independent from South Australia and the socially conservative Family First Party .
Family First 's sole parliamentarian , Senator Steve Fielding , recently single - handedly blocked the government 's initial proposals for a luxury car tax .
Freedom of online speech advocates fear he could use his influence to push for even greater controls on the internet .
There is also question of what is inappropriate , and who gets to decide .
The Greens Senator Scott Ludlam contends : " The black list ... can become very grey depending on how expansive the list becomes - euthanasia material , politically related material , material about anorexia .
There is a lot of distasteful stuff on the internet . "
Slow start
There are technical issues , as well , such as the impact of filtering on the speed of the web , which in Australia is already slow .
The technical term is network degradation .
After its recent trials , ACMA reported significant improvements on earlier studies .
The network degradation on one product was less than 2 % , although two products were in excess of 75 % .
Censorship creep may afflict the net filtering system say critics Filtering systems also have a tendency to " overblock " , restricting access to legal material .
They look at words , the ratio of images to text and the preponderance of skin colour .
They assess content but not necessarily the context in which it appears .
" It is easy to mix up a site criticising child sex tourism and one promoting child sex tourism , " says Mr Clapperton of the EFA .
Finally , there is the question of whether the filters will be effective .
In the ACMA trials , the filters ranged from an 88 % to 97 % hit rate .
Even the most successfully restrictive system was by no means water - tight .
Computer experts also say that the filters will not impact peer - to - peer ( P2P ) file sharing networks , which account for an estimated two - thirds of internet traffic .
" Any determined user - including children - could bypass the filter quickly using an anonymizer service , " says the No Internet Censorship for Australia site .
Many in the online community fear that Australian government is about to degrade the internet with a filtering system that will not offer any effective protections - that if a way can be found to erect the Great Firewall of Australia , it will be easily and quickly breached .

For Atlanta voters , 10 hour lines await RAW STORY
Published : Friday October 31 , 2008
Print This Email This
At many polling spots around the country , early voting is for the studious : arrive whenever , brave a relatively small crowd , and cast a ballot well before the deadline .
But , not this time .
In Atlanta , GA. , MSNBC 's Tamron Hall found not just long lines , but a day - long wait as well .
" These are folks standing in line , trying to get in before early voting ends in that state , " said Hall .
" It ends today , by the way .
And this line ?
Eight to 10 hours is the estimate for some poor soul who's at the back of the line right now .
Eight to 10 hours .
" These lines are everywhere in the state as voters are packing into the polling locations .
They say across the state , lines at polling locations are several hours long , not just where we 're looking , at this strip mall .
Officials estimate , according to what I 'm reading here on one of the local news Web sites , about 12 percent of the state 's 5.6 million registered voters have already cast their vote .
" ... They 're seeing a strong turnout among African - American voters in this state .
Some of the more populated areas , like Atlanta with more African - Americans , are seeing a huge turnout .
This appears to be the case from just looking at the video . "
Poll lines of daunting length -- though none which top Atlanta 's 10 hour wait -- have been reported in Florida , North Carolina and Nevada .
More are expected on election day .
Extremely long lines are of concern to vote integrity watchdogs due to repeat occurrences of mis-allocated voting machines in largely Democrat - leaning areas .
A lack of machines in heavily - populated , African - American majority districts in Ohio contributed significantly to George W. Bush 's 2004 win .
Local and state officials are calling on the governor and secretary of state to extend early voting through Monday .
This video is from MSNBC's News Live , broadcast October 31 , 2008 .

I just saw this article at the Congressional Quarterly .
It is a major , major development :
The FBI has blocked two of its veteran counterterrorism agents from going public with accusations that the CIA deliberately withheld crucial intelligence before the Sept. 11 , 2001 attacks .
FBI Special Agents Mark Rossini and Douglas Miller have asked for permission to appear in an upcoming public television documentary , scheduled to air in January , on pre-9/11 rivalries between the CIA , FBI and National Security Agency .
The program is a spin - off from The Shadow Factory : The Ultra -Secret NSA from 9/11 to the Eavesdropping on America , by acclaimed investigative reporter James Bamford , due out in a matter of days .
The FBI denied Rossini and Miller permission to participate in the book or the PBS " NOVA " documentary , which is also being written and produced by Bamford , / on grounds that the FBI " does n't want to stir up old conflicts with the CIA , " according to multiple reliable sources .
Continued here .
There are a number of things to be said about this story and I will have some reaction to it later .
It is obviously related to this category in the 9/11 Timeline .
Will StumbleUpon ’s New Web Look and Feel Give It Web Wings ?
While rumors of its impending re-sale have apparently been greatly exaggerated , what ’s true about StumbleUpon is that its new Web- centric look and feel and a new partnering program represent a major shift for the online discovery service .
The San Francisco - based company , which was founded in 2001 and sold to eBay last year for $ 75 million , is announcing tonight that users will no longer have to register or download its toolbar to “ stumble ” the Web .
Users can now simply start on StumbleUpon ’s site , for example , and stumble all over the Web using their Web browser as guide rather than a toolbar .
The move is being made simply because most Internet users are increasingly loath to install Web plug-ins like toolbars , a requirement that naturally has slowed the growth of StumbleUpon ’s service over time .
Currently , StumbleUpon has about six million registered users , although only a fraction of those are responsible for the approximately 12 million daily “ stumbles , ” all using a toolbar .
“ We wanted to attract users who do not want to use a toolbar , making it easy so they could use the service right from the get - go , ” said Garrett Camp , co-founder of StumbleUpon , in an interview with BoomTown earlier today .
Camp noted that that the toolbar–which has been downloaded between 11 and 12 million times –has seen that growth slow over time .
Nonetheless , it is not being eliminated either .
“ [ Toolbar adoption ] was still growing , but not accelerating , ” said Camp .
“ Being able to stumble without one was the biggest feedback we got from users . ”
Along with the Web - stumble change , StumbleUpon is also unveiling a redesigned homepage–see an example of it below ; click on the image to make it larger –which is an attempt to make it more of a destination .
With the new look , visitors can find content by topic and more related to interests .
Other changes include a new look for profile pages , as well as user reviews , rating and comments .
Along with its distribution shift and site renovation , StumbleUpon is unveiling a partner program called Stumble Thru that will allow visitors to discover content within those sites without going to StumbleUpon .
Sites–starting with HowStuffWorks.com and the HuffingtonPost.com and followed within weeks by RollingStone.com and National Geographic–will display a StumbleUpon “ badge ” or custom widget .
It is not unlike similar buttons that now dot Web pages from news discovery services like Digg , which users can click to find related pages .
Essentially , much as Google ( GOOG ) delivers custom search within Web sites , StumbleUpon is offering custom surfing , giving publishers StumbleUpon technology to allow its users to surface content within their sites that is often deeply buried .
As to the blog reports that eBay ( EBAY ) had put StumbleUpon up for sale after owning it for a little more than a year , Camp essentially dismissed them , noting that the unit is still operating as an independent subsidiary of the auction giant .
“ They have given us a lot of runway , ” said Camp .
Here is the new front page of StumbleUpon :
Also , here is a video I did last year at the exceptionally noisy ( sorry ! ) party that StumbleUpon threw after it was sold to eBay a little more than a year ago :

The internet has changed the world , mostly through big sites like Google , Amazon , MySpace and Facebook .
But other smaller sites can , if anything , be even more useful , if only you can find the right ones .
There 's no need for you to spend ages doing that , though , because we 've tracked down 20 of the best little - known sites , some of which could also change the way you use the web .
1 . Meet people half way
It 's time to catch up with that distant friend you 've not seen in ages .
But where can you get together ?
Enter their address and yours at MeetWays , choose where you 'd like to meet - coffee shop , pub ? - and this helpful site will suggest some convenient half - way points .
2. Extend Twitter
Microblogging sites like Twitter are fun , but sometimes you 'll want to say more than will fit into a 140 character post .
That 's where TinyPaste comes in .
Type your lengthy message into a box , click submit and you 'll get a short link like tinypaste.com /471 ca .
Paste this in your Twitter feed ( or anywhere else ) and anyone who clicks it will read your full comments .
Quick , simple , and no registration required .
3 . Access your email from anywhere
NutshellMail makes it easy to access , manage and monitor messages from all your email and social networking accounts through one personal inbox .
So you can say goodbye to the hassle of logging in to all those individual accounts .
Parents can add their kid's email addresses to monitor their incoming messages .
And it 'll let you get at your MySpace or Facebook messages at work even if your company firewall blocks social networking sites , because you do n't log in to them - NutshellMail does that .
4 . Find great live music
MP3s are great , but live music is better , and HearWhere is the perfect tool to find out what 's going on near you .
Choose the type of music you like ( pop , acoustic , punk , soul and many more ) , your location , and in seconds you 'll have a detailed list of all the closest shows .
We tested the site by asking it to list all shows on 6th December within 40 kilometres of Derby , and it returned 43 - that 's impressive .
Well worth a look .
5. Keep up with Google
Google is such a big company that it 's easy to miss all the services and products that they offer .
Like the web directory that allows you to browse the web by topics like Arts , Business or Health , the notebook that can store clips from web pages as you 're browsing , and software downloads including one of the best 3D modelling tools around .
If you 'd like to catch up with everything Google has to offer then visit Simply Google , where they 've provided all the links you need on a single page .
6. Declutter your Inbox
Organising your emails can be tricky , as the interesting personal messages quickly get drowned in a flood of newsletters , social networking messages and updates from shopping sites .
But an OtherInbox webmail account could be the solution .
Create new addresses like amazon@JohnSmith.otherinbox.com for Amazon , facebook@JohnSmith.otherinbox.com for Facebook , and so on for other sites , and OtherInbox then sorts all their incoming mail back into the appropriate folders .
And if a company sells your email address to spammers than you 'll immediately know who 's responsible .
You could do much the same thing with rules and filters , but OtherInbox is much easier - recommended .
7. Raise money online
If you 're looking to raise money for a charity or club then you could just add a Paypal ' Donate ' button to your website , but the chances are you 'll have much more success with ChipIn .
This clever free Flash applet can be embedded in most web pages , on MySpace , Blogger and more , where it 'll tell your visitors what you 're collecting for , how much you need to raise , and by when .
They can donate via ChipIn 's secure service , the applet will update to show how many people have contributed and what you 've raised so far , and the money goes direct to your PayPal account .
Genomatica Develops Method to Replace Oil in Plastic - Making Process
September 16th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Genomatica , a San Diego - based sustainable chemical company , announced today that it has developed a process to make an important component of plastic without the use of petrochemicals .
The chemical , 1,4 - butanediol ( BDO ) , has an annual production value of over $ 4 billion in the automotive , textile , and consumer goods industries .
Company scientists genetically engineered E. Coli bacteria to digest sugar and produce BDO .
Genomatica ’s announcement is a huge development for the plastics industry — currently , BDO is only produced using non-renewable petrochemical feedstocks based entirely on oil and natural gas .
Genomatica is still putting the final touches on their microorganism , but the company expects it to be cost - competitive with petrochemical - based BDO within a year .
It will remain competitive even if oil drops to $ 50 a barrel .
Even if sugar prices rise , Genomatica has a plan to remain cost - competitive , as scientists could easily change their production process to use a cheaper feedstock within a 3 to 6 month span .
The company , which has already raised $ 24 million , expects to have a pilot plant running by the end of 2009 .
As someone who has long been concerned about the impact that peak oil will have on plastic production , I ’m heartened to see progress made in this field .
If we can move away entirely from using petroleum in plastics , we will be able to wean ourselves off oil much more easily .

“ It was like doping , ” Winsberg , 42 , said .
“ Suddenly I was running six - minute miles instead of nine - minute miles .
Before I had placed in the bottom third in triathlons .
Four weeks gluten free , and I placed second in a triathlon .
It was like reverse aging .
I went from feeling 38 to 28 to 18 . ”
Winsberg ’s transformation did not surprise Dr. John Reasoner , a medical director with the United States Olympic Committee .
“ In six to eight weeks , if they ’ve followed the diet , it ’s night and day , ” he said .
Reasoner said that symptoms of celiac disease were often subtle but came at a high cost for athletes who expected maximum performance .
Dave Hahn , who has reached the Mount Everest summit 10 times , said he found he had the disease after he became “ inexplicably weak ” on his second trip to the peak in 1999 .
Hahn was the climbing leader on a search expedition for the remains of the Everest pioneer George Mallory , who had disappeared on the mountain in 1924 .
The search was successful , but Hahn struggled .
Then 37 , he had become anemic .
Perilously weak and short of breath on summit day , he had to depend on his climbing partner to make it off the summit alive .
“ It was a huge source of shame which made me feel like I had to get to the bottom of the health problems that I ’d been ignoring for so long , ” Hahn said .
He returned to the doctor he had seen eight years before for chronic gastrointestinal problems , common in celiacs , and this time she diagnosed the disease .
Hahn said he had difficulty adjusting to the gluten - free diet .
“ I got stronger again without question , and you do n’t really expect that in your late 30s , ” he said .
“ I had gotten to the point up high and in the cold where I completely ran out of gas . ”
Critics say the law is too wide - ranging
Enlarge Image
A mother has driven for 12 hours across the US to abandon her teenage son in Nebraska , under a law allowing adults to leave children at state hospitals .
The state 's safe - haven law prevents prosecution for abandonment .
But the head of Nebraska 's health and human services division said dumping children was not an appropriate way for families to deal with parenting issues .
The abandoned boy from Michigan , 13 , is the 18th youth to be left since the law took effect in July .
He is the second teenager from outside the state to be abandoned there .
The first , a 14 - year - old girl from Iowa , was returned home after being left by her grandparents .
This is not what we intended when we said we wanted to increase Nebraska tourism
Todd Landry , local official
The law is unique in that it allows any adult , not just parents , to drop off children of any age at any state - licenced hospital .
The boy , who was left in Omaha , is said to be now in an emergency shelter .
Local officials have spoken to the mother but did not reveal why she left her son .
State officials have expressed the concern that the broad scope of the law could encourage abuses , and have called for it to be restricted to infants , for whom it was originally intended .
" I certainly recognise and can commiserate and empathise with families across our state and across the country who are obviously struggling with parenting issues , but this is not the appropriate way of dealing with them , " said Todd Landry , head of the state 's Department of Health and Human Services ' division of children and family services .
" This is not what we intended when we said we wanted to increase Nebraska tourism , " he was quoted by the Omaha World - Herald newspaper as saying .

The U.S. Federal Reserve led an unprecedented push by central banks to flood financial markets with dollars , backing up government efforts to restore confidence in the banking system .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The ECB , the Bank of England and the Swiss central bank will offer unlimited dollar funds in auctions with maturities of seven days , 28 days and 84 days at a fixed interest rate , the Washington - based Fed said today .
The Bank of Japan may introduce “ similar measures . ”
The dollar declined and some money - market rates fell .
Policy makers from the Group of Seven nations pledged at the weekend to take “ all necessary steps ” to stem a market panic after the MSCI World stock index plunged 20 percent last week .
Central banks last week cut interest rates in tandem for the first time since 2001 , the U.S. plans to buy $ 700 billion in distressed assets from banks and in Europe , the U.K. is leading a push to keep lenders afloat with taxpayers ’ money .
“ By providing unlimited dollar funds they are acting on the back of the G - 7 plan to ensure the system is fully liquidized , ” said Lena Komileva , an economist at Tullet Prebon Plc in London .
“ We ’re going to see even more liquidity provided and more aggressive rate cuts are coming . ”

To some , a president Obama is simply unimaginable .
From a McCain supporter in Wisconsin yesterday :
" We 're all wondering why Obama is where he 's at .
How he got here .
Everybody in this room is stunned we 're in this position . "
There was always going to be a point of revolt and panic for a core group of Americans who believe that Obama simply cannot be president - because he 's black or liberal or young or relatively new .
This is that point .
As the polls suggest a strong victory , the Hannity - Limbaugh - Steyn - O'Reilly base are going into shock and extreme rage .
McCain and Palin have decided to stoke this rage , to foment it , to encourage paranoid notions that somehow Obama is a " secret " terrorist or Islamist or foreigner .
These are base emotions in both sense of the word .
But they are also very very dangerous .
This is a moment of maximal physical danger for the young Democratic nominee .
And McCain is playing with fire .
If he really wants to put country first , he will attack Obama on his policies - not on these inflammatory , personal , creepy grounds .
This is getting close to the atmosphere stoked by the Israeli far right before the assassination of Rabin .
For God 's sake , McCain , stop it .
For once in this campaign , put your country first .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

McCain Gaffes Could Undercut Message on Economy , Foreign Affairs
With focus on economy , misstatements derail his campaign message .
Sept. 22 , 2008  --
In recent days , John McCain has made a series of verbal gaffes that have undercut his campaign claim that he is the candidate who is ready to safeguard the nation 's struggling economy , some political analysts believe .
The verbal stumbles may have wider ramifications for the GOP presidential pick by reminding voters of earlier flubs and calling into question other aspects of his candidacy , including his foreign policy experience , analysts told ABCNews.com .
The most damaging gaffe came Sept. 15 , when McCain said " the fundamentals of our economy are strong , " which was a hard sell because it occurred on the same day that venerable firms Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch were collapsing .
While that statement is likely to haunt McCain through the rest of the campaign , he went on to make several other slips in the following days .
On Thursday , the Arizona senator said he would " fire " Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Chris Cox .
However , while the president nominates and the Senate confirms the SEC chair , a commissioner of an independent regulatory commission cannot be removed by the president .
Trying to recover the next day , McCain confused the SEC with the FEC , the Federal Election Commission .
" I believe that the chairman of the FEC should resign and leave office and be replaced , " McCain said Friday during a speech to the Green Bay Chamber of Commerce , a verbal goof immediately posted on YouTube .
And on the day before the Federal Reserve System bailed out American Insurance Group with an $ 85 billion loan , McCain insisted that taxpayers ' money should not be used to rescue AIG .
The next day , he said it was appropriate to protect the millions of Americans who have insurance policies and accounts at AIG .
McCain did n't help his image as a candidate who understands the economic problems of regular voters when he was asked last month how many houses he owned .
After hemming and hawing , McCain said he would have to ask his staff .
" I think - I 'll have my staff get to you , " McCain told Politico 's Jonathan Martin and Mike Allen in August .
" It 's condominiums where - I 'll have them get to you . "
McCain since responded to the economic crisis by ratcheting up his rhetoric about reforming Washington and cracking down on Wall Street regulation .
McCain's Economic ' Fundamentals ' Line Gives Obama Opening
But political analysts argue that McCain 's flubs have undermined his claim to be ready to take charge of the country 's economy , and have given his Democratic rival Barack Obama an opening on the economic crisis , which will likely be the defining issue of this election .
The verbal missteps have also drawn attention to McCain 's age .
" The question is who in this crisis looked more presidential , calm and unflustered .
It was n't John McCain , " ABC News ' Sam Donaldson said Sunday on " This Week With George Stephanopoulos . "
" His talking points have gotten all mixed up and I think the question of age is back on the table , " Donaldson said .
McCain is 72 while Obama is 47 .
The economic meltdown is uncharted territory for both presidential candidates , but McCain is at a particular disadvantage when it comes to the economy .
Polls have indicated that voters put more faith in the Illinois senator and the Democrats in handling the country 's fiscal health , and McCain 's bumbles serve to highlight what is perceived as his weakest issue .
Analysts Say Economic Focus Puts McCain at Disadvantage
Stephen Hess , a presidential scholar at the Brookings Institute in Washington , D.C. , argued that McCain 's economic response last week point to his discomfort with economic issues rather than any " senior moment " by the Republican senator .
" Whenever the issue turns to the economy , McCain 's going to be at a disadvantage , " Hess said .
" No matter how far he tries to run away from it , he still represents the party in power that voters may blame for this crisis , " Hess said , " and he has established a reputation of being stronger on international affairs and national security and has made it clear that the economy is not his strong suit . "
" I do think McCain is more comfortable talking about foreign policy issues , " said Nathan Gonzales , political editor of the Rothenberg Political Report , a well - respected nonpartisan political newsletter .
" But the news of the day is forcing him to talk more about economic issues and pushing him outside that comfort zone , " Gonzales said , noting Obama likes to remind voters that McCain once quipped that economics is n't his strongest issue .
Dan Schnur , a leading Republican media strategist who was the chief adviser for McCain 's 2000 presidential campaign , believes that when McCain said the economy 's fundamentals were strong he was trying to keep the nation calm during a moment of crisis .
" He was likely trying to be reassuring , but in this climate that was n't going to work , " Schnur said .
" The alternative would have been to keep trying to explain what he meant , and he could have just kept digging the hole deeper and deeper , " Schnur said .
Verbal Mistakes Draw Attention Away From Campaign Message
Verbal mistakes are perhaps unavoidable , given the frenetic campaign schedule and lack of sleep candidates endure .
Obama has been cited for a few clunkers as well .
However McCain 's latest missteps may remind voters of a series of verbal flubs that threaten to hurt his credibility on foreign affairs -- an area the McCain campaign is hoping to dominate .
Traveling in the Middle East in March to highlight his foreign policy expertise , McCain mangled which militant Islamic group was getting training in Iran .
After Sen. Joe Lieberman whispered in his ear , McCain muddied things even more by saying , " I 'm sorry , the Iranians are training extremists , not al Qaeda . "
During an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer on " Good Morning America " in July , McCain bungled his geography when he referred to the Islamic militants fighting along the " Iraq / Afghanistan " border instead of the Pakistan / Afghanistan border .
McCain has referred repeatedly to Czechoslovakia , a country that ceased to exist in 1993 when it was split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
And while discussing Darfur , a region in Sudan , McCain said in June , " How can we bring pressure on the government of Somalia ? "
His senior adviser Mark Salter corrected him , saying , " Sudan . "
Last year , McCain also mistakenly referred to Vladimir Putin of Russia -- after a trip to Germany -- as " President Putin of Germany . "
Candidate Mistakes Under Campaign Spotlight
However the McCain campaign insists voters do n't care about verbal mistakes and point to Obama 's verbal blunders .
" Barack Obama said there were 57 states , " McCain campaign spokesman Brian Rogers told ABCNews.com .
" Come on !
Who cares !
It does n't matter . "
Rogers added , " I think that some in the press need to find something more important to write about . "
As Rogers noted , Obama has frequently misstated which city and state he 's in .
During a campaign rally in Springfield , Ill. , in August , Obama introduced his vice presidential candidate , Sen. Joe Biden , D - Del. , as " the next president . "
Appearing via video at the Democratic convention after his wife 's opening night speech , Obama said he was watching from St. Louis although he was actually 230 miles away in Kansas City , Mo .
While mistakes happen , political analysts argue McCain 's frequent flubs on economic and foreign affairs have been more costly because they are on issues important to his campaign .
Hess said Friday 's first presidential debate in Mississippi on foreign relations could benefit McCain .
However
Hess argued that debates often highlight style over substance among presidential candidates , and how the candidates deliver their messages will be key .
" The debates are going to be more about how they looked and how well they articulate their positions and whether their messages were punchy or not , " Hess said .
" The candidate who is best able to respond to these big issues in a clear way will be deemed the big winner out of the debate , " he said .
A new release of the venerable GNU Image Manipulation Program ( GIMP ) is now available for download .
Version 2.6 offers a variety of new features , user interface improvements , and is also the first release to include support for the Generic Graphics Library ( GEGL ) , a powerful , graph - based image editing framework .
The GIMP is an open source graphics editor that is available for Linux , Windows , and OS X .
It aims to provide Photoshop - like capabilities and offers a broad feature set that has made it popular with amateur artists and open source fans .
Although the GIMP is generally not regarded as a sufficient replacement for high - end commercial tools , it is beginning to gain some acceptance in the pro market .
One of the most significant limitations of the GIMP is that it has traditionally only supported 8 bits per color channel .
This weakness is commonly cited as a major barrier to GIMP adoption by professional artists , who require greater color depth .
This problem has finally been addressed by the new GEGL backend , which delivers support for 32 - bpc .
The inclusion of GEGL is a major milestone for the GIMP and takes it one step closer to being a viable Photoshop replacement for professional users .
In this release , GEGL is still not quite ready to be enabled by default , but users can turn it on with a special option .
GIMP 2.6 also includes some minor user interface enhancements .
The application menu in the tool palette window has been removed , and its contents have been merged into the document window menu .
A document window will now be displayed at all times , even when no images are open .
The floating tool windows have also been adjusted so that they are always displayed over the document window and cannot be obscured .
To reduce clutter and make the windows easier to manage , the floating windows will no longer be listed in the taskbar .
The GIMP user interface has long been a source of controversy , and is characterized by some users as one of the worst on the Linux desktop .
The modest changes made in this release are nice improvements , but probably wo n't be enough to satisfy the most vehement haters .
A more extensive redesign is in the works , however , and the developers are gathering insight from users and experts .
The empty window behavior in version 2.6 is based on one of the first specification drafts that emerged from the redesign project .
There are a number of important functionality improvements that will be welcomed by users , too .
The freehand selection tool now has support for polygonal selections and editing selection segments , the GIMP text tool has been enhanced to support automatic wrapping and reflow when text areas are resized , and a new brush dynamics feature has added some additional capabilities to the ink and paint tools .
Version 2.6 also has a few improvements for plug - in developers , like a more extensive scripting API for manipulating text layers .
For the next major release , the developers plan to improve GEGL support and integrate the development work that was done in Summer of Code projects .
One of the Summer of Code projects that could land in 2.8 brings support for editing text directly on the image canvas , thus obviating the need for a text input dialog .
Another project that we could see in 2.8 adds support for marking specific brushes and gradients with tags so that they are easier to find and organize .
Users can download the latest release from the GIMP web site .

Smith 's children - two daughters , 7 and 5 , and a son , 3 , were not in the house at the time of the arrest .
They were with a babysitter in Kensington , but as of late yesterday afternoon , the children were in the custody of the Department of Human Services , said spokeswoman Alicia Taylor .
I ’ve lately become a reader of Across the Curve , the blog of the bond trader John Jansen .
It ’s jargon - heavy — sometimes even I have to look up the terms he uses — but in a time of disordered markets ( does anyone actually manage to borrow at Libor these days ) it ’s really helpful to have reports from a “ tone and feel of the markets ” guy who can tell you what the numbers can’t .
And his opening comment this morning is a shocker .
After describing some of the weird action in Treasuries , he says :
Is this the beginning of the end for the dollar and the Treasury market ?
Is this the first sign of the bursting of the bubble in Treasury securities ?
That market , in a sense , represents the ultimate bubble as it exists at the whim and caprice of foreign investors , who have as participants in a Faustian bargain , financed our war(s ) and our lifestyle so generously over the last decade .
Maybe even that bizarre construct is crashing about us as we speak .
Maybe I should be drinking something a bit more … calming .. than coffee right now .
SCRANTON , Pa. , Oct. 23 ( UPI ) -- A Scranton , Pa. , woman who was charged with disorderly conduct after swearing at her malfunctioning toilet said the city is paying her $ 19,000 not to sue .
Dawn Herb 's attorney , Barry Dyller , and the American Civil Liberties Union announced Wednesday that the city has agreed to pay the sum to Herb after a judge threw out the charges against her , the Scranton Times - Tribune reported Thursday .

The judge said Herb 's swearing at her broken commode in October 2007 was protected free speech .
Scranton City Solicitor Mary Theresa Paterson said the settlement was an " effort to cap Scranton 's potential exposure to Ms. Herb and her lawyers . "
" By this settlement , Scranton does not admit or acknowledge any wrongdoing on the part of the police officer , " she said .
Silicon Valley technology startups are adopting a new business plan : deferral .
MerchantCircle Inc. , a Los Altos , Calif. , Internet startup , typifies the trend .
Last month , company founder Ben Smith was in New York talking to media companies about raising $ 50 million , with which he planned to make acquisitions to fuel MerchantCircle 's growth .
But as the financial markets tumbled this month , Mr. Smith canceled two trips to New York and a roadshow to Europe to raise the capital .
For now , the fundraising is on the backburner .

In the so - called Bank Leumi affair that dominated headlines in Israel , Lowy was described as nothing more than an " Australian real - estate magnate " .
No mention was made of the fact he had come to British Mandate Palestine as a migrant in the aftermath of World War II , had fought alongside Olmert 's predecessor Ariel Sharon in the 1948 War of Independence , and was now one of Australia 's most successful businessmen .
As there is no equivalent of the " w " sound in the Hebrew alphabet , Israelis were not even sure how to say Lowy 's name , often pronouncing it as " Louie " .
The mispronunciation is said to have annoyed Lowy but , according to a senior Israeli newspaper reporter who knows him and who spoke to the Herald on condition of anonymity , it was an accurate reflection of Lowy 's low profile .
" This is a man who has deliberately sought to be under the radar here .
There are lots of billionaires who float in and out of Israel , naming foundations after themselves .
But not Lowy . "
It may not bear his name , but the Israeli version of Sydney 's Lowy Institute for International Policy - the Institute for National Security Studies , attached to the University of Tel Aviv - is equally his creation .
As its chairman , Lowy has gathered some of the most influential policymakers in Israel and wealthiest international benefactors to sit on its boards .
Much like the Lowy Institute in Sydney , it is a respected independent academic institute that studies key issues relating to national security and foreign affairs , but with a special focus on the Middle East .
Its vice - chairman is Dan Meridor , a prominent lawyer and former politician in the centre - right Likud party .
Meridor served as justice minister and finance minister in the 1990s , and is contemplating a return to politics with the Likud .
Also on the board are the Israeli building contractor Alfred Akirov , the president of Tel Aviv University and former Israeli ambassador to the US , Itamar Rabinovich , and the Australian - born Martin Indyk , twice the US ambassador to Israel during the Clinton administration .
Among those on the board of trustees are Lord David Alliance , an Iranian - born Jewish - British businessman and Liberal Democrat politician , and Sir Ronald Cohen , an Egyptian - born Jewish - British businessman known as " the father of British venture capital " and the man who bankrolled the leadership bid of the Prime Minister , Gordon Brown .
Other trustees are the Chicago real estate mogul Lester Crown and the US property tycoon Mortimer Zuckerman , who owns New York 's Daily News and is editor - in - chief of the influential US News & World Report .
One man who has known Lowy for almost 25 years is Avinoam Brog , president of Israel 's leading market research and polling firm Market Watch , and brother of the former prime minister and current Labour Party chairman , Ehud Barak .
Brog got to know Lowy in the 1980s , when he was executive director of the Sydney branch of Keren Hayesod , the central fund - raising organisation for Israel throughout the world .
" First understand how deep is Frank 's attachment to Israel , " Brog told the Herald .
" He fought for this country 's independence from the British in 1948 , and then Israel offered him a home before he joined other members of his family in Australia .
" By the time I served with Keren Hayesod in Sydney , Frank was a successful businessman and so , given his connections to this country , we got to know each other well . "
Lowy and Barak also enjoyed " a very long and warm friendship " , Brog said .
" He brought Ehud out to Australia I think on several occasions , and whenever Frank is in Israel , which is often , I think the two would see each other …
His influence is such that if he wanted to talk to any politician in Israel , then he could .
And they will listen .
I mean no disrespect to [ Lowy ] , but that does not mean that anyone goes away and does what he tells them to . "
Brog , who described Lowy 's politics in Israel as " centre - left " , said he believed he had also been a strong supporter of , and donor to , the Labour Party .
He had also been a " very , very generous donor to Keren Hayesod " since the 1980s , Brog said .
" And I would expect that that financial support has only increased in the years since . "
According to a handful of Australian and Israeli businessmen who are active in Israel and keep an eye on Lowy 's movements in that country , the money that he puts into the Institute for National Security Studies and Keren Hayesod are the two main concerns he devotes time to outside his business interests .
Lowy 's son David manages a family - owned hedge fund , Ion Asset Management , which , although domiciled in the Cayman Islands , focuses its investments in publicly traded Israeli and Israel - related securities .
It is based in Tel Aviv .
But if Lowy does donate money to a wide range of causes , he does it discreetly , unlike the Pratt Foundation , the highly visible charitable organisation funded by Melbourne 's cardboard king Richard Pratt .
" If you want to find Frank Lowy in Israel , the best place to catch him is at the Tel Aviv Hilton , " said one source , who declined to be named .
Loading Lowy built and owns an apartment building behind the Hilton on Tel Aviv 's main waterfront boulevard and spends about three months of the year in Israel .
" I often see him there relaxing with friends , just enjoying being a relatively anonymous person , " the source said .

NRSC ad assumes Obama win
The underlying premise of this new ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee : Obama 's going to win .
The ad , on behalf of Senator Elizabeth Dole , urges a vote against challenger Kay Hagan as the last bulwark against complete Democratic control :
" These liberals want complete control of government in a time of crisis , " says the narrator .
" All branches of Government .
No checks and balances , no debate , no independence . "
" If [ Hagan ] wins , they get a blank check . "
UPDATE : The NRSC's John Randall strongly disagrees with my interpretation of the spot .
" We are not conceding an Obama victory .
Rather , we are highlighting what could be if a fiscally irresponsible liberal like Kay Hagan is elected to the Senate , especially if that is coupled with a Barack Obama Presidency , " he emails .
NEW YORK : Discredited and vilified .
Those are the words that can begin to describe the people most Americans would term �� �bankers��� .
Rarely has a broadly defined category of occupation sunk so far , so fast .
Not too long ago , careers in finance beckoned the ambitious and avaricious .
In New York , in particular , the only lives worth living seemed to be led by those who worked on Wall Street and whose compensation was determined in widely reported , year - end , life - altering bonuses .
That ended , I suspect , shortly after noon on Friday , October 3 , when the US House of Representatives passed the $ 700 - billion financial - market rescue plan designed to re-open the nation���s credit markets .
How long will it take to rehabilitate the profession ?
Is it three years ?
Five years ?
A decade ?
Fifty years ?
The past few weeks have gone by in a blur .
And yet it was just the sitzkrieg , the phony war .
The real bloodshed will occur in the weeks and months ahead .
Nobody knows what the real outcome of this disaster will be , although it���s very likely that the financial industry will be crushed .
Now the scene shifts to Washington .
This isn���t a temporary shift , either , as the US Treasury attempts to pick up the pieces of the financial system .
No , I have a feeling that no matter who wins the presidency , we are going to see newly empowered regulators go on the rampage .
The taxpayers will demand nothing less .
The lords of finance are finished , at least for a while .
No longer will these notoriously thin - skinned bully - boys visit their wrath upon those who dared to criticize their doings .
Out : Regulators who can be intimidated .
In : US attorneys scrapping for a fight .
Wall Street banks and securities firms maintain lobbyists and associations in Washington to present their case to those who work on Capitol Hill .
The almost $ 1 trillion rescue plan renders these folk nullities .
Can they speak with any authority , even any credibility ?
I ���m not saying this is necessarily a good thing .
Yet this seems to be the consequence of almost bankrupting the country .
Finance surrendered .
Mutiny in Congress and the gyrations of the Dow Jones Industrial Average have overshadowed the municipal - bond market .
That is , until Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California sent an e-mail to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson onOctober 2 , saying the state might have to turn to the federal government for a little loan of $ 7 billion .
The municipal - bond market had almost shut down by the time the governor sent his e-mail , dozens of issuers shelving their borrowing plans upon the advice of their underwriters .
For several years , the government has been looking at the municipal market , in particular at how states and municipalities invested the proceeds they raised from bond issues .
I hope the big bailout doesn���t distract them because if a market richly deserved some scrutiny , it is this one .
I almost don���t know where to begin , but how about with Moody���s Investors Service lowering the credit rating on the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority Metropolitan Highway System ?
�� �On October 2 , the rating company put out a press release stating that the key reasons for the downgrade are narrowing debt service coverage ratios due to escalating debt service and increased interest costs associated with exercised swaptions , ��� and you can stop right there .
Swaptions !
Interest - rate swaps and derivatives !
From coast to coast , these things are eating issuers alive .
I ���m not sure I ���m angrier at the bankers who so aggressively pitched the things , the politicians who bought into them because they could get campaign contributions from the brokers who set them up .
Let 's take a look at some public sector salaries in Illinois , primarily Chicago and Cook County , but in comparison to the Governor 's office .
The Chicago Sun-Times is reporting Top cop 's pay tops the charts .
They may be the bosses , but Mayor Daley , Gov. Blagojevich and Cook County Board President Todd Stroger are not the top wage earners in their respective governments , according to a Chicago Sun -Times survey of public payrolls .
It turns out that a registered nurse working the night shift at a state Department of Human Services facility for the developmentally disabled made $ 201,000 last year -- $ 35,000 more than the governor .
And Chicago Police Supt .
Jody
Weis makes nearly $ 90,000 a year more than his boss , the mayor , while Stroger 's [ Cook County Board President 's ] special assistant Laura Lechowicz - Felicione pulls in $ 2,700 more than her boss .
Stephanie Marshall , the retiring president of the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy , also out - earned the governor by more than $ 95,000 .
The nurse , Loreatha Coleman , who works at the state - run Howe Developmental Center in Tinley Park , earns a base salary of about $ 64,000 .
But a 10 percent night differential and lots of overtime more than tripled her pay , a DHS spokeswoman said .
Also , dozens of doctors working for the state and county made more than their chief executives .
( The Sun - Times did n't count them here in order to better compare administrative salaries , but they are included in an online searchable list of 145,000 city , state and county employees at www.suntimes.com.)
What they make
Jody P. Weis Chicago -- superintendent of police $ 309,996
Stephanie Marshall Illinois -- president , Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy $ 241,559
Jon B. Bauman Illinois -- chief operating officer , Teachers ' Retirement System $ 221,405
Johnny C. Brown Cook County -- chief operating officer , Stroger Hospital $ 220,737
Richard M. Daley Chicago -- mayor $ 216,210
William R. Atwood Illinois -- director , Board of Investments $ 206,350
Loreatha A. Coleman Illinois -- registered nurse , Department of Human Services $ 201,008
Stephen A. Martin Jr Cook County -- chief operating officer , Department of Public Health $ 195,906
Judith M. Erwin Illinois -- executive director , Board of Higher Education $ 191,100
Nuria I. Fernandez Chicago -- commissioner of aviation ( resigned ) $ 190,764
Stephen W. Robinson Illinois -- medical administrator , Department of Human Services $ 187,623
Richard A. Devine Cook County -- state 's attorney $ 185,731
Raymond E. Orozco Chicago -- director , Office of Emergency Management & Communications $ 189,360
As I thought up this list , I came up with many many many more examples in my head of ones that were wrong .
Many of which are due to Hollywood movies .
So while this list may feature a lot from Hollywood , it 's not restricted to that .
It 's really just a list of things that cheese me .-
The movie Armageddon .
Man do they have it wrong .
There is so much sound in that movie - in a movie that takes place in Space !
Space .
A Vacuum !
No particles ( unless you consider planets , asteroids , et. al as particles ... big particles ) .
Sound is the vibration of particles .
Sound is not an electromagnetic force .
It 's a wave of particles colliding .
In space , there are no particles to wave , to collide , nothing .
And there is no sound .
Thus the caption for Alien : " In Space No One Can Hear You Scream "
In fact , that movie also has a lot of sound in it .
To date , just about the only movie I 've seen that honors the no - sound - in - space rule is 2001 , by Kubrick .
Only Kubrick could really pull silence off .
And that 's why 2001 is pretty inaccessible to many people .
They need their sound .-
I 'm going to be specific here about gravity on earth .
By this I mean on the Earth 's surface , and a few hundred feet above it .
Movies get this wrong all the time - they have objects falling at different speeds , the best example being Spiderman who leaps upwards into the air , then arches his body in perfect form , and begins his rapid descent towards Mary Jane , who has been falling this entire time .
Impressively , Spiderman catches up to her , and saves the day .
Not in this world .
I do n't care if he 's wearing a sleak , streamlined suit .
Neither does physics .
Objects fall at the same speed .
Spiderman show - boating his jump into the air , and embellishing the heroic deed would have really just seen Mary Jane fall to her death ...- I 'm going to ignore the movie Core .
That was pornography of physics .
A more recent movie that really got my goat ( thankfully I have many goats to be got ) , was Journey to the Center of the Earth .
Than Brandon Frasier flick .
I never saw it .
I only saw the trailer .
And the trailer was enough to tell me that there would be no science in this movie .
What did I see ?
I saw a waterfall at the supposed center of the Earth .
A waterfall ?
Sorry , but if you could - for a moment - assume that the center of the Earth was a hollow sphere - and not molten rock , completely hollow , then you would float around .
Why ?
Because Gravity completely cancels itself out at the center of the Earth .
Vector diagrams people .
Center of the earth has no gravity .
Nor is there a concept of direction .
How can water even fall ?
That would assume there 's a " down " at the center .
There 's no down .
There 's only symmetry .
There 's no up .
There 's only symmetry .
There 's physics , not some miserable attempt at a film . -
People seem to change gravity as they see fit .
Objects falling at different speeds - that 's 6 , gravity at the center of the earth , that 's 5 .
But there 's also the general misuse of gravity in many films .
Like when Peter Parker punches Eddie Brock , and Eddie Brock flies accross the room in almost a straight line , and then starts an arc 'd descent .
Your eyes tell you that something looked weird about that .
And it 's because , frankly , your eyes know more about physics than the average Hollywood director .
But more specifically , water at high speeds - Apparently Hollywood spends little time in the massive olympic sized pools they have in their backyards .
Or at least , they do n't fall into their pools at the high speeds they have in their movies , where someone will fall a great height into a pool of water and survive .
Or skin across the surface of the water , and survive .
If you 've ever done a bellyflop into a pool , you 'll know how much it hurts .
Now imagine doing that after falling from a cliff .
Or a helicopter .
Maybe you 'll survive ... but if you think you 're about to get back up and go fight the Amazon rebels .... think again .- I 'm not even going to get into it .
But if you 've seen it in a scifi movie , or read it in a scifi book , there 's a 99 % chance they got it wrong . -
Whether you consider yourself an evolutionist , or a creationist , Evolution as a theory is constantly used incorrectly .
Plus it 's argued against incorrectly .
One common argument is that Hitler used evolution to justify the Holocaust ... therefor , what ?
We should stop teaching evolution ?
To my knowledge , oil has also been the justification for some wars .
As has religion .
As has land .
As has diamonds .
Should we stop all these ?
Another argument against evolution is that of the watchmaker .
Unfortunately , the watchmaker analogy has it completely wrong , and is wrought with so many fallacies in it , it can not be taken seriously .
And this notion changes what people think evolution really is .
I know I spent little time really explaining the theories that I 'm arguing Hollywood and company often get wrong .
But I 'm not about to explain them .
Those who care will look it up .
Those who wo n't , will buy tickets to the next

Many people report seeing a bright light A large study is to examine near - death experiences in cardiac arrest patients .
Doctors at 25 UK and US hospitals will study 1,500 survivors to see if people with no heartbeat or brain activity can have " out of body " experiences .
Some people report seeing a tunnel or bright light , others recall looking down from the ceiling at medical staff .
The study , due to take three years and co-ordinated by Southampton University , will include placing on shelves images that could only be seen from above .
This is a mystery that we can now subject to scientific study
Dr Sam Parnia
University of Southampton
Towards the light
To test this , the researchers have set up special shelving in resuscitation areas .
The shelves hold pictures - but they 're visible only from the ceiling .
Dr Sam Parnia , who is heading the study , said : " If you can demonstrate that consciousness continues after the brain switches off , it allows for the possibility that the consciousness is a separate entity .
" It is unlikely that we will find many cases where this happens , but we have to be open - minded .
" And if no one sees the pictures , it shows these experiences are illusions or false memories .
" This is a mystery that we can now subject to scientific study . "
Dr Parnia works as an intensive care doctor , and felt from his daily duties that science had not properly explored the issue of near - death experiences .
Process of death
He said : " Contrary to popular perception , death is not a specific moment .
" It is a process that begins when the heart stops beating , the lungs stop working and the brain ceases functioning - a medical condition termed cardiac arrest .
" During a cardiac arrest , all three criteria of death are present .
There then follows a period of time , which may last from a few seconds to an hour or more , in which emergency medical efforts may succeed in restarting the heart and reversing the dying process .
" What people experience during this period of cardiac arrest provides a unique window of understanding into what we are all likely to experience during the dying process . "
Dr Parnia and medical colleagues will analyse the brain activity of 1,500 cardiac arrest survivors , and see whether they can recall the images in the pictures .
Hospitals involved include Addenbrookes in Cambridge , University Hospital in Birmingham and the Morriston in Swansea , as well as nine hospitals in the US .

What are these ?
" ObamaSongs " painstakingly tracked down precisely 800 songs about Barack Obama from the wilds of YouTube and assembled into a single collection for easy viewing .
The chart to the right shows that whoever is responsible for this found more songs closer to the election , which makes sense .
Because nobody has the time to plow through hundreds of songs about Barack Obama in one sitting , even on a Friday , " ObamaSongs " courteously created a 137 - song playlist of his favorites .
This got us wondering : which candidate has a stronger YouTube presence ?
A search for " McCain song " pulled up about 15,200 videos , while a search for " Obama song " returned around 49,700 videos .

As part of my talk at the Richmond Code Camp earlier in October , I had the opportunity to talk about how to implement functional aspects in C# 3.0 .
This talk revolved around such concepts as from mutable to immutable , from inheritance to functional composition , and the mind shift that is required .
Part of this discussion involved very briefly a talk about monads .
It ’s a very misunderstood part of computer science and one of the most powerful concepts to learn .
Much like continuation passing style , this style is often maligned as a result .
But , let ’s work to change that .
What Is a Monad ?
Monads come to us originally from category theory .
When monads applied to functional programming , they simply are a construction , given an underlying type system , embeds a corresponding monadic type system .
Simply put , the values you have become amplified values that are to be interpreted by the matching monadic type .
The formulation of a monad comes in three parts :
A type construction that defines for every underlying type , how to obtain a corresponding monadic type .
If the given type in F# is ‘a , then the corresponding monadic type for an Identity monad would be I < ‘a >.
I ’ll cover more of what that means below .
A unit function that maps the underlying type to a value in the corresponding monadic type .
In F# parlance , this maps to a Return function .
A binding operation of polymorphic type , in F# parlance , ( I <‘a > ) => ( ‘a => I < ‘b > ) => ( I <‘b > ) .
This maps to a Bind function given your monad builder .
If you look carefully at the signature of this , you might also note that the LINQ SelectMany follows this syntax .
Gee , what could that mean ?
The bind operation follows four steps :
The monadic structure exposes the underlying value of type ‘ a .
The given function is applied to the underlying value to obtain values of type I <‘b>
The monadic structure exposes the underlying value of type ‘b .
The monadic structure is reassembled over the results , given a single value of type I <‘b >
Simply put , a monad , unlike your normal function results , stores function results and side - effect representations .
This allows side effects to be propagated through the return values of functions without breaking the pure functional model .
This is what makes it so powerful that it is a way to manage side effects .
Given a pure language such as Haskell , this is the way that any side effecting operation should be done .
Granted , there are impure ways of doing IO , but let ’s not go there .
There are some good sources of information on what monads are , including some great stuff from Brian Beckman :
Some examples of monads that are used frequently are such things as the maybe monad , identity monad , IO , collections and so on .
Let ’s move onto implementing some of these monads in .NET , whether it be F# or even C# .
Implementing in .NET
To implement the above mentioned monads , we ’ll take examples in both F# and C# to see that both can do the job .
Although I ’ll admit my preference for F# , C# can monads quite nicely using LINQ syntax .
But that sometimes means that the from and select keywords might be confusing .
But what people might not realize is that you are not limited to IEnumerable < T > inside LINQ .
Instead , you could have any backing type you want .
For example , I could have the identity type , maybe type , async type and so on .
We ’ll cover each one of those in detail in the following sections .
Anyhow , let ’s get started with the identity monad .
The Identity Monad
The easiest monad to understand is the identity monad .
This attaches no information to the underlying value , and instead only returns and transforms it .
Implementing in F #
To implement in F# , we need to remember what ’s required for any monad builder .
That is the Bind , Return , Delay and Let functions .
Let ’s define our builder first with the given functions .
# light type I < ‘ a > = ‘ a let bindI i f = f i
let resultI i = i
let delayI f = f( ) type IdentityBuilder ( ) =
member x. Bind( i , f ) = bindI i f
member x.Return( i ) = resultI i
member x.Delay ( f ) = delayI f
member x.Let( i , f ) = bindI ( resultI i ) f
Now that our builder is defined , F# has a special way of representing monads in that you wrap them in curly braces with the given instance name of the monad builder .
In this case , I ’ll call it ident .
let ident = Identity Builder ( )
let iValue = ident {
let ! x = 5
let ! y = 42
return ! x + y
}
printfn " %i " iValue
The above code allows me to define x and y and add them together .
The end result ends up being 47 .
This looks pretty simple using this syntax , although this is what it ends up being behind the scenes :
let iValue = ident .
Delay ( fun ( ) ->
ident .
Bind ( 5 , fun x ->
ident .
Bind ( 42 , fun y ->
ident .
Return ( x + y ) ) ) )
As you can see , the syntax is much more simplified with the syntactic sugar that they give us .
This almost looks like LINQ in a way .
Implementing in C# 3.0
Now , what about C# ?
What can we do there ?
Actually , the answer is , that it ’s quite simple .
If you notice one thing about LINQ is the signature of the SelectMany method .
Let ’s look at the definition on the Enumerable class .
public static IEnumerable <U> SelectMany<T , U > (
this IEnumerable <T> s ,
Func<T , IEnumerable <U >> f )
And if you look at the bind syntax that we used in our F# example , it ’s exactly the same signature .
That should tell us something that LINQ expressions can indeed be monads .
Now , let ’s implement the identity monad by first identifying the class and then the extension methods that make this work .
public class Identity <T>
{
public Identity ( T value ) {
Value = value ; }
public T Value { get ; private set ; }
} Identity Identity ( T value ) { Value = value ; }T Value { ; } public static class IdentityExtensions
{
public static Identity < T> ToIdentity < T>( this T value )
{
return new Identity < T> ( value ) ;
} public static Identity < U> SelectMany <T , U > (
this Identity < T> id ,
Func<T , Identity <U >> k)
{
return k( id.Value ) ;
} public static Identity < V> SelectMany <T , U , V > (
this Identity < T> id ,
Func<T , Identity <U >> k ,
Func<T , U , V > s)
{
return id.SelectMany(x => k( x ) .SelectMany(y => s(x , y ) .
ToIdentity ( ) ) ) ;
}
}
When we implement things for LINQ , we must be cognizant for the need of two SelectMany methods for various performance reasons to allow us to combine values .
Now that we ’ve defined these methods , we can now use LINQ expressions to express our identity monad .
var identResult = from x in 5 . ToIdentity ( )
from y in 42 . ToIdentity ( )
select x + y ;
Console.WriteLine(identResult.Value ) ;
As above the answer comes out to 47 .
Let ’s move onto the maybe monad .
The Maybe Monad
The maybe monad is another popular monad type .
A maybe monad is very similar to the identity , yet a value may be missing .
In F# parlance , this translates to the Option < ‘ a > type .
Let ’s go ahead and implement this in F# using our given option type .
Implementing in F #
Implementing the maybe monad is very similar to the identity monad .
The only difference being is the to differentiate between some value and no value specified .
We will determine that through pattern matching , as always .
# light type M< ‘a > = option <‘a>
let bindM d f =
match d with
| None ->
None
| Some(v ) -> f v
let resultM v = Some(v )
let delayM f = f ()
type MaybeBuilder ( ) =
member x. Bind( v , d ) = bindM v d
member x.Return( v ) = resultM v
member x.Delay ( f ) = delayM f
member x.Let( v , f ) = bindM ( resultM v ) f
Once defined , we can now use our MaybeBuilder to define a simple use of our maybe monad .
Let ’s make sure we use
None to denote that we are missing a value .
let maybe = MaybeBuilder ( )
let mValue = maybe {
let ! x = Some ( 5 )
let ! y = None
return x + y
}
let option_to_string = function
| None -> " Undefined "
| Some v -> v . ToString ( )
printfn " %s " ( mValue | > option_to_string )
The result of course is " Undefined " because our y value is the None option type .
But , how might this work in C# ?
Implementing in C# 3.0
We can reuse a lot of our ideas from implementing this via extension methods .
I will go ahead and use the Option type that I ’ve defined in my Functional C# project on MSDN Code Gallery .
From there , we can implement our SelectMany operations .
public static class MaybeExtensions
{
public static Option < T> ToMaybe <T >( this T value )
{
return Option < T>.Some ( value ) ;
} MaybeExtensionsOption ToMaybe ( T value ) Option . Some ( value ) ; public static Option < U> SelectMany <T , U > (
this Option < T> m ,
Func<T , Option <U >> k)
{
return !m. IsNone ?
Option < U>. None : k( m.Value ) ;
} public static Option < V> SelectMany <T , U , V > (
this Option < T> m ,
Func<T , Option <U >> k ,
Func<T , U , V > s)
{
return m.SelectMany(x => k( x ) .SelectMany(y => s(x , y ) . ToMaybe ( ) ) ) ;
}
}
Now that we defined our binding operations , we can move onto actually using the maybe monad .
Let ’s use the template that we defined up above for our identity monad and craft it to use our maybes .
var maybeResult = from x in 5 . ToMaybe ( )
from y in Option < int >.
None
select x + y ;
Console .
WriteLine (
maybeResult .IsSome ? maybeResult.Value.ToString ( ) : " Undefined " ) ;
Once again , our result will be undefined as our y value has no real value at all .
Clear so far ?
Let ’s move onto the List Monad .
The Collection Monad
The collection monad is another important monad type .
This monad is the heart and soul of LINQ and the way we use it to compute our lazily evaluated lists .
This monad strikes home as one of the most important to .NET developers .
Using LINQ to SQL , XML and such uses collections of various sorts to transform the data into other forms .
Implementing in F #
As before , we need to define our basic bind , let , return and delay functions in order for the monad to work in F#. Let ’s define the list monad to use seq < ‘a > .
This way , I can lazily evaluate my results and yield them when I need to .
For the bind and result statements , I ’m using a sequence expression to yield the appropriate values .
# light let bindL l f =
seq {for x in l do
for y in f x do
yield y}
let resultL l = seq{ yield l }
let delayL f = f( ) type SeqBuilder ( ) =
member x. Bind(l , f ) = bindL l f
member x.Return(l ) = resultL l
member x.Delay ( f ) = delayL f
member x.Let(l , f ) = bindL ( resultL l ) f
Now that we ’ve defined our monad builder , let ’s implement this to add the values from each collection to each other .
let seqMonad = new SeqBuilder ( )
let sValue = seqMonad {
let ! x = { 1 . .3 }
let ! y = { 4 . .6 }
return x + y
}
sValue | >
Seq .
iter ( fun x -> printfn " %i " x )
Our results will be the addition of each number in each list to each other .
So , in turn , I will get 9 numbers in total with a value of 5 6 7 6 7 8 7 8 9 .
Implementing in C# 3.0
To view the bind methods , simply open the Enumerable class to view the SelectMany implementations .
This will get us started in looking at a C# equivalent to the list monad we did above .
A simple representation might look like this .
var sValues = from x in Enumerable .
Range ( 1 , 3 )
from y in Enumerable .
Range ( 4 , 3 )
select x + y ;
foreach ( var sValue in sValues ) Console.
WriteLine( sValue ) ;
And we now realize the answers between the two are exactly the same .
No special magic required for list monads .
The Asynchronous Monad
One of the most often used monads in F# is the asynchronous computation expression .
This allows us to use non-blocking calls to download resources , whether it be files , web request , WCF calls and so on .
This is where monads become really useful for .NET developers who want to explore a little outside the box in ways of thinking about monads .
Implementing in F #
We get the asynchronous computation expressions out of the box with F# .
This allows us to easily create asynchronous computation expressions which I talked about earlier here .
But , let ’s look at one example of downloading the HTML from various web sites in parallel with non-blocking calls .
What might that look like ?
# light open System .
IO
open System .
Net
open Microsoft .
FSharp .
Control
open Microsoft .
FSharp.Control .CommonExtensions let get_html_async ( url:string ) =
async {
let request = WebRequest . Create ( url )
let ! response = request .
AsyncGetResponse ( )
let stream = response.
GetResponseStream ()
let reader = new StreamReader ( stream )
let ! text = reader .
AsyncReadToEnd ( )
return text
}
let urls = [ " http://live.com " ; " http://google.com " ; " http://codebetter.com " ]
let textResults =
Async.Run( Async.
Parallel [ for url in urls -> get_html_async url ] )
textResults |> Seq.iter ( fun textResult -> printfn " %s " textResult )
As you can see , we ’re creating a request , getting the response , creating a reader , and reading all the way to the end asynchronously .
As you may note , there is a difference between let ! and let .
The let ! uses the Bind method whereas the let uses the Let method of AsyncBuilder .
What I ’m able to do here is take three websites , and download their HTML and display within a short amount of time .
Imagine if I had to write that using IAsyncResult classes and such .
That would n’t be ideal !
But , can C# partake in this ?
Implementing in C# 3.0
The question I asked is that can we take advantage of the F# asynchronous computation expressions in C# ?
The answer , surprisingly is YES !
I had the opportunity to talk to F# developer , Brian McNamara , on this very subject .
Back in May , he posted a quick example of using the F# libraries from C# .
There is a bit of work required to do this , but it pays off handily .
I ’ll cover the exact details in my next post of how to do it .
But , in the mean time , imagine if we could download HTML from three websites simultaneously using LINQ ?
Here ’s what the code that does exactly that looks like .
string , Async < string >> get_html_async = url =>
from _ in AsyncExtensions .StartWorkflow
from request in WebExtensions.AsyncCreateWebRequest( url )
from response in request .
AsyncGetResponse ( )
let reader = new StreamReader ( response.GetResponseStream ( ) )
from urlText in reader .
AsyncReadToEnd ( )
select urlText ; Func > get_html_async = url => AsyncExtensions.StartWorkflowrequestWebExtensions.AsyncCreateWebRequest(url)responserequest.AsyncGetResponse()reader
= StreamReader( response.GetResponseStream())urlTextreader.AsyncReadToEnd() urlText ; var urls = new [ ] { " http://live.com/ " , " http://www.google.com/ " , " http://codebetter.com/ " } ;
var urlTexts = Async.Run (
Async. Parallel ( from url in urls select get_html_async ( url ) ) , Option < int >. None , Option < bool >.
None ) ;
Array.ForEach( urlTexts , Console. WriteLine ) ;
How simple is that ?
Well , we have to put some backing to some of these methods in order to make them asynchronous , and I will cover exactly what that is in the next post .
Wrapping it Up
What about such things as the IO monad ?
Well , that ’s more of a language construct that is enforced by the compiler .
I would like to see something similar to this in F# going forward , so that we could better manage our side effects .
Using such technologies as Spec# to statically verify the behavior is important .
But , once again , that ’s another post .
I hope I helped to alleviate some of the confusion around monads .
More importantly , I hope you know more of how and when to use them .
In the next post , I ’ll follow up with the actual implementation of the asynchronous computation expressions in C# 3.0 .
Giving us the ability to have parity with F# is really powerful and attests to the power of LINQ ( and monads of course ) .
Stay tuned !

This graph shows the net equity extraction , or mortgage equity withdrawal ( MEW ) , results , both in billions of dollars quarterly ( not annual rate ) , and as a percent of personal disposable income .
Last week the Bank of England reported that MEW was slightly negative in the UK in the 2nd quarter .
Less equity extraction means less consumption over the next few quarters .

Mark sez , " Colin Jackson is a well - known IT consultant in New Zealand and former President of InternetNZ .
Colin attended a meeting with the Minister in charge of copyright on Monday to talk about a proposal to kick people off the internet on the basis of three unsubstantiated accusations of copyright infringement , and she lost her temper and yelled at them . "
The meeting was set down for 45 minutes from 3:45 .
When it opened , Judith Tizard spent 30 minutes telling us why the change had to be made .
She began by strongly expressing her anger that we had complained to her at this stage in the proceedings .
None of us , she said , had been to see her before this on this topic .
When we protested that we had worked with the Select Committee , which had removed this provision – and balanced it with one which made licence holders liable for false accusations – she said that this was completely inappropriate of the Select Committee , because Cabinet had already decided this was going ahead .
We should not have been surprised , we were told , that this provision was reinserted by the government at the last minute before the bill was passed .
( It 's worth noting here that Judith has been to the two New Zealand Foo Camps and was engaged roundly on copyright both times . )
She set forth strong views about how the launch of Sione 's Wedding had been ruined , about how studios in Auckland were running out of work , and about how artists were mortgaging their homes to make films and music and were not making any returns on their investments , all , she said , because of Internet piracy …
When we suggested that natural justice would imply that it was unreasonable to withdraw Internet access based on an accusation , she reiterated her position that something had to be done and that ISPs had to do it .
ISPs , she said , need to negotiate with the licence holders to put in a regime to prevent copyright infringements .
The licence holders ' associations had assured her that they would not be unreasonable .
In response to being told that it is technically impossible for ISPs to tell what people are doing , Judith said that it had been done for child pornography and that ISPs need to apply the same standards .
It was pointed out that the state defines objectionable material , possession of which is a crime , but there 's no equivalent definition for copyright , infringement of which is a civil matter to be determined by courts .

Friedrich A. Hayek was barely out of his twenties in 1929 when he published the German versions of the first two works in this collection , Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle and " The Paradox of Saving . "
The latter article was a long essay that was to become the core of his celebrated book and the third work in this volume , Prices and Production , the publication of which two years later made him a world - renowned economist by the age of thirty - two .
But the young Hayek did not pause to savor his success .
He was already hard at work on " Reflections on the Pure Theory of Money of Mr. J.M. Keynes , " a lengthy critical review of John Maynard Keynes 's two - volume Treatise on Money , which had been published in 1930 .
Hayek 's two - part review appeared in late 1931 and 1932 .
There followed within a few years the other three works collected in this volume .
" The Mythology of Capital " appeared in 1936 and was a response to Frank Knight 's hostile criticisms of the Austrian theory of capital .
A short article on " Investment That Raises the Demand for Capital " and the monograph Monetary Nationalism and International Stability were published in 1937 .
These seven works taken together represent the first integration and systematic elaboration of the Austrian theories of money , capital , business cycles , and comparative monetary institutions , which constitute the essential core of Austrian macroeconomics .
Indeed these works have profoundly influenced postwar expositions of Austrian or " capital - based " macroeconomics down to the present day .
The creation of such an oeuvre would be a formidable intellectual feat over an entire lifetime ; it is an absolute marvel when we consider that Hayek had completed it in the span of eight years ( 1929 –1937 ) and still well shy of his fortieth birthday .
Hayek 's amazingly precocious intellect and creative genius are on full display in these works .
Thus , before the age of thirty , Hayek already had fully mastered and begun to synthesize and build upon the major contributions of his predecessors in the Austrian tradition .
These included , in particular : Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk 's theory of capital and interest ; Knut Wicksell 's further elaborations on Böhm - Bawerk 's capital theory and his own insights into the " cumulative process " of changes in money , interest rates and prices ; Ludwig von Mises 's groundbreaking theories of money and business cycles ; and the general analytical approach of the broad Austrian school from Menger onward that focused on both the subjective basis and the dynamic interdependence of all economic phenomena .
There is something else about Hayek that becomes apparent when reading his contributions in this volume .
The young Hayek was a great economic controversialist , perhaps the greatest of the twentieth century .
His entire macroeconomic system was forged within the crucible of the great theoretical controversies of the era .
His opponents were some of the great ( and not so great ) figures in interwar economics : Keynes , W.T. Foster and W. Catchings , Ralph Hawtrey , Irving Fisher , Frank Knight , Joseph Schumpeter , Gustav Cassel , Alvin Hansen , A.C. Pigou , Arthur Spiethoff to name a few .
Hayek took on all comers without fear or favor and inevitably emerged victorious .
As Alan Ebenstein notes , " Hayek came to be seen in Cambridge , as Robbins and LSE 's point man in intellectual combat with Cambridge . "
Hayek 's prodigious dialectical skills and his relentless drive to root out and correct even the most entrenched economic errors are exhibited throughout this volume .
Hayek 's review of Keynes 's Treatise on the Pure Theory of Money is the exemplar of disputation in theoretical economics .
Keynes was Hayek 's senior by a generation and at the time the leading economist in Great Britain and among the most famous public intellectuals in the Anglophone world .
Keynes worked hard and long on his treatise , and clearly intended it to be his magnum opus , a dazzling leap forward in the theory of money based on " a novel means of approach to the fundamental problems of monetary theory . "
But Keynes 's reach far exceeded his grasp given his parochial and stunted training in economic theory — one course in economics and the study of Alfred Marshall 's clunky and disjointed textbook .
Keynes 's Treatise never stood a chance .
For the brilliant and courageous young Hayek was waiting , pen in hand , to show up the Treatise as a theoretical dead end rather than the new departure in monetary theory Keynes had hoped for .
Hayek 's blistering review essay is a positive thrill to read .
He relentlessly scrutinizes and exposes the shaky and patchwork structure of Keynes 's theoretical arguments and then dismantles it brick by brick , leaving nothing standing .
Keynes 's reaction reveals just how deeply Hayek 's review cut as well as his own cavalier attitude toward intellectual pursuits .
Keynes 's reply to the first part of Hayek 's essay , which dealt with the first , purely theoretical volume of the Treatise , was not properly a reply at all but a critique of Hayek 's book Prices and Production .
Upon publication six months later of the second part of Hayek 's article , which focused on the second , applied volume of the Treatise and in which Hayek was a bit more complimentary , Keynes remarked to Hayek , " Oh never mind , I no longer believe all that . "
Yet Keynes was not done .
A month later , Keynes , as chief editor of the Economic Journal , published a nasty review of Hayek 's Prices and Production written by one of Keynes 's more uncomprehending and rabid disciples , Piero Sraffa .
Keynes 's fellow Cambridge economist , Arthur C. Pigou , was aghast at this behavior .
Without naming names , Pigou wrote , " A year or two ago , after the publication of an important book , there appeared an elaborate and careful critique of a number of passages in it .
The author 's answer was , not to rebut the criticism , but to attack with violence another book , which the critic had himself written several years before .
Body - line bowling .
The methods of the duello .
That kind of thing is surely a mistake . "
In " The Mythology of Capital , " Hayek took on the long and bitter crusade against the Austrian theory of capital waged by Frank Knight , fifteen years Hayek 's senior , an eminent American economist and the founder and leader of the early Chicago School .
Hayek fittingly adopted as the introductory quotation of his article a statement by Eugen von Böhm - Bawerk , not coincidentally the greatest economic disputant of the nineteenth century and Hayek 's chief influence in capital theory .
Hayek 's quotation of Böhm - Bawerk read , " With every respect for the intellectual qualities of my opponent , I must oppose his doctrine with all possible emphasis , in order to defend a solid and natural theory of capital against a mythology of capital . "
This is actually a concise statement of the early Hayek 's general method of attaining theoretical breakthroughs : he would carefully develop the correct theoretical position and then use it as a weapon with which to strike down the fallacies of his opponents .
In this article he proceeded to demolish Knight 's claim that capital , once accumulated , was a permanent fund that perpetually and automatically reproduced itself without regard to human purposes and the prevailing conditions of scarcity .
Hayek trenchantly characterized Knight 's notion of capital as " a pseudo - concept devoid of content and meaning , which threatens to shroud the whole problem in a mist of words . "
" The Paradox of Saving , " which was for Hayek " the beginning of a continuous development of thought " that shaped his research agenda throughout the 1930s , was a critique of the underconsumptionist approach to depression .
Specifically , Hayek was responding to two American writers , Waddill Catchings and William Trufant Foster , who had co-authored a series of essays and tracts on the topic in the 1920s and even offered a $ 5,000 prize for the best critique of their doctrine in 1925 .
In the course of his point - by - point refutation of their argument , Hayek integrated Böhm - Bawerk 's analysis of the period of production with Mises 's theory of the business cycle and provided the latter theory with an explicit basis in capital theory for the first time .
The other works in this volume , although they were not overtly controversial pieces , followed much the same pattern as his critiques of Keynes , Knight , and Foster and Catchings .
Hayek wrote Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle as an explication of the monetary causes of the business cycle .
However , in order to do so , he believed that he had to " save the sound elements in the monetary theories of the trade cycle " by refuting those naïve quantity theorists who posited a simplistic and mechanical connection between the aggregate money supply and the average price level .
Thus he took out after the price " stabilizers " like Irving Fisher and Gustav Cassel who were the forerunners of the modern monetarists .
He identified " the critique of the program of the ' stabilizers ' " as " the central theme of this book . "
Nor did Hayek tread lightly in verbalizing his criticisms .
He placed the blame for " the exceptional severity and duration of the depression " squarely on central banks ' , particularly the Fed's , " experiment " in " forced credit expansion " first to stabilize prices in the 1920s and then to combat the depression in the early 1930s .
Hayek defiantly declared : " We must not forget that , for the last six or eight years [ up to 1932 ] monetary policy all over the world has followed the advice of the stabilizers .
It is high time that their influence , which has already done harm enough , should be overthrown . "
Prices and Production , often seen as the companion volume to Monetary Theory and the Trade Cycle , developed in much greater detail the synthesis of Misesian business - cycle and Böhm - Bawerkian capital theory that Hayek first sketched out in " The Paradox of Saving . "
Once again , Hayek 's positive contribution , i.e. , a fully developed statement of Austrian business cycle theory , was at least partially motivated by his intent to engage and refute what he regarded as an economic fallacy , specifically , the Anglo - American version of the quantity theory .
After summarizing that theory in three propositions , he referred to them as " delusions " that " make it possible to assume that we can neglect the influence of money [ on the real structure of production ] so long as the value of money is assumed to be stable . "
In the short article on " Investment that Raises the Demand for Capital , " Hayek drew out the subtle implications of an accepted proposition regarding the sunk costs of already invested capital to show the complete inadequacy of simplistic monetary explanations of the business cycle that treat capital as an abstract homogeneous aggregate and ignore the intricate interrelationships among the concrete goods composing the capital structure .
Again , Hayek was not gentle in his rhetoric .
He insisted that his positive restatement of the proposition in question rendered it " so obvious as to put its logical correctness beyond dispute , " which meant that " much of the purely monetary analysis of the trade cycle now current is built on very insufficient foundations . "
In Monetary Nationalism and International Stability , Hayek extended Mises 's monetary theory to provide a groundbreaking analysis of the international operation of the pure gold standard and the widely misunderstood role of international monetary flows therein .
Hayek also identified the systemic flaw in the classical gold standard — a centralization of gold reserves in the hands of national central banks or " the national reserve system " — that led to its destruction by monetary policy .
Thus Hayek argued that the demise of the gold standard in 1931 was caused by the influence on monetary policy achieved by the ideas of " Monetary Nationalism " after World War I. Wrote Hayek , " [ L] ong before the breakdown of the international gold standard in 1931 , monetary policy all over the world was guided by the ideas of monetary nationalism . "
In critically analyzing the proposals of the monetary nationalists for a regime of fluctuating national fiat currencies , Hayek presented the first comprehensive case against so - called freely fluctuating exchange rates , which has yet to be improved upon .
Integrating his argument with Austrian business cycle theory , he demonstrated that fluctuating exchange rates do not prevent the international transmission of macroeconomic fluctuations as long as there exists free trade in all orders of capital goods as well as in consumer goods — even if governments under the influence of monetary nationalism are able to impede international capital flows .
As always , Hayek was not shy about identifying the individuals to whom his critical remarks applied .
Thus he characterized Keynes 's disciple and later biographer Roy Harrod as " one of the most ardent advocates of monetary nationalism . "
Hayek also harshly criticized Charles R. Whittlesey for whom " almost the whole argument in favor of monetary nationalism is based on the assumption that different national currencies are different commodities and that consequently there ought to be variable prices of them in terms of each other . "
Ever the dialectician , Hayek proceeded to point out the naïve fallacy vitiating Whittlesey 's argument : " No attempt is made to explain why or under what conditions and in what sense the different national moneys ought to be regarded as different commodities , and one can hardly avoid the impression that the author has uncritically accepted the difference in denomination as proof of a difference in kind . "
This last work , which was a slight volume of fewer than one hundred pages , was basically the reproduction of a series of lectures that Hayek delivered at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva .
We can only speculate what course the Keynesian Revolution and , indeed , the economic history of the Western world would have taken had Hayek discontinued work on his abortive Pure Theory of Capital to " undertake the larger investigation " that his friends ( viz. , LSE economists Lionel Robbins , Frank Paish and Frederic Benham ) advised " the subject deserves . "
Hayek himself believed that it " would certainly have been a much bigger and much better book " had he incorporated their suggestions .
If Hayek , who was at the peak of his academic fame and analytical and rhetorical powers , had revised and expanded the lectures into a proper book , Monetary Nationalism and International Stability might have become the Austrian tract for the times that rivaled the General Theory and derailed the Keynesian juggernaut right at the outset .
This was Hayek 's great missed opportunity and not , as he often later lamented , the narrowly technical review of the General Theory he failed to write .
The present volume thus presents the combative and assertive , yet always polite , Hayek , fully confident in the superiority of the intellectual armamentarium supplied by his great predecessors in the Austrian tradition and in his own ability to wield it .
Here we look in vain for the irenic and temporizing Hayek who was later to dedicate a book to " the Socialists of All Parties . "
The former Hayek seemed to completely disappear sometime after the publication of the Pure Theory of Capital in 1941 .
It is an open question whether this radical change in attitude was the result of a strategic choice that corresponded to Hayek 's shift out of economics into the broader field of social theory .
Hayek himself lent credence to this interpretation in later reflections :
" When it proved that … the General Theory … conquered most of the professional opinion , and when in the end even some of the colleagues I most respected supported the wholly Keynesian Bretton Woods agreement , I largely withdrew from the debate , since to proclaim my dissent from the near unanimous views of the orthodox phalanx would merely have deprived me of a hearing on other matters about which I was more concerned at the time . "
Hayek 's transformation may also have been a temperamental response to the crushing blow to his reputation as an economist caused by the overwhelming success of the Keynesian Revolution .
Hayek also provided some evidence for this view of the matter in another one of his reminiscences :
I had a period of twenty years in which I bitterly regretted having once mentioned to my wife after Keynes 's death that now Keynes was dead , I was probably the best - known economist living .
But ten days later it was probably no longer true .
At that very moment , Keynes became the great figure , and I was gradually forgotten as an economist .
Many laboring in the thriving cottage industry of Hayek biographers , critics and interpreters have commented on the transition from a " Hayek I " to a " Hayek II " that began in the late 1930s , portraying it as almost wholly an intellectual re-orientation and change in research interests .
Few , if any , have recognized the radical alteration in analytical procedure and rhetorical style that characterized this transformation .
This is evident by comparing the works in this volume with later essays penned by Hayek II , e.g. , those anthologized in his Studies in Philosophy , Politics and Economics .
However Hayek I re-emerged almost immediately after receiving the Nobel Prize in 1974 fully armed and with renewed passion for intellectual combat .
In a remarkable flurry of articles , pamphlets , booklets , and interviews , he aggressively demolished the intellectual case for postwar Keynesianism and confidently offered new and radical proposals for extricating the Western industrial nations from the stagflationary mire into which they had floundered under the guidance of Keynes 's disciples .
The republication of these works in a single volume is a magnificent event that fills a yawning gap in the Austrian macroeconomic literature and provides modern Austrians with a model of how to advance economic theory through reasoned debate and criticism .
I do n't know about you , but there is a poverty hidden by the seven - figure sums of the CNR budget .
Look around you on campus today , and you see students registering each other to vote in record numbers .
Of all the groups doing this , the College Republicans of UNM have yet to participate .
So long as the organization is treated as a slush fund , they rob themselves of the ability to gather younger recruits and participate in the growth of youth activism .
Beyond what speakers or events that student groups host , our most important activity is undoubtedly registering students to vote in the rush to the Oct. 7 deadline .
We 've even established early voting in the SUB that will last from Oct. 18 to Nov. 1 .
But the College Republicans have long ago stepped out of that volunteerism and instead sold themselves out to campaign contribution leftovers .
The College Republicans rebutted with an op -ed by Ashley Barbera , in which she pointed out the paucity of funds available to College Democrats due to their status as an appendage of the DNC , and contrasted that to what the CRNC is able to accomplish with their larger budget .
I wo n't argue with the first part of Barbera 's piece .
I 've written at length about how the College Democrats are financially disadvantaged by remaining within the DNC .
And I do n't think Drake is right in saying that the CRNC is a slush fund for the Republican Party .
However , the College Republican 's budget requires much closer scrutiny , as do Barbera 's claims .
Barbera touts the CRNC 's fundraising prowess , and notes that
Our money comes from a national network of 110,000 supporters , mostly small - dollar donors , who recognize the importance of reaching out to young voters .
According to Open Secrets , the College Republican National Committee has raised $ 4.7 million this cycle .
Of that money , a full 73 % - $ 3.2 million - went back into fundraising .
What 's going on here ?
Well looking into the expenditures it becomes clear :
2008 CRNC Budget by Expenditures
$ 3.2 million to Infocision Management , a Republican direct mail and telemarketing firm .
The College Republicans are n't a slush fund , but they are n't a mega - funded super org either .
They 're an incredibly inefficient direct mail and telemarketing operation that spends 75 cents for every dollar it raises .
And this money does not come , as Barbera suggests , from 110,000 small donors who " understand the need to reach out to young voters . "
As this article in the Seattle Times makes clear , the vast majority of donors who give to the CRNC have no idea they are giving money to the college Republicans .
They are elderly men and women , tricked into giving by dishonest telemarketing and direct mail scams .
In the last three electoral cycles , the number one employment category of individual donors to the CRNC is " retired . "
Looking further into the CRNC 's 2008 expenditures , almost 1 / 4 of a million dollars goes to consultants - almost as much as the $ 373 k the organization paid to its employees .
The College Republicans are n't a $ 4.8 million juggernaut of youth organizing .
Once you take out the money spent on fundraising , they are a $ 1.2 million org that spends 1 / 5 of its budget padding the pockets of consultants .
I 'm sure the rebuttal from the CRNC will be that this is still far better than the College Democrats , but comparing the College Democrats and College Republicans is like comparing apples and oranges .
As Barberra herself states , CDA is an appendage of the DNC , while the CRNC is an independent 527 , able to raise much greater sums of money on its own and operate independently of the Republican Party .
As such , CRNC 's closest analogue on the Democratic side of the aisle is the Young Democrats of America , also a 527 organization .
According to Open Secrets ' analysis of YDA 's expenditures for 2008 , the group has raised far less money than CRNC , but the vast majority of YDA 's expenditures go towards salaries and programs for young voter outreach .
They spend only a fraction of their total budget on fundraising .
In fact , even with a budget that is only a fraction of the CRNC 's overall budget , YDA still manages to spend more money on their staff and programs than does the CRNC :
YDA 2008 Budget Expenditures :
Now , I 'm not looking to do a full comparison between YDA and the CRNC in terms of program , though I suspect such a comparison will be equally favorable to YDA .
Even College Republicans on the CRNC 's own blog question their reports about the tens of thousands of new recruits and hundred thousand phone calls cited by Barbera .
Such criticisms from within the organization are also directed at STORM , the social action network / CRM ( constituent relationship manager ) developed by CRNC .
STORM was another accomplishment touted by Barberra , though it is hard to see why .
The network is a barren wasteland , used by almost no one ; so much so that I was able to infiltrate the network and become one of the " STORM Top 40 " - a group of top recruiters given free housing and credentials at the Republican National Convention .
This took almost no effort on my part , and to this day , my STORM profile confirms that I only recruited 17 people into the network .
Reports on the CRNC blog say that STORM cost between $ 250 and $ 300 k .
Friends in the CMS / CRM business assure me that this price is outrageous for what is essentially a glorified database and email program .
Taking a longer view of the CRNC vs YDA budget also produces some rather unfavorable trends for CRNC .
Whereas the YDA budget is growing each year , and YDA always operates within their budget , the CRNC 's budget has shrunk dramatically in the last four years .
And - ironically for the party of " fiscal responsibility " - CRNC can't seem to operate within their means , racking up massive debt in 2004 and 2006 .
CRNC Budgets by Cycle
YDA Budgets by Cycle
So while Drake may have missed the mark with his op - ed against the College Republicans , Barbera 's response was n't much better .
A closer look at CRNC unmasks the organization as a paper tiger with more bark than bite .
Let the fans choose .
Masvidal vs Nate , Colby or Conor ...
Who you got ?...
A nasty fungus seems to have sex while it invades its human host .
The fungus causes chronic diarrhea in AIDS patients , organ transplant recipients and travelers .
The finding could lead to the development of new treatments against these virulent pathogens .
Both sexual and asexual reproduction are common in fungi .
Asexual reproduction means cells simply divide .
Scientists were unsure which way this group of fungi , called microsporidia , reproduced .
Now they know it 's sexual .
" Microsporidian infections are hard to treat because until now we have n't known a lot about his common pathogen , " said Soo Chan Lee , lead author of a new study and a postdoctoral researcher at Duke University in North Carolina .
" Up to 50 percent of AIDS patients have microsporidial infections and develop chronic diarrhea . "
" These infections are also detected in patients with traveler 's diarrhea , and also in children , organ transplant recipients and the elderly , " Lee added .
Of the more than 1,200 species of microsporidia , more than a dozen infect humans .
Investigating the tiny fungi was difficult because they cannot live outside of an infected host cell and they have a small number of genes , which are rapidly evolving .
The Duke scientists used two genetic studies to prove that microsporidia are true fungi and that they evolved from sexually - reproducing fungi .
They also found that they are closely related to zygomycete fungi , another group that reproduces sexually , as well as asexually .
The most familiar type of zygomycete is the fast - growing , white , fuzzy fungus that develops on strawberries and other high - sugar content fruits .
Lee and his colleagues found that microsporidia shared 33 out of 2,000 genes with zygomycetes that it does n't share with other fungi .
This genomic signature shows that the two types of fungi likely shared a common ancestor and are more distantly related to other known fungal lineages .
The study , funded by the National Institutes of Health and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research , also showed that microsporidia and zygomycetes have some of the same genes involved in sexual reproduction and that they 're arranged in the same order in both groups .
These findings , detailed in the Oct. 30 issue of the journal Current Biology , show that microsporidia have a genetically - controlled sexual cycle and that they may be undergoing sexual reproduction while they 're invading their host .
Lee said that the next step of the research is to explore the fungi's sexual reproduction , which may cause more severe infections because they use the host 's cellular environment and machinery as a safe haven in which to reproduce .
Oh my God !!!!
I ’ve been banned from freaking Digg.com !!!!!!!!
Big deal .
The world continues to turn .
Why is it when people get banned from a place on these internets , we all get this feeling of rejection ?
Who cares really ?
Really , who cares ?
Yes , I was using a script … ooooooooooo , it ’s soooooo bad .
There are all kinds of bad people roaming the streets this evening is n’t there ?
“ What are you in for ? ”
Says a convicted felon in my same jail cell .
“ I was banned from Digg for using a script . ”
Yes , I ’m a bad SOB !!!
The other prisoners shutter in disbelief how heinous my criminal history is .
It is n’t the end of the world folks .
Frankly , it ’s a relief to be rid of Digg and let me explain why .
As many of you know , I used to write a daily piece called the Daily Digg Disappointment .
It was a great little article that garnered a good following of members .
But Digg saw that it was becoming too popular , too powerful , so they nixed it claiming it was spam .
Hahaha imagine that .
Spam .
I was banned then too .
Then Digg had this great idea of the Recommendation Engine .
Talk about slowing the process of digging down .
Digg must have paid some serious bucks for this piece of crap .
I suspect the reason Digg went on this humongous ban tour is because the guy that developed this piece of crap recommendation engine was crying the scripts were making it do crazy shit .
That ’s just my theory though .
But come on , the servers were probably being over - worked with all of the scripts , and all of the recommendation engine crap .
So I plead guilty .
Big deal .
I have decided I like the social networks , I like submitting stories , so I created my own place and you are very welcome to be a subscriber .
Here is the link : http://www.reddit.com/r/ExDiggers/
Be sure and save that quickly , because you know I ’m gonna get banned pretty quickly after I post this right ?
I just want to take a moment to also tell you please put my blog in your favorites : https://lewp.wordpress.com/
Thanks to all of you for being my friend .
We can still hang out together , just save those links to your favorites , and I would be honored if you start submitting to my ExDigger site .
Thanks , and you guys take care !
Editor 's note : Glenn Beck is on CNN Headline News nightly at 7 and 9 ET and also is host of a conservative national radio talk show .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
With a little less than a month before the election , this week started with a re-examination of Barack Obama 's association with William Ayers .
Voting against Barack Obama or Sarah Palin does n't make someone a racist or sexist , according to Glenn Beck .
Whether holding a career - launching state Senate campaign event at the home of an unrepentant terrorist should disqualify you from the presidency is up to the people to decide .
I tend to see it as a rather low bar to clear if you 're going to run the world , but hey , that 's just me .
The defense on Ayers from the Obama camp is that they 're not friends -- Ayers was " a guy who lives in my neighborhood , " as Obama said .
This strikes me as a strange argument from the same campaign that ran Spanish - language ads attempting to disparage McCain by highlighting his " Republican friends " like Rush Limbaugh .
Besides the fact that Rush is n't a terrorist and had to be completely taken out of context in the attempt to smear him -- Limbaugh and McCain are best known for their adversarial relationship .
Rush has spent the better part of a decade mocking him , most recently on the specific stance that was the focus of the commercial , immigration reform .
If Rush qualifies as McCain 's friend , then William Ayers might as well be Barack Obama 's fiancé .
But as The Associated Press claimed , even mentioning the association with Ayers , as Sarah Palin did in a speech earlier in the week , signifies a hidden " racial tinge . "
Is anyone else getting tired of this ?
Any and every time a question of Obama 's history or record is asked , there is always someone to blame it on racism .
Remember , William Ayers is a pasty white guy like me .
Should n't the fact that Palin is criticizing a white terrorist show that it's not his color -- but his terrorism -- that she 's not fond of ?
Instead , the AP tries to make the case that voters will think Obama is " not like us " since " terrorists are envisioned as dark - skinned radical Muslims . "
Right , because nothing dredges up visions of radical Muslims with box - cutters like a guy named Bill .
Just ridiculous .
That was n't enough to convince Democratic Rep. Gregory Meeks , who said , " He 's ' not one of us ' ?
That 's racial .
That 's fear .
They know they can't win on the issues , so the last resort they have is race and fear . "
He also added , " They are trying to throw out these codes . "
I did n't know about the secret white person code language , but I 'm hoping there 's a secret handshake too .
Earlier , Kansas Gov. Kathleen
Sebelius said essentially the same thing : " I think the notion that , ' By the way , have any of you noticed that Barack Obama is part African - American ? ' -- that may be a factor .
All of the code language , all that does n't show up in polls and that may be a factor for some people . "
Note to all white people -- remember to grab your secret racist decoder ring in each box of Cracker Jacks for Crackers .
The New York Observer found no shortage of New York politicians willing to go on the record with their accusations of racism :
" Racism is alive and well in this country , and McCain and Palin are trying to appeal to that and it's unfortunate . " -- Rep. Ed Towns
" They are obviously playing on people 's fears and prejudices in a desperate way .
While not explicitly relating to race , they are clearly creating the opportunity for those inclined to come to those conclusions . " -- State Sen. Bill Perkins
" If you have to remind people that Barack Obama is African - American , you have reached the bottom . " -- State Sen. Kevin Parker
" Who exactly is Joe Six - Pack and who are these hockey moms ?
That 's what I 'd like to know .
...
Is that supposed to be terminology that is of common ground to all Americans ?
I do n't find that .
It leaves a lot of people out . " -- Rep. Yvette Clarke
It 's worth noting that all of this comes from the same state and the same party as Hillary Clinton .
If you 're of the mindset that all Republicans are racist and therefore deserve these attacks , remember what happened to Hillary and her husband during the primaries .
If the " first black president " can be vilified over claims of racism , what person that dares to criticize Obama can escape the same fate ?
Charges of racism have even entered the financial meltdown .
One recent criticism by conservatives has surrounded the Community Reinvestment Act .
This act , passed in 1977 under Jimmy Carter and then strengthened by Bill Clinton , pressured mortgage companies to lend to those with poor credit and lower income .
You might think that putting the government 's endorsement of the loosening of lending standards under the microscope in the middle of a global financial crisis would be a no- brainer .
Well , not to House Financial Services Committee chair Barney Frank : " The bizarre notion that the Community Reinvestment Act ... somehow is the cause of the whole problem , [ conservatives ] do n't mind that .
...
They 're aware that the affordable - housing goals of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac [ and ] the Community Reinvestment Act [ aim to help ] poor people .
And let 's be honest , the fact that some poor people are black does n't hurt either from their standpoint . "
I guess when you 're on record in July of this year saying " I think this is a case where Fannie and Freddie are fundamentally sound , that they are not in danger of going under , " the only thing you can do is play the race card .
I 'm not sure if this is the new kind of politics we were promised by Barack Obama , but I do n't think it 's the change most people have in mind .
This random name - calling just winds up hurting legitimate claims of racism , which do exist .
But they risk being taken far less seriously , if the constant crying of wolf continues .
The truth is , voting against Barack Obama does n't make you a racist , just like voting against Sarah Palin does n't make you a sexist .
The vast majority of regular Americans understand that .
If politicians could catch up and restrain themselves from trying to exploit our differences for their own gain -- we 'd all be better off .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .
YouTube has rejected a request from US presidential candidate John McCain 's campaign to review its fair use policy and stop removing political campaign videos that may infringe copyright so swiftly .
The McCain campaign 's general counsel , Trevor Potter , sent a letter to executives from YouTube and parent company Google earlier this week asking for a " full legal review " of takedown notices submitted against videos posted by political candidates and campaigns .
" Lawyers and judges constantly disagree about what does and does not constitute fair use , " said YouTube 's chief counsel Zahavah Levine in a letter of response .
" No number of lawyers could possibly determine with a reasonable level of certainty whether all videos for which we receive disputed take down notices qualify as fair use , " Levine added .
YouTube , which is facing legal action from media companies and rights owners including Viacom and the Premier League over illegal copyright infringement , argues that it is protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
Under the DMCA YouTube is protected from being responsible for illegal material as long as the company moves to take it down when notified of an infringing video .
" The DMCA provides a statutory safe harbour for service providers such as YouTube that host content at the direction of users , " said Levine .
" Without this safe harbour , sites like YouTube could not exist .
The real problem here is individuals and entities that abuse the DMCA process , " he added .
McCain , who is outgunned in ad spend terms by Democrat rival Barack Obama and is suffering in the polls , has found his campaigning films frequently removed by YouTube following complaints they use copyrighted material without permission .

American 's armed forces are growing bigger to reduce the strains from seven years of war , but if the US is confronting an era of " persistent conflict , " as some experts believe , it will need an even bigger military .
A larger military could more easily conduct military and nation - building operations around the world .
But whether the American public has the appetite to pursue and pay for such a foreign - policy agenda , especially after more than five years of an unpopular war in Iraq , is far from clear .
Last week , the Army released a new manual on " stability operations " that outlines for the Army a prominent global role as a nation - builder .
The service will maintain its ability to fight conventional land wars , but the manual 's release signals that it expects future conflicts to look more like Iraq or Afghanistan than World War II .
While Defense Secretary Robert Gates has not publicly supported expanding the force beyond what is already planned , he has said the United States must prepare for more counterinsurgency wars like the ones it is fighting now – a hint that a larger military may be necessary .
Some analysts are certain of that need .
The Army currently has about 540,000 active - duty soldiers and is expected to attain its goal of 547,000 by 2011 .
The Marine Corps , also tapped to expand , should top 202,000 within the next couple of years .
The total American force – including active - duty , reserve , and guard – is about 2.2 million .
John Nagl , a counterinsurgency expert and a retired Army officer , says in coming years the Army should grow to 750,000 and the Marine Corps to 250,000 .
Demand for troops is already high , and it wo n't abate anytime soon even if substantial numbers of troops return from Iraq , he recently said at the Center for a New American Security , a think tank in Washington .
Meanwhile , the top US commander in Afghanistan has asked for more American troops that the US simply can't produce until more leave Iraq .
" We do n't have enough brigades to fight – that is an inconvertible fact , " says Mr. Nagl .
If the US is to remain a superpower in a world in which weak nations , not strong ones , are the big threats , then it must expand its forces so it wo n't again enter a conflict using too few troops , as it did in Iraq , say other experts .
America must stay engaged in nations with weak or nonexistent governments to prevent extremism from taking root and threatening the US .
" This is not a prediction of conflicts to come , but a recognition that the potential for stabilization and reconstruction missions remains high , " writes Fred Kagan , a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , a think tank here , in a book he cowrote called " Ground Truth . "
Mr. Kagan and Thomas Donnelly argue for a total force of about 2.8 million , which includes an active Army of about 800,000 and a Marine Corps of about 200,000 .
" We may not want these missions , but they might be thrust upon us ; and they certainly might appear to a future president as the least - bad outcome , " Kagan writes .
Despite warnings against allowing the military to become the face of US foreign policy , more analysts are arguing that the resource - and manpower - rich armed forces are in the best position to fulfill any US policy pertaining to strengthening and stabilizing troubled nations .
Meanwhile , the State Department has pledged to hire 600 new foreign - service officers by next year to join the military in countries where stability operations are the main focus .
" The military is definitely out front .
They are faster than [ civilians ] are , they are alert , and they have a lot of resources , " says Daniel Serwer , a vice president at the United States Institute of Peace , which supports the Army 's new manual .
The cost of all this gives some analysts pause .
Frank Hoffman , a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia , says the new manual may represent a shift for the Army , but he has yet to see major changes in the overall Army approach .
" The Army is not fundamentally investing in new capabilities or creating any unique skill sets , or reducing training requirements or workload from conventional fighting , " he says .
It has yet to reevaluate its expensive future combat system , a cornerstone of Army modernization , he notes .
In Congress , which a few years ago was bipartisan in its support for a larger military , some are adjusting their view .
Rep. Jack Murtha ( D ) of Pennsylvania recently argued that the cost of a bigger force is too much and could prevent the military from buying equipment .
Whatever happens , Pentagon officials know they may be charged with expanding the military beyond current growth goals .
David Chu , the Pentagon 's undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness , says meeting higher recruiting goals would require a basic shift in the way the nation views the military .
He says he bristles when discussions in Washington about encouraging Americans to participate in national service programs omit the military .
" Few of those attempts , and fewer of those legislative proposals , ever mention the military , " he says .
If the country were to reverse that stand , " there wo n't be serious recruiting issues . "
I picked up my copy of the Iron Man DVD on Tuesday from Target .
If you have n’t seen the packaging yet for the “ Ultimate 2 - Disk Edition ” from Target , it ’s SWEET !
There are several different retailer exclusives , but I personally like the Target version best .
The DVD package itself is shaped like Iron Man ’s head !
How cool is that ?!?!?
See the pictures below .
Other retailer exclusives include comic books , access to exclusive digital comics , bobbleheads , a DVD featuring the first episode of the new animated series , and more .
You can find a complete list of the exclusives at SuperHeroHype.com .
Special features included with the “ Ultimate 2 - Disk Edition ” include : deleted and extended scenes , a “ Making of ” documentary , a “ History of the Hero ” feature , a segment on visual effects , Robert Downey Jr ’s screen test , the actor ’s process , still galleries , and more .
When I sat down to watch the movie again , I was worried I would n’t enjoy it as much .
I was completely over the moon for the film when it was first released .
On occasion in the past I ’ve really enjoyed a geek - related movie , only to find myself suffering from a “ geek hangover ” upon second viewing .
That was not the case this time !
This movie still rocks !
It starts with a bang ( literally in Afghanistan ) and keeps a hold of you all the way until the end .
Jon Favreau directed a comic book masterpiece here .
This is definitely my favorite comic book movie yet !
Robert Downey
Jr really is the perfect Tony Stark ; suave , focused , handsome , and can really act the rich playboy .
I also really like Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper .
She ’s not exactly like Pepper from the comics , but she did a fine job as Tony ’s girl Friday .
It does n’t hurt that she looked really hot in this film .
While I was n’t thrilled with Terrance Howard as Rhodey the first time I watched the movie , he ’s growing on me .
I ca n’t wait to see him as War Machine !
And Jeff Bridges as Obadiah Stane … just wow !
Who would have guessed he could pull off such a menacing villain ( and bald too ! ) .
Two minor characters worth mentioning are Agent Phil Coulson of SHIELD and Happy Hogan ( Jon Favreau ) .
I really liked the unassuming character of Agent Coulson .
Once he got his chance to shine it was great .
On top of directing an outstanding movie , Favreau was also fun to see as Hogan .
In Daredevil he played “ Foggy ” , in Iron Man he played “ Happy ” .
Sounds like he ’s collecting his own seven dwarfs cast of roles .
The special effects in this movie were completely seamless !
It was very difficult to tell what was CGI and what was costume .
I ’ve also been negligent in complimenting the script .
What a well put together story with lots of action , drama , and humor !
If the script had been lousy , these great actors and fantastic special effects would n’t have been able to save it .
I hope they get the same script writers back for Iron Man 2 !
I ’m looking forward to the “ Demon in a Bottle ” storyline .
Finally , check out the deleted scenes on the DVD … there is more on the Stark Industries airplane with the sexy stewardesses !
To sum up , “ Iron Man ” truly is an invincible movie !
After watching the movie again , it makes me want to bust out some of my old Iron Man comics .
I was a pretty big fan of ole shellhead back in the day .
I have over 130 issues of his comic ; I collected pretty regularly from 1985 - 1987 , 1992 - 1993 , and 1995 - 2003 .
My personal favorite era was the 1985 - 1987 stuff , which a lot of the movie was based on .
Just check out the cover to Iron Man # 200 from 1985 .
Awesome stuff !
Scientists Create Energy - Producing Solar Paint
October 1st , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
A recent partnership between the steel industry and UK university researchers has led to the development of a unique photovoltaic paint that can be applied to steel .
The paint is made up of dye and electrolytes that can be applied as a paste to steel sheets .
Four layers of paint are applied to each sheet .
When light hits the solar cells , excited molecules release an electron into an electron collector and circuit ( nanocrystalline titanium dioxide ) .
Finally , the electrons move back into the dye .
Photovoltaic paint has a number of advantages over traditional solar cells .
It does n’t have the material limitations of silicon solar cells , so it theoretically provides many terawatts of electricity at a low cost .
Additionally , the paint can absorb light across the visible spectrum — so even cloudy days will reap lots of energy .
According to steel company Corus Colours , the solar cells can achieve a power conversion efficiency of 11 percent .
Production of solar paint will begin soon — a lab built to develop the new technology is starting work on October 30 in North Wales .
Ultimately , researchers at the PV Accelerator Laboratory in North Wales hope to develop a way to apply solar paint to steel at 30 to 40 square meters per second .
I only wonder if solar paint will be available for purchase to consumers in the future — if so , it could easily lead to a do - it - yourself solar revolution .

We 've got two shameful situations with early and absentee voting .
Well , there are many more , no doubt , but for purposes of this article , we 'll focus on the outrage in D.C. , where thousands of voters are not receiving their absentee ballots , so they 're being forced to go vote at county headquarters .
And out here in Los Angeles , the world 's largest voting jurisdiction , with just one , single early voting location .
News on both of those scandals --- and the response we received from our inquiry about the L.A. situation from L.A. County Registrar Dean Logan --- follow below ...
On the D.C. scandal ... This from " Fox News " today :
Despite efforts to reduce long lines and voting irregularities on Election Day , thousands of voters this week have been waiting in line for hours at Washington , D.C. , Election Board headquarters to cast ballots in person after requested absentee ballots failed to arrive before the voting deadline .
In a city with no early voting rules , elections officials have been accommodating the in - person vote since many voters said they had requested ballots by mail but none came .
With the deadline for absentee voting looming , voters said they did n't want to miss their chance to participate in the milestone election .
" I called them up this morning and they could n't guarantee that my ballot would arrive by tomorrow and that I should come in and vote in person , " Bella Sewal told FOX News .
...
Washington , D.C. --- like many states across the country --- has experienced its share of voting headaches .
Election board officials said they sent out more than 16,000 absentee ballots but do not know yet how many did not reach their intended destination or why not .
John Gideon of VotersUnite.org ( and a frequent contributor to The BRAD BLOG ) brought the article to our attention .
He also noted : " DC does not have early voting yet they are allowing voters to vote early because they have no idea if absentee ballots will be delivered .
And the unasked and answered question in this article ; what about the military and overseas voters ?
Did they get their ballots ?
Will they be able to vote ? "
Good questions .
And speaking of problems with the lack of early voting ...
Los Angeles , the largest voting jurisdiction in the country , larger than 41 states combined --- and where we happen to live --- has a single early voting location at the county 's election headquarters .
The drive , if L.A. traffic plays along ( and it rarely does ) , from The BRAD BLOG World News Headquarters is about 40 minutes from here .
That 's an absolute scandal , frankly .
In previous elections there had been a dozen or so locations around the county for early voting .
LA County Clerk and Recorder Dean Logan explained via email ( posted below in full ) , after we 'd forwarded an email from a voter troubled about it ( also posted below ) , that the reason is due to CA SoS Debra Bowen 's requirement that the county 's Diebold touch - screen voting machines , previously used for early voting , must have their so - called " paper trails " 100 % hand - counted , following severe security and accuracy issues discovered during her landmark " Top - to - Bottom Review " of the state 's voting systems .
Though we appreciate Logan 's thorough and quick response , his reasoning , frankly , is pretty weak , in our estimation , even if he was n't responsible for selecting this system .
That was done by former Registrar , Conny " Diebold Cover Girl " McCormack , who suddenly resigned in January , just one month before Super Tuesday .
But if Florida , of all places , can serve every one its voters by easing the expected historic turnout on Nov. 4th with early voting across the state --- albeit with several problems , largely due to failures in the state 's e-registration computers and Republican insistence that voting hours be cut back --- so can Los Angeles .
Next Tuesday will be a nightmare out here .
The email from the concerned Los Angeles voter , and Logan 's full email in response , follow below ...

Subject : Los Angeles County early Voting problem SusanWednesday , October 22 , 2008 2:00 PMLos Angeles County early Voting problem Los Angeles County has * only one * early voting location for the entire county ; the county is over 4000 square miles and has a population of over 9,948,000 .
I would have to drive at least 37 miles to vote early .
When I called the registrar 's office .
I was told that there was nothing to be done about it .
This is not right and constitues a veiled form of voter suppression .
Too much is at stake in this election .
I do not know where to turn .
I have called the CNN voter 's hotline , the LA League of Women 's Voters , and Election Protection , so far no one has anything constructive to offer as far as action to increase early voting locations in LA county .
I sure hope you can help or at least bring it to the public 's attention .

Brad --
Thanks for the question and the opportunity to respond .
I responded to a similar question from LAist last night .
Los Angeles County operated a successful early voting program in the past ; however it was dependent on the use of touch screen voting technology .
Following the Secretary of State 's top - to - bottom review of voting systems and the subsequent conditional approval of voting systems , the early voting system used in Los Angeles required a 100 % manual count of all ballots cast on touch screen devices .
Based on the size of our jurisdiction and the number of measures and contests on the ballot , it is simply not practical or logistically feasible to do that in a large scale , high volume election such as the one we are conducting now .
As a result , we discontinued the program .
We were very clear about this during the review of voting systems --- with the Board of Supervisors , the Secretary of State and the election protection community .
Collectively , I believe we all recognized the trade - off associated with the need for the conditions of use applied to the touch screen voting system (s ) .
With our paper - based , central count Optical Scan voting system , it is also not feasible to issue ballots at remote locations .
For this election , we have over 700 different ballot styles .
The ballot security , accountability and inventory control issues with this kind of volume and its associated variables would be significant and a drain on resources needed to ensure secure , transparent processes inherent to administering elections in Los Angeles County .
I believe many other California counties have faced a similar reality with regard to early voting .
We have emphasized options for vote by mail voting --- including an on - line application and tracking system on our web site at www.lavote.net.
Additionally , we have expanded hours and access at our Norwalk headquarters for those who need or choose to vote prior to election day .
In fact , we are will be open every day through election day for this purpose .
Please be assured that an early voting component will be a consideration in any future discussions or plans with regard to voting systems in Los Angeles County .
I hope this information is helpful .

OMAHA , Oct. 6 ( UPI ) -- Campaigners for Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Barack Obama say they are focusing attention on Omaha , trying to " stretch " the party 's electoral map .
Only two states , Nebraska and Maine , award electoral college votes based on individual congressional districts rather than in winner - take - all fashion .
And while Nebraska overall has n't voted for a Democratic presidential nominee since 1936 , advisers for Obama , a U.S. senator from Illinois , sense an opportunity in the state 's only heavily urban district in Omaha , The Washington Post reported Monday .

Obama 's campaign has sent 15 paid staff members to Nebraska hoping to secure an electoral vote from its 2nd Congressional District , which could be crucial in a close race , they say .
" One of the keys is going to be stretching the map .
If we can put all of these states into play , that will make a difference , " Jon Carson , Obama 's national field director , told the Post , adding that the more competitive Obama can be , the more traditionally Republican territory GOP opponent John McCain , a U.S. senator from Arizona , will be forced to defend .
McCain campaigners are employing the same strategy in traditionally Democratic Maine , where they are hoping to win a largely rural congressional district .

Director Ron Howard who to those of us of a certain age was Richie from Happy Days and to those with a bit more gray was Opie from The Andy Griffith Show has teamed up with former co-stars Andy Griffith and Henry Winkler to reprise his most famous roles in a pro-Obama video .
See more Ron Howard videos at Funny or Die
As you can see , the video is funny , but not too heavy handed .
Howard said that he has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past , but in 2008 he feels that the country needs change .
As he put some people will label as part of liberal Hollywood , but I think that his video shows that the notion that this nation is on the wrong path extends from sea to sea .
Did you really think that you would ever see Andy and Opie , or Richie and the Fonz again ?
Advertisements
This was a lighthearted video that as Howard said was designed to get people to take 5 minutes and think about the choices in this election .
Maybe it is because I am getting a little older , or maybe I just need a break from all the negativity in this campaign , but this video made me laugh , and I think it is a great way to spend a couple of minutes of your time .
I am starting to get to the point where videos like this are an oasis in a desert of endless political ads .
If there 's one thing that should have been learned by the Democratic Party over the last thirty or so years , it 's that running against the base is a recipe for failure in elections .
This lesson , however , has been repeatedly ignored by most of the party 's politicians .
When one goes over the electoral cycles since 1980 , it 's clear that the DLC 's " run - to - the - right " ploy has never actually won an election .
" But , " you tell me , " Bill Clinton won in 1992 and 1996 . "
This ignores the fact that independent candidate H. Ross Perot pulled enough votes away from the Republican nominees those years to swing the elections in the Democrat 's favor .
After Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994 , the party was unable to win it back until public disgust with the GOP had grown to such proportions that their defeat in 2006 was inevitable .
Since winning back the Legislature , however , Democrats have for the most part continued to piss away any chance they might have had for shoring up their victory and securing a lasting majority .
They 've kept funding the illegal occupation of Iraq , have continued to rubber stamp the shrub 's dismantling of the Constitution — even going so far as to protect him from impeachment for high crimes including treason , and basically let down the public on every issue of importance .
Barack Obama is n't even trying to win vital states such as Ohio ; in the heart of the state 's Democratic stronghold , the campaign has n't even bothered to set up telephones for phone - banking — volunteers have to use their own devices to call voters .
Furthermore , instead of going after frequently voting Democrats , Obama has his people reaching out to Republicans , most of whom have stated flat out that they have no intention of voting for him .
I know this through several Democratic volunteers who 've put their efforts into Obama 's campaign .
They are the eyewitnesses on the ground .
There 's a reason Ohio's GOP voters did not deign to put J. Kenneth Blackwell in the governor 's mansion : he 's technically black .
It did n't matter to them that he supported every bug - eyed insane policy and social position they did ; his skin color was darker than theirs , so he could not be allowed to become governor .
That Obama insists on trying to reach the still - strong bigot bloc , forsaking his own party 's base in the process , is absolute stupidity .
He 's going to blow it for us again , just as John Kerry and Al Gore did before him .
McCain will cheat his way to the dictatorship created by the shrub and his gargoyle , all because Obama wants to " play it safe " by running to appease the very wealthy .
How long shall Progressives continue to hold on to the fantasy that we can somehow reform the party from within ?
Yesterday I happened upon a diary at you - know - where that states flat out what I 'm sure a majority of Americans are thinking : that it is foolishness to continue remaining a registered Democrat as long as the party 's conservative wing controls it .
And make no mistake , Obama is very much part of that conservative wing despite whatever denials his followers choose to engage in .
Sooner or later the Progressive base of the Democratic Party has got to wake up and realize that it is pointless to remain with people who always denounce , marginalize , and campaign against its interests .
One might say that now is not the time to dump the Democratic Party , that there is too much at stake .
To that I say that it 's never going to be the " right time , " because there 's always going to be " too much at stake . "
Franklin Delano Roosevelt once said :
The country needs and , unless I mistake its temper , the country demands bold , persistent experimentation .
It is common sense to take a method and try it :
If it fails , admit it frankly and try another .
But above all , try something .
The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach .
We need enthusiasm , imagination and the ability to face facts , even unpleasant ones , bravely .
We need to correct , by drastic means if necessary , the faults in our economic system from which we now suffer .
And :
This is preeminently the time to speak the truth , the whole truth , frankly and boldly .
Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today .
This great Nation will endure as it has endured , will revive and will prosper .
So , first of all , let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself — nameless , unreasoning , unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance .
In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory .
I agree with the Kos diarist : it 's time for the Progressive base of the Democratic Party to face the unpleasant truth that we cannot and should not continue to waste our energies trying to reform from within a political party that long ago decided it wants to be something that runs contrary to everything we stand for .
The stakes are indeed high , but we have to ask ourselves if it's worth another four to eight years of frustration as we watch our beloved country and our world fall further in the hellish pits of fascism and ruin .
If Democrats as a whole will not represent Progressives , then we need to break away and form our own party so that our movement has genuine representation .
If nothing else , it will send Democrats a wakeup call : they cannot continue to dismiss and ignore their party 's base with impunity .

About author I 'm from Ohio , and a registered member of the Green Party of Ohio .
If we see a shadowy figure walking down a dark street , our sense of whether it is coming at us or walking away depends on whether we see it as a he or a she , new research finds .
This new result sheds light on the subtle judgments the brain makes when it notices motion .
In the past , research has shown that people are extraordinarily good at deducing the gender , age , mood and even personality of others based on just a few of their moves .
" Humans are acute observers of each other .
We know a lot about each other at first glance .
How we do that is an interesting question , especially as some people seem so good at it , " said researcher Rick van der Zwan , a behavioral neuroscientist at Southern Cross University in Australia .
To see what other kinds of details people might glean from movements , scientists had volunteers watch clusters of dots shaped roughly like people .
These were created by attaching lights on the real people and filming them as they either walked on a treadmill toward or away from a camera .
" If you look at someone with just their joints illuminated when they are n't moving , it 's difficult to tell what it is you are looking at .
But as soon as they move , instantaneously , you can tell that it's a person and perceive their nature , " van der Zwan said .
" You can tell if it 's a boy or a girl , young or old , angry or happy .
You can discern all these qualities about their state , affect , and actions with no cues at all about what they look like — with no form at all , just motion . "
As these stylized figures walked , their movements were manipulated to range anywhere from a " girly girl " to a " hulking male . "
The halfway point was a gender - neutral walker that volunteers judged as male half the time and female the other half .
Oddly , when these ambiguous figures were judged as masculine , volunteers saw them as approaching them , even when the actual people these figures were based on had walked away from the camera .
Moreover , when these figures were judged feminine , volunteers saw them as walking away from them , even when in real life the women had approached the camera .
" The thing that most people find most surprising is that the effects are consistent for observers of both genders , " van der Zwan told LiveScience .
" It does not matter if you are a female or a male observer — male figures of the type we used often look like they are facing the observer and female figures often look like they are facing away . "
Apparently , " there is something in the way males and females move that affects the way others see them in terms of their orientation in space , " van der Zwan said .
It is " tempting to speculate " that this effect reflects the potential costs " of misinterpreting the actions and intentions of others , " he added .
" For example , a male figure that is otherwise ambiguous might best be perceived as approaching to allow the observer to prepare to flee or fight .
Similarly , for observers , and especially infants , the departure of females might signal also a need to act , but for different reasons . "
The scientists will detail their findings in the Sept. 9 issue of the journal Current Biology .
ERIE , Penn . ( Reuters ) - Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on Thursday said Democratic nominee Barack Obama would be incapable of meeting U.S. national security challenges .
Palin , whose selection as Republican John McCain ’s running mate prompted criticism of her scant national security experience , spoke after meeting a group of retired military commanders and the former leaders of the CIA and the Homeland Security Department .
“ Barack Obama did n’t have much to say in that long infomercial of his last night about the stakes in the wars America is fighting , or about the need to support the troops in the field , or why he supported cutting off funding to our troops in the war , ” Palin said .
Palin said Obama ’s 30 - minute television ad on Wednesday sought to wrap his “ closing message ” before the Nov. 4 election in warm and fuzzy commercial trappings .
“ He wants to soften the focus in these closing days , hoping your mind wo n’t wander to the real challenges of national security that he is incapable of meeting , ” said Palin .
Five days before the election , Obama leads in national polls and has campaigned hard on economic themes as the country faces its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
A New York Times / CBS poll published on Thursday , in which Obama led McCain by 11 percentage points , also found that 59 percent of respondents believed Palin was not prepared for the job of vice president , up 9 percentage points since the beginning of the month .
Nearly a third said the vice presidential choice would be a major factor influencing their vote for president .
BIDEN DEFENDS OBAMA’S JUDGMENT
Speaking in Allentown , Pennsylvania , Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden lashed out at the McCain campaign ’s attacks against Obama and said they were aimed at dividing the nation .
“ I know Barack Obama ... this man has steel in his spine , ” Biden said to roars of applause .
“ In a dangerous world , you see Barack Obama exercise sound judgment about Iraq , about Afghanistan and about Korea while John McCain has demonstrated poor judgment , ” Biden said .
“ If you want to know where those ( failed ) policies are going to lead us , just look in the rearview mirror , ” he added .
Palin said it was possible for the 47 - year - old Obama , a first - term Illinois senator , to be “ admirable in many ways ” but he was not yet ready for the most important job in the world .
“ Rousing speeches that can fill a stadium , perhaps cannot keep this country safe , ” said Palin , who has revved up the conservative Republican base but failed to win over many more moderate and independent voters .
“ For a season , a man can inspire with his words .
But for a lifetime , John McCain has inspired with his heroic and trustworthy deeds .
And in five days , it will all come down to a choice between these two men , Barack Obama and John McCain , ” Palin said .
She made similar comments to a packed rally in Erie , drawing cheers when she said former Vietnam war prisoner and Navy pilot McCain understood the costs of war after commanding more than just a “ scripted political campaign . ”
The 72 - year - old McCain has expressed confidence in Palin ’s ability to handle any crisis , dismissing critics who say her two years as Alaska governor and earlier stint as a small town mayor were not enough to prepare her to become the country ’s second in command .

UPDATE - I have a new website called Keep Calm and Run .
It 's a guide for dealing with Alien Invaders , Zombies , Robotic Rampages , Giant Monsters , Things Man Was Not Meant to Know , and more .
I often hear people talk about pivotal moments in their lives with longing regret : wishing they ’d known then how critical a moment this fleeting juncture would be .
I have had the pleasure / terror of Total In - The - Moment - Surety that something was going to be a life altering event even as it happened .
The unifying theme is choice .
When I decided to say “ Yes ” to my boyfriend J.P. and move from The City to Los Angeles .
When I decided to attend NYU instead of Carnegie - Mellon .
When I said “ Yes , OK . ” and invited a Certain British Musician to sit at my table and change the face of my core sexuality within a scant 17 days …all of these were moments where I made a deliberate choice and knew that the ripples would lap at the shores of my internal ocean for the rest of my life .
One of the more unexpected hairpin turns I navigated in my “ Coming Out ” into BDSM involved a series of moments that were deceptively simple , perhaps even innocent , in a way .
Imagine my surprise when the gossamer web of control and submission made itself known to me in the context of a children ’s game .
Which is bizarrely fitting .
So much of what we do in BDSM is freeing our selves and rewinding , emotionally , to a trusting , open and daring and , dare I say , child - like psychology .
When I first took my steps into the Leather Community here in San Francisco , I was fortunate to be taken under the wings of some wonderful people , many of whom I am proud to call my friends to this day .
After attending and meeting some of the Big Kids at a Munch , I was invited to a kinky Truth or Dare party .
I was a little apprehensive .
See , I had still never attended a play party , let alone done a scene , but I thought I could handle this sort of event .
It is a game night , right ?
What could possibly happen ?
The event was casual , in a private residence , with snacks and people sitting in a living room chatting and schmoozing .
The game was played in the standard way .
People are called out around the circle , and are able to choose whether or not they wish to reveal a personal truth , or take a dare .
Not really knowing what to expect , I stuck to “ Truths ” for the first round .
My query was along the lines of “ When did you have your first SM experience ? ”
Since I had nothing else to go on , I replied by telling about The Musician , and our stunning affair , and how that altered my perception of what I needed from a relationship .
In theory , at least .
At the end of the round , there was only one person left .
He was an imposing looking man , who I did n’t know personally but had seen at a Munch once .
He was quite clearly a top .
From his cool blue … or … grey…eyes ( I could n’t maintain eye contact for a sufficient duration to ascertain the precise shade ) to his black leather vest to the buckle on his engineers boots , he was totally intimidating me .
Which was unnerving .
He hardly seemed to blink .
He sat quietly , arms folded , through the entire round .
Seemed
No one wanted to truth OR dare him .
So who gets stuck with the last query ?
Of course , it was I .
“ So , d’ya want a Truth or a Dare ? ”
He smiled , a small and enigmatic curl of the lip and said
“ I ’ll take a dare , please . ”
Oh , I was totally nonplussed .
I stared wildly around at the group .
“ OK , Help me out you guys !!
What should I dare him ??! ”
They were less than helpful .
I tried to think of something fairly innocuous , since I was quite certain that he ’d never do anything outrageous or silly .
Thank the goddess for the voices in my head !
“ OK , well , why do n’t you get someone in this room to kneel in front of you . ”
There .
Simple enough .
There was a scoff from across the circle .
A striking looking female top was laughing at me .
“ OK , so kneel in front of him and …?
What …? ”
Oy vey ish meir … it never ends with you people !
“ Um …and kiss your boots . ”
He nodded slowly , looking at me rather pointedly .
“ All right then .
Come over here and kiss my boots . ”
I looked around
“ ME ???
You ca n’t pick me !
I gave you the dare !!! ”
There was a consultation with the host .
The ruling came down , and indeed I was completely eligible for this dare .
Nice .
Well , I did n’t want to wuss out .
And besides , I did n’t have to do it !
The dare was that he GET someone to do it !
I smiled cockily .
“ OK .
So I accept . ”
He stared levelly at me .
“ Kneel here and kiss my boots . ”
I giggled “ Nope ! ”
Everyone laughed .
Except for him .
The laughter dimmed to smiles from everyone .
Everyone except him .
The laughter died away totally as he sat stone still for a minute ………..
……….. then two .
His stare was making me terribly uncomfortable , so I looked away .
He rose quietly from his chair and crossed to where I was sitting .
I could n’t look up ; I could feel him watching me and I was entirely intimidated .
Dammit ! FUCK .
Why was I so squirrelly ?!?!
“ I am going to ask you one more time ….
Kneel and kiss my boots . ”
I stared at my hands .
My throat was dry …
“ No … thank … you… ? ” I whispered .
He waited ; a long moment … and then he stood back a step .
“ Stand up , ”
And before he was even done speaking I was on my feet .
Um .
“ Well….shit…OK … ” I thought to myself “ … if I am standing , I am further away from the floor , so this should be all right … .
What ’s he gonna do , throw me to the ground ? ”
Hm .
That , at least , would have been much easier to defend against .
He leaned close to me .
Fingers curling around to the back of my neck he pulled me close and whispered in my ear .
Quietly .
As he whispered the words became one long stream of sound that I could not fully understand .
There were the words , there was the sensation of his breath in my ear there was his hand on my neck and …
He pulls my head back , tipping my face so that I am looking into his eyes again .
Blinking .
I was just waking up , I had been asleep , and my legs could n’t hold me up anymore .
What was I doing standing ?
Why was n’t I on my knees ?
I almost sank directly to the floor but thought I should wait …he had n’t told me to .
He stepped back .
“ Are you ready ? ”
I nodded once , mute .
“ Then kneel . ”
I sank to my knees , almost relieved .
Again , I started to move to kiss his boots , but something made me pause .
I heard his voice from somewhere above me , earthquake aftershock rocking my unsteady foundations .
“ Now , you may kiss my boots . ”
I leaned forward , pressing my lips against the warm leather , inhaling their smell , and feeling the grain of the hide against my mouth .
First the right then the left , then I sat back on my heels .
After a moment , I folded my arms behind my back , one on top of the other , stared at the floor , and waited .
It just felt like …the thing to do .
The room was dense with silence .
No one even moved .
Finally …
His hand on my shoulder , guiding me to my feet .
His arms around me , a quick friendly hug .
He smiled .
“ Are you OK ? ” He asked .
I nodded , then promptly sat down on the arm of a chair , awkwardly cracking the hell out of my butt , and almost fell over .
Our host cleared his throat “ Er , on that note … why do n’t we take a break … ”
I ran outside .
I needed a cigarette .
Three women followed me down the stairs and out into the cold .
I forgot my jacket .
Did n’t need it .
I was sweating .
My fingers nerveless as I lit the cigarette , still dazed .
“ Ohmigod , that was one of the hottest scenes I have EVER witnessed !! ”
I turned , exhaling slowly and watching the smoke curl and disappear
“ That was n’t a scene .
He barely even touched me . ”
They all smiled knowingly , the initiated , amused by the hubris of the uninitiated newbie .
“ Oh , yes , that was a scene .
And wow , the energy you guys had …what did he say to you ?
I ’m dying of curiosity ! ! ”
I shook my head .
“ I ca n’t remember .
He just sort of …explained to me that I wanted to do that for him , that I was safe … I dunno .
It was …. ”
What it was was yet another beginning .
He offered me a ride home after the party .
And yes , I said “ Yes , ” and watched the ripples begin to spread .
PLASTIC OUTRAGE - CHILDREN IN DANGER
By Byron J. Richards , CCN
October 8 , 2008
NewsWithViews.com
Americans once again get to watch , as industry - friendly managers at the FDA drag their feet while the health of tens of millions of American infants and children is in high danger .
Consumer protection groups , like the Environmental Working Group , are sounding alarm bells .
The international community is outraged , and the October 2008 issue of Environmental Research has published six articles on the serious risk of plastic toxicity to human health , describing what it calls “ A Plastic World . ”
One of the many toxic plastic - based chemicals of concern is called Bisphenol A , or BPA for short .
The Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) sets the “ safe ” level for this toxin .
The EPA , like the FDA , is in crisis .
Many EPA scientists have left or been forced out when they voice concerns .
Oftentimes safe levels for chemicals are based on industry - friendly amounts , not levels for safety of human health .
The perchlorate debacle , a thyroid - disrupting chemical that is currently injuring millions of infants across the U.S. , is another example of good scientists at the EPA being muzzled by management and the Bush administration so that the military wo n’t be forced to clean up a 50 billion dollar problem .
( Fight for Your Health , Chapter 13 , How the Military has Poisoned Our Water . )
Last month the Journal of the American Medical Association published a study of 1400 adults and found that those with the most BPA in their urine had nearly three times the risk of heart disease , more than twice the risk of diabetes , as well as signs of liver damage .
Unfortunately , the levels of BPA that were associated with disease are within the EPA ’s industry - friendly levels of “ safety . ”
The researchers stated “ Widespread and continuous exposure to BPA , primarily through food but also through drinking water , dental sealants , dermal exposure , and inhalation of household dusts , is evident from the presence of detectable levels of BPA in more than 90 % of the U.S. population .
Most studies of the health effects of BPA have focused on well - documented estrogenic activity , but reports have highlighted additional modes of action , including liver damage , disrupted pancreatic ß- cell function , thyroid hormone disruption , and obesity - promoting effects … .
[ Our ] findings add to the evidence suggesting adverse effects of low - dose BPA . ”
The FDA finds itself in an all too familiar and uncomfortable position of sitting on the crisis hot seat , yet one more distraction for Commissioner Andrew von Eschenbach .
He took the top job at the FDA so he could speed new and dangerous biotech cancer drugs onto the market with even less testing for safety or effectiveness ( favors for his many friends in the cancer industry ) .
Von Eschenbach ’s purpose has been plagued by a never - ending stream of drug frauds and dangers , as well as various food safety debacles .
It should be pretty obvious to everyone that safety of the American public is very low on the FDA management ’s list of priorities , a problem decades old that really took a turn south in 1992 when Clinton put through legislation that allowed Big Pharma to fund the FDA ( funding the Senate and House approved and expanded last year ) .
Von Eschenbach is carrying forward the Bush doctrine of health , which means that citizens of the United States should have no legal recourse when they are injured by drugs .
The Supreme Court is likely to rule on this issue next month ( preemption ) , and has indicated so far it is likely to side with the FDA ( part of the Bush legacy ) .
Let ’s be clear , the FDA is little more than a police force bully to natural health and consumer legal rights , while acting primarily as an economic gatekeeper for industry and its various economic problems .
Safety – what safety ?
Under consumer demand the FDA was forced to take a position on BPA and recently declared in the face of a mountain of negative evidence that “ products containing BPA currently on the market are safe and that exposure levels ... are below those that may cause health effects . ”
To reach this decision the FDA appeared to rely on two studies funded by plastic manufacturers , ignoring hundreds of negative studies .
The release of the alarming JAMA study in September was timed for an FDA Advisory Panel that is to review the issue further .
The release of the six new studies in Environmental Research this month is also targeted to pressure the FDA .
“ Not only are these studies of scientific importance , they also contribute to the ongoing U.S. congressional hearings involving the Food and Drug Administration , ” remarked Gert - Jan Geraeds , Publisher of Environmental Research , “ As such , “ The Plastic World ” has a broader societal impact and raises awareness of increasingly important environmental issues . ”
Why Is n’t the FDA Taking Action ?
In a crisis situation the FDA acts first to protect the economic interests of those who are causing harm .
The FDA knows that if it dictates something should be removed from the market it will open a floodgate of lawsuits .
The FDA is employing a time - tested tactic for allowing its friends in industry to escape most legal responsibility and overwhelming damage claims , while actually maintaining their profits while they continue to injure .
This is how the strategy works .
It is based on how Monsanto escaped most financial and legal responsibility for contaminating the world with PCBs .
The general idea is for the company , in this case Monsanto , to acknowledge certain aspects of the problem , tighten restrictions , and continue to manufacture .
A legion of lawyers - for - hire is set up to create confusion and deflect iron - clad proof away from the offending substance as the cause of anything .
Profits are continued while liability declines , which enabled Monsanto to keep making money for several decades and to never have to spend the 50 – 100 billion to clean up the U.S. , a serious health problem that persists to this day for all Americans .

Monsanto was able to keep its liabilities to a minimum .
It has gone through corporate metamorphosis by selling off all its chemical business to escape the future liability if Americans ever wise up .
Monsanto is now only in the Frankenfood business ( another public health catastrophe of magnitude ) .
We also recently saw the FDA , under the leadership of Von Eschenbach , employ this very same strategy to bail out the German company Bayer .
Bayer was caught red - handed knowingly killing thousands of Americans with its heart by - pass drug Trasylol .
The FDA dragged its feet for close to two years and eventually Bayer withdrew the drug on its own ( obviously because the FDA would have been forced to remove it ) .
Criminal executive behavior at Bayer , resulting in the deaths of many unsuspecting Americans , was met with an FDA wrist slap .
While Bayer will face many lawsuits over Trasylol , its lawyers - for - hire will seek to drag problems out for decades and limit liability to a fraction of what would have happened if the FDA pulled the drug from the market when it was clear the drug was killing Americans .
As a Sixty Minutes expose on Trasylol concluded , at least 20,000 Americans lost their lives while the FDA dragged its feet in defense of Bayer .
Of course , if the FDA has its way these suits would soon become illegal to file .
In the case of the FDA it always drags its feed based on the excuse it needs more data or studies , which is how it provides cover for a company in trouble .
The FDA is now in crisis mode on plastics .
Its mantra is “ industry first , consumer last . ”
The only thing that fazes the FDA is massive public outcry and media scrutiny of their ineptitude to protect Americans .
What Are the Dangers in Plastics ?
The overall problem is that many chemicals within plastic can be released from the plastic .
In some cases this causes direct exposure damage , as is the case with infants and children .
Another angle on the problem is that these chemicals massively pollute our oceans , are getting into the food supply as well as adversely affecting many species of life , and are accumulating in our groundwater .
BPA is one of a number of plastic - related chemicals of concern , with around 7 billion pounds a year of production causing widespread contamination of planet Earth .
BPA is used to harden plastics so they are shatterproof .
BPA is also part of a resin used to coat the inside of canned foods and can leach into the food .
BPA is a fat - soluble neurotoxin and hormone disrupter , meaning that it crosses the blood brain barrier and causes nerve damage while upsetting the metabolic applecart .
Primate studies clearly show it causes a loss of cognitive function and memory .
Exposure in infants and children may cause permanent damage to their developing nervous system .
Our government gives the following tips for reducing BPA exposure :
• Do n’t microwave polycarbonate plastic food containers .
Polycarbonate may break down from overuse at high temperatures and release BPA .
( Manufacturers are not required to disclose whether an item contains BPA , but polycarbonate containers that do usually have a No. 7 on the bottom . )
• Reduce use of canned foods , especially acidic foods such as tomatoes that can accelerate leaching of BPA from plastic can linings .
Opt for soups , vegetables and other items packaged in cardboard “ brick ” cartons , made of safer layers of aluminum and polyethylene plastic ( labeled No. 2 ) .
• Switch to glass , porcelain or stainless - steel containers , particularly for hot food or liquids .
• Use baby bottles that are BPA - free ; in the past year , most major manufacturers have developed bottles made without BPA .
Another dangerous chemical called PBDEs ( polybrominated diphenyl ethers ) is widely used in fire retardants and electronics .
It is used in many plastic toys and children ’s clothing .
A single exposure , in monkeys , can cause permanent brain damage .
It is a very close cousin of Monsanto ’s PCBs .
Exposure directly disturbs the thyroid gland , one more factor contributing to world - wide obesity and poor cognitive development .
A recent small study showed that children have 3 times the level of PBDEs in their blood as their mothers .

DAMASCUS ( Reuters ) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy warned Iran on Thursday it was taking a dangerous gamble in seeking to develop nuclear weapons because one day its arch - foe Israel could strike .
France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy speaks during news conference at the end of the Damascus Summit September 4 , 2008 .

Western powers accuse Iran of seeking the atom bomb under the cover of a civilian nuclear program but Tehran denies the charge , insisting it only wants to master atomic technology in order to generate electricity .
The United States and Israel have not ruled out military action if the dispute cannot be settled through diplomacy .
“ Iran is taking a major risk in continuing the process to obtain a military nuclear capacity , ” Sarkozy told a meeting in Damascus with the leaders of Syria , Turkey and Qatar .
“ One day , whatever the Israeli government , we could find one morning that Israel has struck , ” Sarkozy added .
“ The question is not whether it would be legitimate , whether it would be intelligent .
What will we do at that moment ?
It would be a catastrophe .
We must avoid that catastrophe , ” Sarkozy told the meeting in comments broadcast on television .
Speculation about a possible attack on Iran ’s nuclear facilities has risen since Israel staged an air force exercise in June which was reported to be a simulation of a strike against Iran .
“ WEST FRIGHTENED ”
The French president has asked Syrian President Bashar al - Assad to help resolve the standoff with Iran , a close ally of Syria , and Assad has pledged to help seek a solution .
“ The solution is to find a mechanism to prove that this nuclear program is a peaceful program , ” Assad told France 2 television in an interview , adding that he understood why the West was worried about the idea of Iran getting the bomb .
“ Of course the West is frightened .
We do n’t want the nuclear bomb in the Middle East , ” he said .
The U.N. Security Council has imposed three rounds of sanctions against Iran over its failure to heed calls to suspend uranium enrichment , a process that can produce fuel for power plants or , potentially , nuclear weapons .
Sarkozy repeated his call on Iran to halt enrichment and said Tehran should accept stricter inspections by the U.N. nuclear watchdog , the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
“ If Iran continues enrichment , that is a problem .
But IAEA checks should at least take place in a complete manner .
Then ( Iran ’s ) good faith would be established , ” he said .
Iran is in talks with the IAEA on improving its cooperation with the agency , but Sarkozy did not say what “ complete ” inspections would be in his view .
Tehran has also so far failed to respond to a sweetened offer of incentives by France , Britain , Germany , the United States , Russia and China aimed at persuading it , initially , to freeze expansion of its nuclear work .

But the van 's singular quality was n't the paint job .
This was a pot-powered vehicle -- a " Hempmobile . "
In the tank were four gallons of KeroGreen , a fuel made from hemp seed oil , donated by a man in Ohio .
Organized by the Alaska Green Party and Hemp 2000 , the trip in the alternatively powered van was aimed at bringing attention to an initiative to legalize marijuana in Alaska , and to the campaign of Anna Young , a Green party candidate running against U.S. Rep.
Don Young .
( The two are not related . )
Anna Young donated the van , a 1985 Ford Econoline with 75,000 miles that she has used for her campaign .
A former gillnetter , Young said she has crusaded for alternative fuels since the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill destroyed her commercial fishing business in Prince William Sound .
" The spill ruined my family , " she said .
" I want options .
If I have to go to Washington , D.C. to get those to happen , I will . "
She drove to Wasilla hoping to convince Mayor Sarah Palin that she was wrong to introduce a city council resolution opposing Proposition 5 , which would legalize pot use in Alaska for adults in private places and also legalize growing industrial hemp for products such as fuel .
Joining
Young was her mother , two members of the Hemp 2000 campaign -- R.L Marcy and Don Hart -- and a man who would identify himself only as Rob , a biodiesel engineer and a biology student at the University of Alaska Anchorage .
Of all people , Palin should know the difficulty of enforcing current pot laws , Young said .
" I know where all the pot comes from , " Young said .
" I know where fishermen get their marijuana .
They get it from Wasilla . "
The group spent nearly an hour with Palin in her office .
They handed her brochures and pamphlets about hemp , and gave her gifts , including a pair of hemp gloves and a hemp necklace .
They also handed out a box of hemp - flower candies made in Switzerland , which tasted about like one might expect a honey - flavored hemp lozenge to taste .
Growing hemp in Alaska could bring in thousands of jobs , Hart told Palin .
People could use it to make paper and clothes and fuel , even fish food .
" It 's a perfect food to feed fish fry , " he said .
Palin , who has admitted to inhaling as a young woman , said little .
But she repeatedly asked why , if the goal was growing hemp for clothing , did the group write the initiative to make it legal to smoke marijuana to get high ?
They had to write it that way , Hart said .
Otherwise farmers would be required to test their crops to prove it was n't the type of marijuana people smoke for pleasure .
The cost of testing would make industrial hemp unprofitable , he said .
Palin remained unmoved .
She said later she thought growing hemp for clothing and fuel were side issues .
" Those do n't really have anything to do with the foundation of what the initiative is , " she said .
But even if Young did n't convince Palin , she considered the trip a success .
The van ran smoothly and appeared to get about 20 miles per gallon on the hemp fuel , which is about what it usually gets , she said .
It smelled better too , she said .

" I do n't know what yardstick Senator McCain uses , but where I come from , there is nothing more ' fundamental ' than a job .
The fundamentals of our economy are not strong and it's time we had a President who understands that . "
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Obama also explains his vote in favor of the " rescue plan " last night , and calls this crisis the " final verdict " on trickle - down economics and deregulation .
Transcript of the entire speech ( available here ) below the fold
The events of the last few weeks have shown us that the stakes in this election could not be higher .
We are in a financial crisis as serious as any we 've faced since the Great Depression .
In recent weeks , we 've seen our financial landscape shift before our eyes .
We 've seen a growing credit crunch put new pressures on banks , businesses , and families .
And on Monday , we saw the single largest decline of the stock market in two decades - a decline that threatens not just the wealth of Wall Street executives , but the life savings , jobs , and economic security of millions of ordinary Americans .
Everywhere you look , the economic news is troubling .
But for so many of you here in Michigan , it is n't really news at all .
600,000 jobs have been lost since the year began , including about 30,000 in Michigan .
The unemployment rate here in Grand Rapids and other parts of this state is nearly double what it is across this country .
And a new jobs report is coming out tomorrow that experts predict will show our ninth straight month of job loss .
Nine straight months of job loss !
Yet , just the other week , John McCain said the " fundamentals of the economy are strong . "
Well , I do n't know what yardstick Senator McCain uses , but where I come from , there 's nothing more fundamental than a job .
And when we 're losing jobs month after month after month , when good , hard - working Americans who 've done everything right watch their dreams slip away , the fundamentals of our economy are not strong , and it 's time we had a President who understands that .
But it 's not just jobs .
Home values are falling .
Wages are flat - lining .
And the cost of everything from gas to groceries is going up and up .
These are the quiet storms that our families have been facing for months if not years , and these are the storms that will only grow worse if we do not act - and act now - to pass the rescue plan that 's before Congress .
Democrats and Republicans in the House need to do what the Senate did last night and do what 's right for this country .
If the financial markets collapse , and loans are not available , businesses , large and small , will follow .
It 's your jobs , your savings , your ability to pursue your dreams for your children that are at risk .
That 's why we have to act .
That 's why we have to set aside the politics of the moment and exercise something we have n't seen in Washington lately - responsibility .
Now , let me be perfectly clear .
The fact that we are in this mess is an outrage .
It 's an outrage because we did not get here by accident .
This was not a normal part of the business cycle .
This did not happen because of a few bad apples .
This financial crisis is a direct result of the greed and irresponsibility that has dominated Washington and Wall Street for years .
It 's the result of speculators who gamed the system , regulators who looked the other way , and lobbyists who bought their way into our government .
It 's the result of an economic philosophy that says we should give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else ; a philosophy that views even the most common - sense regulations as unwise and unnecessary .
Well , this crisis is nothing less than a final verdict on this failed philosophy - and it's a philosophy I 'm running for President to end .
That 's what this election is all about .
Because despite my opponent 's best efforts to make you think otherwise , this is the philosophy he 's embraced during his twenty - six years in Washington .
Over the past few days , he 's talked a lot about getting tough on Wall Street , but over the past few decades , he 's fought against the very rules of the road that could 've stopped this mess .
He says he 'll take on corporate lobbyists now , but he put seven of the biggest lobbyists in Washington in charge of his campaign .
And if you think those lobbyists are working day and night to elect him just to put themselves out of business , well I 've got a bridge to sell you up in Alaska .
The truth is , my opponent 's philosophy is n't just wrong - headed , it reveals how out of touch he really is .
How else could he offer $ 200 billion in tax cuts for big corporations at a time like this ?
How else could he propose giving the average Fortune 500 CEO a $ 700,000 tax cut at a time when millions of Americans are struggling to pay their bills ?
How else could he come up with an economic plan that leaves out more than 100 million middle class families at the very moment they need help most ?
Senator McCain just does n't get it .
Well , Michigan , you and I do get it .
That 's why we 're here today .
We know the next four years do n't have to look like the last eight .
We know we can steer ourselves out of this crisis .
Because that 's who we are .
Because this is America .
We 're a nation that 's faced down war and depression ; great challenges and great threats .
And at each and every moment , we 've risen to meet these challenges because we 've never forgotten that fundamental truth - that here , in this country , our destiny is not written for us ; it 's written by us .
It 's time to take our destiny into our own hands and reclaim our economic future .
Part of what that means is passing the rescue plan that 's before Congress .
I know many people were outraged when this administration initially asked the American people to sign a blank check to solve this crisis .
I was outraged too .
That 's why I fought to make sure the rescue plan protects taxpayers , provides oversight and accountability , helps struggling homeowners stay in their homes , and does n't reward the Wall Street executives whose greed and irresponsibility led us to this perilous moment .
While these taxpayer protections are now part of the rescue plan , this plan still is n't perfect .
But it 's what we must do to prevent a crisis from turning into a catastrophe .
But understand , even with this plan , we may face a long and difficult road to recovery .
That is why , if I'm President , passing this rescue plan wo n't be the end of what we do to strengthen our economy , it 'll be the beginning .
It 'll be the beginning of a long - term rescue plan for our middle class - a plan that will create millions of new jobs ; help families keep up with rising costs ; relieve the burden of crushing health care costs ; and educate the next generation of Americans with the skills and knowledge to compete with any workers , anywhere in the world .
Now , people have asked whether the size of the plan that Congress is voting on , together with the weakening economy , means that the next President will have to scale back his agenda and some of his proposals .
And there 's no doubt that some programs or policies that I 've proposed on the campaign trail may require more time to achieve .
But I reject the idea that you can't build a strong middle class at a time when our economy is weak .
I believe that building a strong middle class is the key to making our economy strong .
And that 's what we 'll do when I'm President of the United States .
To create new jobs , we 'll not only invest in rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges , and our outdated electricity grid - we 'll strengthen the auto industry that built the middle class in this country .
A number of auto companies are showing real leadership in building fuel - efficient cars , and I applaud them for it .
But I refuse to accept that Washington has to stand idly by while foreign automakers outpace us .
I 'm running for President to make sure the cars of the future are made in the same place they 've always been made - right here in Michigan .
I 'll be a President who finally keeps the promise that 's made year after year by providing the funding our automakers need to retool their factories and make fuel - efficient and alternative fuel cars and trucks .
And as we fight to reverse the decline in manufacturing over the last eight years , we 'll also bring manufacturing into the 21st century by building an American green energy sector .
We 'll invest $ 150 billion over the next decade in affordable , renewable sources of energy - wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels ; an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and can't ever be outsourced .
Because the fight for American manufacturing is the fight for America 's future - and I believe that 's a fight this country will win .
I will also reform our tax code so that it does n't reward the lobbyists who wrote it , but the American workers and small businesses who deserve it .
I will eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses and start - ups , so that we can grow our economy and create the high - wage , high - tech jobs of tomorrow .
I will cut taxes - cut taxes - for 95 % of all working families .
My opponent does n't want you to know this , but under my plan , tax rates will actually be less than they were under Ronald Reagan .
If you make less than $ 250,000 a year , you will not see your taxes increase one single dime .
In fact , I offer three times the tax relief for middle - class families as Senator McCain does - because in an economy like this , the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle - class .
I will reform our health care system so we can relieve families , businesses , and our economy from the crushing cost of health care by investing in new technology and preventative care .
If you have health care , my plan will lower your premiums .
If you do n't , you 'll be able to get the same kind of coverage that members of Congress give themselves .
And we 'll reduce costs for business and their workers by picking up the tab for some of the most expensive illnesses and conditions - because that 's how we 'll make our companies more competitive in the 21st century .
And if I am President , I will meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world - class education , because it will take nothing less to compete in the global economy .
I 'll invest in early childhood education .
I 'll recruit an army of new teachers , and pay them higher salaries and give them more support .
But in exchange , I will ask for higher standards and more accountability .
And we will keep our promise to every young American - if you commit to serving your community or your country , we will make sure you can afford a college education .
Finally , I will modernize our outdated financial regulations and put in place the common - sense rules of the road I 've been calling for since March - rules that will keep our market free , fair , and honest ; rules that will restore accountability and responsibility in the boardroom , and make sure Wall Street can never get away with the stunts that caused this crisis again .
But just as we demand accountability on Wall Street , we must also demand it in Washington .
Because we cannot afford another four years of the kind of deficits we 've seen during the past eight .
We cannot afford to mortgage our children 's future on another mountain of debt .
That 's why I 'm not going to stand here and simply tell you what I 'm going to spend , I 'm going to tell you how we 're going to save when I am President .
I will go through the entire federal budget , page by page , line by line , and eliminate programs that do n't work and are n't needed .
We 'll start by ending a war in Iraq that 's costing $ 10 billion a month while the Iraqi government sits on a $ 79 billion surplus .
And we 'll save billions of dollars by shutting the overseas tax havens that let companies avoid paying taxes here in America .
And as for those programs we do need , I 'll make them work better and cost less .
We 'll save billions by cutting waste , improving management , and strengthening oversight .
And I will finally end the abuse of no - bid contracts once and for all - the days of sweetheart deals for Halliburton will be over when I 'm in the White House .
These are the changes and reforms that we need .
A new era of responsibility and accountability on Wall Street and in Washington .
Common - sense regulations to prevent a crisis like this from ever happening again .
Investments in the technology and innovation that will restore prosperity and lead to new jobs and a new economy for the 21st century .
Bottom - up growth that will create opportunity for every American .
I wo n't pretend this will be easy or come without cost .
We will all need to sacrifice and we will all need to pull our weight because now more than ever , we are all in this together .
What this crisis has taught us is that at the end of the day , there is no real separation between Main Street and Wall Street .
There is only the road we 're traveling on as Americans - and we will rise or fall on that journey as one nation ; as one people .
This country and the dream it represents are being tested in a way that we have n't seen in nearly a century .
And future generations will judge ours by how we respond to this test .
Will they say that this was a time when America lost its way and its purpose ?
When we allowed our own petty differences and broken politics to plunge this country into a dark and painful recession ?
Or will they say that this was another one of those moments when America overcame ?
When we battled back from adversity by recognizing that common stake that we have in each other 's success ?
This is one of those moments .
I realize you 're cynical and fed up with politics .
I understand that you 're disappointed and even angry with your leaders .
You have every right to be .
But despite all of this , I ask of you what 's been asked of the American people in times of trial and turmoil throughout our history .
I ask you to believe - to believe in yourselves , in each other , and in the future we can build together .
Because together , we can not fail .
Not now .
Not when we have a crisis to solve and an economy to save .
Not when there are so many Americans without jobs and without homes .
Not when there are families who can't afford to see a doctor , or send their child to college , or pay their bills at the end of the month .
Not when there is a generation that is counting on us to give them the same opportunities and the same chances that we had for ourselves .
We can do this .
Americans have done this before .
Some of us had grandparents or parents who said maybe I can't go to college but my child can ; maybe I can't have my own business but my child can .
I may have to rent , but maybe my children will have a home they can call their own .
I may not have a lot of money but maybe my child will run for Senate .
I might live in a small village but maybe someday my son can be president of the United States of America .
Now it falls to us .
Together , we can not fail .
And I need you to make it happen .
If you want the next four years looking just like the last eight , then I am not your candidate .
But if you want real change - if you want an economy that rewards work , and that works for Main Street and Wall Street ; if you want tax relief for the middle class and millions of new jobs ; if you want health care you can afford and education that helps your kids compete ; then I ask you to knock on some doors , make some calls , talk to your neighbors , and give me your vote on November 4th .
And if you do , I promise you - we will win Michigan , we will win this election , and then you and I - together - will change this country and change this world .
Thank you ,
God bless you , and may God bless America .
Well , they ’re black , and they ’re like bottomless holes .
What would you call them ?
- Me , when a friend asked me why they ’re named what they are
Ah , black holes .
The ultimate shiver - inducer of the cosmos , out - jawing sharks , out - ooking spiders , out - scaring … um , something scary .
But we ’re fascinated by ’em , have no doubt — even if we do n’t understand a whole lot about them .
But then , that ’s why I ’m here .
Allow me to be your tour guide to infinity .
Or the inverse of it , I suppose .
Since it ’s Halloween this seems appropriate … and my book Death from the Skies !
just came out , and there ’s lots of ways a black hole can destroy the Earth .
Mwuhahahaha .
So below I present ten facts about black holes — the third in my series of Ten Things You Do n’t Know ( the first was on the Milky Way ; the second about the Earth ) .
Regular readers will know a few of these since I ’ve talked about them before , but I ’m hoping you do n’t know all of these .
And if you do , then feel free to leave a comment preening about your superior intellect .
Mind you , this list is nowhere near complete : I could have picked probably 50 things that are weird about black holes .
But I like these .
1 . It ’s not their mass , it ’s their size that makes them so strong .
OK , first , a really quick primer on black holes .
Bear with me !
The most common way for a black hole to form is in the core of a massive star .
The core runs out of fuel , and collapses .
This sets off a shockwave , blowing up outer layers of the star , causing a supernova .
So the star ’s heart collapses while the rest of it explodes outwards ( this is the Cliff ’s notes version ; for more details on the process — which is way cool , so you should read it — check out my description of it ) .
As the core collapses , its gravity increases .
At some point , if the core is massive enough ( about 3 times the mass of the Sun ) , the gravity gets so strong that right at the surface of the collapsing core the escape velocity increases to the speed of light .
That means that nothing can escape the gravity of this object , not even light .
So it ’s black .
And since nothing can escape , well , read the quotation at the top of the page .
The region around the black hole itself where the escape velocity equals the speed of light is called the event horizon .
Any event that happens inside it is forever invisible .
OK , so now you know what one is , and how they form .
Now , I could explain why they have such strong gravity , but you know what ?
I ’d rather let this guy do it .
I hear he ’s good .
So there you go .
Sure , the mass is important , but sometimes it ’s the little things that count .
2 . They ’re not infinitely small .
So OK , they ’re small , but how small are they ?
I was writing about black holes in my previous job , and we got in a fun discussion over just what we meant by black hole : did we mean the object itself that collapses down to a mathematical point , or the event horizon surrounding it ?
I said the event horizon , but my boss said it was the object .
I decided she had a point ( HAHAHAHAHA ! A " point " !
Man , I kill me ) , and made sure that when I wrote about the event horizon versus the black hole itself I was making myself clear .
Like I said above , to the collapsing core , its clock keeps ticking , so it sees itself collapsing all the way down to a point , even if the event horizon has some finite size .
What happens to the core ?
The actual mass that collapsed ?
Out here , we ’ll never know for sure .
We ca n’t see in , and it sure enough is n’t gonna send any info out .
But our math in these situations is pretty good , and we can at least apply them to the collapsing core , even when it ’s smaller than the event horizon .
It will continue to collapse , and the gravity increases .
Smaller , smaller … and when I was a kid I always read that it collapses all the way down to a geometric dot , an object with no dimensions at all .
That really bugged me , as you can imagine … as well it should .
Because it ’s wrong .
At some point , the collapsing core will be smaller than an atom , smaller than a nucleus , smaller than an electron .
It ’ll eventually reach a size called the Planck Length , a unit so small that quantum mechanics rules it with an iron fist .
A Planck Length is a kind of quantum size limit : if an object gets smaller than this , we literally cannot know much about it with any certainty .
The actual physics is complicated , but pretty much when the collapsing core hits this size , even if we could somehow pierce the event horizon , we could n’t measure its real size .
In fact , the term " real size " does n’t really mean anything at this kind of scale .
If the Universe itself prevents you from measuring it , you might as well say the term has no meaning .
And how small is a Planck Length ?
Teeny tiny : about 10 - 35 meters .
That ’s one one - hundred quintillionth the size of a proton .
So if someone says a black hole has zero size , you can be all geeky and technical and say , not really , but meh .
Close enough .
3 . They ’re spheres .
And they ’re definitely not funnel shaped .
The gravity you feel from an object depends on two things : the object ’s mass , and your distance from that object .
This means that anyone at a given distance from a massive object — say , a million kilometers — would feel the same force of gravity from it .
That distance defines a sphere around an object : anyone on that sphere ’s surface would feel the same gravity from the object at the center .
The size of an event horizon of a black hole depends on the gravity , so really the event horizon is a sphere surrounding the black hole .
From the outside , if you could figure out how to see the event horizon in the first place , it would look like a pitch black sphere .
Some people think of black holes as being circles , or worse , funnel - shaped .
The funnel thing is a misconception from people trying to explain gravity as a bending in space , and they simplify things by collapsing 3D space into 2D ; they say the space is like a bed sheet , and objects with mass bend space the same way that a massive object ( a bowling ball , say ) will warp a bed sheet .
But space is not 2D , it ’s 3D ( even 4D if you include time ) and so this explanation can confuse people about the actual shape of a black hole event horizon .
I ’ve had kids ask me what happens if you approach a black hole from underneath !
They sometimes do n’t get that black holes are spheres , and there is no underneath .
I blame the funnel story .
Sadly , it ’s the best analogy I ’ve seen , so we ’re stuck with it .
Use it with care .
4 . Black holes spin !
It ’s kind of an odd thought , but black holes can spin .
Stars rotate , and when the core collapses the rotation speeds way , way up ( the usual analogy is that of an ice skater who brings in his arms , increasing his rotation rate ) .
As the core of the star gets smaller it rotates more rapidly .
If it does n’t quite have enough mass to become a black hole , the matter gets squeezed together to form a neutron star , a ball of neutrons a few kilometers across .
We have detected hundreds of these objects , and they tend to spin very rapidly , sometimes hundreds of times a second !
The same is true for a black hole .
Even as the matter shrinks down smaller than the event horizon and is lost to the outside Universe forever , the matter is still spinning .
It ’s not entirely clear what this means if you ’re trying to calculate what happens to the matter once it ’s inside the event horizon .
Does centrifugal force keep it from collapsing all the way down to the Planck length ?
The math is fiendish , but do - able , and implies that matter falling in will hit matter inside the event horizon trying to fall further but unable to due to rotation , This causes a massive pile up and some pretty spectacular fireworks … that we ’ll never see , because its on the other side of infinity .
Bummer .
5 . Near a black hole , things get weird .
The spin of the black hole throws a monkey in the wrench of the event horizon .
Black holes distort the fabric of space itself , and if they spin that distortion itself gets distorted .
Space can get wrapped around a black hole — kind of like the fabric of a sheet getting caught up in a rotating drill bit .
This creates a region of space outside the event horizon called the ergosphere .
It ’s an oblate spheroid , a flattened ball shape , and if you ’re outside the event horizon but inside the ergosphere , you ’ll find you ca n’t sit still .
Literally .
Space is being dragged past you , and carries you along with it .
You can easily move in the direction of the rotation of the black hole , but if you try to hover , you can ’t .
In fact , inside the ergosphere space is moving faster than light !
Matter cannot move that fast , but it turns out , according to Einstein , space itself can .
So if you want to hover over a black hole , you ’d have to move faster than light in the direction opposite the spin .
You ca n’t do that , so you have to move with the spin , fly away , or fall in .
Those are your choices .
I suggest flying away .
Fast .
Because …
6 . Approaching a black hole can kill you in fun ways .
And by fun , I mean gruesome , horrifying , and really really ookie .
Sure , if you get too close , plop !
You fall in .
But even if you keep your distance you ’re still in trouble …
Gravity depends on distance .
The farther you are from an object , the weaker its gravity .
So if you have a long object near a massive one , the long object will feel a stronger gravitational force on the near end versus a weaker force on the far end !
This change in gravity over distance is called the tidal force ( which is a bit of a misnomer , it ’s not really a force , it ’s a differential force , and yes , it ’s related to why we have ocean tides on Earth from the Moon ) .
The thing is , black holes can be small — a BH with a mass of about three times the Sun has an event horizon just a few kilometers across — and that means you can get close to them .
And that in turn means that the tidal force you feel from one can get distressingly big .
Let ’s say you fall feet first into a stellar - mass BH .
It turns out that as you approach , the difference in gravity between your head and your feet can get huge .
HUGE .
The force can be so strong that your feet get yanked away from your head with hundreds of millions of times the force of Earth ’s gravity .
You ’d be stretched into a long , thin strand and then shredded .
Astronomers call this spaghettification .
Ewwww .
So getting near a black hole is dangerous even if you do n’t fall in .
Evidently , there really is a tide in the affairs of men .
Disk of DOOOOOM !

7 . Black holes are n’t always dark .
The thing is , black holes can kill from a long way off .
Matter falling into a black hole would rarely if ever just fall straight in and disappear .
If it has a little bit of sideways motion it ’ll go around the black hole .
As more matter falls in , all this junk can pile up around the hole .
Because of the way rotating objects behave , this matter will create a disk of material whirling madly around the hole , and because the gravity of the hole changes so rapidly with distance , matter close in will be orbiting much faster than stuff farther out .
This matter literally rubs together , generating heat through friction .
This stuff can get really hot , like millions of degrees hot .
Matter that hot glows with intense brightness … which means that near the black hole , this matter can be seriously luminous .
Worse , magnetic and other forces can focus two beams of energy that go plowing out of the poles of the disk .
The beams start just outside the black hole , but can be seen for millions or even billions of light years distant .
They ’re bright .
In fact , black holes that are eating matter in this way can glow so brightly that they become the brightest continuously - emitting objects in the Universe !
We call these active black holes .
And as if black holes are n’t dangerous enough , the matter gets so hot right before it makes the final plunge that it can furiously emit X - rays , high - energy forms of light ( and the beams can emit even higher energy light than that ) .
So even if you park your spaceship well outside the event horizon of a black hole , if something else falls in and gets shredded , you get rewarded by being fried by the equivalent of a gazillion dental exams .
I may have mentioned this : black holes are dangerous .
Best to stay away from them .
8 . Black holes are n’t always dangerous .
Having said that , let me ask you a question : if I were to take the Sun and replace it with Folgers crystals a black hole of the exact same mass , what would happen ?
Would the Earth fall in , be flung away , or just orbit like it always does ?
Most people think the Earth would fall in , sucked inexorably down by the black hole ’s powerful gravity .
But remember , the gravity you feel from an object depends on the mass of the object and your distance from it .
I said the black hole has the same mass as the Sun , remember ?
And the Earth ’s distance has n’t changed .
So the gravity we ’d feel from here , 150 million kilometers away , would be exactly the same !
So the Earth would orbit the solar black hole just as nicely as it orbits the Sun now .
Of course , we ’d freeze to death .
You ca n’t have everything .
9 . Black holes can get big .
Q : What happens if two stellar - mass black holes collide ?
A : You get one bigger black hole .
You can extrapolate from there .
Black holes can eat other objects , including other black holes , so they can grow .
We think that early on in the Universe , when galaxies were just forming , matter collecting in the center of the nascent galaxy can collapse to form a very massive black hole .
As more matter falls in , the hole greedily consumes it , and grows .
Eventually you get a supermassive black hole , one with millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun .
However , remember that as matter falls in it can get hot .
It can be so hot that the pressure from light itself can blow off material that ’s farther out , a bit like the solar wind but on a much grander scale .
The strength of the wind depends on many things , including the mass of the black hole ; the heftier the hole , the windier the , uh , wind .
This wind prevents more matter from falling in , so it acts like a cutoff valve for the ever - increasingly girthy hole .
Not only that , but over time the gas and dust around the black hole ( well , pretty far out , but still near the center of the galaxy ) gets turned into stars .
Gas can fall into a black hole more easily than stars ( if gas clouds collide head - on their motion relative to the black hole can stop , allowing them to fall in ; stars are too small and too far apart for this to happen ) .
So eventually the black hole stops consuming matter because nothing more is falling into it .
It stops growing , the galaxy becomes stable , and everyone is happy .
In fact , when we look into the Universe today , we see that pretty much every large galaxy has a supermassive black hole in its heart .
Even the Milky Way has a black hole at its core with a mass of four millions times that of the Sun .
Before you start running around in circles and screaming , remember this : 1 ) it ’s a long way off , 26,000 light years ( 260 quadrillion kilometers ) , 2 ) its mass is still very small compared to the 200 billion solar masses of our galaxy , and therefore 3 ) it ca n’t really harm us .
Unless it starts actively feeding .
Which it is n’t .
But it might start sometime , if something falls into it .
Though we do n’t know of anything that can fall into it soon .
But we might miss cold gas .
Hmmm .
Anyway , remember this as well : even though black holes can cause death and destruction on a major scale , they also help galaxies themselves form !
So we owe our existence to them .
10 .
Black holes can be low density .
Of all the weirdnesses about black holes , this one is the weirdest to me .
As you might expect , the event horizon of a black hole gets bigger as the mass gets bigger .
That ’s because if you add mass , the gravity gets stronger , which means the event horizon will grow .
If you do the math carefully , you find that the event horizon grows linearly with the mass .
In other words , if you double the black hole ’s mass , the event horizon radius doubles as well .
That ’s weird !
Why ?
The volume of a sphere depends on the cube of the radius ( think way back to high school : volume = 4/3 x π x radius3 ) .
Double the radius , and the volume goes up by 2 x 2 x 2 = 8 times .
Make the radius of a sphere 10 times bigger and the volume goes up by a factor of 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000 .
So volume goes up really quickly as you increase the size of a sphere .
Now imagine you have two spheres of clay that are the same size .
Lump them together .
Is the resulting sphere twice as big ?
No !
You ’ve doubled the mass , but the radius only increases a little bit .
Because volume goes as radius cubed , to double the radius of your final clay ball , you ’d need to lump together eight of them .
But that ’s different than a black hole .
Double the mass , double the size of the event horizon .
That has an odd implication …
Density is how much mass is packed into a given volume .
Keep the size the same and add mass , and the density goes up .
Increase the volume , but keep the mass the same , and the density goes down .
Got it ?
So now let ’s look at the average density of matter inside the event horizon of the black hole .
If I take two identical black holes and collide them , the event horizon size doubles , and the mass doubles too .
But volume has gone up by eight times !
So the density actually decreases , and is 1/4 what I started with ( twice the mass and eight times the volume gives you 1/4 the density ) .
Keep doing that , and the density decreases .
A regular black hole — that is , one with three times the Sun ’s mass — with have an event horizon radius of about 9 km .
That means it has a huge density , about two quadrillion grams per cubic cm ( 2 x 1015 ) .
But double the mass , and the density drops by a factor of four .
Put in 10 times the mass and the density drops by a factor of 100 .
A billion solar mass black hole ( big , but we see them this big in galaxy centers ) would drop that density by a factor of 1 x 1018 .
That would give it a density of roughly 1/1000 of a gram per cc… and that ’s the density of air !
A billion solar mass black hole would have an event horizon 3 billion km in radius — roughly the distance of Neptune to the Sun .
See where I ’m going here ?
If you were to rope off the solar system out past Neptune , enclose it in a giant sphere , and fill it with air , it would be a black hole !
That , to me , is by far the oddest thing about black holes .
Sure , they warp space , distort time , play with our sense of what ’s real and is n’t … but when they touch on the everyday and screw with that , well , that ’s what gets me .
I first thought of this at a black hole conference at Stanford a few years back .
I was walking with noted black hole expert Roger Blandford when it hit me .
I did a quick mental calculation to make sure I had the numbers right , and related to Roger that a solar system full of air would be a black hole .
He thought about it for a moment and said , " Yes , that sounds about right . "
And that , me droogs , was one of the coolest moments of my hole life .
But thinking about it still makes my brain hurt .
Conclusion
Well , what can I say ?
Black holes are weird .
As it so happens , there was a lot more that could be said about them , of course .
What about wormholes ?
What about how they form ? what about Hawking radiation ?
Can black holes totally evaporate ?
You can find answers to these and other questions elsewhere on the web ( and even on this very blog ) ; I could n’t cover everything in just ten sections !
But I ’ll note ( shocker ) that chapter 5 of my book Death from the Skies !
talks in detail about how they form , and what they can do if you get too close to them .
Later chapters also talk about the black hole in the core of the Milky Way , and what will happen to black holes a long time from now … literally , 1060 , 1070 , even a googol years from now .
But even then , that ’s not the scariest thing about black holes .
I almost did n’t put this in the post , it ’s so over the top mind - numbingly horrifying .
But I ’m a scientist , and we ’re skeptics here , so we can take it .
So I present to you , the worst thing about black holes of all :
Tom Hurndall , 21 , was a young , compassionate man when he went to Gaza in 2003 .
Months later , while he was rescuing Palestinian children from gunfire , he was shot by an Israeli army sniper .
On the eve of a Channel 4 film , his parents tell of their anger , loss , intense grief and political awakening as they sought to bring his killer to justice
This story begins with an ending .
On 11 April 2003 , Thomas Hurndall , a 21 - year - old photojournalist , was shot in the head in Gaza by a sniper from the Israeli army .
Tom was a brilliant , intrepid young man , driven by an energetic morality , a wish to make a difference in the world .
The shooting left him with unsurvivable brain damage , but he clung to life - against the odds - in a coma , for nine months .
While he lay dying in Tel Aviv and later in the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead , north London , his parents , Anthony and Jocelyn Hurndall , took on a heroic struggle against the Israeli army .
They were determined to seek truth and accountability at all costs .
They had no idea how hard this was going to be .
The Israeli army appeared to view Tom 's death with indifference ; there were no plans to investigate the shooting , interview witnesses or go to Gaza .
Nor , at first , were they willing to meet the Hurndalls .
Their claim was that their soldier had fired at an armed terrorist .
Tom , dressed in an orange jacket ( a known sign for peace workers ) , was unarmed .
What 's more he was shot while rescuing Palestinian children .
Faced with lies and silence , Anthony , a commercial lawyer , did the only thing he could : he took the case on himself .
It was his meticulous investigation that led to the prosecution of Bedouin sniper Sergeant Wahid Taysir , who got eight years ( the longest sentence ever received by an Israeli Defence Forces soldier for shooting an unarmed civilian in the occupied territories ) .
Vengeance was not Anthony 's motivation .
He wanted only to find out what had happened .
But the verdict was , in the bleakest way imaginable , a personal victory .
Jocelyn has told her story in a beautifully written , uncompromising book , My Son Tom ( Bloomsbury ) .
More riskily , Channel 4 has turned the story into a drama to be broadcast tomorrow : The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall , written by Simon Block and directed by Rowan Joffe .
Stephen Dillane plays Anthony and Kerry Fox plays Jocelyn .
The film manages to be neither sensational nor sentimental - quite a feat .
It is its understatement that overwhelms .
Anthony and Jocelyn divorced several years before Tom 's death and the film conveys the strained decency of their relationship and their admirable transcending of differences .
The three surviving children - Sophie , Bill and Fred - are carefully characterised , and what the film spells out is that the shooting of Tom was a shattering of the entire family .
Each of them took the impact of the sniper 's fire .
But I wondered if the film might have taken some emotional liberties too :
Anthony is seen to be all head , Jocelyn all heart .
And they are presented in rivalrous stances , as if we are being asked to choose between them .
Was it really like that ?
I met the Hurndalls separately : Anthony first , on a cold autumn day , in his offices near the Bank of England .
He is tall , with a shambling gait , and is absolutely direct .
You do n't feel any slipperiness , any side .
I liked him at once and admired his ability to talk with clarity about complicated issues .
At the same time , he often left sentences unfinished as if he lacked the will to complete them .
I noticed how often he leant back and shut his eyes when speaking , as if closing his eyes would have the opposite effect - make it possible to see .
For Anthony , the film is a ' further memorial ' to Tom .
But what matters most to him is that audiences should understand that what happened was ' not a freak accident , but a product of a policy that the Israeli armed forces were adopting in Gaza ' .
There is barely suppressed outrage in his voice as he remembers the British government 's failure to protest when Tom was shot :
' The government viewed Israel as a close ally who they did not want to put out in any way . '
It was only when a Tel Aviv bar was bombed by two British Muslims three weeks after the shooting of Tom in 2003 that Anthony became aware of how skewed the British government 's attitude could be .
' Jack Straw expressed deep sympathy to the Israelis and promised to put all the resources of the British government at their disposal .
This was our government taking responsibility for two people who were not employees of the British government , merely two citizens of Britain who happened to be in Israel . '
But when their own British citizens ( Tom , along with Iain Hook , a UN worker shot by an Israeli sniper in November 2002 , and James Miller , a documentary - maker shot by an IDF patrol in May 2003 ) were attacked by Israeli soldiers , there was no outcry ( no ministerial interest at all , beyond a standard request , from a junior level , for a proper inquiry ) .
' They were shot not by people for whom the Israeli government had no responsibility but by their own soldiers .
That , for me , was outrageous . '
Anthony approves of the film and thinks Dillane got a lot of things right .
But he resists the idea of himself as the ' dry lawyer ' .
He feels a ' little put out ' at a scene in which he is in a hurry to get back to the office while Jocelyn waits devotedly by Tom 's bedside : ' It was not like that . '
He finds Dillane 's Anthony ' more confident than I am .
I am much more uncertain about things . '
He admits he can switch gear into ' detached ' mode and adds : ' I do live in my head . '
But he wants it on record that ' there is a lot of emotion there ' .
I do n't doubt it .
The way he uses
Tom 's name as emotional shorthand reveals the strength of his feelings : ' When I heard that Tom had been shot , I felt angry and worried , but already I knew that if this had happened , this was Tom doing something which was Tom .
When we heard he had been going to rescue children - that was absolutely Tom .
He had this strong , protective urge - a tremendous feeling of caring about putting things right . '
It was Tom 's need to put things right that became , for Anthony , an unspoken direction , an imperative .
He remembers it like this : ' Tom , you are lying there .
This is what you want .
This is what we are going to do for you , Tom - with you . '
That ' with ' is affecting because the more accurate word would have been ' without ' .
Anthony describes
Tom as a little boy who was ' troubled ' , although ' outgoing ' , and ' determined to do his own thing ' .
He ' hated arrogance ' , intellectual or otherwise .
He was much loved because he was ' always there for people .
He would talk to anybody , on any level , about anything . '
Tom was 15 or 16 when his parents split up .
' Being the angry teenager he was , we did n't talk for a while , ' Anthony recalls .
But football ( Arsenal ) and photography were shared passions .
And by the time Tom left England in 2003 , 'we had re-established quite close bonds .
We were still a little aloof but much closer .
We discussed his preparations for the trip .
I remember talking about what he was going to do to keep safe . '
Tom also discussed the trip with his ' very closest friends , who happened to be Jewish ' .
But his attitude would have been : ' I want to find out for myself . '
It is painful listening to Anthony piecing together the past , trying to reconfigure his relationship with Tom before he died .
I suggest that it was remarkable that he and Jocelyn managed to work together with such dignity .
' There have been enormous stresses , ' he admits .
' Do n't be under any illusions about that , but I think we are now closer in many ways . '
Before I leave , I hear myself asking - I had n't meant to put it so baldly - how much Tom 's death has changed his life ?
' The whole experience has changed my view of life and of what is important , ' he answers .
He describes being ' in the City , in a bar , seeing people have a good time - it seems completely unreal ' .
He admits he has lost the taste for ' life 's pleasures ' .
' Work is what matters . '
Anthony 's work now is to create a forum for people to solve their legal difficulties outside the court .
He finds , in this good - hearted project , an af finity with Tom .
But he remains hard on himself .
He believes that because of Tom 's death : ' I am a lesser parent .
I do n't take the children on holidays . '
He bought some golf clubs : ' They have n't been out of the cupboard . '
He feels that Tom 's death has made him more spiritual : ' I used to read to Tom in intensive care .
I spent hours with him .
I read the Koran for the first time and Taoism .
It was a time for contemplation , working out what was important . '
Gaza , he explains , was ' so dramatic and powerful .
The best journalist cannot portray the reality of what is happening .
What is an Israeli - only road ?
What is a checkpoint ? '
He believes we have ' so little idea of what is happening ' .
Grief , he recognises , can make you see more keenly .
It has also made the political personal : ' I remember saying to someone [ about Gaza and the Middle Eastern conflict ] the Israelis can't say the problem is only theirs .
This is now our issue . '
Jocelyn Hurndall lives in Tufnell Park , north London .
She has a radiance that is immediately attractive .
But faces carry their recent emotional history and her grief is as indelible as a watermark .
She wonders whether we might sit in her garden .
It is a is lovely , peaceful , idiosyncratic place - a shrine of sorts .
I exclaim at the tiny , weeping silver birch at its centre : ' It was planted for Tom , ' she says .
' It 's going to make me cry . ' ' Do n't , ' I say .
' It 's doing your weeping for you . '
I feel an immediate rapport with this woman whose emotions , five years on , are still so close to the surface , so available to her .
In her book , she wrote : ' People know about death in the Middle East ... it is one of the things that gives life there its vibrancy .
In the West we are not forced to look death in the face in the same way - we barely acknowledge its existence .
We take our lives very much for granted . '
Tom 's death has changed that permanently : ' I never take my life for granted . '
She tells me : ' Tom valued the moment , the meaning of things .
I respect that .
It is what I have learnt from him . '
And after his death , she learnt that being able to ' meet the moment ' was an essential part of grieving too - not running away even from the most agonising details : the scent of Tom 's clothes , the look of his handwriting .
We talk about gardening , how it insists you live in the present ( but with an optimistic eye on the future ) .
Her hands , she says , have been roughened by it , but it has helped her heart .
Being able to garden is emotional progress for her .
' For a long while I could not look at anything beautiful - lichen , for example , that has taken a lifetime to grow on a stone .
I could n't look at the beauty of this world without thinking about what Tom had lost . '
The film conveys the profound alienation after Tom 's death - the shock of being pitched from London into a Middle East war zone .
Is n't grief itself like this ; does n't it bring with it a feeling of being in a foreign country , an attendant unreality ?
A sense of not being at home in your own skin ?
She agrees .
' Back then , even being with a group of friends felt foreign .
You were n't able to give anything back - and that was shocking .'
One insight in her book is that a family is seldom united by grief .
Mourning is an individual thing , a lonely road .
I can see ( as Jocelyn herself recognises ) that her emotional articulacy might not always have been easy for her family .
And it must have been hard for her too .
Looking back , she finds Anthony 's grieving ' completely different ' from hers because ' it was so far under the surface ' .
She says : ' My brain was shot .
He seemed to be able to use his . '
Her son Billy was different again .
He coped by completely rebuilding his little brother Fred 's room after Tom 's death , an awesome job for a boy with no formal carpenter 's training .
Jocelyn is still so proud of this that she takes me to inspect his handiwork .
I wonder how Jocelyn feels now about allowing a child , albeit a grown - up child , to go to a war zone .
' When Tom first said he was going away [ Iraq was his initial destination ] , I froze .
I could not speak when I found out my challenging , extremely bright son was planning to do this .
I felt : how could he put us through this ?'
It was a long time before she was able to respect his decision .
Now she believes ' we learn so much from risk takers ' , from people not content to ' sit on their comfortable sofas ' .
She remembers
Tom asking her ' why a 21 - year - old on the other side of the world should live a much more difficult life than I do in London ' .
She salutes his thinking : ' He saw acceptance of difference as one of the answers to the universe , ' and she agrees with him : ' Inclusion is essential - on climate change , on banking crises .
We need to think in a more global way . '
Since
Tom 's death , Jocelyn no longer works as a head of learning support at a state school .
She is , instead , the director of the Middle East charity Friends of Birzeit University , which raises funds for academic scholarships for Palestinian students .
' It is to do with education for an oppressed group who experience barriers to learning , ' she says .
Her daughter , Sophie , has also gravitated towards charity work ; in her case , Map ( Medical Aid for Palestinians ) .
She has become an exceptionally effective campaigner ( the importance of her role in the family has been written out of the film ) .
Jocelyn hopes the film will make audiences ' abandon an emotional response to the conflict and make an objective attempt to open their minds to what this is really about .
Highly intelligent people often lose all their logic about this conflict . '
It is interesting that just as Anthony wants me to know that he is emotional , she wants me to know she can be logical .
But both Hurndalls want people to know what is happening in Gaza .
Her eyes blaze as she describes the ' wanton destruction of people 's homes ' .
She wishes she could bring politicians in ' by the busload ' to see what she has seen .
And yet it is clear that Jocelyn will never find it possible to abandon the emotional response to the Middle East conflict .
' The life - changing moment for me was when Fred , who was only 12 , was interviewed by the BBC .
" How do you feel ? " they asked him .
He was standing next to Tom 's blood on the ground .
He was like a ghost .
He said , " They shot my brother , he was doing something good , he was rescuing children . " '
She tells me that part of Tom 's legacy is the realisation that how a story is told is crucial - words matter to her , as they did to him , tremendously .
It is this that suddenly reminds me to ask her about the Israeli judge who passed sentence in words so unjudiciously lyrical they take the breath away .
She knows ' nothing about him ' , she says , but continues to cherish the words he chose .
This was his summing up : ' Sergeant Wahid Taysir caused a soul to leave this world .
He spilt the blood of a young man in the bloom of youth , causing the loss of an entire world .
When that young man was alive , there was no one else like him , and there will never be anyone like him again . '

Study shows people with diabetes who have no symptoms of heart disease do not benefit from taking aspirin , though previous sufferers may benefit
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
People with diabetes should not routinely take aspirin to prevent heart attacks , new research suggested today .
It has been argued that routine use of the drug could help prevent the risk of a heart attack .
But research by the British Medical Journal ( BMJ ) found that people with diabetes who showed no symptoms of heart disease had no benefit from regularly taking aspirin .
But some groups of people with diabetes would still benefit from taking aspirin , it found .
After a heart attack or stroke , taking the drug could reduce the risk of future related problems by a quarter .
The research , conducted by Professor Jill Belch of the Institute of Cardiovascular Research at Dundee University , found the drug was most effective if prescribed to people with more serious cardiovascular problems .
The report read : " A total of seven well - controlled trials now show that aspirin has no benefit for primary prevention of cardiovascular events , even in people at higher risk .
" Although aspirin is cheap and universally available , practitioners and authors of guidelines need to heed the evidence that aspirin should be prescribed only in patients with established symptomatic cardiovascular disease . "
The study involved more than 1,200 middle - aged patients with type one or type two diabetes .
Belch told the Daily Mail : " If you 're taking aspirin for secondary prevention because you 've had a heart attack , or stroke , or have a circulatory problem , then it works .
" But it does n't work if you have none of these problems and there is also no evidence for its use by healthy middle - aged people .
" We do not want people taking aspirin prescribed by their doctor to stop taking it without seeking medical advice .
They may have conditions for which it is suitable . "
Contrary to what The Register reports , Microsoft is not paying $ 100,000 annual membership to the Apache Software Foundation .
ASF membership cannot be bought : people earn their individual membership by merit , and there ’s no such thing as ASF member companies .
As with any other sponsor of the ASF , Microsoft ’s sponsorship only means that they ’re giving money to the ASF , money that the ASF can use freely , as the ASF does not accept directed donations .
I am very pleased to see this happening .
It wo n’t make me love Microsoft ’s current products much more ( although , as my son notes , the XBox is a nifty piece of kit ) , but it is great to see more and more people inside Microsoft understand the importance of open source in today ’s IT landscape .
Update : as I write this , the Google Number for + apache + microsoft +sponsor * is 682,000
Update : it ’s been at least 24 hours since I posted a comment to the Register article linked above , indicating their error .
Surprisingly , that comment has n’t been moderated in yet …

Challenging the king
Note :
What follows is a brief assessment of Warhammer Online based on two months of extensive play logged in our gaming journal , Opposable Thumbs .
For the full story , read through the play logs themselves , which are linked throughout this article and again at the end .
With over 10 million subscribers , World of WarCraft is the undisputed king of the MMORPG market .
When it comes to massively - multiplayer online role - playing games , few can pose any real challenge to Activision - Blizzard 's WoW .
But EA , long - time rival of Activision , is trying to do just that with its recently - released MMO Warhammer Online .
After two months in the field , it 's time to see if EA has pulled off this coup .
In this battle , we wage WAAAGH !
From the outset , it 's clear that EA Mythic has poured a lot of time and money into the Warhammer Online project .
The game had an extensive beta - testing period and an excellent launch , arriving as a product filled with polish and promise .
The early weeks of the game were free from any unplanned down - time , and the developers have been managing populations pretty well so far .
The few areas of the game that are rough around the edges can largely be attributed to the typical roster of post - launch problems common in every MMO .
The centerpiece of the title , combat , is remarkably fresh and fun .
Though the game banks on traditional Western MMO designs — for example , you have a hotbar with spell icons that you click to activate mana - draining spells , each limited by cool - down timers .
Nevertheless , combat proves to be interesting , thanks to the inclusion of unique , class - specific play mechanics that give the game a leg up on the competition .
One example is the Ironbreaker tanking class 's " Grudges , " which add up when taking damage and mitigate increasing damage in proportion to the number of Grudges .
These simple mechanics go a long way toward individualizing the play styles of each class while making the otherwise - standard click - and - cast combat much more fun .
Player character individualization is also heavily supported by a strong array of customization systems .
Mechanically , the game uses a ladder - based talent system that allows players to spill points earned from leveling up into specialized abilities that distinguish the player from others of the same class .
The more linear approach makes it much easier to customize one 's character without straying off the cookie - cutter path and handicapping oneself .
Aesthetically , a trophy system allows players to attach decorative trinkets to themselves in various places so that they can be distinguishable on the battlefield .
While the variety of armor sets in the game is limited by the developers ' decision to make each class visually - identifiable , the addition of trophies , as well as colored dyes , makes it easy enough to stand out from the crowd .
My shaman has come a long way in the last month .
This personalization also extends to the game 's interface , which is surprisingly user - friendly .
In addition to the various Lua- powered mods made popular by World of WarCraft , Warhammer Online also includes an in - game UI editor reminiscent of Guild Wars .
This editor allows players to easily drag , drop , and re-size the game 's UI elements without any programming knowledge or extra - game tinkering .
All of these well - polished fundamentals lay the groundwork for the game 's unrivaled player - versus - player combat , which is , in a word , exceptional .
Mythic has successfully built on the formula it established with Dark Age of Camelot by offering its trademark realm - versus - realm engine in a more mature , polished , and attractive package .
The game includes the now - standard array of instance - based , scenario combat options with varied objectives , including variants of " Capture The Flag " and " King of the Hill . "
Players can queue up from wherever they are in the world , jump into a stand - alone encounter with automatically - assigned teams and an objective , and then return to where they were in the world without missing a beat .
The drop - in , drop - out nature of the scenario system puts Warhammer a league above the competition .
Player vs. player vs. environment
At every stage of the game 's four level - restricted tiers of content , and specifically in the end - game , players can also engage in world player vs. player combat ( PVP ) .
This " Siege " system requires members of the two opposing factions to defend zone keeps with both willpower and mechanical weaponry , such as battering rams and catapults , in order to remain in power .
In the end - game , this becomes a battle for full cities — lose a city , and your entire faction cannot access much of the end - game bonuses .
This truly creates a meaningful drive for players to fight in the name of their faction .
As was the case in DAOC , the PVP combat of Warhammer Online is undeniably fun and gives the game a lasting appeal .
And while PVP is the clear focus , Mythic has made a few key innovations in the PVE space that are truly exciting .
While there are thousands of relatively well - designed ( though boring at times ) player versus environment quests , as well as a collection of instanced dungeons and lairs , the most notable addition is the Public Questing system .
This public raiding system automates the majority of the bureaucracy involved in multi-man raids , like tracking contribution and fairly distributing loot .
With these taken care of , players are free to enjoy the raids and not worry about various social nuisances .
The PQs themselves are multi-stage , scripted events which can sometimes be as fun to watch as they are to participate in , though the sheer number of them spread about the game 's many zones means that some are definitely more interesting than others .
PVE is also supplemented by the excellent " Tome of Knowledge , " the game 's included digital encyclopedia .
Within this in - game book is everything the player could ever want to know about the world and its inhabitants ; this is where the game 's license really comes into its own .
Hundreds of pages of lore dripping with sweet fantasy can be found .
And the tome also comes equipped with countless quests for players to undertake at their leisure , ranging from a bestiary requiring X number of monster kills to a travel log requiring trips to far - away regions .
All progress contributes to a vast set of exclusive rewards that include special titles , special tactics , and rare items .
It is time to confront the unhappy fact about our country :
There are now two Americas .
Not a rich one and a poor one ; economic status plays little role in this division .
There is a red one and a blue one .
For most of my life I have believed , in what I now regard as wishful thinking , that the right and left wings have essentially the same vision for America , that it 's only about ways to get there in which the two sides differ .
Right and left share the same ends , I thought .
That is not the case .
For the most part , right and left differ in their visions of America and that is why they differ on policies .
Right and the left do not want the same America .
The left wants America to look as much like Western European countries as possible .
The left wants Europe 's quasi- pacifism , cradle - to - grave socialism , egalitarianism and secularism in America .
The right wants none of those values to dominate America .
The left wants America not only to have a secular government , but to have a secular society .
The left feels that if people want to be religious , they should do so at home and in their houses of prayer , but never try to inject their religious values into society .
The right wants America to continue to be what it has always been -- a Judeo - Christian society with a largely secular government ( that is not indifferent to religion ) .
These opposing visions explain , for example , their opposite views concerning nondenominational prayer in school .
The left prefers to identify as citizens of the world .
The left fears nationalism in general ( this has been true for the European left since World War I ) , and since the 1960s , the American left has come to fear American nationalism in particular .
On the other side , the right identifies first as citizens of America .
The left therefore regards the notion of American exceptionalism as chauvinism ; the United Nations and world opinion are regarded as better arbiters of what is good than is America .
The right has a low opinion of the U.N. 's moral compass and of world opinion , both of which it sees as having a much poorer record of stopping genocide and other evils than America has .
The left is ambivalent about and often hostile to overt displays of American patriotism .
That is why , for example , one is far more likely to find American flags displayed in Orange County , Calif. , on national holidays than in liberal neighborhoods in West Los Angeles , Manhattan or San Francisco .
The left subscribes to the French Revolution , whose guiding principles were " Liberty , Equality , Fraternity . "
The right subscribes to the American formula , " Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . "
The French / European notion of equality is not mentioned .
The right rejects the French Revolution and does not hold Western Europe as a model .
The left does .
That alone makes right and left irreconcilable .
The left envisions an egalitarian society .
The right does not .
The left values equality above other values because it yearns for an America in which all people have similar amounts of material possessions .
This is what propels the left to advocate laws that would force employers to pay women the same wages they pay men not only for the same job but for " comparable " jobs ( as if that is objectively ascertainable ) .
The right values equality in opportunity and strongly believes that all people are created equal , but the right values liberty , a man - woman based family and other values above equality .
The left wants a world -- and therefore an America -- devoid of nuclear weapons .
The right wants America to have the best nuclear weapons .
The right trusts American might more than universal disarmament .
The left wants to redefine marriage to include same - sex couples for the first time in history .
The right wants gays to have equal rights , but to keep marriage defined as man-woman .
This , too , constitutes an irreconcilable divide .
For these and other reasons , calls for a unity among Americans that transcends left and right are either naive or disingenuous .
America will be united only when one of them prevails over the other .
The left knows this .
Most on the right do not .
OCTOBER 7-- Days after federal officials agreed to an $ 85 billion bailout of American International Group , the insurance firm spent more than $ 440,000 for a corporate retreat at a swanky California resort .
An invoice from the week - long getaway , a copy of which you 'll find here , was obtained by the congressional panel that has been holding hearings this week about Wall Street collapses and executive excess .
The late - September AIG gathering at the St. Regis Resort in Monarch Beach cost $ 443,343 , according to the invoice .
The six - figure sum covered hotel rooms , banquets , golf fees , and spa services at the resort south of Los Angeles .
However , company funds apparently were not spent on exploding cakes or urinating ice statues .

Siemens Healthcare , a biotech company , announced that it managed to create an ultrasonic tourniquet which can quickly stop bleeding for troops in combat zones .
The company 's representatives stated that Siemens Healthcare signed a contract with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) .
The device is expected to be ready by 2010 .
The ultrasonic device was dubbed Deep Bleeder Acoustic Coagulation cuff ( DBAC ) .
It will be used to clot blood vessels without any invasion and staunch internal bleeding .
It is worth mentioning that internal bleeding from combat limb wounds are the main cause of death of troops during a battle .
The company hopes to use the device in future in the field of civilian care .
According to Siemens , its device is so simple that an untrained soldier would be able to operate with it .
When applied to the wound , the machine scans the limb to identify the location of the severe bleeding ; then using high - intensity ultrasound pulses the device will coagulate the blood .
The Deep Bleeder Acoustic Coagulation would be able to stop severe bleeding from liver , spleen and blood vessels in just 1 - 2 minutes .
The Agency believes that the device would be of much help to American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan .
It could prevent limb loss from roadside bombs and improvised explosions .
In addition the cuff will be able to prevent deaths from haemorrhagic shock .

The reviling McCain campaign volunteer * is suddenly very upset with the media for creating a ‘ political firestorm ‘ over her allegations that she was beaten , robbed , sexually assaulted , and mutilated by a 6 ’ 4 ″ black man who did these things simply because she had a McCain bumper sticker on her car .
Yes , that ’s right , she is claiming that it ’s the media ’s fault that her hoax was talked about in the first place .
This leaves me wondering what her motivation was to give herself a black eye , scratch a backwards B into her cheek , and report it to police ?
Could she have only been looking for attention amongst a small group of people with this obviously ill - prepared hoax ?
Of course not .
Not only did she quite obviously intend for this to get into the media , the McCain campaign themselves attempted to capitalize on this incident , not only publicizing that McCain and Gov. Palin had called her to see how she was , but apparently pushing the story to reporters !
It makes me wonder how much of this was her own inspiration , and how much it was a group effort .
This is the same idiot that posted videos on YouTube complaining about a tall ( maybe 6 ’ 4 ″ ? ) black janitor that removed some signs that she had obviously not received permission to put up :
And here ’s Ashley ‘ ZOMG !
I just got beaten up by a fake Obama supporter !’
Todd introducing herself :
I ’m sorry McCain campaign , but she is simply more than just a ‘ volunteer ’ .
The responsibilities she listed are more in line with a paid employee of an organization affiliated with the campaign , not a straight volunteer .
* currently there is a debate evolving as to whether on not she had a paid position for a group that works for the McCain campaign
Poll : 19 % of Americans associate just one word with McCain David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Monday July 7 , 2008
Print This Email This An AP - Yahoo poll asked Americans what word comes to mind when they think of the two presidential candidates .
Although both had roughly the same favorable - unfavorable split , the specific images of the two men were very different .
For John McCain , the most common response was " old , " with 19 % .
In contrast , 20 % responded to Barack Obama 's name with " change " or " outsider " and another 8 % saw him as " inspiring . "
However , the news is n't all bad for McCain , as the Associated Press does n't mention if one other word allegedly linked to McCain comes to mind .
Among those responders who looked more positively on McCain , 9 % referred to his having been a prisoner of war , while 13 % noted Obama 's " lack of experience . "
One woman told AP , " I think he talks the talk , but I do n't think he can walk the walk . "
Another 9 % called Obama " dishonest . "
Obama received more responses associated with caring or likability and was favored on domestic issues , while McCain was cited more often in terms of leadership or decisiveness .
However , AP noted that " Obama 's image has deteriorated with two crucial groups : 52 percent of whites view him negatively , up 12 points from November .
And 48 percent of independents have an unfavorable view of him , up from 31 percent last fall . "
Finally , 7 % saw McCain as equivalent to Bush and 6 % linked him to Iraq or terrorism .
" I think of the people we lost and a country that can never be won , no matter who is in office , " said one woman .

Baconnaise
There 's a new player in town vying for the attention of your sandwiches and vegetables .
J&D , a .k.a. Justin and Dave , first opened our eyes with Bacon Salt , which made everything taste like bacon .
But for those of us who do n't salt our bread , now we have Baconnaise .
Stemming from a customer suggestion about 6 months ago , it seems inconceivable that the world has been deprived of such a culinary achievement .
As a nation of bacon-eaters would attest , it is a concept whose time has come .
How we ever got along without Baconnaise is the real question .
Some inventions clearly are for the benefit of humanity .
While I was under the impression that bacon went well with everything , apparently bacon and mayonnaise never really got along too well .
( Could have fooled me ! )
They decided to settle their differences in the only way the knew how : mayonnaise wrestling .
In the spirit of Halloween , click on through for some prefight smack - talk between bacon and mayonnaise .
Touted as the " Ultimate Bacon Flavored Spread , " Baconnaise is available in Regular and Lite .
The " Battle in Seattle " was held at the Baconnaise launch .
It does n't really matter who won the wrestling match , because with Baconnaise , we 're all winners .

Do n't get me wrong : Alan Greenspan is n't at fault for all of today 's woes .
Maybe some , maybe a lot , but not all .
He 's only one man .
One man , but one very powerful man .
As the then - chairman of the organization responsible for the nation 's monetary policy and Washington 's go - to guy on economic issues , Greenspan 's more than deserving of a little criticism for his oversight during the greatest financial run-up the nation has ever seen .
Here are five Greenspan quotes uttered during the bubble that we can only imagine he wished he'd never said .
" I believe that the general growth in large [ financial ] institutions have occurred in the context of an underlying structure of markets in which many of the larger risks are dramatically -- I should say , fully -- hedged . " -- 2000
D'oh !
Hedging -- meaning losses in one investment get offset by gains in another -- works wonders when markets remain rational , and it allowed investment banks like Goldman Sachs ( NYSE : GS ) and JPMorgan Chase ( NYSE : JPM ) to leverage up to their gills without much worry .
Problem is , once markets turn from rational machines to emotion - driven lunatics ( as they have been lately ) , securities that should zig when something else zags do n't always follow their intended path .
Here 's an example of rational markets going haywire : On Sept. 19 -- the first day the ban on short - selling certain financial companies was enacted -- Berkshire Hathaway ( NYSE : BRK - B ) class B shares closed at $ 4,595 , while class A shares closed at $ 147,000 .
The A shares are transferable into 30 B shares , so one B share should always be worth roughly 1/30th of one A share .
On Sept. 19 , that natural link vanished ( with each B share worth about 1/32 of an A share ) because investors could n't short the A shares and close the gap .
Situations like that are when the " fully hedged " argument Greenspan preached falls to pieces .
" Even though some down payments are borrowed , it would take a large , and historically most unusual , fall in home prices to wipe out a significant part of home equity .
Many of those who purchased their residence more than a year ago have equity buffers in their homes adequate to withstand any price decline other than a very deep one . " -- October 2004
Think about Russian roulette :
If there 's a 25 % chance you 'll end up dead , would you play ?
Most people say no , because even though the odds are in their favor , the outcome of landing on a bullet is n't worth the risk .
Now use that same logic for owning a home :
If there 's a 25 % chance of a " very deep decline " that would mean losing your home and sending the economy into oblivion , would you buy ?
Remarkably , most homeowners , and even Greenspan , thought the answer should be " yes , " and used it as an excuse to buy homes with little or no money down .
" The use of a growing array of derivatives and the related application of more - sophisticated approaches to measuring and managing risk are key factors underpinning the greater resilience of our largest financial institutions ....
Derivatives have permitted the unbundling of financial risks . " -- May 2005
In hindsight , we all know that the " growing array of derivatives " did n't unbundle financial risk , they complicated things to such an extent that even the people who created them can't figure them out .
Earlier this year , George Soros claimed that the complexity of derivatives and the near - impossible task of unbundling the products themselves " must have played a role in the Fed 's decision not to allow Bear Stearns to fail . "
Meanwhile , AIG ( NYSE : AIG ) had to pay the head of its unit responsible for derivatives $ 1 million per month for consulting services after he was fired , perhaps because he was one of the few who knew how insanely complex these products really were .
" Improvements in lending practices driven by information technology have enabled lenders to reach out to households with previously unrecognized borrowing capacities . " -- October 2004
Ah , yes : Many American's had " previously unrecognized borrowing capacitates . "
What they did n't have was previously unrecognized capacity to pay off those borrowings .
By December 2007 , the default rate on securitized subprime loans stood at more than 25 % .
It should come as little surprise that the banks that chose to tap the " unrecognized borrowing capacitates , " such as WaMu and Wachovia ( NYSE : WB ) , crashed and burned , while banks that stuck to good - ol ' " loan - money - to - people - who - can - pay - it - back " practices like Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) and BB&T ( NYSE : BBT ) are doing just fine .
" Indeed , recent research within the Federal Reserve suggests that many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable - rate mortgages rather than fixed - rate mortgages during the past decade , though this would not have been the case , of course , had interest rates trended sharply upward . " -- February 2004
What seems a little sketchy is that Greenspan made the comment about " interest rates trending sharply upward " in February 2004 , when the Fed funds rate stood at a historically low 1 % .
With rates that low , it was preposterous to think rates would do anything but trend sharply higher ... which , of course , they did , and many of those holding adjustable - rate mortgages found themselves saddled with mortgages they could n't afford after Greenspan nearly quintupled the fed funds rate .
For related Foolishness :
spoke too soon .

GOP CLAIMS PALINS TEEN DAUGHTERS PREGNANCY IS ALL HILLARYS FAULT
Satire by R J Shulman
ST .
PAUL , Minnesota 
Key leaders of the Republican Party are going on the offensive to head off criticism of their new Vice Presidential candidate Alaska Governor Sarah Palin due to the disclosure that her 17 - year old unmarried daughter Bristol is pregnant .
" If it was n't for Hillarys long time support of loose morals and whipping up women to think they can make decisions about their own bodies , none of this would have happened , " said Grover Norquist , anti-tax activist and GOP leader .
 Staying married to that cheating liar of a husband of hers , gave the message to our daughters that it is acceptable to lose all respect for themselves and to forget our all important teachings of abstinence only .
Shame on the Clintons .
They should be impeached all over again ,  said senior McCain advisor Steve Schmidt .
" The focus of blame lies clearly with the Clintons and the rest of the Godless Democrats , " said Family Research president Tony Perkins , and certainly not with the Palin's .
Fortunately , their daughter Bristol believes in pro-life and will keep the child and will marry the childs father as soon as a suitable father can be located .
More importantly for Palin and the Republicans , the elder statesman of the evangelical movement , James Dobson of the powerful Focus on the Family organization said he backs Palin completely .
" We all know that this teen pregnancy is the result of the Democrat Partys unabashed support of the gay agenda . "
" This disclosure will not hurt the Republican ticket but actually help it , " said Annette Ratliff a Texas delegate to the GOP convention .
" It shows that the Palin 's wrestle with the same problems as ordinary Americans and their handling of it shows strength , determination and that they are just like us .
Now if it was Chelsea Clinton or one of the Obama girls who got pregnant when they are teens , it would be nothing less than a message to the American people of a shameful flaunting of immoral behavior encouraged by parents in league with the devil himself . "

WASHINGTON , Sept. 23 ( UPI ) -- Rep. Ron Paul , R - Texas , says the U.S. government 's bailout of financial institutions will increase economic instability in the long run .
Paul , who ran for his party 's nomination for president this year , said such excessive intervention keeps the market from adjusting prices to lower levels , which would bring the economy back into balance , equalizing supply and demand , CNN reported Tuesday .

Paul , who serves on the House Financial Committee , told CNN policy makers have not learned prices must adjust to economic reality .
While the " government cannot just sit back idly and let the bust occur , " Paul said , " it must actively roll back stifling laws and regulations that allowed the boom to form in the first place . "
Low dishonesty and craven cynicism sometimes win the day but not inevitably .
The attempt to link Barack Obama to an old radical in his neighborhood has desperation and deceit written all over it .
Meanwhile , stunning acts of heroism stand out , such as the fidelity of military lawyers assigned to defend detainees at Guantanamo Bay -- uniformed officers faithful to their lawyerly duty to offer a vigorous defense even though it means exposing the injustice of military justice that is rigged for conviction and the mendacity of a commander in chief who commits war crimes .
If your law school is looking for a name for its new library , instead of selling the honor to a fat cat alumnus , you should consider the names of Lt. Cmdr.
Charles Swift , Lt. Col. Mark Bridges , Col. Steven David , Lt. Col. Sharon Shaffer , Lt. Cmdr. Philip Sundel and Maj. Michael Mori .
We are a stalwart and stouthearted people , and never more so than in hard times .
People weep in the dark and arise in the morning and go to work .
The waves crash on your nest egg and a chunk is swept away and you put your salami sandwich in the brown bag and get on the bus .
In Philly , a woman earns $ 10.30 an hour to care for a man brought down by cystic fibrosis .
She bathes and dresses him in the morning , brings him meals , puts him to bed at night .
It 's hard work lifting him and she has suffered a painful hernia that , because she can't afford health insurance , she can't get fixed , but she still goes to work because he'd be helpless without her .
There are a lot of people like her .
I know because I 'm related to some of them .
It was dishonest , cynical men who put forward a clueless young woman for national office , hoping to juice up the ticket , hoping she could skate through two months of chaperoned campaigning , but the truth emerges :
The lady is talking freely about matters she has never thought about .
The American people have an ear for B.S.
They can tell when someone 's mouth is moving and the clutch is not engaged .
When she said , " One thing that Americans do at this time , also , though , is let 's commit ourselves just every day , American people , Joe Six - Pack , hockey moms across the nation , I think we need to band together and say never again .
Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars , " people smelled gas .
Some Republicans adore her because they are pranksters at heart and love the consternation of grown - ups .
The ne'er - do - well son of the old Republican family as president , the idea that you increase government revenue by cutting taxes , the idea that you cut social services and thereby drive the needy into the middle class , the idea that you overthrow a dictator with a show of force and achieve democracy at no cost to yourself -- one stink bomb after another , and now Sarah Palin .
She is a chatty sportscaster who lacks the guile to conceal her vacuity , and she was John McCain 's first major decision as nominee .
This troubles independent voters , and now she is a major drag on his candidacy .
She will get a nice book deal from Regnery and a new career making personal appearances for forty grand a pop , and she 'll become a trivia question , " What politician claimed foreign - policy expertise based on being able to see Russia from her house ? "
And the rest of us will have to pull ourselves out of the swamp of Republican economics .
Your broker kept saying , " Stay with the portfolio , do n't jump ship , " and you felt a strong urge to dump the stocks and get into the money market where at least you 're not going to lose your shirt , but you did n't do it and did n't do it , and now you 're holding a big bag of brown bananas .
Me , too .
But at least I know enough not to believe desperate people who are talking trash .
Anybody who got whacked last week and still thinks McCain - Palin is going to lead us out of the swamp and not into a war with Iran is beyond persuasion in the English language .
They 'll need to lose their homes and be out on the street in a cold hard rain before they connect the dots .

Guest commentary by Spencer R. Weart , American Institute of Physics
I often get emails from scientifically trained people who are looking for a straightforward calculation of the global warming that greenhouse gas emissions will bring .
What are the physics equations and data on gases that predict just how far the temperature will rise ?
A natural question , when public expositions of the greenhouse effect usually present it as a matter of elementary physics .
These people , typically senior engineers , get suspicious when experts seem to evade their question .
Some try to work out the answer themselves ( Lord Monckton for example ) and complain that the experts dismiss their beautiful logic .
The engineers ’ demand that the case for dangerous global warming be proved with a page or so of equations does sound reasonable , and it has a long history .
The history reveals how the nature of the climate system inevitably betrays a lover of simple answers .
The simplest approach to calculating the Earth ’s surface temperature would be to treat the atmosphere as a single uniform slab , like a pane of glass suspended above the surface ( much as we see in elementary explanations of the “ greenhouse ” effect ) .
But the equations do not yield a number for global warming that is even remotely plausible .
You ca n’t work with an average , squashing together the way heat radiation goes through the dense , warm , humid lower atmosphere with the way it goes through the thin , cold , dry upper atmosphere .
Already in the 19th century , physicists moved on to a “ one - dimensional ” model .
That is , they pretended that the atmosphere was the same everywhere around the planet , and studied how radiation was transmitted or absorbed as it went up or down through a column of air stretching from ground level to the top of the atmosphere .
This is the study of “ radiative transfer , ” an elegant and difficult branch of theory .
You would figure how sunlight passed through each layer of the atmosphere to the surface , and how the heat energy that was radiated back up from the surface heated up each layer , and was shuttled back and forth among the layers , or escaped into space .
When students learn physics , they are taught about many simple systems that bow to the power of a few laws , yielding wonderfully precise answers : a page or so of equations and you ’re done .
Teachers rarely point out that these systems are plucked from a far larger set of systems that are mostly nowhere near so tractable .
The one - dimensional atmospheric model ca n’t be solved with a page of mathematics .
You have to divide the column of air into a set of levels , get out your pencil or computer , and calculate what happens at each level .
Worse , carbon dioxide and water vapor ( the two main greenhouse gases ) absorb and scatter differently at different wavelengths .
So you have to make the same long set of calculations repeatedly , once for each section of the radiation spectrum .
It was not until the 1950s that scientists had both good data on the absorption of infrared radiation , and digital computers that could speed through the multitudinous calculations .
Gilbert N. Plass used the data and computers to demonstrate that adding carbon dioxide to a column of air would raise the surface temperature .
But nobody believed the precise number he calculated ( 2.5 ºC of warming if the level of CO 2 doubled ) .
Critics pointed out that he had ignored a number of crucial effects .
First of all , if global temperature started to rise , the atmosphere would contain more water vapor .
Its own greenhouse effect would make for more warming .
On the other hand , with more water vapor would n’t there be more clouds ?
And would n’t those shade the planet and make for less warming ?
Neither Plass nor anyone before him had tried to calculate changes in cloudiness .
( For details and references see this history site . )
Fritz Möller followed up with a pioneering computation that took into account the increase of absolute humidity with temperature .
Oops … his results showed a monstrous feedback .
As the humidity rose , the water vapor would add its greenhouse effect , and the temperature might soar .
The model could give an almost arbitrarily high temperature !
This weird result stimulated Syukuro Manabe to develop a more realistic one - dimensional model .
He included in his column of air the way convective updrafts carry heat up from the surface , a basic process that nearly every earlier calculation had failed to take into account .
It was no wonder Möller ’s surface had heated up without limit : his model had not used the fact that hot air would rise .
Manabe also worked up a rough calculation for the effects of clouds .
By 1967 , in collaboration with Richard Wetherald , he was ready to see what might result from raising the level of CO 2 .
Their model predicted that if the amount of CO 2 doubled , global temperature would rise roughly two degrees C .
This was probably the first paper to convince many scientists that they needed to think seriously about greenhouse warming .
The computation was , so to speak , a “ proof of principle . ”
But it would do little good to present a copy of the Manabe - Wetherald paper to a senior engineer who demands a proof that global warming is a problem .
The paper gives only a sketch of complex and lengthy computations that take place , so to speak , offstage .
And nobody at the time or since would trust the paper ’s numbers as a precise prediction .
There were still too many important factors that the model did not include .
For example , it was only in the 1970s that scientists realized they had to take into account how smoke , dust and other aerosols from human activity interact with radiation , and how the aerosols affect cloudiness as well .
And so on and so forth .
The greenhouse problem was not the first time climatologists hit this wall .
Consider , for example , attempts to calculate the trade winds , a simple and important feature of the atmosphere .
For generations , theorists wrote down the basic equations for fluid flow and heat transfer on the surface of a rotating sphere , aiming to produce a precise description of our planet ’s structure of convective cells and winds in a few lines of equations … or a few pages … or a few dozen pages .
They always failed .
It was only with the advent of powerful digital computers in the 1960s that people were able to solve the problem through millions of numerical computations .
If someone asks for an “ explanation ” of the trade winds , we can wave our hands and talk about tropical heating , the rotation of the earth and baroclinic instability .
But if we are pressed for details with actual numbers , we can do no more than dump a truckload of printouts showing all the arithmetic computations .
I ’m not saying we do n’t understand the greenhouse effect .
We understand the basic physics just fine , and can explain it in a minute to a curious non-scientist .
( Like this : greenhouse gases let sunlight through to the Earth ’s surface , which gets warm ; the surface sends infrared radiation back up , which is absorbed by the gases at various levels and warms up the air ; the air radiates some of this energy back to the surface , keeping it warmer than it would be without the gases . )
For a scientist , you can give a technical explanation in a few paragraphs .
But if you want to get reliable numbers – if you want to know whether raising the level of greenhouse gases will bring a trivial warming or a catastrophe – you have to figure in humidity , convection , aerosol pollution , and a pile of other features of the climate system , all fitted together in lengthy computer runs .
Physics is rich in phenomena that are simple in appearance but cannot be calculated in simple terms .
Global warming is like that .
People may yearn for a short , clear way to predict how much warming we are likely to face .
Alas , no such simple calculation exists .
The actual temperature rise is an emergent property resulting from interactions among hundreds of factors .
People who refuse to acknowledge that complexity should not be surprised when their demands for an easy calculation go unanswered .
Veiled racism seen in new attacks on Obama

As CNN 's pundits wondered whether instant post - debate polls favoring Sen.
Barack Obama meant he would win on election day , analyst David Gergen - who has been an adviser to Republican and Democratic presidents - stopped them .
" I think it 's too early to declare victory , because Barack Obama is black , " Gergen said Tuesday night .
" And until we play out the issue of race in this country , I do n't think we 'll know and maybe ( not until ) late in the campaign . "
While Obama 's campaign has fended off racially rooted attacks since its inception , analysts say the ones surfacing in the past few days have been more overt , arriving as many undecided voters are making their final decision .
They are part of a recent stream of attacks on his background , including his religion and his connections to a former ' 60s radical .
" It is the Willie Hortonization of Obama , " said University of San Francisco associate professor of political science James Taylor .
Horton , an African American man , was a Massachusetts felon who committed a rape and armed robbery while on a weekend furlough .
Republican strategist Lee Atwater used a TV attack ad featuring Horton to create a negative impression of the 1988 Democratic nominee , former Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis , in the campaign 's final months .
' Coded ' language
Instead of using a grainy photo of a grizzled convict as Atwater did , the current attacks , analysts say , are embedded in " coded " language .
They cite as examples Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin portraying Obama as a cultural outsider and friend to terrorists and the dismissive way his Republican opponent , Sen .
John McCain , referred to Obama at their Tuesday night debate as " that one . "
Other recent attacks include the unsubstantiated allegation on Fox News ' " Hannity 's America " Sunday that Obama 's community organizing work in Chicago was " training for a radical overthrow of the government . "
The incendiary allegations - as well as the anti-Semitic background of the source of the allegation , commentator Andy Martin - went unchallenged and undisclosed by the host , conservative commentator Sean Hannity .
Fox said that the program is the host 's opinion , even though the allegation was presented as a documentary .
Obama did not respond to Hannity 's request for comment .
Martin wrote on his blog that " I am not a ' reporter ' assembling facts for a morning newspaper .
I am an analyst and expert opinion columnist .
I take ' facts ' that may or may not make sense in isolation , and I analyze them until patterns emerge and conclusions are apparent . "
Then there have been the speakers at McCain - Palin rallies who continue , unchecked by the candidates , to refer to " Barack Hussein Obama " - the emphasis on his middle name is an implication that Obama , who is a Christian , is Muslim .
The latest occurred Wednesday in Pennsylvania , when Bill Platt , the Lehigh County Republican chairman , mentioned Obama 's former reluctance to wear an American flag lapel pin and said : " Think about how you 'll feel on Nov. 5 if you see the news that Barack Obama , Barack Hussein Obama , is president of the United States . "
McCain - Palin spokesman Paul Lindsay said , " We do not condone this inappropriate rhetoric , which distracts from the real questions of judgment , character and experience that voters will base their decisions on this November . "
Shouts of ' terrorist '
Regardless , some attending McCain - Palin rallies are responding to this kind of incitement .
The Secret Service is investigating press reports that someone might have said " kill him " after Palin tried to connect Obama to former Weather Underground leader Bill Ayers .
Some attending McCain 's rally Wednesday in Pennsylvania interrupted him with shouts of " socialist , " " terrorist " and " liar . "
Earlier this week , Palin told a group of donors in Colorado that " this is not a man who sees America like you and I see America . "
Obama , Palin said , " is someone who sees America , it seems , as being so imperfect , imperfect enough , that he 's palling around with terrorists who would target their own country , " a reference to Obama 's connection with Ayers , now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago .
Conservative talk radio show host Rush Limbaugh echoed this attack by referring to Obama 's " mentorship " by Ayers ; Obama was in elementary school when Ayers and the Weather Underground were carrying out bombings .
Politico.com described Obama 's relationship with Ayers : " There 's no evidence their relationship is more than the casual friendship of two men who occupy overlapping Chicago political circles and who served together on the board of a Chicago foundation . "
FactCheck.org , a nonpartisan fact - checking organization , confirmed that description .
And during the week of Sept. 28 - Oct. 4 , " nearly 100 percent of the McCain campaign 's advertisements were negative , " according to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Advertising Project .
" During the same period , 34 percent of the Obama campaign 's ads were negative . "
Democratic vice presidential nominee Sen. Joe Biden worried Wednesday that the Republicans are injecting " fear and loathing " into the campaign .
" The idea that a leading American politician who might be vice president of the United States would not just stop midsentence and turn and condemn that - it's just a slippery slope , it 's a place that we should n't be going , " Biden said Wednesday on NBC's " Today " show , referring to the shouts of " terrorist " at Palin 's rallies .
" I mean , here you have out there these kinds of , you know , incitements out there - a guy introducing Barack using his middle name as if it 's some epithet or something , " he said on CBS Wednesday .
" This is over the top . "
These attacks are no different from the kind Atwater - the political mentor of Karl Rove - launched during the 1980s , said Stefan Forbes , director of the documentary " Boogieman : The Lee Atwater Story , " which opens Friday in San Francisco .
" I do n't see how the Democrats do n't understand the Lee Atwater playbook .
His tactics have been winning elections , even after his death " in 1991 , Forbes said .
The Horton campaign " represented the triumph of spin and smear over the issues .
They know that if you wrap things in the flag , you can sell anything . "
The key to Atwater 's success was that the candidates themselves remained above the fray .
" They were friendly , like ( Ronald ) Reagan , " Forbes said .
" Just like now , Palin is the friendly face , or George W. Bush was the guy you wanted to have a beer with .
They 'll dance around it and say ( these tactics ) are n't racist , but they are .
" The next couple of weeks are going to be really fascinating , " Forbes said .
" If the Atwater playbook can destroy Obama when the economy is collapsing the way it is , then it can accomplish almost anything . "
But Stanford University political science Professor Paul Sniderman , who recently completed a survey on racial attitudes of voters , does n't think the attacks will work .
He also said widely circulated media reports that said " Obama 's support would be as much as 6 percentage points higher if there were no white racial prejudice " were wrong .

From yesterday ’s Washington Post :
“ Al - Qaeda will have to support McCain in the coming election , ” said a commentary posted Monday on the extremist Web site al - Hesbah , which is closely linked to the terrorist group .
It said the Arizona Republican would continue the “ failing march of his predecessor , ” President Bush .
You heard right .
Al - Qaeda is endorsing John McCain for President .
And it is n’t hard to figure out why ( but we ’ll explain anyway ) :
The Web commentary was one of several posted by Taliban or al - Qaeda - allied groups in recent days that trumpeted the global financial crisis and predicted further decline for the United States and other Western powers .
In language that was by turns mocking and ominous , the newest posting credited al - Qaeda with having lured Washington into a trap that had “ exhausted its resources and bankrupted its economy . ”
It further suggested that a terrorist strike might swing the election to McCain and guarantee an expansion of U.S. military commitments in the Islamic world .
“ It will push the Americans deliberately to vote for McCain so that he takes revenge for them against al - Qaeda , ” said the posting , attributed to Muhammad Haafid , a longtime contributor to the password - protected site .
“ Al - Qaeda then will succeed in exhausting America . ”
By the way , AL QAEDA , America can bankrupt itself without your help .
So get your greedy paws out of our stock exchange !

Investors have reacted positively to efforts to stem the financial turmoil Wall Street shares rocketed 11 % on Monday as investors welcomed fresh moves to deal with the worldwide financial crisis .
The Dow share index surged 936 points , ending at 9,387 points , after falling dramatically in the previous week .
Investors were helped by news the US government wanted to put in place its $ 700 bn bank bail - out quickly .
This followed fresh moves by European governments to inject extra cash into their own banks .
Investors have generally welcomed the moves by governments .
" Sometime last week it seemed like we faced Armageddon , so to have a co-ordinated plan on stabilising banks is huge progress , " said Jack Ablin , at Harris Private Bank in Chicago .
DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE : 13 October 2008 * All Times GMT
In Washington President George W Bush said he was confident that the challenges which faced governments trying to curb the market turmoil could be overcome .
" We can work our way through these challenges and America will continue to work closely with the other nations to co-ordinate our response to this global financial crisis , " he said .
Rescue plans On Monday US Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank officials met the chief executives of some of America 's biggest banks , to work out details of the US government 's $ 700 bn ( £ 400 bn ) bail - out package .
The US has said it was also getting ready to follow in Europe 's footsteps and purchase stakes in financial institutions .
On Monday the US Treasury announced it was set to buy stakes in a " broad array " of financial firms .
European governments have said they are putting up to 1.7 trillion euros ( $ 2.3 trillion ; £ 1.3 trillion ) to protect the continent 's banks through guarantees and other emergency measures .
The sums are a maximum , and might not all be spent if the financial crisis eases .
So far Germany has approved a bank rescue plan worth up to 500bn euros , France will spend about 350bn euros , the Netherlands has pledged 200bn euros , Spain 100bn euros , and Austria 85 bn euros .
Italy said it would spend as much as was needed , without giving any exact figures .
The bulk of the European money will be used to guarantee lending between banks - part of a plan agreed this weekend by the 15 nations that use the euro .
The cash will also be used to take stakes in ailing banks .
UK bank move
In other key developments on Monday : The UK government said it would inject up to £ 36bn of taxpayers cash into Royal Bank of Scotland , Lloyds TSB and HBOS
The news lifted UK shares , with the main FTSE 100 index advancing 325 points or 8.2 % to 4,256
However , shares in the three UK banks affected end down heavily , with HBOS losing 27 % , Lloyds TSB falling 14 % and Royal Bank of Scotland slipping 8.3 %
Germany 's Dax index added 518 points , or 11 % to 5,062 , while France 's Cac 40 climbed 355 points , or 11 % to 3,531
Some central banks said they would offer financial institutions an unlimited amount of short - term dollar loans to help stem the crisis
The Icelandic stock exchange said share trading would remain suspended until Tuesday due to continuing " unusual market conditions " Momentous day " Today marks another momentous day in both UK and global financial history , " said Keith Bowman , equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers .
HAVE YOUR SAY
It seems Mr Brown and Co. have no choice in this matter and these takeovers are necessary , but its very wrong that it is the tax payer that should have to do this Anthony Halpin , Aberdeen " The hope in the markets is that political leaders have finally ' grasped the nettle ' , with substantial and coherent rescue plans now being formulated and rolled into place . "
The cash injection moves by Germany , France and Spain follow after talks between all 15 eurozone countries in Paris on Sunday .
The two - fold plan involves guaranteeing lending between banks and taking stakes in financial institutions - similar to the bank rescue in the UK announced last week .

The President of SINTEF Fisheries and Aquaculture , Karl Andreas Almås , crouches over his laptop , opens one of his presentations and finds an illustration .
It shows one red curve and one blue one .
He then indicates the point where they meet each other , then frowns and says the message he cannot repeat often enough :
There is a huge gap between world demand for fish and what we can harvest from the world ’s natural stocks .
The figures are clear :
If we do n’t do something about the over fishing , the stocks of wild fish will be dealt a death blow .
At the same time , the world ’s population continues to grow – and with it the global demand for food .
“ On a global basis today , we have an average annual consumption of 15 - 16 kilos of fish per person , ” says Almås .
“ If we are going to continue consuming at this rate , we need to double the production of farmed fish within the next 20 years .
Doing this in a sustainable manner will be a major challenge . ”

Balancing act
As well as expressing his concern , the president is also optimistic .
As the head of Europe ’s largest research institution for fisheries and aquaculture technology , he knows more than most about the conditions in the sea and how this can be achieved .
According to Almås , there are two main parts to the work towards sustainable aquaculture , but they are closely connected :
One is to develop technology for more selective and gentle capture of species in the sea to enable natural growth in the stocks and only capture the quality we actually want .
This must also occur without the fishing fleet using large energy consumption .
The other is to increase the efficiency of the aquaculture sector .
The president ’s figures show that the difference between fish production in 1980 and that which we will require in 2030 is a full 60 – 70 million tonnes of farmed fish .
This means among other things we must stop using fish as feed for farmed fish .
Fish caught at sea must be human food .
Therefore , we need to find feed alternatives that can be captured lower in the food chain .
Plant oils and proteins may be utilised as ingredients for feed in the aquaculture industry , and this is an area some research scientists are working on .
Another alternative is to convert natural gas to bio proteins , so - called single - cell proteins .
Last , but by no means least , we need to succeed in finding some new species of farmed fish and develop technology that enables a smarter and more cost - effective production of the fish species we are already farming .
If Almås achieves his visions of technological development and knowledge transfer , there will be few quiet days for he and his colleagues at SINTEF SeaLab at Brattørkaia in Trondheim Harbour .
However , they are already well on the way to finding solutions for the challenges .
Trawling down in the food chain
One of the research scientists eager to put fresh aquaculture knowledge into practice is Research Director Håvard Røsvik .
Together with product designer and colleague Mads Heide , he is working on the final polish of a new animation .
It demonstrates one of the research scientist ’s pet projects : a bubble trawler , which until now the world has not seen equal to .
Soundtracks featuring the cries of sea gulls , the splashing of waves and the sound of boat motors turn the film clip into a living description of the trawler that utilises air bubbles instead of a net to surface its prey : the 3 mm long , protein - rich Calanus finmarchicus .
“ This tiny creature , which has its natural place long down in the food chain , contains large amounts of proteins as well as marine fats , ” says Røsvik .
The film shows the boat chugging off on the smooth sea , while releasing air bubbles down into the sea .
As Calanus finmarchicus contains many hairs on its tiny body , it attaches itself to the air bubbles in the same manner as a nail attaches itself to a magnet , and floats up to the surface .
The tiny creatures are then collected in a fine - mesh cloth and enter the catch chamber with the assistance of a pump system .
Seemingly , it is just as simple as it is genial .
( Se egen sak .
S... red. anm . )
The challenge previously has been to capture a sufficient volume of the little chap .
With this trawler , it is likely that large enough volumes can be captured to make it profitable .
There is certainly enough to capture : Calculations show there are 300-400 million tonnes in Norwegian waters alone .
“ Capturing just one percent of this biomass would cover the requirements for the Norwegian aquaculture industry , ” says Røsvik .
The 90 degree effect
Another challenge Røsvik and his colleagues are working on is selective capture : Developing trawler systems that make it possible to catch fish of the correct size without damaging the small fish .
“ Trawling accounts for 40 percent of the world ’s total fisheries production , ” says Røsvik .
“ As such , improvements to this method of fishing will produce major consequences for the different fish stocks and the areas in which they live . ”
A simple , but extremely effective solution to make trawling gentler and more selective has been to turn the trawl net 90 degrees .
“ This is one idea that we tested in our flume tank in Hirtshals in Denmark , ” says Røsvik .
“ Scientists knew that fish were often damaged in the codend because turbulence occurs around traditional codends , causing them to swing from side to side . ”
However , by turning the meshes in the codend , the SINTEF research scientists utilised a recipe that did not cause turbulence : namely that the meshes in an outstretched position remain as wide open as possible .
It yielded results .
The cross-section was 12 times greater and the swinging movements were dramatically reduced compared to traditional codends .
Further , the meshes remain open when the trawl is stretched .
This means that the small fish escape and the fish that are large enough are damaged to a much lesser extent .
Energy consumption was also reduced .
A large proportion of the trawling fleets fishing whitefish off the coasts of Iceland , Scotland and New Zealand have now adopted this idea .
Cod farming
In the basement at SINTEF SeaLab , Trina Galloway stands bent over a tank of young cod .
Galloway is working on areas including the development of new farmed species .
She is now studying the result of one of the department ’s latest trials : 15 cm long “ teenagers ” swimming around in the tanks in the name of research .
In two years , these will be large cod that fetch a high price at seafood restaurants .
But whether they grow up and become saleable , healthy and good fish is not something we can take for granted .
It is the result of many years ’ research , trial and error and then yet more research .
One of the challenges associated with farming cod has been to find suitable feed for the recently hatched fish larvae .
While salmon larvae hatch with a large built - in packed lunch and develop a functional digestive system relatively quickly , cod require specially developed , live plankton , which is 100 percent research - based !
“ On the cod ’s part , hatching the eggs is not enough , ” says the biologist .
“ We need to have control of the entire life cycle , including the factors that contribute to the fish that hatch growing up .
The conditions need to be optimal . ”
Ecosystem in the “ cod kindergarten ”
What appear to the uninitiated like ordinary plastic tanks with small creepy - crawlies swimming around are actually small , but exactly balanced ecosystems .
In each tank , phytoplankton , zooplankton and fish larvae are living in perfect harmony , and physical factors such as water flow , temperature and light are precisely matched .
At the end of the hall , there is a two metre high white plastic container filled with a gurgling yellowy - green soup .
This is the heart of the facility : a bio filter or “ live storeroom ” containing the optimal bacterial flora for cod babies , and which supplies the facility ’s tanks with mature , re-circulated water .
For small , sensitive , young fish , it is particularly important to have stable growing conditions early in their childhood .
“ This is the marine fish hatchery of the future , ” says Galloway .
From mono to poly
But the future of the aquaculture industry will offer challenges other than good water for the hatcheries and new feed alternatives .
Better utilisation of both the fish farming area and the energy in the feed will be important .
“ On average , the salmon utilise only 20 - 25 percent of the energy in the feed for growth , ” says Galloway .
“ The remainder is separated as waste or disappears out of the cages . ”
With this in mind , the research scientists have designed a system for three farmed species .
The idea is to cultivate species that live in different stages of the food chain in the same place .
“ If we succeed with keeping salmon , mussels and kelp in the same system , the feed will be fully utilised because the mussels and kelp eat the feed not consumed by the fish , ” explains Galloway .
Operating aquaculture in this way is relatively new in Norway , but not totally uncommon in fish farming counties in the east .
SINTEF research scientists will pursue the idea and develop it for the open sea - and it is precisely far out at sea that the fish farms of the future will be located .
Aquaculture off - shore
“ If the aquaculture industry is going to grow globally , this must happen at sea , ” says Arne Fredheim .
“ Fish farming in rough and open sea is something we can do well in Norway , and this knowledge is in demand from clients worldwide . ”
There are many reasons why the aquaculture sector is aiming for the open sea .
The water quality here is better than the limited areas near land and the temperature is more stable – a factor that improves the quality of the fish meat .
Moreover , the flow rate increases , and with it the supply of oxygen to the cages .
He is now working to develop fish farms for the open sea .
Fredheim is Director of CREATE , a centre for research - based innovation in aquaculture technology and one of the areas of strategic focus for the Research Council of Norway within innovation .
He and his research colleagues at NTNU and SINTEF have received NOK 80 million .
One of the research scientists ’ visions is an advanced fish farm that can “ think for itself ” .
Such fish farms will be able to float to more optimal locations when required and submerge in the sea when exposed to rough weather .
Even though this vision is unlikely to be a reality for at least 10 or 15 years , the technology for fish farms in the open sea is already in place .
“ Our part is to view the total , integrated process , from the technological and operational sides through to the biological challenges , ” says Fredheim .
Today the research scientists are working on developing such fish farms through different projects .
One of the challenges is to find out how long a submergible cage should use on its ascent back to the surface .
“ Some fish species can actually get a sort of decompression sickness , ” says Fredheim .
“ Ascending too quickly will , for example , burst a cod ’s air bladder .
Maybe it is ideal that a cage uses several days to complete the ascent up to the surface . ”
Utilizing the whole fish
One floor above the laboratory ’s “ fish kindergarten ” , Marit Aursand is sitting at her desk thumbing through a report .
The report is about “ functional food ” , one of the hottest concepts within food technology .
Functional food is food that in addition to providing nutrition contains properties beneficial to your health .
One such example is food to reduce cholesterol , which is already available on shop shelves .
This is a growing market .
As Research Director at the Department of Processing Technology , this is an area in which Aursand is particularly interested .
“ One of our main challenges is more of what we catch needs to be used as human food , and the parts that cannot be used for food can be used for marine oils , animal feed or health products , ” says Aursand .
“ Products like this can be added to other food to provide health benefits .
Healthy fish oil can , for example , be added to yoghurt .
Fish have the potential for 100 percent utilisation .
If we manage to develop automation processes to achieve this objective , this can become an important industry for Norway . ”
And with Marit Aursand ’s vision , along with new solutions for fishing equipment , fishing methods and fish farming on both land and at sea , maybe we can see hope for the new face of the sea ?

Advertisement British consumers are being warned they could face shortages of everything from clothes to fuel unless effective action is taken to stop pirates hijacking ships off the coast of Somalia .
The effects could become apparent in the run-up to Christmas , says the British Chamber of Shipping .
So far this year , more than 30 ships have been hijacked by Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden , with hundreds of crew members taken hostage .
The rate at which ships are being taken has led the British Chamber of Shipping to warn customers that all supplies that come to the UK and other western European countries from Asia could be put at risk .
Long way round Gavin Simmonds , head of international policy at the chamber , says : " Car carriers with vehicles for the UK , foodstuffs from Asia , textiles and clothing , dare I say it in time for the Christmas market , will not be arriving on time if they have to [ go round South Africa ] .
We could begin to see shortages within the next few weeks . "
Of the ships pirated this year , most attention has focussed on MV Faina , the Ukrainian vessel carrying tanks and heavy weaponry .
But the majority of ships sailing through the Gulf carry supplies vital to the running of the global economy .
Goods as diverse as oil , gas , cars , textiles and electronics travel past Somalia on their way to Britain .
Life in Somalia 's pirate town Somalia : Special report Somali piracy costs $ 30 m
The alternative route , going round the Cape of Good Hope , would add up to three weeks to the average journey .
However , the International Chamber of Shipping ( ICS ) says that two companies have already given their captains the permission to go the long way round and others are considering following suit .
Some action is now being attempted to thwart the pirates , whose actions are also disrupting shipments of aid supplies to the war - torn Somali mainland .
A flotilla of naval vessels from 10 Nato nations is now heading for the Gulf of Aden , and two UN Security Council resolutions have been passed condemning the piracy , and urging coordinated action to stop the attacks .
The issue is also being discussed in the European Parliament .
But despite this there is a distinct lack of urgency to address the problem , say some experts .
The ICS argues that if commercial airlines were being attacked as often as ships , the reaction of governments would be very different .
" It 's taken a very long time to get politicians aware of it and to get real military action under way , " says Peter Hinchcliffe from the ICS .
Hijacked " And whilst all these discussions are going on and whilst the pirates continue to hold ships to ransom , there is a very real possibility that cargos will be held up and deliveries will be delayed . "
Insurance companies are increasingly concerned by the dangers .
Speciality insurer Hiscox says some of its clients have had their vessels hijacked .
While he acknowledges the frustration within the shipping industry at the lack of attention to the piracy issue , Guillaume Bonnissent from Hiscox doubts that ships will actually start to avoid the Gulf of Aden .
" I do n't think we are going to see shortages .
I think we are more likely to see ship owners charging higher prices [ to cover the increased insurance premiums ]
which may have repercussions for the consumer . "

What are these ?
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with US President George Bush
By Dipankar Bhattacharya , general secretary , Communist Party of India ( Marxist - Leninist ) Liberation
October 14 , 2008 -- India 's United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) government finally sealed the nuclear deal with the US on October 10 .
For the Congress Party and the coalition of ``Unashamed Partners of America ' ' headed by it , the nuclear deal is the supreme achievement of the government .
On the eve of signing the deal , India 's external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee reiterated India 's commercial commitment to the US nuclear energy industry : " We look forward to working with US companies on the commercial steps that will follow to implement this landmark Agreement . "
In a second statement issued after the agreement 's signing he also reiterated India 's commitment to implement the agreement in good faith even though no such reciprocal assurance was made by the US to confirm New Delhi 's claim regarding the so - called US ``guarantee '' on uninterrupted fuel supply .
On India 's part , faithful implementation of the commitments , whether declared or undeclared , has long been underway .
From the vote against Iran at International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to the continuing prevarication and procrastination on the issue of the Iran - Pakistan - India gas pipeline proposal , India has been complying with the Hyde Act , which requires India 's foreign policy to be congruent with US priorities and objectives , in letter and spirit .
And now Pranab Mukherjee 's explicit assurance reaffirms the commercial component of India 's commitment , which can only be music to US ears at a time when the US economy is passing through its worst crisis in some eighty years .
The dilapidated atomic reactor industry in the US is awaiting hefty orders from India even as massive military purchases are in the pipeline .
The day Pranab Mukherjee and Condoleezza Rice inked the nuke deal , US President George Bush met the finance ministers and central bankers of the G7 countries – the US , Germany , Japan , France , Britain , Italy and Canada – and leading officials of the IMF in a desperate bid to check the growing financial panic that has now begun to spread beyond the US horizons to overshadow the G7 sky .
The meeting of the G7 finance chiefs called for " urgent and exceptional action " and the use of " all available tools to support systematically important financial institutions and prevent their failure . "
In a separate statement US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson admitted " never has it been more essential to find collective solutions to ensure stable and efficient financial markets and restore the health of the world economy " .
History is replete with examples showing what the US really means by finding " collective solutions " .
It desperately tries to pass on its crisis to other countries and refuel its military - industrial complex to underwrite its economy , and in the process steps up politico - military intervention across the world .
And it is precisely at this juncture that the Indian ruling classes have pushed India into a tight strategic embrace with the crisis - ridden US – a country that is hated by most nations of the world for its imperialist arrogance and aggression and whose economy is now emitting waves of financial instability and panic across the global economy .
Strategic partnership with the US can only prove to be a conduit for importing the entire gamut of crises facing the US into India .
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh and his ilk epitomise the typical Indian comprador mindset that considers the US to be the pinnacle of capitalist success and would do everything to bask in the American sun .
But the much - trumpeted great ``American Dream ' ' is now fast turning sour .
Just a couple of days before Pranab Mukherjee signed the deal , almost every newspaper in India carried the shocking story of an MBA degree - holder from India killing his entire family as well as himself as all his fortunes collapsed in the ongoing financial meltdown .
The nuke deal and Indo - US strategic partnership is not a passport to US - sponsored prosperity and power , it is an invitation to greater crisis and vulnerability to US blackmailing and arm twisting .
All right - thinking Indians must reject this sordid comprador capitulation with the contempt it deserves .

Hello PW peeps .
It ’s Ryan , and I ’m so excited to share this recipe with you because this has truly been the go - to meal of the year for me .
It works well for an everyday dinner as well as a dinner party .
Everyone LOVES this dish .
Well , I ’m sure there are people out there who do n’t , but I have n’t met them …and I ’m not quite sure I ’d want to .
It ’s got a good number of ingredients , but it ’s really quite easy .
Something to keep in mind is that this is an extremely flexible recipe .
You can add or omit ingredients to your taste and whatever you do , this “ Lasagna ” will surely be amazing .
I ’m using a full - sized pan for this ( something that will feed 20 + people ) so keep that in mind and cut the recipe in half if you ’re just using a regular casserole dish .
Be on the look out for quantities such as “ some ” , “ A few ” , or “ A good bit of ” … just remember , this is flexible .
Do n’t stick too closely to my exact recipe .
Make it all your own .
Here ’s what we need :
I ’ve got Paprika , Cumin , and Chili Powder to make up my own “ Taco Seasoning ” .
Some onions , tomatoes , and lots of garlic .
Corn and black beans , white rice ( I ’m using Basmati ) , Chicken broth or stock , ground beef , Mexican cheese blend ( aka Monterey Jack & Cheddar ) , Salsa Verde and Enchilada sauce .
Note from PW : Also , Flour Tortillas !
( I ’m so glad I ’m not the only one who forgets ingredients in the Cast of Characters .
Gives me hope in the world . )
Got all that ?
Awesome .
Let ’s get started by preparing our Mexican rice .
I ’m not going to show you how I go about preparing white rice .
It ’s very simple and I have confidence that you can do this with the basic instructions included with your rice .
I can tell you that I prefer Basmati rice and I cook it in chicken broth instead of water .
It makes quite a difference in flavor .
Here ’s 4 cups ( that ’s a lot ! ) of unprepared rice .
I be sure to use low sodium chicken stock so I can control how salty it is .
Then I simply salt it to taste .
When it ’s done , you ’ll have more than twice the amount of dry rice you started with .
Next we ’re going to want to chop up our tomatoes , onions , and garlic .
The finer the better for picky eaters .
I like to toss this mixture into a pan to cook it down a bit .
You do n’t have to do this , but it will help to make everything blend together without that raw onion crunch that some find unpalatable .
A couple tablespoons of butter help with this .
This is a good spot to add our spices .
I like to use 2 parts chili powder , 1 part paprika , and 1 part cumin .
In my case … with the large amount I ’m making , this would be 3 tablespoons chili powder , 1 1/2 tablespoons paprika and 1 1/2 tablespoons cumin .
Give it all a stir .
If you like beans you can toss some of those in there , too .
And once that ’s all cooked down a little , you can mix it in with your rice .
( And by the way , this Mexican rice is awesome as a side dish .
Mmm … )
Now that we ’ve got an empty pan , we can start browning our ground beef .
There ’s something so satisfying about being able to use the same pan multiple times .
Anyway , I like using the leanest ground beef I can get my hands on for something like this .
It ’s a little healthier and it also allows me to be lazy as it does n’t create a bunch of grease I have to drain off .
Once the beef has browned , we can add some more of that “ Taco seasoning ” mix .
I ’m tossing in another tablespoon or so of the chili powder , paprika , and cumin .
You may need to add a little water to this to get it all mixed up .
This will be a good time to get started with our layering process .
First , I ’m going to pour a jar of Salsa Verde into my pan as a base .
If you have n’t used Salsa Verde before you may need to take a deep look inside yourself and find out what ’s been holding you back for so long .
Maybe it was pride ” ¦perhaps fear .
One thing ’s for sure : it ’s time .
Spread it around to get a thin layer .
Next , we ’ll layer on some flour tortillas .
lay them out like lasagna noodles .
It ’s okay if they overlap .
Once you ’ve got the tortillas laid out , you can spread on a layer of rice .
Use half of it .
After the rice is spread out … layer on some cheese .
1 /2 of the cheese goes here .
After the cheese , throw on another layer of tortillas .
Then , this is where I like to add some enchilada sauce .
Spread it out …
Now toss your ground beef mixture on there .
If corn has a home …it ’s here .
Go home corn , go home .
The other half of your rice will go nicely here .
Our remaining cheese goes on top of everything …including the other layer of Salsa Verde that I forgot to take a picture of .
Trust me — it ’s under there , though .
I like to sprinkle the top with something spicy .
Cayenne pepper and paprika work well here .
Now , slide this puppy into a 375 º oven for 25 - 35 minutes until all the cheese has gotten melty and crusty and delicious looking .
You will not believe how good this is .
Serve it up with sour cream on the side and some cilantro on top .
Bliss I tell you …bliss .
Try it tonight !
Love Wins ,
Ryan

With world markets verging on panic , the G - 7 , the group of leading industrialized economies , met over the weekend to take drastic action to prop up the banking system .
The emergency meeting underscored the failure of the Bush / Paulson Wall Street bailout plan to stanch the financial bleeding , despite White House rhetoric and the support of key Democrats , including Barack Obama .
As news analyst Pepe Escobar notes , top economists have criticized the mechanics of the Bush / Paulson plan , which concentrates power on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and his former Goldman Sachs colleagues .
There are also questions about how systemic issues contribute to the crisis , including the half - trillion - dollar U.S. budget deficit and U.S. military spending to support two wars .

Gwen Ifill : Conservatives used me to change the subject David Edwards and Andrew McLemore
Published : Sunday October 5 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin had announced during Thursday 's debate that she " may not answer the questions that either the moderator or you want to hear . "
In other words , she " blew me off I think is the technical term , " moderator Gwen Ifill of PBS said Sunday .
Palin avoided answering questions 10 times by being non-specific or simply pivoting away to another issue , Politico reported .
Ifill explained to NBC's Tom Brokaw how the event had been presented beforehand compared to what actually happened on stage .
She said that if the candidates decide they are not going to debate one another , " there is very little a moderator can do other than say , ' No , no , no , listen , please answer the question . "
Ifill also related the difficulty of having been thrust into the media spotlight when prior to the debate , conservatives called for Ifill to be replaced as the debate moderator because she is writing a book partially about Obama .
" What I discovered this week , in an uncomfortable way , is that when they throw everything in the mix to change the subject that you can get in the way .
I got in the way of it this week .
It was an interesting -- I kind of did n't pay attention to a lot of it -- but it was interesting to realize that if changing the subject from the stakes of vice president meant talking about the moderator instead of talking about the candidate , they would do that .
If that meant raising questions about anything else that 's out there -- which is why if you leard one thing about this campaign is every week it will be something else . "

David Tennant , Patrick Stewart , and Avery Brooks have all performed Shakespeare , proving that the Bard can benefit from actors who 've cruised through space and time .
And science fiction has had more than its share of Shakespearean influence : not just lines used here and there , but futuristic adaptations of his plays and mind - bending scenarios with the Bard himself as the star .
Below , we 've explored enough Shakespearey scifi to " engage " your English papers for the next ten years .

Forbidden Planet : Perhaps the best - known scifi adaptation of Shakespeare 's work , Forbidden Planet transplants the action of The Tempest to the near - deserted planet Altair IV .
Philologist Edward Morbius takes the place of the sorcerer Prospero and his daughter Altaira stands in for the beautiful , sheltered Miranda .
The magic and spirits of the original play are replaced with alien technology ; just as the now - dead witch Sycorax enslaved the sprite Ariel and birthed Caliban , so too did the extinct Krell build the technology that created Robby the Robot and the Creature from the Id .

Shakespeare in Star Trek :
As pervasive as Shakespeare is , few series have quite the love affair with the Bard that Star Trek does .
Picard uses Hamlet to debate mankind 's nature with Q. Data performs The Tempest and Henry V to better understand human emotions .
And episodes of the original series contain elements of Shakespeare 's plays , including “ The Conscience of the King ” ( Hamlet ) and “ Catspaw ” ( Macbeth ) , casting Kirk as the male lead .
But Star Trek 's most significant Shakespearean adaptation is the Klingon Language Institutes 's translation of Hamlet into , as Chancellor Gorkon put it , “ the original Klingon . ”
The Tragedy of Khamlet , Son of the Emperor of Qo'nos is said to be the work of Klingon playwright Wil'yam Shex 'pir , whose work and history have been distorted by Federation propaganda .

Shakespeare in Doctor Who : William Shakespeare himself makes a brief appearance on the Time - Space Visualizer in the episode “ The Chase , ” but does n't actually meet the Doctor on screen until “ The Shakespeare Code . ”
Being the genius of the human condition that he is , Will quickly pegs the Doctor as an alien and Martha Jones as a traveler from the future .
In the meantime , the mystery of the lost play Love 's Labour 's Won is solved ( it was sucked through a portal into another dimension ) , and the episode cheekily suggests that Shakespeare got the idea for the name “ Sycorax ” from the Doctor , and not the other way around .
The Doctor alludes to several other off - screen meetings with the poet , and the two hang out in the novel The Empire of Glass and the audiodrama “ The Kingmaker . ” Isaac Asimov “ The Immortal Bard ” : As in Doctor Who , Isaac Asimov supposes that Shakespeare has some special power to comprehend the future beyond that of mere mortals .
In his story , a physics professor claims that he can transport people from the past to the present .
Though he tried it with many illustrious minds – Galileo , Archimedes , Isaac Newton – Shakespeare was the only one who could wrap his mind around modern society .
Of course , it all goes to pot when he enrolls Will in a colleague 's course on Shakespearean literature .
It would n't be Asimov 's last meeting with the man ; in 1970 , he published a two - volume guide to Shakespeare 's plays .
Frank Ramirez “ The Merchant of Stratford ” : Ever wondered just how Shakespeare deals with all those time travelers ?
When the first time traveler decides to head back to 1615 Stratford , he finds that Shakespeare has already set up a cottage industry as a time travel tourist attraction .
After getting time travelers from all different eras to bring him works of science fiction , Shakespeare starts selling his own collected works to the people of the future , including his unpublished science fiction novel Go-Captains in Nostrilla , based on Cordwainer Smith 's novel .

Romeo x Juliet :
Set in a future city that hovers above a devastated Earth , the anime series keeps the themes of star - crossed lovers from warring families , but plays with the characters and their roles .
Romeo is still an idle young nobleman who falls for Rosaline , then Juliet , but Juliet is an orphan , hardened by life under the oppressive Lord Montague .
As the love story gets tangled up in the tale of rebellion and revenge , characters from other Shakespeare plays keep wandering in : Portia , Ophelia , Emilia , and Hermione .
Harry Harrison “ A Fragment of Manuscript ” : Harrison imagines that Shakespeare meant for some of his plays to be science fiction in the first place .
In his story , he discovers a manuscript for the original version of A Midsummer Night 's Dream , which , he learns , was a work of science fiction rather than a work of fantasy .
But the Bard recognizes that he is too far ahead of his time for his contemporary audience , and has attached a note to revise the script accordingly .
William Sanders “ The Undiscovered ” : Sanders puts Shakespeare across the ocean , where , in the company of a Cherokee tribe , he becomes “ Spearshaker . ”
Doing what he does best , he tries to stage a production of Hamlet for the members of the tribe , but , contrary to theories on the universalness of Shakespeare , they do n't really get what he 's trying to do .

Harry Turtledove , Ruled Britannia : Shakespeare also finds his way into Turtledove 's alternate history novel about the Spanish occupation of England during the Elizabethan period .
English revolutionaries tap Shakespeare to compose a play about Boudicca , an ancient queen who led a rebellion against occupying Roman forces , hoping to stir up similar revolutionary attitudes .
This leaves Turtledove to try his hand at composing lines in the style of Shakespeare .
Nick O'Donohoe , Too , Too Solid Flesh :
In a future where theater has mostly died out , a troupe of android actors performs Hamlet every night .
But , because the androids were constructed specifically for their roles , they tend to stay in character even when they 're off - duty .
And when the troupe 's designer and manager turns up dead , the Hamlet actor decides to investigate the mystery .

King Lear : Jean - Luc
Godard 's film takes place in a parallel universe where Chernobyl has destroyed much of human civilization , notably works of art .
William Shakespeare Jr.the Fifth ( Peter Sellers ) has been tasked with restoring his illustrious ancestor 's work to the human canon .
In the course of his work he encounters the gangster Don Learo ( Burgess Meredith ) and his daughter Cordelia ( Molly Ringwald ) .
Fortunately for Mr. Shakespeare , on the rare occasions this pair speaks to one another , it is in lines from King Lear , which Shakespeare conveniently records in his notebook .
A demonstrator is pulled off the stage after she approached KarlRove and tried to arrest him at a panel discussion at the 2008 Mortgage Bankers Association Conference and Expo October 21 , 2008 in San Francisco , California .

An upcoming watchdog report indicates that two new Internal Revenue Service computer systems have security vulnerabilities .
Here , the IRS headquarters building in Washington is seen .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
Two new IRS computer systems that will eventually cost taxpayers almost $ 2 billion are being put into service despite known security and privacy vulnerabilities , a Treasury watchdog said in a report coming out Thursday .
The office of the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said Internal Revenue Service officials failed to ensure that identified weaknesses had been addressed before putting the new systems into use .
Inspector General J. Russell George said it was " very troublesome " that the IRS " was aware of , and even self - identified , these weaknesses . "
The IRS , in a statement , said security of taxpayer data " is of paramount importance " to the agency and that , as noted in the report , it had implemented many of its recommendations and taken steps to improve security .
It stressed that no taxpayer data has been harmed and numerous security safeguards were in place .
The report focused on the Customer Account Data Engine , which will provide the foundation for managing all taxpayer accounts , and the Account Management Services system , which will provide faster and improved access by employees to taxpayer account data .
Both systems are gradually being put into use .
CADE , expected to cost more than $ 1 billion through 2012 to develop and operate , this year processed about 20 % of the 142 billion returns filed .
The Account Management Services system , AMS , still in its initial stages , will cost more than $ 700 million to develop and maintain through 2024 .
The IG report said the IRS organizations responsible for giving the go - ahead to partial deployment of the systems were aware of security and privacy problems but did not consider them significant .
But it said those vulnerabilities increased the risks that unscrupulous people could gain access to vast amounts of taxpayer information with little chance of detection and that systems could not be recovered effectively during an emergency .
It said administrators to the CADE system could access , modify and delete information without being detected , that contractors could make changes to system configurations without approval and that backup tapes from offsite storage facilities were not adequately tested to ensure that data would be restored without errors or losses .
The report said the CADE system might be vulnerable to malicious code attacks such as computer viruses .
Similarly , it said auditing controls for the AMS system were not sufficient to ensure that illegal browsing , changes or theft of taxpayer files would be detected .
The report recommended that the committee in charge of approving implementation of new stages of the systems consider all security vulnerabilities before giving that approval and that interim measures be put in place when significant security problems have been identified .
It said the IRS agreed with their recommendations .

The only thing cooler than a review of the new Millennium Falcon toy ?
A review of the Millennium Falcon toy by geek storyteller Jesse Alexander , who has worked on Giz favorites like Heroes , Alias and Lost .
P.S. I think that 's an Emmy on his desk .
More of Jesse 's impressions , below :

" The new Legacy Collection Millennium Falcon from Hasbro is the greatest Star Wars toy ever made .
No joke .
Beats Amidala ’s Royal Starship .
Beats the AT - AT .
And even the Imperial Troop Transporter .
This Falcon is the “ hunk of junk ” we ’ve been waiting for since May ' 77 .
First thing you ’ll notice when you crack the cardboard is her size .
Some 30 percent larger than the original from back in the day .
You know — the one your Mom tossed in the garbage while you were in college rolling D20’s and learning BASIC .
So prepare to upgrade your playroom / display case shelves to docking bay 94 size .

This Falcon has plenty of interior room for parties .
And does n’t lack for little nubs to slot your figures atop .
Or chairs where they can take a seat .
The chairs are particularly cool .
Remember those babies ?
From the scene where Luke trains with the saber and Han flips him attitude ?
The ones that George Lucas copied for his custom Lear Jet back in the ' 80s .
You knew that , right ?
That he took a large portion of his Star Wars gold and used it to have the interior of his private plane modified to resemble the interior of the Falcon !
( Not true , of course .
But still — my favorite old school SW rumor ! )
This Falcon ’s paint job is slick .
And so detailed I ’m guessing it must ’ve been done by next - gen droids , or Jawa slave children with very small hands .
All the tech in this Falcon is state of the art .
She ’s got sound effects up the gundark .
Triggered via multiple buttons strategically placed around her sturdy Corellian hull .
The orange light at the rear of the cockpit is cool .
As is the sweet blue band of engine light that accompanies the jump to hyperspace .
But my fave feature has to be the twin LED ’s that illuminate when the boarding ramp slowly lowers at the touch of a button .
Perfect for lighting up the squishy floor of any odd looking asteroid cave .

One can only hope this magnificent spice smuggler heralds an approaching renaissance from the boffins at Hasbro .
The build quality , attention to detail , and sheer number of features on the Legacy Collection Falcon will raise the expectations of Star Wars Fans the republic over .
Owning your own freighter ai n’t cheap .
You may need to sell your mint in - box landspeeder from ’ 77 to cover the cost .
But she ’s worth it .
See you on the Kessel run !
I think 11 parsecs is doable ! "

For about 15 years , scientists have known that certain " junk " DNA -- repetitive DNA segments previously thought to have no function -- could evolve into exons , which are the building blocks for protein - coding genes in higher organisms like animals and plants .
Now , a University of Iowa study has found evidence that a significant number of exons created from junk DNA seem to play a role in gene regulation .
The findings , which increase understanding of how humans differ from other animals , including non-human primates , appear Oct. 17 in the open- access journal PLoS Genetics .
Nearly half of human DNA consists of repetitive DNA , including transposons , which can " transpose " or move around to different positions within the genome .
A type of transposon called retrotransposons are transcribed into RNA and then reintegrated into the genomic DNA .
The most common form of retrotransposons in the human genome are Alu elements , which have more than one million copies and occupy approximately 10 percent of the human genome .
" Alu elements are a major source of new exons .
Because
Alu is a primate - specific retrotransposon , creation of new exons from Alu may contribute to unique traits of primates , so we want to better understand this process , " said the study 's senior author Yi Xing , Ph.D. , assistant professor of internal medicine and biomedical engineering , who holds a joint appointment in the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and the UI College of Engineering .
To study the impact of Alu - derived exons on human gene expression , the researchers used a high - density exon microarray .
The technology has nearly six million probes for monitoring the expression patterns of all human exons .
Using data generated by these microarrays , the scientists analyzed 330 Alu - derived exons in 11 human tissues .
The team then identified a number of exons with interesting expression and functional characteristics .
" Hundreds of exons in the human genome were created from Alu elements .
The whole - genome exon microarray allowed us to quickly identify exons that most likely contribute to the regulation of gene expression and function , " said Lan Lin , Ph.D. , University of Iowa postdoctoral fellow in internal medicine and the lead author of this study .
Analysis of one human gene , SEPN1 , which is known to be involved in a type of muscular dystrophy , along with comparative data from chimpanzee and macaque tissues , suggested that the presence of a muscle - specific Alu - derived exon resulted from a human - specific change that occurred after humans and chimpanzees diverged evolutionarily .
" In this case , this exon is only expressed at a high level in the human muscle but not in any other human or non-human primate tissue , so this implies that the exon plays a functional role in muscle , and this role is human - specific , " said Xing , who is also affiliated with University of Iowa Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology .

仕事の出張だから、ちょっとためらいもあったんですが、旅の恥はかき捨てと言い訳する。
ニューヨークカジノにも詳しい者が一人いて、色々なゲームの遊び方を教えてもらい、全員思い切り楽しむ。
負けてもともとの気持ちがあるも、最初に小さく勝ったら欲が増し、徐々に大きなお金を掛ける。
そしてプラスマイナスの分岐点から、マイナス方向に入った時、ニューヨークカジノの大きな落とし穴にハマる。
取り返そうと掛け続けるも、５回連続で負け続け、後味が悪い結果になっちゃったよ。

Palin grew up in Alaska , where people hunt and fish .
So be it .
This is not going to be a dissertation on animal rights or a moral critique on her spare time activities .
Moose and salmon and wild birds are fair game for hunters in her neck of the woods , and Sarah hunts and fishes with the best of them .
Good for her .
But in her new role as the GOP veep candidate Sarah Palin has crossed a line , even for a hunter .
This time she has set her sights on a new and unfamiliar target .
This time she is not aiming at a herd or a bevy or a flock .
This time she is going after a large group of intelligent , thinking Americans known as women voters .
.
And this time , as she hunts in uncharted territory , Sarah Palin has made a strategic error .
For some distorted reason , Palin thinks she is hunting lemmings .
Please do n’t email TvNews.org to explain that lemmings really do not commit mass suicide .
I know that , I really do .
But these little rodents serve as an effective metaphor for people who blindly follow the opinions of others , often with disastrous consequences .
In a previous editorial , I described the herd mentality of many US legislators as they fell in line and supported the insane and destructive policies of the Bush / Cheney administration , and I still stand by that portrayal .
So , for Sarah Palin , the GOP party hacks , and the idiot corporate media punditry to assume that millions of American women will abandon their convictions , their ideals , their needs and their politics to vote for a candidate just because she has a uterus is totally ridiculous , and highly , highly insulting .
It boggles the mind , it really does .
Surely , Sarah Palin will delight those who support her right wing , ultra conservative views on issues such as choice , gay rights , global warming , evolution , gun control and war .
Without question , the GOP base has been energized by a candidate whose extreme ideology makes even the late Jerry Falwell sound like a benign moderate .
But to suppose that any other group of Americans will collectively dismiss the problems that confront this nation and cast a collective gender vote is absurd .
I have to believe that Sarah Palin and her GOP partners also believe that thinking women would rally around Ann Coulter , had she been the nominee .
What nonsense .
This election is not about Hillary supporters or glass ceilings .
It is about a nation on the edge of total disaster .
When Sarah Palin suggested that she was the natural successor to the legacies of Clinton and Ferraro , she showed a cynical and calculated disrespect for every voter in the nation , and most particularly for women .
Sarah Palin does not support a single policy for which Clinton and Ferraro fought their entire political lives .
In the end , people will vote on the issues , and on the quality of the candidates before them .
To suggest otherwise is demeaning and belittling to us all .
I truly hope that I am right , and that no thinking man or woman will cast a vote in this historical election solely because the slate includes a woman .
Sarah Palin is emerging from Alaska into big time national politics where she has to convince the American public that her values are worthy of their vote .
But first , she has to call off the hunt and deal with the reality that the women of America will not self destruct on her behalf .
As they campaign for the most important positions in the nation , Sarah Palin and John McCain must understand that this is not lemming season in America .
One of my favorite things about C++ was its predictable stack unwinding .
This could be combined with anonymous scopes for some powerful techniques .
( I learned all about this from Steve ) For example , I might want to hold onto a lock to something for a particular time .
I could simply make an object which allocates the lock in its constructor and releases it in its destructor .
// Anonymous scope for lock
{
ResourceLock lock ;
//…
}
ResourceLock allocates the resource it its constructor .
It lives on the stack until the local block is exited , whereupon its destructor is called and the lock is released .
The really great thing about this technique , especially for things like locks , is that it ’s entirely exception safe .
Can we do something similar in C# ?
Method 1 : IDisposable / using
The C# way of doing predictable allocation is IDisposable .
And since we have a bit of syntax sugar in the ‘ using ’ block to make it exception safe , we may as well use it for this purpose .
class ResourceLock : IDisposable
{
public ResourceLock ( )
{
// allocate the lock
}
public Dispose ( )
{
// release the lock
}
}
// usage example
using ( new ResourceLock ( ) )
{
// the lock is held here …
}
// … and released here
Hopefully the usage is pretty obvious .
I like this method because the usage syntax is pretty good .
In fact I do n’t know of another method for things like locks .
But there are other scenarios where you might want to do a bit more .
Method 2 : Delegate passing
You ’ll be familiar with this technique if you ’ve ever used Ruby or Smalltalk .
Those languages ( and others ) have native support for blocks .
It ’s not quite as nice in C # but still usable .
Let ’s take the example of data binding .
There are often cases where you need to do a batch of operations on a class which can throw change events .
While it ’s not strictly incorrect to throw an event after each operation , it can be a big performance problem .
So we want disable change notification while the operations are in progress and throw a single change event when they ’re done .
Think of it as a kind of data - binding transaction .
We ’ll implement the Transaction method using a Delegate parameter :
// A class which is observable in some way class DataBindingClass { public void Transaction ( Action a ) { try { SuspendChangeNotification ( ) ; a( ) ; } finally { ResumeChangeNotification ( ) ; NotifyObserversOfChange( ) ; } } }
By passing an anonymous delegate to this method , we get an acceptable ( but not great ) syntax .
public void DoStuff ( DataBindingClass db ) { db. Transaction ( delegate ( ) { // do some stuff } ) ; }
Do n’t forget that you can pull in variables from the surrounding scope via closure .
That ’s really the only reason this technique is worth bothering with .
Method 3 : IEnumerable / yield return / continuations
Okay , we ’ve now stepped clearly into the realm of abuse .
Please do n’t do this in your code .
But in the interest of completeness …
Since the yield return syntax is really a form of continuation , we can get the same general scoping effect with a little bit of creativity .
// A class which is observable in some way class DataBindingClass { public IEnumerable < int > Transaction ( ) { try { SuspendChangeNotification ( ) ; yield return 42 ; } finally { ResumeChangeNotification ( ) ; NotifyObserversOfChange( ) ; } } } // usage example public void DoStuff ( DataBindingClass db ) { foreach ( var i in db .
Transaction ( ) ) { // do some stuff } }
As you can see , we abuse the ability of foreach to iterate over any IEnumerable to simulate a block syntax .
In this case the block is only called once , so the loop only runs one time .
The particular value we yield out Transaction ( ) is completely arbitrary , as is the type .
It ’s only there to fool the loop into running .
In summary
C# gives us some reasonable tools here .
I recommend method 2 ( delegate passing ) for most cases – it ’s very flexible and the syntax is reasonable .
Ethnic and racial minorities will comprise a majority of the nation ’s population in a little more than a generation , according to new Census Bureau projections , a transformation that is occurring faster than anticipated just a few years ago .
The census calculates that by 2042 , Americans who identify themselves as Hispanic , black , Asian , American Indian , Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander will together outnumber non-Hispanic whites .
Four years ago , officials had projected the shift would come in 2050 .
The main reason for the accelerating change is significantly higher birthrates among immigrants .
Another factor is the influx of foreigners , rising from about 1.3 million annually today to more than 2 million a year by midcentury , according to projections based on current immigration policies .
“ No other country has experienced such rapid racial and ethnic change , ” said Mark Mather , a demographer with the Population Reference Bureau , a research organization in Washington .
BELLMORE , New York ( CNN ) --
Walking through a crowded shopping mall can bring back memories of war .
The shifting crowds , the jostle of passers - by and the din can all trigger Army Sgt. Kristofer Goldsmith 's post - traumatic stress disorder .
Upon finishing high school , Kris Goldsmith fulfilled his dream of enlisting in the Army .
He was sent to Iraq .
" You get used to scanning what everybody 's doing .
Your brain just starts working so fast and it's purely instinctual because you want to know what everyone 's intent is around you , " said Goldsmith , who served four years in active duty .
" You want to know if anyone has the intent to harm you or the capabilities to harm you . "
That hyper -vigilance is one common symptom of post - traumatic stress disorder .
PTSD , an anxiety disorder , can develop after a terrifying or life - threatening event , or a series of events causing extreme stress .
It 's a complex disorder that displays myriad symptoms .
People may become more depressed , aggressive , or emotionally detached .
For Goldsmith , the chest - tightening anxiety attacks and trouble sleeping he experienced after returning from Iraq in 2005 indicated he was suffering from PTSD .
" With PTSD comes anxiety problems , depression problems ... I get flashes of rage , which goes hand in hand with alcoholism I 've been fighting since I got back from Iraq , " Goldsmith said .
Dr Gupta : Watch more on Kris Goldsmith 's war experience »
As more troops return from the battlefield , the U.S. military faces a burgeoning dilemma of diagnosing and treating PTSD .
According to the latest Pentagon study , published in 2004 , about one in six veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan suffers from PTSD , depression or anxiety .
Learn more about PTSD
A more recent RAND Corp. study , released in April this year , found that nearly 20 percent -- or one in five returning war veterans -- reported symptoms of post - traumatic stress disorder or major depression .
But , only slightly more than half of them sought treatment , the study found .
That compares with a prevalence of 4 percent for the general U.S. population , according to a 2005 study in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
As soon as he graduated from high school , Goldsmith fulfilled his childhood dream of enlisting in the Army .
After his first duty station at Fort Stewart , Georgia , he and the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division deployed to Iraq .
His Battalion occupied Sadr City in January 2005 .
Carrying the rank of private at the time , Goldsmith had trained as a forward observer in charge of directing artillery .
But once he set foot in Iraq , his job duties shifted .
At the time , radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al - Sadr had ordered his Mehdi Army militia to observe a cease - fire , so gun and mortar fire were infrequent .
Instead , Goldsmith was charged with documenting everything his platoon encountered .
At first , he was reporting on the sewage , water , electrical and trash systems in the sprawling Baghdad slum of Sadr City .
But he soon found himself documenting Iraqi - on - Iraqi violence instead .
" There started to be a lot of murders in Sadr City .
I was a 19 - year - old kid taking pictures of mutilated men , women and boys and little girls .
Those are the type of images that never really go away , " he recalled .
In late 2005 , Goldsmith returned from Iraq .
He found himself profoundly changed : drinking heavily every day , sleeping too much or too little , displaying an uncontrollable temper .
Violence and physical fights became a regular part of going out with friends .
He remembers choking someone into unconsciousness at a party .
" Without saying a word , without warning , I wrapped my arms around this kid's neck and I choked him until he stopped breathing ....
" I was covered in my blood and his from rolling around in broken glass as I was strangling him .
And I mean that 's not who I was before I deployed . "
Goldsmith 's personal life was spinning out of control .
Back from the Battle Anderson Cooper and MTV shine a light on issues facing young veterans .
A special hour on CNN .
Sat & Sun , 8 p.m. ET AC360 »
All the while , Goldsmith 's military career was flourishing .
He received the Army Commendation Medal for his service in Iraq .
He was promoted from private to sergeant in May 2006 .
But he looked forward to May 2007 and the end of his Army contract as a chance to recover and get back to normal .
" I just wanted to get out of the Army , and I figured all my problems would go away once I got out of the service , " he said .
But his breaking point came when his unit was given " stop - loss " orders in early 2007 .
Under stop - loss , military personnel are forced to stay beyond their volunteer commitments .
" Those stop - loss orders were saying that I was going to deploy to Iraq the same week that I was supposed to be getting out of the Army , " Goldsmith said .
The stop - loss set in motion an unimaginable set of events for Goldsmith .
In March 2007 , he went to the Winn Army Community Hospital at Fort Stewart with what he believed to be a heart attack .
After cardiac testing , doctors said it was most likely a panic attack and directed him to the behavioral health clinic on base .
That same day , doctors told Goldsmith he had an " adjustment disorder with disturbance of emotions and conduct . "
He was told to attend group therapy sessions and given an appointment with a psychiatrist .
He was found to have chronic severe depression , prescribed the anti-depressant Celexa and cleared for duty .
Goldsmith said he felt helpless and out of options .

" The night before I was supposed to deploy to Iraq on Memorial Day of 2007 , I tried to take my fate into my own hands .
What I wanted to do was make the issue of stop - loss something that people talk about and give people reason to fight against it because I had felt like my entire life had just been raped of every ounce of freedom and liberty that I had thought I was joining the Army to protect , " Goldsmith said .
" So I took a black Sharpie magic marker and I wrote across my arms ' Stop - loss killed me .
End stop - loss now . '
I took my half bottle of Percocet and ... a liter and half a bottle of vodka and downed the Percocet and I chased it with the vodka and drank until I could n't drink anymore . "
To his surprise , Goldsmith survived the suicide attempt .
His unit deployed to Iraq without him and he was discharged months later .
Now 23 , he lives with his parents in Long Island , New York .
His post - traumatic stress disorder was diagnosed months after his homecoming at a Veterans Affairs Hospital .
He receives $ 700 in disability every month .
These days , Goldsmith spends much of his time working with veterans ' rights groups and in the peace and anti-war movement .
Earlier this year , he testified before Congress ' Out of Iraq Caucus as a member of the organization " Iraq Veterans Against the War . "
" I do n't think that my 18 - year old self would recognize who I am today .
At the age of 18 , I thought that I was going to be a career soldier .... I never imagined speaking out . "

Broccoli may help ward off prostate cancer Eating broccoli could reverse the damage caused by diabetes to heart blood vessels , research suggests .
A University of Warwick team believe the key is a compound found in the vegetable , called sulforaphane .
It encourages production of enzymes which protect the blood vessels , and a reduction in high levels of molecules which cause significant cell damage .
Brassica vegetables such as broccoli have previously been linked to a lower risk of heart attacks and strokes .
Our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
Professor Paul Thornalley
University of Warwick People with diabetes are up to five times more likely to develop cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and strokes ; both are linked to damaged blood vessels .
The Warwick team , whose work is reported in the journal Diabetes , tested the effects of sulforaphane on blood vessel cells damaged by high glucose levels ( hyperglycaemia ) , which are associated with diabetes .
They recorded a 73 % reduction of molecules in the body called Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) .
Hyperglycaemia can cause levels of ROS to increase three - fold and such high levels can damage human cells .
The researchers also found that sulforaphane activated a protein in the body called nrf2 , which protects cells and tissues from damage by activating protective antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes .
Countering vascular disease Lead researcher Professor Paul Thornalley said : " Our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes .
" In future , it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients .
We expect that it will . "
Dr Iain Frame , director of research at the charity Diabetes UK , stressed that research carried out on cells in the lab was a long way from the real life situation .
However , he said : " It is encouraging to see that Professor Thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes .
" It also may help add some scientific weight to the argument that eating broccoli is good for you . "

A new review of more than 100 studies on the safety of mobile phones has concluded that cellular devices are poised to cause an epidemic of brain tumors that will kill more people than smoking or asbestos .
The review was conducted by neurosurgeon Vini Khurana , who has received more than 14 awards in the past 16 years , who made headlines worldwide with his warnings .
He called upon the industry to immediately work to reduce people 's exposure to the radiation from mobile phones .
According to Khurana , research demonstrates that long - term use of mobile handsets , more than 10 years , can double the risk of contracting brain cancer .
While a number of studies have concluded that there is no such risk , Khurana said that most of those studies only examined short - term use .
But because a brain tumor can take 10 years to develop , studies without a long follow - up period are largely meaningless .
" There is a significant and increasing body of evidence for a link between mobile phone usage and certain brain tumors , " Khurana said , a link that will be " definitively proven " within 10 years .
Khurana urged people to minimize their use of mobile phones , particularly handsets .
He also urged the industry to act immediately to reduce exposure to radiation from the devices .
While mobile phones may save lives in certain emergency situations , Khurana said , brain cancer is " a life - ending diagnosis . "
" It is anticipated that this danger has far broader public health ramifications than asbestos and smoking , " Khurana said .
While one billion people worldwide smoke tobacco , three times as many now use mobile phones Smoking is responsible for five million deaths each year .
While the United Kingdom ' snewspaper described Khurana 's study as " the most devastating indictment yet published of the health risks " of mobile phones , his warning is not the first .
A Swedish study in 2006 concluded that people who used mobile phones for an hour or more each day had a 240 percent higher brain tumor risk than non-users .
Tumors were significantly more likely to develop on the side of the head where the phone was most often used .
Inspired in part by such studies , France has warned against mobile phone use ( especially in children ) , Germany urges people to minimize their use of mobile handsets , and the European Environment Agency has called for minimizing exposure to cellular radiation .
The mechanisms by which mobile phones increase cancer risk are not well understood , but several possibilities are suspected .
Electromagnetic radiation ( EMR ) is known to directly heat up the head and brain , and can also cause thermoelectric effects on cells and DNA .
According to Khurana , even bluetooth devices and unshielded headsets merely turn the head into an antenna that bombards itself with radiation .
Children , with thinner skulls than adults , are particularly at risk .
" EMR rays in general cause irritation , concentration lapses and in many cases even proliferation of cells which cause cancer , " said Dr Rajeev Ranjan , a New Delhi neurologist .
Radiation can also interfere with the functioning of medical devices like pacemakers .
EMR also " affect[s ] the DNA and cause [s ] problems in cell recovery and cell growth , " said New Delhi neurologist Anshu Rohatgi .
Khurana warned that if immediate measures are not taken , mobile phones will soon be responsible for a massive public health crisis .
"
We are currently experiencing a reactively unchecked and dangerous situation , " he said .
Because mobile phone use began in the mid-1980s and it can take up to 20 years to diagnose a malignant solid brain tumor , he said , " In the years 2008 - 2012 , we will have reached the appropriate length of follow - up time to begin to definitively observe the impact of this global technology on brain tumor incidence rates . " " Malignant brain tumor incidence and its associated death rate will be observed globally to rise within a decade from now , " Khurana said , " by which time it may be far too late to meaningfully intervene .

Amid the astonishing details of the Feds fierce money pumping , the Treasurys partial nationalization of the banking industry , and the madcap exchange of its legal tender for the banks  rotten mortgage - backed securities , we may lose sight of the overall character of these actions : they are , in effect , nothing short of a gigantic armed robbery .
Any armed robbery , of course , has two sides : on one side is the party who takes property by threatening violence against its legitimate possessor , and on the other side is the party who loses property by yielding to this threat .
Such redistribution of wealth is bad enough on its face , but in the present case its related aspects render it even more obnoxious .
What we have before us now is a systematic redistribution from the prudent and the responsible to the imprudent and the irresponsible .
Did you make your mortgage payments in full when they were due ?
Were you careful to avoid investing in incomprehensible derivatives whose failure might lead to your bankruptcy ?
Very good , sir : you are therefore entitled to relinquish substantial amounts of your wealth , either directly through ordinary taxation or indirectly through the inflation tax  and the diffuse effects of crowding out in the loanable - funds market , where the government must soon borrow hundreds of billions of dollars more than expected a few months ago .
But not to worry , because your injuries are simultaneously the means by which those who failed to act with honesty and due diligence will be rewarded .
You see , it all washes out , my dear Keynesians : we owe it to ourselves !
( Full disclosure requires admission that the substantial gainers include not only undeserving Americans , but also , among others , Arab sheiks , the Bank of Japan , and the Bank of China , which own huge heaps of agency debt ,  especially the bonds of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
You may chalk these foreigners  financial salvation up to the Bush administrations own version of the Good Neighbor Policy . )
Moralists have much grist for their mill in these events .
Economists will worry more about their incentive effects .
One thing is certain : the governments recent actions herald the ascendancy of its commitment to a policy of too cozy to fail . 
Are you from Goldman Sachs ?
Yes , well , then , here : take these billions .
Yes , yes , dont worry ; it s okay .
Weve got everything covered .
Bank of America , here , you take some , too .
Citigroup , heres yours .
Wells Fargo , Morgan Stanley , the line forms right here .
Come along , my friends , times awastin .
And dont worry about taking something that doesnt belong to you .
The president says  these efforts are designed to directly benefit the American people by stabilizing our overall financial system and helping our economy recover . 
How , exactly , will these dishonest enrichments give rise to those happy outcomes ?
What , as the pharmacologists say , is the mechanism of action ?
Well , the authorities havent spelled that out yet , but if you are a good American , youll happily trust them .
After all , Henry Paulson and his friends have always proved themselves to be financial geniuses in the past , havent they ?
( Security , get that man out of here .
Yes , that one , the one yelping about the parties responsible for this hideously tangled monkey business of mortgage - related securities , derivatives of derivatives , credit - default swaps , collateralized - debt obligations , and off - balance - sheet assets .
And keep him out . )
Dont let that troublemakers questions disturb you , gentlemen .
Those complications are all ancient history now , and this is no time for finger - pointing .
It s imperative that we move on , and were simply going to cut through the Gordian knot you tied .
We must act decisively before the entire world economy melts down or freezes up .
( The Minister of Metaphors will determine which hyperbolic term will be officially adopted for use in our G - 7 and G - 20 communiqués . )
Now , Bank of New York Mellon , JP Morgan Chase , fall in line .
You , too , State Street .
Step lively , gentlemen , and hold those purses open wide while I pour in the taxpayers  money .
Although many details remain to be worked out , and the architects of the new financial order are drawing ( and redrawing ) their blueprint as the construction proceeds , the overall logic of the new structure has already become fairly clear .
As best we can determine , the administrations theory is that the economic well - being of Americans , and indeed of people around the world , cannot be achieved without resort to the grandissimo of all grand larcenies .
Barbara Bush probably never dreamed what amazing things her rather dim - witted firstborn son would accomplish .
By the time that all of these crimes have run their course , George Walker Bush may well have proved himself to be the greatest economic wrecker and looter in the history of the world .
Of course , he does not lack for willing hands to pitch in as he rips and tears his way through the fabric of economic life .
Hank Paulson , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , and the rest of the big bankers , like the fabled Tammany Hall boss George Washington Plunkitt , have seen their chances and they took em .
At the Fed , Ben Bernanke is snatching new powers for the central bank ( and hence for himself ) as if there were no tomorrow , and using them just as rashly .
Is there a problem ?
Enormous effusions of new central - bank credit will cure it .
Inflation ?
Dont worry about that : it wont show up in full force until the day after tomorrow .
Members of Congress also love the new financial regime .
Anything that puts more money and power at the governments disposal means that the solons will have more promises to sell in their future backroom deals .
So , in short , everybody who counts is deliriously pleased with the recent turn of events .
If they say they re not happy , its only a pose , and for these professional posers and fakers , nothing comes easier than lying , stealing , and cheating .
In truth , they are now reveling in their very heaven , as the power elite always is during a crisis , even a crisis as bogus as the present one .
The great mass of the people , of course , are somewhat less happy .
Many are , as usual , simply bewildered by whats going on , and frightened by the panic they see on display in the news media .
Others , however , are actually angry , because this time they have seen through their rulers  gossamer rationales , and they realize that they , as well as their children and their grandchildren , are being impoverished in order to pass hundreds of billions of dollars along to the incompetent , dishonest , undeserving , yet politically potent , masters of high finance .
Oct. 20 , 2008 -- Medical records released by the Obama - Biden campaign suggest that vice presidential candidate Sen .
Joe Biden is in good health , according to media reports .
The campaign released Biden 's medical records to some news organizations on Monday .
They reportedly show that Biden , who is 65 , has not had another brain aneurysm since the two he suffered 20 years ago .
Biden had emergency surgery for an aneurysm in an artery in his brain two decades ago but suffered no permanent damage as a result .
An aneurysm is a bulging of an artery due to a weakened area of the vessel wall .
He also had a second , smaller , unruptured aneurysm that was removed a few months later .
An aneurysm can cause damage by crowding brain tissue , or , as was the case with Biden in 1988 , bursting and leaking blood into surrounding tissue .
Biden also had an episode of irregular heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation in July 2006 , reports said .
A stress test of the heart at the time indicated no heart disease .
He was started on aspirin therapy .
Biden also suffers from an enlarged prostate but has no signs of prostate cancer , the reports indicated .
He takes Flomax for his enlarged prostate .
He also takes allergy medications and the cholesterol - lowering drug Zocor .
Doctors for presidential candidates Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama have declared them medically fit to be to be president .
McCain allowed a group of reporters to view some of his medical records in May .
They showed that McCain , who is 72 , has had multiple diagnoses of malignant melanoma , which have been surgically removed .
McCain also has limited mobility in his arms and an abnormal gait because of injuries suffered during the Vietnam War .
Obama released a one - page letter in May from his doctor saying the candidate was in excellent health .
The letter said Obama has used Nicorette gum -- with success -- to help the candidate quit smoking .
Sarah Palin , the Republican nominee for vice president , has not released any of her medical information .
Palin is 44 years old .

China ’s state media today reports on the real reason behind the Wall Street meltdown and a subject that the mainstream US media dare not mention – the Federal Reserve ’s overissuance of currency – which the Chinese say is part of a wider agenda to justify increased control over the global economy .
The Bush administration today announced a plan to use hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money to buy up up bad mortgages and other debts .
The process of injecting more fiat money into an already over - inflated system had the desired effect – the Dow Jones shot up 450 points – but the dollar , following a brief jump , began to plummet .
According to numerous Chinese state media news sources today , the Federal Reserve ’s continued zeal for propping up the market by injecting illusory liquidity is part of an agenda to gain trust and grease the skids for increased government intervention in financial markets .
China Finance , China News and Chaobao Financial News , all state owned media outlets , slammed the Fed for taking action that will only make long term economic conditions worse and devalue the dollar by “ creating money that does not exist which leads to the inflation of liquidity , ” a policy contrary to China ’s position as a holder of vast reserves of US dollars .
The analyst quoted by Chaobao Financial News highlighted “ that when there is market failure , the paramount purpose of government intervention should be saving the market for the benefit of the people : Relief , Recovery and then Reform , ” and that “ Protecting the rights of people who are suffering in the housing market and as a result of high oil prices should be treated as a priority . ”
The analyst added that by concentrating on saving just a few large financial companies , the Fed is creating wider financial chaos while arousing anger and suspicion by “ only protecting and encouraging large companies ’ wrong doing . ”
CEIBS Professor of Economics and Finance Xu Xiaonian told a conference yesterday that “ The fundamental source of Wall Street ’s meltdown is caused by Federal Reserve overissuing currency . ”
He cautioned that the US government has already exceeded its scope in terms of intervention compared with their usual policy .
Similar sentiments were echoed by economist Zuo Xiaolie , who said that the amount of money injected into the market will have little real impact , but that such measures are a “ Narrow minded way that the Federal Reserve uses to diversify the pressure of currency adjustment to other countries , which leads to the devaluation of the dollar , causing imbalance in the global economy . ”
“ The amount of money that has been put into the market can not fundamentally save the market , ” said Xiaolie , adding that the move was merely part of an agenda to “ regain the trust and justify future further intervention in the economy . ”
On Wednesday , China ’s official People ’s Daily newspaper , the voice of the ruling Communist party , said that the US had unleashed economic “ weapons of mass destruction ” and set off a “ financial tsunami ” by allowing Wall Street lenders to trade in subprime debts and unstable financial derivatives , according to a Press TV report .
China has previously threatened to liquidate its vast holding of US treasuries , amounting to $ 1.33 trillion , if Washington imposes trade sanctions to force a yuan revaluation .
The Communist power has also repeatedly expressed its anger at the Fed ’s indifference to the weakening dollar .
If China were to dump the dollar it would likely set in motion a chain of events that would lead to a collapse of the greenback .
We know we are in trouble when the Chinese Communist Party sound like bastions of sound money policy and fiscal conservatism in comparison to the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve , who in creating more money out of thin air continue to bail out their friends on Wall Street while the economic future of hundreds of millions of American citizens is sold down the river .

" I thought ' Oh my god , It would be the highlight of my life to design a game that kids would actually use .
Steve and I did n't sleep for two days to get it done on time . "
His enthusiasm and creativity is clearly undiminished to this day : he still lies in bed at night imagining the next world changing " killer app " .
The Associated Press has released a poll that shows a much closer race than any other poll out ther .
Now , Liz “ I know what kind of donuts John McCain really likes ” Sidoti must have been gleeful that she was chosen to write John McCain ’s “ comeback ” piece .
( The infamous AP / McCain donut video is below . )
But , the poll does n’t make sense on many levels .
Here ’s one example : 45 % of this poll ’s respondents are evangelicals or born - again Christians ( this is on page 20 of the poll ’s crosstabs ( it ’s a pdf ) :
The problem ?
In 2004 , evangelicals / born - again Christians made up 23 % of voters .
But that same group makes up 44 % of likely voters in AP ’s poll released today .
That ’s almost double the number – it ’s totally implausible .
In 2000 and 2004 , there was a very aggressive push for the evangelical vote .
In 2000 , when the question was asked “ Do you consider yourself part of the conservative Christian political movement , ” 14 % of voters said “ yes ” in exit polls .
In 2004 , when the question was changed to “ Would you describe yourself as a born - again or evangelical Christian ? ” – the very category AP uses in its current poll – 23 % of voters said yes in exit polls .
Did you get that ?
The percentage of evangelicals / born - agains voting in 2004 was 23 % .
The percentage of evangelicals / born - agains that AP included in their likely voters scenario is 44 % .
That ’s almost twice as many .
Consider that 79 % of evangelicals voted Republican in the 2004 presidential elections , and we can assume that anyone calling themselves “ born - again ” might be more prone to voter Republican .
This means AP disproportionately skewed its polling towards the GOP base .
So it ’s no surprise that the AP poll shows McCain doing better than in other polls .
With such an outlier , one wonders why the brain trust at AP decided to move ahead releasing this poll .
But , the AP brain trust loves McCain .
It ’s not just Sidoti .
Remember , AP ’s Washington bureau chief almost went to work for McCain .
He ’s in that donut video , too .
As Nate Silver so clearly explains , the likely voter models being used by some pollsters , including AP ’s partner , GfK , are n’t making sense .
In fact , Nate has issued a challenge to the pollsters who have a wide gap in their models :
I would like to issue a challenge to those pollsters like Franklin & Marshall and GfK which in spite of all the facts above , are showing a substantial shift toward the Republicans when they apply their likely voter models .
E - mail me — my contact information is at the top of the page — and tell me why you think what you ’re doing is good science .
I would like to issue a challenge to the Associated Press , too :
Put aside your friendship with John McCain , please .
At least for the next two weeks , be the objective new source you used to be .

HEMPSTEAD , New York ( CNN ) -- Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain and Democrat Sen. Barack Obama faced off at Hofstra University Wednesday night in their last debate before Election Day .
Bob Schieffer of CBS was the moderator .
Here is a transcript of the debate .
Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain debate face to face Wednesday night .
Schieffer : Good evening .
And welcome to the third and last presidential debate of 2008 , sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates .
I 'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News .
The rules tonight are simple .
The subject is domestic policy .
I will divide the next hour - and - a - half into nine - minute segments .
I will ask a question at the beginning of each segment .
Each candidate will then have two minutes to respond , and then we 'll have a discussion .
I 'll encourage them to ask follow - up questions of each other .
If they do not , I will .
The audience behind me has promised to be quiet , except at this moment , when we welcome Barack Obama and John McCain .
Gentlemen , welcome .
By now , we 've heard all the talking points , so let 's try to tell the people tonight some things that they -- they have n't heard .
Let 's get to it .
Another very bad day on Wall Street , as both of you know .
Both of you proposed new plans this week to address the economic crisis .
Sen. McCain , you proposed a $ 52 billion plan that includes new tax cuts on capital gains , tax breaks for seniors , write - offs for stock losses , among other things .
Sen .
Obama , you proposed $ 60 billion in tax cuts for middle - income and lower - income people , more tax breaks to create jobs , new spending for public works projects to create jobs .
I will ask both of you :
Why is your plan better than his ?
Sen. McCain , you go first .
McCain :
Well , let -- let me say , Bob , thank you .
And thanks to Hofstra .
And , by the way , our beloved Nancy Reagan is in the hospital tonight , so our thoughts and prayers are going with you .
It 's good to see you again , Sen. Obama .
Americans are hurting right now , and they 're angry .
They 're hurting , and they 're angry .
They 're innocent victims of greed and excess on Wall Street and as well as Washington , D.C .
And they 're angry , and they have every reason to be angry .
And they want this country to go in a new direction .
And there are elements of my proposal that you just outlined which I wo n't repeat .
But we also have to have a short - term fix , in my view , and long - term fixes .
Let me just talk to you about one of the short - term fixes .
The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae that caused subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse .
I am convinced that , until we reverse this continued decline in home ownership and put a floor under it , and so that people have not only the hope and belief they can stay in their homes and realize the American dream , but that value will come up .
Now , we have allocated $ 750 billion .
Let 's take 300 of that billion and go in and buy those home loan mortgages and negotiate with those people in their homes , 11 million homes or more , so that they can afford to pay the mortgage , stay in their home .
Now , I know the criticism of this .
Well , what about the citizen that stayed in their homes ?
That paid their mortgage payments ?
It does n't help that person in their home if the next door neighbor 's house is abandoned .
And so we 've got to reverse this .
We ought to put the homeowners first .
And I am disappointed that Secretary Paulson and others have not made that their first priority .
Schieffer : All right .
Sen. Obama ?
Obama :
Well , first of all , I want to thank Hofstra University and the people of New York for hosting us tonight and it's wonderful to join Sen.
McCain again , and thank you , Bob .
I think everybody understands at this point that we are experiencing the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
And the financial rescue plan that Sen. McCain and I supported is an important first step .
And I pushed for some core principles : making sure that taxpayer can get their money back if they 're putting money up .
Making sure that CEOs are not enriching themselves through this process .
And I think that it 's going to take some time to work itself out .
But what we have n't yet seen is a rescue package for the middle class .
Because the fundamentals of the economy were weak even before this latest crisis .
So I 've proposed four specific things that I think can help .
Number one , let 's focus on jobs .
I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that 's creating a job right here in America .
Number two , let 's help families right away by providing them a tax cut -- a middle - class tax cut for people making less than $ 200,000 , and let 's allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they 're experiencing a crisis .
Now Sen.
McCain and I agree with your idea that we 've got to help homeowners .
That 's why we included in the financial package a proposal to get homeowners in a position where they can renegotiate their mortgages .
I disagree with Sen. McCain in how to do it , because the way Sen.
McCain has designed his plan , it could be a giveaway to banks if we 're buying full price for mortgages that now are worth a lot less .
And we do n't want to waste taxpayer money .
And we 've got to get the financial package working much quicker than it has been working .
Last point I want to make , though .
We 've got some long - term challenges in this economy that have to be dealt with .
We 've got to fix our energy policy that 's giving our wealth away .
We 've got to fix our health care system and we 've got to invest in our education system for every young person to be able to learn .
Schieffer : All right .
Would you like to ask him a question ?
McCain : No . I would like to mention that a couple days ago Sen.
Obama was out in Ohio and he had an encounter with a guy who 's a plumber , his name is Joe Wurzelbacher .
Joe wants to buy the business that he has been in for all of these years , worked 10 , 12 hours a day .
And he wanted to buy the business but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes .
You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket which was going to increase his taxes , which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people , which Joe was trying to realize the American dream .
Now Sen .
Obama talks about the very , very rich .
Joe , I want to tell you , I 'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for and be able -- and I 'll keep your taxes low and I 'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees .
And I will not have -- I will not stand for a tax increase on small business income .
Fifty percent of small business income taxes are paid by small businesses .
That 's 16 million jobs in America .
And what you want to do to Joe the plumber and millions more like him is have their taxes increased and not be able to realize the American dream of owning their own business .
Schieffer :
Is that what you want to do ?
McCain :
That 's what Joe believes .
Obama :
He has been watching ads of Sen. McCain's .
Let me tell you what I 'm actually going to do .
I think tax policy is a major difference between Sen. McCain and myself .
And we both want to cut taxes , the difference is who we want to cut taxes for .
Now , Sen.
McCain , the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $ 200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America .
Exxon Mobil , and other oil companies , for example , would get an additional $ 4 billion in tax breaks .
What I 've said is I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans , 95 percent .
If you make more -- if you make less than a quarter million dollars a year , then you will not see your income tax go up , your capital gains tax go up , your payroll tax .
Not one dime .
And 95 percent of working families , 95 percent of you out there , will get a tax cut .
In fact , independent studies have looked at our respective plans and have concluded that I provide three times the amount of tax relief to middle - class families than Sen. McCain does .
Now , the conversation I had with Joe the plumber , what I essentially said to him was , " Five years ago , when you were in a position to buy your business , you needed a tax cut then . "
And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber , the nurse , the firefighter , the teacher , the young entrepreneur who does n't yet have money , I want to give them a tax break now .
And that requires us to make some important choices .
The last point I 'll make about small businesses .
Not only do 98 percent of small businesses make less than $ 250,000 , but I also want to give them additional tax breaks , because they are the drivers of the economy .
They produce the most jobs .
McCain :
You know , when Sen. Obama ended up his conversation with Joe the plumber -- we need to spread the wealth around .
In other words , we 're going to take Joe 's money , give it to Sen.
Obama , and let him spread the wealth around .
I want Joe the plumber to spread that wealth around .
You told him you wanted to spread the wealth around .
The whole premise behind Sen .
Obama 's plans are class warfare , let 's spread the wealth around .
I want small businesses -- and by the way , the small businesses that we 're talking about would receive an increase in their taxes right now .
Who -- why would you want to increase anybody 's taxes right now ?
Why would you want to do that , anyone , anyone in America , when we have such a tough time , when these small business people , like Joe the plumber , are going to create jobs , unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around .
I 'm not going to ...
Obama : OK .
Can I ...
McCain :
We 're not going to do that in my administration .
Obama :
If I can answer the question .
Number one , I want to cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans .
Now , it is true that my friend and supporter , Warren Buffett , for example , could afford to pay a little more in taxes in order ...
McCain :
We 're talking about Joe the plumber .
Obama : ... in order to give -- in order to give additional tax cuts to Joe the plumber before he was at the point where he could make $ 250,000 .
Then Exxon Mobil , which made $ 12 billion , record profits , over the last several quarters , they can afford to pay a little more so that ordinary families who are hurting out there -- they 're trying to figure out how they 're going to afford food , how they 're going to save for their kids ' college education , they need a break .
So , look , nobody likes taxes .
I would prefer that none of us had to pay taxes , including myself .
But ultimately , we 've got to pay for the core investments that make this economy strong and somebody 's got to do it .
McCain : Nobody likes taxes .
Let 's not raise anybody 's taxes .
OK ?
Obama :
Well , I do n't mind paying a little more .
McCain :
The fact is that businesses in America today are paying the second highest tax rate of anywhere in the world .
Our tax rate for business in America is 35 percent .
Ireland , it 's 11 percent .
Where are companies going to go where they can create jobs and where they can do best in business ?
We need to cut the business tax rate in America .
We need to encourage business .
Now , of all times in America , we need to cut people 's taxes .
We need to encourage business , create jobs , not spread the wealth around .
Schieffer : All right .
Let 's go to another topic .
It 's related .
So if you have other things you want to say , you can get back to that .
This question goes to you first , Sen. Obama .
We found out yesterday that this year 's deficit will reach an astounding record high $ 455 billion .
Some experts say it could go to $ 1 trillion next year .
Both of you have said you want to reduce the deficit , but the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers on both of your proposals and they say the cost of your proposals , even with the savings you claim can be made , each will add more than $ 200 billion to the deficit .
Are n't you both ignoring reality ?
Wo n't some of the programs you are proposing have to be trimmed , postponed , even eliminated ?
Give us some specifics on what you 're going to cut back .
Sen. Obama ?
Obama :
Well , first of all , I think it 's important for the American public to understand that the $ 750 billion rescue package , if it 's structured properly , and , as president , I will make sure it 's structured properly , means that ultimately taxpayers get their money back , and that 's important to understand .
But there is no doubt that we 've been living beyond our means and we 're going to have to make some adjustments .
Now , what I 've done throughout this campaign is to propose a net spending cut .
I have n't made a promise about ...
Schieffer :
But you 're going to have to cut some of these programs , certainly .
Obama : Absolutely .
So let me get to that .
What I want to emphasize , though , is that I have been a strong proponent of pay - as - you - go .
Every dollar that I 've proposed , I 've proposed an additional cut so that it matches .
And some of the cuts , just to give you an example , we spend $ 15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies .
It does n't -- under the Medicare plan -- it does n't help seniors get any better .
It 's not improving our health care system .
It 's just a giveaway .
We need to eliminate a whole host of programs that do n't work .
And I want to go through the federal budget line by line , page by page , programs that do n't work , we should cut .
Programs that we need , we should make them work better .
Now , what is true is that Sen.
McCain and I have a difference in terms of the need to invest in America and the American people .
I mentioned health care earlier .
If we make investments now so that people have coverage , that we are preventing diseases , that will save on Medicare and Medicaid in the future .
If we invest in a serious energy policy , that will save in the amount of money we 're borrowing from China to send to Saudi Arabia .
If we invest now in our young people and their ability to go to college , that will allow them to drive this economy into the 21st century .
But what is absolutely true is that , once we get through this economic crisis and some of the specific proposals to get us out of this slump , that we 're not going to be able to go back to our profligate ways .
And we 're going to have to embrace a culture and an ethic of responsibility , all of us , corporations , the federal government , and individuals out there who may be living beyond their means .
Schieffer : Time 's up .
Senator ?
McCain :
Well , thank you , Bob .
I just want to get back to this home ownership .
During the Depression era , we had a thing called the home ownership loan corporation .
And they went out and bought up these mortgages .
And people were able to stay in their homes , and eventually the values of those homes went up , and they actually made money .
And , by the way , this was a proposal made by Sen.
Clinton not too long ago .
So , obviously , if we can start increasing home values , then there will be creation of wealth .
Schieffer : But what ...
McCain : But -- OK .
All right .
Schieffer :
The question was , what are you going to cut ?
McCain : Energy -- well , first -- second of all , energy independence .
We have to have nuclear power .
We have to stop sending $ 700 billion a year to countries that do n't like us very much .
It 's wind , tide , solar , natural gas , nuclear , off - shore drilling , which Sen. Obama has opposed .
And the point is that we become energy independent and we will create millions of jobs -- millions of jobs in America .
OK , what -- what would I cut ?
I would have , first of all , across - the - board spending freeze , OK ?
Some people say that 's a hatchet .
That 's a hatchet , and then I would get out a scalpel , OK ?
Because we 've got -- we have presided over the largest increase -- we 've got to have a new direction for this country .
We have presided over the largest increase in government since the Great Society .
Government spending has gone completely out of control ; $ 10 trillion dollar debt we 're giving to our kids , a half - a- trillion dollars we owe China .
I know how to save billions of dollars in defense spending .
I know how to eliminate programs .
Schieffer : Which ones ?
McCain : I have fought against -- well , one of them would be the marketing assistance program .
Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol .
I oppose subsidies for ethanol because I thought it distorted the market and created inflation ; Sen. Obama supported those subsidies .
I would eliminate the tariff on imported sugarcane - based ethanol from Brazil .
I know how to save billions .
I saved the taxpayer $ 6.8 billion by fighting a deal for a couple of years , as you might recall , that was a sweetheart deal between an aircraft manufacturer , DOD , and people ended up in jail .
But I would fight for a line - item veto , and I would certainly veto every earmark pork - barrel bill .
Sen .
Obama has asked for nearly $ 1 billion in pork - barrel earmark projects ...
Schieffer : Time 's up .
McCain : ... including $ 3 million for an overhead projector in a planetarium in his hometown .
That 's not the way we cut -- we 'll cut out all the pork .
Schieffer : Time 's up .
Obama :
Well , look , I think that we do have a disagreement about an across - the - board spending freeze .
It sounds good .
It 's proposed periodically .
It does n't happen .
And , in fact , an across - the - board spending freeze is a hatchet , and we do need a scalpel , because there are some programs that do n't work at all .
There are some programs that are underfunded .
And I want to make sure that we are focused on those programs that work .
Now , Sen. McCain talks a lot about earmarks .
That 's one of the centerpieces of his campaign .
Earmarks account for 0.5 percent of the total federal budget .
There 's no doubt that the system needs reform and there are a lot of screwy things that we end up spending money on , and they need to be eliminated .
But it 's not going to solve the problem .
Now , the last thing I think we have to focus on is a little bit of history , just so that we understand what we 're doing going forward .
When President Bush came into office , we had a budget surplus and the national debt was a little over $ 5 trillion .
It has doubled over the last eight years .
Obama :
And we are now looking at a deficit of well over half a trillion dollars .
So one of the things that I think we have to recognize is pursuing the same kinds of policies that we pursued over the last eight years is not going to bring down the deficit .
And , frankly , Sen. McCain voted for four out of five of President Bush 's budgets .
We 've got to take this in a new direction , that 's what I propose as president .
Schieffer :
Do either of you think you can balance the budget in four years ?
You have said previously you thought you could , Sen. McCain .
McCain : Sure I do .
And let me tell you ...
Schieffer :
You can still do that ?
McCain : Yes .
Sen. Obama , I am not President Bush .
If you wanted to run against President Bush , you should have run four years ago .
I 'm going to give a new direction to this economy in this country .
Sen .
Obama talks about voting for budgets .
He voted twice for a budget resolution that increases the taxes on individuals making $ 42,000 a year .
Of course , we can take a hatchet and a scalpel to this budget .
It 's completely out of control .
The mayor of New York , Mayor Bloomberg , just imposed an across - the - board spending freeze on New York City .
They 're doing it all over America because they have to .
Because they have to balance their budgets .
I will balance our budgets and I will get them and I will ...
Schieffer :
In four years ?
McCain : ... reduce this -- I can -- we can do it with this kind of job creation of energy independence .
Now , look , Americans are hurting tonight and they 're angry and I understand that , and they want a new direction .
I can bring them in that direction by eliminating spending .
Sen .
Obama talks about the budgets I voted for .
He voted for the last two budgets that had that $ 24 billion more in spending than the budget that the Bush administration proposed .
He voted for the energy bill that was full of goodies for the oil companies that I opposed .
So the fact is , let 's look at our records , Sen. Obama .
Let 's look at it as graded by the National Taxpayers Union and the Citizens Against Government Waste and the other watchdog organizations .
I have fought against spending .
I have fought against special interests .
I have fought for reform .
You have to tell me one time when you have stood up with the leaders of your party on one single major issue .
Schieffer : Barack .
Obama :
Well , there 's a lot of stuff that was put out there , so let me try to address it .
First of all , in terms of standing up to the leaders of my party , the first major bill that I voted on in the Senate was in support of tort reform , which was n't very popular with trial lawyers , a major constituency in the Democratic Party .
I support ...
McCain :
An overwhelming vote .
Obama : I support charter schools and pay for performance for teachers .
Does n't make me popular with the teachers union .
I support clean coal technology .
Does n't make me popular with environmentalists .
So I 've got a history of reaching across the aisle .
Now with respect to a couple of things Sen. McCain said , the notion that I voted for a tax increase for people making $ 42,000 a year has been disputed by everybody who has looked at this claim that Sen.
McCain keeps on making .
Even FOX
News disputes it , and that does n't happen very often when it comes to accusations about me .
So the fact of the matter is that if I occasionally have mistaken your policies for George Bush 's policies , it 's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people , on tax policy , on energy policy , on spending priorities , you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush .
Now , you 've shown independence -- commendable independence , on some key issues like torture , for example , and I give you enormous credit for that .
But when it comes to economic policies , essentially what you 're proposing is eight more years of the same thing .
And it has n't worked .
And I think the American people understand it has n't worked .
We need to move in a new direction .
Schieffer : All right ...
McCain :
Let me just say , Bob .
Schieffer : OK .
About 30 seconds .
McCain : OK .
But it 's very clear that I have disagreed with the Bush administration .
I have disagreed with leaders of my own party .
I 've got the scars to prove it .
Whether it be bringing climate change to the floor of the Senate for the first time .
Whether it be opposition to spending and earmarks , whether it be the issue of torture , whether it be the conduct of the war in Iraq , which I vigorously opposed .
Whether it be on fighting the pharmaceutical companies on Medicare prescription drugs , importation .
Whether it be fighting for an HMO patient 's bill of rights .
Whether it be the establishment of the 9/11 Commission .
I have a long record of reform and fighting through on the floor of the United States Senate .
Schieffer : All right .
McCain : Sen. Obama , your argument for standing up to the leadership of your party is n't very convincing .
Schieffer : All right .
We 're going to move to another question and the topic is leadership in this campaign .
Both of you pledged to take the high road in this campaign yet it has turned very nasty .
Schieffer : Sen. Obama , your campaign has used words like " erratic , " " out of touch , " " lie , " " angry , " " losing his bearings " to describe Sen. McCain .
Sen. McCain , your commercials have included words like " disrespectful , " " dangerous , " " dishonorable , " " he lied . "
Your running mate said he " palled around with terrorists . "
Are each of you tonight willing to sit at this table and say to each other 's face what your campaigns and the people in your campaigns have said about each other ?
And , Sen. McCain , you 're first .
McCain : Well , this has been a tough campaign .
It 's been a very tough campaign .
And I know from my experience in many campaigns that , if Sen .
Obama had asked -- responded to my urgent request to sit down , and do town hall meetings , and come before the American people , we could have done at least 10 of them by now .
When Sen. Obama was first asked , he said , " Any place , any time , " the way Barry Goldwater and Jack Kennedy agreed to do , before the intervention of the tragedy at Dallas .
So I think the tone of this campaign could have been very different .
And the fact is , it 's gotten pretty tough .
And I regret some of the negative aspects of both campaigns .
But the fact is that it has taken many turns which I think are unacceptable .
One of them happened just the other day , when a man I admire and respect -- I 've written about him -- Congressman John Lewis , an American hero , made allegations that Sarah Palin and I were somehow associated with the worst chapter in American history , segregation , deaths of children in church bombings , George Wallace .
That , to me , was so hurtful .
And , Sen. Obama , you did n't repudiate those remarks .
Every time there 's been an out - of - bounds remark made by a Republican , no matter where they are , I have repudiated them .
I hope that Sen . Obama will repudiate those remarks that were made by Congressman John Lewis , very unfair and totally inappropriate .
So I want to tell you , we will run a truthful campaign .
This is a tough campaign .
And it 's a matter of fact that Sen .
Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history .
And I can prove it .
And , Sen. Obama , when he said -- and he signed a piece of paper that said he would take public financing for his campaign if I did -- that was back when he was a long - shot candidate -- you did n't keep your word .
And when you looked into the camera in a debate with Sen.
Clinton and said , " I will sit down and negotiate with John McCain about public financing before I make a decision , " you did n't tell the American people the truth because you did n't .
And that 's -- that 's -- that 's an unfortunate part .
Now we have the highest spending by Sen.
Obama 's campaign than any time since Watergate .
Schieffer : Time 's up .
All right .
Obama :
Well , look , you know , I think that we expect presidential campaigns to be tough .
I think that , if you look at the record and the impressions of the American people -- Bob , your network just did a poll , showing that two - thirds of the American people think that Sen.
McCain is running a negative campaign versus one - third of mine .
And 100 percent , John , of your ads -- 100 percent of them have been negative .
McCain :
It 's not true .
Obama :
It absolutely is true .
And , now , I think the American people are less interested in our hurt feelings during the course of the campaign than addressing the issues that matter to them so deeply .
And there is nothing wrong with us having a vigorous debate like we 're having tonight about health care , about energy policy , about tax policy .
That 's the stuff that campaigns should be made of .
The notion , though , that because we 're not doing town hall meetings that justifies some of the ads that have been going up , not just from your own campaign directly , John , but 527s and other organizations that make some pretty tough accusations , well , I do n't mind being attacked for the next three weeks .
What the American people can't afford , though , is four more years of failed economic policies .
And what they deserve over the next four weeks is that we talk about what 's most pressing to them : the economic crisis .
Sen .
McCain 's own campaign said publicly last week that , if we keep on talking about the economic crisis , we lose , so we need to change the subject .
And I would love to see the next three weeks devoted to talking about the economy , devoted to talking about health care , devoted to talking about energy , and figuring out how the American people can send their kids to college .
And that is something that I would welcome .
But it requires , I think , a recognition that politics as usual , as been practiced over the last several years , is not solving the big problems here in America .
McCain :
Well , if you 'll turn on the television , as I -- I watched the Arizona Cardinals defeat the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday .
Obama : Congratulations .
McCain : Every other ad -- ever other ad was an attack ad on my health care plan .
And any objective observer has said it 's not true .
You 're running ads right now that say that I oppose federal funding for stem cell research .
I do n't .
You 're running ads that misportray completely my position on immigration .
So the fact is that Sen. Obama is spending unprecedented -- unprecedented in the history of American politics , going back to the beginning , amounts of money in negative attack ads on me .
And of course , I 've been talking about the economy .
Of course , I 've talked to people like Joe the plumber and tell him that I 'm not going to spread his wealth around .
I 'm going to let him keep his wealth .
And of course , we 're talking about positive plan of action to restore this economy and restore jobs in America .
That 's what my campaign is all about and that 's what it 'll continue to be all about .
But again , I did not hear a repudiation of Congressman ...
Obama : I mean , look , if we want to talk about Congressman Lewis , who is an American hero , he , unprompted by my campaign , without my campaign 's awareness , made a statement that he was troubled with what he was hearing at some of the rallies that your running mate was holding , in which all the Republican reports indicated were shouting , when my name came up , things like " terrorist " and " kill him , " and that you 're running mate did n't mention , did n't stop , did n't say " Hold on a second , that 's kind of out of line . "
And I think Congressman Lewis ' point was that we have to be careful about how we deal with our supporters .
Now ...
McCain :
You 've got to read what he said ...
( CROSSTALK )
Obama : Let -- let -- let ...
McCain :
You 've got to read what he said .
Obama : Let me -- let me complete ...
Schieffer : Go ahead .
Obama : ... my response .
I do think that he inappropriately drew a comparison between what was happening there and what had happened during the civil rights movement , and we immediately put out a statement saying that we do n't think that comparison is appropriate .
And , in fact , afterwards , Congressman Lewis put out a similar statement , saying that he had probably gone over the line .
The important point here is , though , the American people have become so cynical about our politics , because all they see is a tit- for - tat and back - and - forth .
And what they want is the ability to just focus on some really big challenges that we face right now , and that 's what I have been trying to focus on this entire campaign .
McCain : I cannot ...
Obama :
We can have serious differences about our health care policy , for example , John , because we do have a difference on health care policy , but we ...
McCain : We do and I hope ...
Obama : ... talking about it this evening .
McCain : Sure .
Obama :
But when people suggest that I pal around with terrorists , then we 're not talking about issues .
What we 're talking about ...
McCain :
Well , let me just say I would ...
Schieffer : ( inaudible )
McCain :
Let me just say categorically I 'm proud of the people that come to our rallies .
Whenever you get a large rally of 10,000 , 15,000 , 20,000 people , you 're going to have some fringe peoples .
You know that .
And I 've -- and we 've always said that that 's not appropriate .
But to somehow say that group of young women who said " Military wives for McCain " are somehow saying anything derogatory about you , but anything -- and those veterans that wear those hats that say " World War II , Vietnam , Korea , Iraq , " I 'm not going to stand for people saying that the people that come to my rallies are anything but the most dedicated , patriotic men and women that are in this nation and they 're great citizens .
And I 'm not going to stand for somebody saying that because someone yelled something at a rally -- there 's a lot of things that have been yelled at your rallies , Sen .
Obama , that I 'm not happy about either .
In fact , some T - shirts that are very ...
Obama : John , I ...
McCain : ... unacceptable .
So the point is -- the point is that I have repudiated every time someone 's been out of line , whether they 've been part of my campaign or not , and I will continue to do that .
But the fact is that we need to absolutely not stand for the kind of things that have been going on .
I have n't .
Obama :
Well , look , Bob , as I said ...
Schieffer : I mean , do you take issue with that ?
Obama :
You know , here 's what I would say .
I mean , we can have a debate back and forth about the merits of each other 's campaigns .
I suspect we wo n't agree here tonight .
What I think is most important is that we recognize that to solve the key problems that we 're facing , if we 're going to solve two wars , the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , if we can -- if we 're going to focus on lifting wages that have declined over the last eight years and create jobs here in America , then Democrats , independents and Republicans , we 're going to have to be able to work together .
And what is important is making sure that we disagree without being disagreeable .
And it means that we can have tough , vigorous debates around issues .
What we can't do , I think , is try to characterize each other as bad people .
And that has been a culture in Washington that has been taking place for too long .
And I think ...
McCain : Well , Bob , you asked me a direct question .
Schieffer : Short answer , yes , short answer .
McCain : Yes , real quick .
Mr. Ayers , I do n't care about an old washed - up terrorist .
But as Sen. Clinton said in her debates with you , we need to know the full extent of that relationship .
We need to know the full extent of Sen .
Obama 's relationship with ACORN , who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country , maybe destroying the fabric of democracy .
The same front outfit organization that your campaign gave $ 832,000 for " lighting and site selection . "
So all of these things need to be examined , of course .
Schieffer : All right .
I 'm going to let you respond and we 'll extend this for a moment .
Obama : Bob , I think it 's going to be important to just -- I 'll respond to these two particular allegations that Sen.
McCain has made and that have gotten a lot of attention .
In fact , Mr. Ayers has become the centerpiece of Sen. McCain 's campaign over the last two or three weeks .
This has been their primary focus .
So let 's get the record straight .
Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago .
Forty years ago , when I was 8 years old , he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group .
I have roundly condemned those acts .
Ten years ago he served and I served on a school reform board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan 's former ambassadors and close friends , Mr. Annenberg .
Other members on that board were the presidents of the University of Illinois , the president of Northwestern University , who happens to be a Republican , the president of The Chicago Tribune , a Republican - leaning newspaper .
Mr. Ayers is not involved in my campaign .
He has never been involved in this campaign .
And he will not advise me in the White House .
So that 's Mr. Ayers .
Now , with respect to ACORN , ACORN is a community organization .
Apparently what they 've done is they were paying people to go out and register folks , and apparently some of the people who were out there did n't really register people , they just filled out a bunch of names .
It had nothing to do with us .
We were not involved .
The only involvement I 've had with ACORN was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people get registered at DMVs .
Now , the reason I think that it 's important to just get these facts out is because the allegation that Sen.
McCain has continually made is that somehow my associations are troubling .
Let me tell you who I associate with .
On economic policy , I associate with Warren Buffett and former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker .
If I 'm interested in figuring out my foreign policy , I associate myself with my running mate , Joe Biden or with Dick Lugar , the Republican ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , or General Jim Jones , the former supreme allied commander of NATO .
Those are the people , Democrats and Republicans , who have shaped my ideas and who will be surrounding me in the White House .
And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign , Sen. McCain , says more about your campaign than it says about me .
McCain : Well , again , while you were on the board of the Woods Foundation , you and Mr. Ayers , together , you sent $ 230,000 to ACORN .
So -- and you launched your political campaign in Mr. Ayers ' living room .
Obama :
That 's absolutely not true .
McCain :
And the facts are facts and records are records .
Obama :
And that 's not the facts .
McCain :
And it 's not the fact -- it's not the fact that Sen .
Obama chooses to associate with a guy who in 2001 said that he wished he had have bombed more , and he had a long association with him .
It 's the fact that all the -- all of the details need to be known about Sen .
Obama 's relationship with them and with ACORN and the American people will make a judgment .
And my campaign is about getting this economy back on track , about creating jobs , about a brighter future for America .
And that 's what my campaign is about and I 'm not going to raise taxes the way Sen .
Obama wants to raise taxes in a tough economy .
And that 's really what this campaign is going to be about .
Schieffer : All right .
Let 's go to the next topic and you -- we may want to get back into some of this during this next discussion .
I want to ask both of you about the people that you 're going to bring into the government .
And our best insight yet is who you have picked as your running mates .
Schieffer :
So I 'll begin by asking both of you this question , and I 'll ask you to answer first , Sen. Obama .
Why would the country be better off if your running mate became president rather than his running mate ?
Obama : Well , Joe Biden , I think , is one of the finest public servants that has served in this country .
It 's not just that he has some of the best foreign policy credentials of anybody .
And Democrats and Republicans alike , I think , acknowledge his expertise there .
But it 's also that his entire life he has never forgotten where he came from , coming from Scranton , fighting on behalf of working families , remembering what it 's like to see his father lose his job and go through a downward spiral economically .
And , as a consequence , his consistent pattern throughout his career is to fight for the little guy .
That 's what he 's done when it comes to economic policies that will help working families get a leg up .
That 's what he 's done when it comes to , for example , passing the landmark 1994 crime bill , the Violence Against Women 's Act .
Joe has always made sure that he is fighting on behalf of working families , and I think he shares my core values and my sense of where the country needs to go .
Because after eight years of failed policies , he and I both agree that what we 're going to have to do is to re-prioritize , make sure that we 're investing in the American people , give tax cuts not to the wealthiest corporations , but give them to small businesses and give them to individuals who are struggling right now , make sure that we finally get serious about energy independence , something that has been languishing in Washington for 30 years , and make sure that our kids get a great education and can afford to go to college .
So , on the key issues that are of importance to American families , Joe Biden 's always been on the right side , and I think he will make an outstanding president if , heaven forbid , something happened to me .
Schieffer : Senator ?
McCain : Well , Americans have gotten to know Sarah Palin .
They know that she 's a role model to women and other -- and reformers all over America .
She 's a reformer .
She is -- she took on a governor who was a member of her own party when she ran for governor .
When she was the head of their energy and natural resources board , she saw corruption , she resigned and said , " This ca n't go on . "
She 's given money back to the taxpayers .
She 's cut the size of government .
She negotiated with the oil companies and faced them down , a $ 40 billion pipeline of natural gas that 's going to relieve the energy needs of the United -- of what they call the lower 48 .
She 's a reformer through and through .
And it 's time we had that bresh of freth air ( sic ) -- breath of fresh air coming into our nation 's capital and sweep out the old - boy network and the cronyism that 's been so much a part of it that I 've fought against for all these years .
She 'll be my partner .
She understands reform .
And , by the way , she also understands special - needs families .
She understands that autism is on the rise , that we 've got to find out what 's causing it , and we 've got to reach out to these families , and help them , and give them the help they need as they raise these very special needs children .
She understands that better than almost any American that I know .
I 'm proud of her .
And she has ignited our party and people all over America that have never been involved in the political process .
And I can't tell how proud I am of her and her family .
Her husband 's a pretty tough guy , by the way , too .
Schieffer :
Do you think she 's qualified to be president ?
Obama :
You know , I think it 's -- that 's going to be up to the American people .
I think that , obviously , she 's a capable politician who has , I think , excited the -- a base in the Republican Party .
And I think it 's very commendable the work she 's done on behalf of special needs .
I agree with that , John .
I do want to just point out that autism , for example , or other special needs will require some additional funding , if we 're going to get serious in terms of research .
That is something that every family that advocates on behalf of disabled children talk about .
And if we have an across - the - board spending freeze , we 're not going to be able to do it .
That 's an example of , I think , the kind of use of the scalpel that we want to make sure that we 're funding some of those programs .
Schieffer : Do you think Sen. Biden is qualified ?
McCain : I think that Joe Biden is qualified in many respects .
But I do point out that he 's been wrong on many foreign policy and national security issues , which is supposed to be his strength .
He voted against the first Gulf War .
He voted against it and , obviously , we had to take Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait or it would 've threatened the Middle Eastern world supply .
In Iraq , he had this cockamamie idea about dividing Iraq into three countries .
We 're seeing Iraq united as Iraqis , tough , hard , but we 're seeing them .
We 're now about to have an agreement for status of forces in Iraq coming up .
There are several issues in which , frankly , Joe Biden and I open and honestly disagreed on national security policy , and he 's been wrong on a number of the major ones .
But again , I want to come back to , notice every time Sen .
Obama says , " We need to spend more , we need to spend more , that 's the answer " -- why do we always have to spend more ?
Why can't we have transparency , accountability , reform of these agencies of government ?
Maybe that 's why he 's asked for 860 -- sought and proposed $ 860 billion worth of new spending and wants to raise people 's taxes in a time of incredible challenge and difficulty and heartache for the American families .
Schieffer : Let 's go to -- let 's go to a new topic .
We 're running a little behind .
Let 's talk about energy and climate control .
Every president since Nixon has said what both of you ...
McCain : Climate change .
Schieffer : Climate change , yes -- has said what both of you have said , and , that is , we must reduce our dependence on foreign oil .
When Nixon said it , we imported from 17 to 34 percent of our foreign oil .
Now , we 're importing more than 60 percent .
Would each of you give us a number , a specific number of how much you believe we can reduce our foreign oil imports during your first term ?
And I believe the first question goes to you , Sen. McCain .
McCain : I think we can , for all intents and purposes , eliminate our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and Venezuelan oil .
Canadian oil is fine .
By the way , when Sen. Obama said he would unilaterally renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement , the Canadians said , " Yes , and we 'll sell our oil to China . "
You do n't tell countries you 're going to unilaterally renegotiate agreements with them .
We can eliminate our dependence on foreign oil by building 45 new nuclear plants , power plants , right away .
We can store and we can reprocess .
Sen .
Obama will tell you , in the -- as the extreme environmentalists do , it has to be safe .
Look , we 've sailed Navy ships around the world for 60 years with nuclear power plants on them .
We can store and reprocess spent nuclear fuel , Sen. Obama , no problem .
So the point is with nuclear power , with wind , tide , solar , natural gas , with development of flex fuel , hybrid , clean coal technology , clean coal technology is key in the heartland of America that 's hurting rather badly .
So I think we can easily , within seven , eight , ten years , if we put our minds to it , we can eliminate our dependence on the places in the world that harm our national security if we do n't achieve our independence .
Schieffer : All right .
Can we reduce our dependence on foreign oil and by how much in the first term , in four years ?
Obama : I think that in ten years , we can reduce our dependence so that we no longer have to import oil from the Middle East or Venezuela .
I think that 's about a realistic timeframe .
And this is the most important issue that our future economy is going to face .
Obviously , we 've got an immediate crisis right now .
But nothing is more important than us no longer borrowing $ 700 billion or more from China and sending it to Saudi Arabia .
It 's mortgaging our children 's future .
Now , from the start of this campaign , I 've identified this as one of my top priorities and here is what I think we have to do .
Number one , we do need to expand domestic production and that means , for example , telling the oil companies the 68 million acres that they currently have leased that they 're not drilling , use them or lose them .
And I think that we should look at offshore drilling and implement it in a way that allows us to get some additional oil .
But understand , we only have three to four percent of the world 's oil reserves and we use 25 percent of the world 's oil , which means that we can't drill our way out of the problem .
That 's why I 've focused on putting resources into solar , wind , biodiesel , geothermal .
These have been priorities of mine since I got to the Senate , and it is absolutely critical that we develop a high fuel efficient car that 's built not in Japan and not in South Korea , but built here in the United States of America .
We invented the auto industry and the fact that we have fallen so far behind is something that we have to work on .
Now I just want to make one last point because Sen.
McCain mentioned NAFTA and the issue of trade and that actually bears on this issue .
I believe in free trade .
But I also believe that for far too long , certainly during the course of the Bush administration with the support of Sen.
McCain , the attitude has been that any trade agreement is a good trade agreement .
And NAFTA does n't have -- did not have enforceable labor agreements and environmental agreements .
And what I said was we should include those and make them enforceable .
In the same way that we should enforce rules against China manipulating its currency to make our exports more expensive and their exports to us cheaper .
And when it comes to South Korea , we 've got a trade agreement up right now , they are sending hundreds of thousands of South Korean cars into the United States .
That 's all good .
We can only get 4,000 to 5,000 into South Korea .
That is not free trade .
We 've got to have a president who is going to be advocating on behalf of American businesses and American workers and I make no apology for that .
Schieffer : Senator ?
McCain :
Well , you know , I admire so much Sen. Obama 's eloquence .
And you really have to pay attention to words .
He said , we will look at offshore drilling .
Did you get that ?
Look at .
We can offshore drill now .
We 've got to do it now .
We will reduce the cost of a barrel of oil because we show the world that we have a supply of our own .
It 's doable .
The technology is there and we have to drill now .
Now , on the subject of free trade agreements .
I am a free trader .
And I need -- we need to have education and training programs for displaced workers that work , going to our community colleges .
But let me give you another example of a free trade agreement that Sen. Obama opposes .
Right now , because of previous agreements , some made by President Clinton , the goods and products that we send to Colombia , which is our largest agricultural importer of our products , is -- there 's a billion dollars that we -- our businesses have paid so far in order to get our goods in there .
Because of previous agreements , their goods and products come into our country for free .
So Sen. Obama , who has never traveled south of our border , opposes the Colombia Free Trade Agreement .
The same country that 's helping us try to stop the flow of drugs into our country that 's killing young Americans .
And also the country that just freed three Americans that will help us create jobs in America because they will be a market for our goods and products without having to pay -- without us having to pay the billions of dollars -- the billion dollars and more that we 've already paid .
Free trade with Colombia is something that 's a no-brainer .
But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better .
Obama :
Let me respond .
Actually , I understand it pretty well .
The history in Colombia right now is that labor leaders have been targeted for assassination on a fairly consistent basis and there have not been prosecutions .
And what I have said , because the free trade -- the trade agreement itself does have labor and environmental protections , but we have to stand for human rights and we have to make sure that violence is n't being perpetrated against workers who are just trying to organize for their rights , which is why , for example , I supported the Peruvian Free Trade Agreement which was a well - structured agreement .
But I think that the important point is we 've got to have a president who understands the benefits of free trade but also is going to enforce unfair trade agreements and is going to stand up to other countries .
And the last point I 'll make , because we started on energy .
When I talked about the automakers , they are obviously getting hammered right now .
They were already having a tough time because of high gas prices .
And now with the financial crisis , car dealerships are closing and people can't get car loans .
That 's why I think it 's important for us to get loan guarantees to the automakers , but we do have to hold them responsible as well to start producing the highly fuel - efficient cars of the future .
And Detroit had dragged its feet too long in terms of getting that done .
It 's going to be one of my highest priorities because transportation accounts for about 30 percent of our total energy consumption .
If we can get that right , then we can move in a direction not only of energy independence , but we can create 5 million new jobs all across America , including in the heartland where we can retool some of these plants to make these highly fuel - efficient cars and also to make wind turbines and solar panels , the kinds of clean energy approaches that should be the driver of our economy for the next century .
McCain :
Well , let me just said that that this is -- he -- Sen .
Obama does n't want a free trade agreement with our best ally in the region but wants to sit down across the table without precondition to -- with Hugo Chavez , the guy who has been helping FARC , the terrorist organization .
Free trade between ourselves and Colombia , I just recited to you the benefits of concluding that agreement , a billion dollars of American dollars that could have gone to creating jobs and businesses in the United States , opening up those markets .
So I do n't -- I do n't think there 's any doubt that Sen.
Obama wants to restrict trade and he wants to raise taxes .
And the last president of the United States that tried that was Herbert Hoover , and we went from a deep recession into a depression .
We 're not going to follow that path while I 'm -- when I 'm president of the United States .
Schieffer :
All right , let 's go to a new topic , health care .
Given the current economic situation , would either of you now favor controlling health care costs over expanding health care coverage ?
The question is first to Sen. Obama .
Obama :
We 've got to do both , and that 's exactly what my plan does .
Look , as I travel around the country , this is the issue that will break your heart over and over again .
Just yesterday , I was in Toledo shaking some hands in a line .
Two women , both of them probably in their mid- to late - 50s , had just been laid off of their plant .
Neither of them have health insurance .
And they were desperate for some way of getting coverage , because , understandably , they 're worried that , if they get sick , they could go bankrupt .
So here 's what my plan does .
If you have health insurance , then you do n't have to do anything .
If you 've got health insurance through your employer , you can keep your health insurance , keep your choice of doctor , keep your plan .
The only thing we 're going to try to do is lower costs so that those cost savings are passed onto you .
And we estimate we can cut the average family 's premium by about $ 2,500 per year .
If you do n't have health insurance , then what we 're going to do is to provide you the option of buying into the same kind of federal pool that both Sen.
McCain and I enjoy as federal employees , which will give you high - quality care , choice of doctors , at lower costs , because so many people are part of this insured group .
We 're going to make sure that insurance companies can't discriminate on the basis of pre-existing conditions .
We 'll negotiate with the drug companies for the cheapest available price on drugs .
We are going to invest in information technology to eliminate bureaucracy and make the system more efficient .
And we are going to make sure that we manage chronic illnesses , like diabetes and heart disease , that cost a huge amount , but could be prevented .
We 've got to put more money into preventive care .
This will cost some money on the front end , but over the long term this is the only way that not only are we going to make families healthy , but it 's also how we 're going to save the federal budget , because we can't afford these escalating costs .
Schieffer : All right .
Sen. McCain ?
McCain : Well , it is a terribly painful situation for Americans .
They 're seeing their premiums , their co-pays go up .
Forty - seven million Americans are without health insurance in America today .
And it really is the cost , the escalating costs of health care that are inflicting such pain on working families and people across this country .
And I am convinced we need to do a lot of things .
We need to put health care records online .
The V.A. does that .
That will -- that will reduce costs .
We need to have more community health centers .
We need to have walk - in clinics .
The rise of obesity amongst young Americans is one of the most alarming statistics that there is .
We should have physical fitness programs and nutrition programs in schools .
Every parent should know what 's going on there .
We -- we need to have -- we need to have employers reward employees who join health clubs and practice wellness and fitness .
But I want to give every American family a $ 5,000 refundable tax credit .
Take it and get anywhere in America the health care that you wish .
Now , my old buddy , Joe , Joe the plumber , is out there .
Now , Joe , Sen .
Obama 's plan , if you 're a small business and you are able -- and your -- the guy that sells to you will not have his capital gains tax increase , which Sen .
Obama wants , if you 're out there , my friend , and you 've got employees , and you 've got kids , if you do n't get -- adopt the health care plan that Sen .
Obama mandates , he 's going to fine you .
Now , Sen .
Obama , I 'd like -- still like to know what that fine is going to be , and I do n't think that Joe right now wants to pay a fine when he is seeing such difficult times in America 's economy .
Sen .
Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies , take over the health care of America through -- as he said , his object is a single payer system .
If you like that , you 'll love Canada and England .
So the point is ...
Schieffer :
So that 's your objective ?
Obama :
It is not and I did n't describe it ...
McCain : No , you stated it .
Obama : I just ...
McCain : Excuse me .
Obama : I just described what my plan is .
And I 'm happy to talk to you , Joe , too , if you 're out there .
Here 's your fine -- zero .
You wo n't pay a fine , because ...
McCain : Zero ?
Obama : Zero , because as I said in our last debate and I 'll repeat , John , I exempt small businesses from the requirement for large businesses that can afford to provide health care to their employees , but are not doing it .
I exempt small businesses from having to pay into a kitty .
But large businesses that can afford it , we 've got a choice .
Either they provide health insurance to their employees or somebody has to .
Right now , what happens is those employees get dumped into either the Medicaid system , which taxpayers pick up , or they 're going to the emergency room for uncompensated care , which everybody picks up in their premiums .
The average family is paying an additional $ 900 a year in higher premiums because of the uninsured .
So here 's what we do .
We exempt small businesses .
In fact , what , Joe , if you want to do the right thing with your employees and you want to provide them health insurance , we 'll give you a 50 percent credit so that you will actually be able to afford it .
If you do n't have health insurance or you want to buy into a group plan , you will be able to buy into the plan that I just described .
Now , what we have n't talked about is Sen. McCain 's plan .
He says he 's going to give you all a $ 5,000 tax credit .
That sounds pretty good .
And you can go out and buy your own insurance .
Here 's the problem -- that for about 20 million people , you may find yourselves no longer having employer - based health insurance .
This is because younger people might be able to get health insurance for $ 5,000 , young and healthy folks .
Older folks , let 's healthy folks , what 's going to end up happening is that you 're going to be the only ones left in your employer - based system , your employers wo n't be able to afford it .
And once you 're out on your own with this $ 5,000 credit , Sen.
McCain , for the first time , is going to be taxing the health care benefits that you have from your employer .
And this is your plan , John .
For the first time in history , you will be taxing people 's health care benefits .
By the way , the average policy costs about $ 12,000 .
So if you 've got $ 5,000 and it 's going to cost you $ 12,000 , that 's a loss for you .
Last point about Sen. McCain 's plan is that insurers right now , the main restrictions on what they do is primarily state law and , under Sen.
McCain 's plan , those rules would be stripped away and you would start seeing a lot more insurance companies cherry - picking and excluding people from coverage .
That , I think , is a mistake and I think that this is a fundamental difference in our campaign and how we would approach health care .
Schieffer :
What about that ?
McCain : Hey , Joe , you 're rich , congratulations , because what Joe wanted to do was buy the business that he 's been working for 10 - 12 hours a day , seven days a week , and you said that you wanted to spread the wealth , but -- in other words , take Joe 's money and then you decide what to do with it .
Now , Joe , you 're rich , congratulations , and you will then fall into the category where you 'll have to pay a fine if you do n't provide health insurance that Sen .
Obama mandates , not the kind that you think is best for your family , your children , your employees , but the kind that he mandates for you .
That 's big government at its best .
Now , 95 percent of the people in America will receive more money under my plan because they will receive not only their present benefits , which may be taxed , which will be taxed , but then you add $ 5,000 onto it , except for those people who have the gold - plated Cadillac insurance policies that have to do with cosmetic surgery and transplants and all of those kinds of things .
And the good thing about this is they 'll be able to go across America .
The average cost of a health care insurance plan in America today is $ 5,800 .
I 'm going to give them $ 5,000 to take with them wherever they want to go , and this will give them affordability .
This will give them availability .
This will give them a chance to choose their own futures , not have Sen.
Obama and government decide that for them .
This really gets down to the fundamental difference in our philosophies .
If you notice that in all of this proposal , Senator -- government wants -- Sen. Obama wants government to do the job .
Sen .
Obama wants government to do the job .
I want , Joe , you to do the job .
I want to leave money in your pocket .
I want you to be able to choose the health care for you and your family .
That 's what I 'm all about .
And we 've got too much government and too much spending and the government is -- the size of government has grown by 40 percent in the last eight years .
We can't afford that in the next eight years and Sen. Obama , with the Democrats in charge of Congress , things have gotten worse .
Have you noticed , they 've been in charge the last two years .
Schieffer :
All right .
A short response .
Obama : Very briefly .
You all just heard my plan .
If you 've got an employer - based health care plan , you keep it .
Now , under Sen. McCain 's plan there is a strong risk that people would lose their employer - based health care .
That 's the choice you 'll have is having your employer no longer provide you health care .
And do n't take my word for it .
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce , which generally does n't support a lot of Democrats , said that this plan could lead to the unraveling of the employer - based health care system .
All I want to do , if you 've already got health care , is lower your costs .
That includes you , Joe .
Schieffer : All right .
Let 's stop there and go to another question .
And this one goes to Sen. McCain .
Sen. McCain , you believe Roe v.
Wade should be overturned .
Sen. Obama , you believe it should n't .
Could either of you ever nominate someone to the Supreme Court who disagrees with you on this issue ?
Sen. McCain ?
McCain : I would never and have never in all the years I 've been there imposed a litmus test on any nominee to the court .
That 's not appropriate to do .
Schieffer :
But you do n't want Roe v.
Wade to be overturned ?
McCain : I thought it was a bad decision .
I think there were a lot of decisions that were bad .
I think that decisions should rest in the hands of the states .
I 'm a federalist .
And I believe strongly that we should have nominees to the United States Supreme Court based on their qualifications rather than any litmus test .
Now , let me say that there was a time a few years ago when the United States Senate was about to blow up .
Republicans wanted to have just a majority vote to confirm a judge and the Democrats were blocking in an unprecedented fashion .
We got together seven Republicans , seven Democrats .
You were offered a chance to join .
You chose not to because you were afraid of the appointment of , quote , " conservative judges . "
I voted for Justice Breyer and Justice Ginsburg .
Not because I agreed with their ideology , but because I thought they were qualified and that elections have consequences when presidents are nominated .
This is a very important issue we 're talking about .
Sen .
Obama voted against Justice Breyer and Justice Roberts on the grounds that they did n't meet his ideological standards .
That 's not the way we should judge these nominees .
Elections have consequences .
They should be judged on their qualifications .
And so that 's what I will do .
I will find the best people in the world -- in the United States of America who have a history of strict adherence to the Constitution .
And not legislating from the bench .
Schieffer :
But even if it was someone -- even someone who had a history of being for abortion rights , you would consider them ?
McCain : I would consider anyone in their qualifications .
I do not believe that someone who has supported Roe v.
Wade that would be part of those qualifications .
But I certainly would not impose any litmus test .
Schieffer : All right .
Obama :
Well , I think it 's true that we should n't apply a strict litmus test and the most important thing in any judge is their capacity to provide fairness and justice to the American people .
And it is true that this is going to be , I think , one of the most consequential decisions of the next president .
It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance .
Now I would not provide a litmus test .
But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided .
I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on .
But what ultimately I believe is that women in consultation with their families , their doctors , their religious advisers , are in the best position to make this decision .
And I think that the Constitution has a right to privacy in it that should n't be subject to state referendum , any more than our First Amendment rights are subject to state referendum , any more than many of the other rights that we have should be subject to popular vote .
So this is going to be an important issue .
I will look for those judges who have an outstanding judicial record , who have the intellect , and who hopefully have a sense of what real - world folks are going through .
I 'll just give you one quick example .
Sen.
McCain and I disagreed recently when the Supreme Court made it more difficult for a woman named Lilly Ledbetter to press her claim for pay discrimination .
For years , she had been getting paid less than a man had been paid for doing the exact same job .
And when she brought a suit , saying equal pay for equal work , the judges said , well , you know , it 's taken you too long to bring this lawsuit , even though she did n't know about it until fairly recently .
We tried to overturn it in the Senate .
I supported that effort to provide better guidance to the courts ; John McCain opposed it .
I think that it 's important for judges to understand that if a woman is out there trying to raise a family , trying to support her family , and is being treated unfairly , then the court has to stand up , if nobody else will .
And that 's the kind of judge that I want .
Schieffer : Time 's up .
McCain : Obviously , that law waved the statute of limitations , which you could have gone back 20 or 30 years .
It was a trial lawyer 's dream .
Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue .
We have to change the culture of America .
Those of us who are proudly pro-life understand that .
And it 's got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman who 's facing this terribly difficult decision .
Sen. Obama , as a member of the Illinois State Senate , voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion .
He voted against that .
And then , on the floor of the State Senate , as he did 130 times as a state senator , he voted present .
Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago , where he voted against a ban on partial - birth abortion , one of the late - term abortion , a really -- one of the bad procedures , a terrible .
And then , on the floor of the Illinois State Senate , he voted present .
I do n't know how you vote " present " on some of that .
I do n't know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America .
And that 's his record , and that 's a matter of his record .
And he 'll say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade , about the Illinois State Senate .
It was clear - cut votes that Sen .
Obama voted , I think , in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America .
Schieffer : Response ?
Obama :
Yes , let me respond to this .
If it sounds incredible that I would vote to withhold lifesaving treatment from an infant , that 's because it 's not true .
The -- here are the facts .
There was a bill that was put forward before the Illinois Senate that said you have to provide lifesaving treatment and that would have helped to undermine Roe v. Wade .
The fact is that there was already a law on the books in Illinois that required providing lifesaving treatment , which is why not only myself but pro-choice Republicans and Democrats voted against it .
And the Illinois Medical Society , the organization of doctors in Illinois , voted against it .
Their Hippocratic
Oath would have required them to provide care , and there was already a law in the books .
With respect to partial - birth abortion , I am completely supportive of a ban on late - term abortions , partial - birth or otherwise , as long as there 's an exception for the mother 's health and life , and this did not contain that exception .
And I attempted , as many have in the past , of including that so that it is constitutional .
And that was rejected , and that 's why I voted present , because I 'm willing to support a ban on late - term abortions as long as we have that exception .
The last point I want to make on the issue of abortion .
This is an issue that -- look , it divides us .
And in some ways , it may be difficult to -- to reconcile the two views .
But there surely is some common ground when both those who believe in choice and those who are opposed to abortion can come together and say , " We should try to prevent unintended pregnancies by providing appropriate education to our youth , communicating that sexuality is sacred and that they should not be engaged in cavalier activity , and providing options for adoption , and helping single mothers if they want to choose to keep the baby . "
Those are all things that we put in the Democratic platform for the first time this year , and I think that 's where we can find some common ground , because nobody 's pro-abortion .
I think it 's always a tragic situation .
We should try to reduce these circumstances .
Schieffer : Let 's give Sen. McCain a short response ...
McCain : Just again ...
Schieffer : ... and then ...
McCain : Just again , the example of the eloquence of Sen. Obama .
He 's health for the mother .
You know , that 's been stretched by the pro-abortion movement in America to mean almost anything .
That 's the extreme pro-abortion position , quote , " health . "
But , look , Cindy and I are adoptive parents .
We know what a treasure and joy it is to have an adopted child in our lives .
We 'll do everything we can to improve adoption in this country .
But that does not mean that we will cease to protect the rights of the unborn .
Of course , we have to come together .
Of course , we have to work together , and , of course , it 's vital that we do so and help these young women who are facing such a difficult decision , with a compassion , that we 'll help them with the adoptive services , with the courage to bring that child into this world and we 'll help take care of it .
Schieffer : Let 's stop there , because I want to get in a question on education and I 'm afraid this is going to have to be our last question , gentlemen .
The question is this : the U.S. spends more per capita than any other country on education .
Yet , by every international measurement , in math and science competence , from kindergarten through the 12th grade , we trail most of the countries of the world .
The implications of this are clearly obvious .
Some even say it poses a threat to our national security .
Do you feel that way and what do you intend to do about it ?
The question to Sen. Obama first .
Obama :
This probably has more to do with our economic future than anything and that means it also has a national security implication , because there 's never been a nation on earth that saw its economy decline and continued to maintain its primacy as a military power .
So we 've got to get our education system right .
Now , typically , what 's happened is that there 's been a debate between more money or reform , and I think we need both .
In some cases , we are going to have to invest .
Early childhood education , which closes the achievement gap , so that every child is prepared for school , every dollar we invest in that , we end up getting huge benefits with improved reading scores , reduced dropout rates , reduced delinquency rates .
I think it 's going to be critically important for us to recruit a generation of new teachers , an army of new teachers , especially in math and science , give them higher pay , give them more professional development and support in exchange for higher standards and accountability .
And I think it 's important for us to make college affordable .
Right now , I meet young people all across the country who either have decided not to go to college or if they 're going to college , they are taking on $ 20,000 , $ 30,000 , $ 50,000 , $ 60,000 worth of debt , and it 's very difficult for them to go into some fields , like basic research in science , for example , thinking to themselves that they 're going to have a mortgage before they even buy a house .
And that 's why I 've proposed a $ 4,000 tuition credit , every student , every year , in exchange for some form of community service , whether it 's military service , whether it 's Peace Corps , whether it 's working in a community .
If we do those things , then I believe that we can create a better school system .
But there 's one last ingredient that I just want to mention , and that 's parents .
We can't do it just in the schools .
Parents are going to have to show more responsibility .
They 've got to turn off the TV set , put away the video games , and , finally , start instilling that thirst for knowledge that our students need .
Schieffer : Sen. McCain ?
McCain : Well , it 's the civil rights issue of the 21st century .
There 's no doubt that we have achieved equal access to schools in America after a long and difficult and terrible struggle .
But what is the advantage in a low income area of sending a child to a failed school and that being your only choice ?
So choice and competition amongst schools is one of the key elements that 's already been proven in places in like New Orleans and New York City and other places , where we have charter schools , where we take good teachers and we reward them and promote them .
And we find bad teachers another line of work .
And we have to be able to give parents the same choice , frankly , that Sen. Obama and Mrs. Obama had and Cindy and I had to send our kids to the school -- their kids to the school of their choice .
Charter schools are n't the only answer , but they 're providing competition .
They are providing the kind of competitions that have upgraded both schools -- types of schools .
Now , throwing money at the problem is not the answer .
You will find that some of the worst school systems in America get the most money per student .
So I believe that we need to reward these good teachers .
We need to encourage programs such as Teach for America and Troops to Teachers where people , after having served in the military , can go right to teaching and not have to take these examinations which -- or have the certification that some are required in some states .
Look , we must improve education in this country .
As far as college education is concerned , we need to make those student loans available .
We need to give them a repayment schedule that they can meet .
We need to have full student loan program for in - state tuition .
And we certainly need to adjust the certain loan eligibility to inflation .
Schieffer :
Do you think the federal government should play a larger role in the schools ?
And I mean , more federal money ?
Obama :
Well , we have a tradition of local control of the schools and that 's a tradition that has served us well .
But I do think that it is important for the federal government to step up and help local school districts do some of the things they need to do .
Now we tried to do this under President Bush .
He put forward No Child Left Behind .
Unfortunately , they left the money behind for No Child Left Behind .
And local school districts end up having more of a burden , a bunch of unfunded mandates , the same kind of thing that happened with special education where we did the right thing by saying every school should provide education to kids with special needs , but we never followed through on the promise of funding , and that left local school districts very cash - strapped .
So what I want to do is focus on early childhood education , providing teachers higher salaries in exchange for more support .
Sen. McCain and I actually agree on two things that he just mentioned .
Charter schools , I doubled the number of charter schools in Illinois despite some reservations from teachers unions .
I think it 's important to foster competition inside the public schools .
And we also agree on the need for making sure that if we have bad teachers that they are swiftly -- after given an opportunity to prove themselves , if they can't hack it , then we need to move on because our kids have to have their best future .
Where we disagree is on the idea that we can somehow give out vouchers -- give vouchers as a way of securing the problems in our education system .
And I also have to disagree on Sen. McCain 's record when it comes to college accessibility and affordability .
Recently his key economic adviser was asked about why he did n't seem to have some specific programs to help young people go to college and the response was , well , you know , we can't give money to every interest group that comes along .
I do n't think America 's youth are interest groups , I think they 're our future .
And this is an example of where we are going to have to prioritize .
We can't say we 're going to do things and then not explain in concrete terms how we 're going to pay for it .
And if we 're going to do some of the things you mentioned , like lowering loan rates or what have you , somebody has got to pay for it .
It 's not going to happen on its own .
Schieffer :
What about that , Senator ?
McCain : Well , sure .
I 'm sure you 're aware , Sen. Obama , of the program in the Washington , D.C. , school system where vouchers are provided and there 's a certain number , I think it 's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that .
Because they wanted to have the same choice that you and I and Cindy and your wife have had .
And that is because they wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children .
And we all know the state of the Washington , D.C. , school system .
That was vouchers .
That was voucher , Sen. Obama .
And I 'm frankly surprised you did n't pay more attention to that example .
Now as far as the No Child Left Behind is concerned , it was a great first beginning in my view .
It had its flaws , it had its problems , the first time we had looked at the issue of education in America from a nationwide perspective .
And we need to fix a lot of the problems .
We need to sit down and reauthorize it .
But , again , spending more money is n't always the answer .
I think the Head Start program is a great program .
A lot of people , including me , said , look , it 's not doing what it should do .
By the third grade many times children who were in the Head Start program are n't any better off than the others .
Let 's reform it .
Let 's reform it and fund it .
That was , of course , out - of - bounds by the Democrats .
We need to reform these programs .
We need to have transparency .
We need to have rewards .
It 's a system that cries out for accountability and transparency and the adequate funding .
And I just said to you earlier , town hall meeting after town hall meeting , parents come with kids , children -- precious children who have autism .
Sarah Palin knows about that better than most .
And we 'll find and we 'll spend the money , research , to find the cause of autism .
And we 'll care for these young children .
And all Americans will open their wallets and their hearts to do so .
But to have a situation , as you mentioned in our earlier comments , that the most expensive education in the world is in the United States of America also means that it cries out for reform , as well .
And I will support those reforms , and I will fund the ones that are reformed .
But I 'm not going to continue to throw money at a problem .
And I 've got to tell you that vouchers , where they are requested and where they are agreed to , are a good and workable system .
And it 's been proven .
Obama : I 'll just make a quick comment about vouchers in D.C. Sen .
McCain 's absolutely right : The D.C. school system is in terrible shape , and it has been for a very long time .
And we 've got a wonderful new superintendent there who 's working very hard with the young mayor there to try ...
McCain : Who supports vouchers .
Obama : ... who initiated -- actually , supports charters .
McCain :
She supports vouchers , also .
Obama :
But the -- but here 's the thing , is that , even if Sen .
McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go -- I disagree with him on this , because the data does n't show that it actually solves the problem -- the centerpiece of Sen.
McCain 's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots .
That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Sen. McCain .
So if we are going to be serious about this issue , we 've got to have a president who is going to tackle it head - on .
And that 's what I intend to do as president .
Schieffer : All right .
McCain : Because there 's not enough vouchers ; therefore , we should n't do it , even though it 's working .
I got it .
Schieffer : All right .
Gentlemen , we have come to the close .
Before I ask both of you for your closing statements tonight , I 'd like to invite our viewers and listeners to go to MyDebates.org , where you will find this evening 's debates and the three that preceded tonight 's debate .
Now , for the final statements , by a coin toss , Sen. McCain goes first .
McCain :
Well , thank you again , Bob .
Thanks to Hofstra .
And it 's great to be with you again .
I think we 've had a very healthy discussion .
My friends , as I said in my opening remarks , these are very difficult times and challenges for America .
And they were graphically demonstrated again today .
America needs a new direction .
We can not be satisfied with what we 've been doing for the last eight years .
I have a record of reform , and taking on my party , the other party , the special interests , whether it be an HMO Patients '
Bill of Rights , or trying to clean up the campaign finance system in -- in this country , or whether it be establishment of a 9/11 Commission , I have a long record of it .
And I 've been a careful steward of your tax dollars .
We have to make health care affordable and available .
We have to make quality education there for all of our citizens , not just the privileged few .
We have to stop the spending .
We have to stop the spending , which has mortgaged your children 's futures .
All of these things and all the promises and commitments that Sen.
Obama and I made ( inaudible ) made to you tonight will base -- will be based on whether you can trust us or not to be careful stewards of your tax dollar , to make sure America is safe and secure and prosperous , to make sure we reform the institutions of government .
That 's why I 've asked you not only to examine my record , but my proposals for the future of this country .
I 've spent my entire life in the service of this nation and putting my country first .
As a long line of McCains that have served our country for a long time in war and in peace , it 's been the great honor of my life , and I 've been proud to serve .
And I hope you 'll give me an opportunity to serve again .
I 'd be honored and humbled .
Schieffer : Senator ?
Obama :
Well , I want to thank Sen. McCain and Bob for moderating .
I think we all know America is going through tough times right now .
The policies of the last eight years and -- and Washington 's unwillingness to tackle the tough problems for decades has left us in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
And that 's why the biggest risk we could take right now is to adopt the same failed policies and the same failed politics that we 've seen over the last eight years and somehow expect a different result .
We need fundamental change in this country , and that 's what I 'd like to bring .
You know , over the last 20 months , you 've invited me into your homes .
You 've shared your stories with me .
And you 've confirmed once again the fundamental decency and generosity of the American people .
And that 's why I 'm sure that our brighter days are still ahead .
But we 're going to have to invest in the American people again , in tax cuts for the middle class , in health care for all Americans , and college for every young person who wants to go .
In businesses that can create the new energy economy of the future .
In policies that will lift wages and will grow our middle class .
These are the policies I have fought for my entire career .
And these are the policies I want to bring to the White House .
But it 's not going to be easy .
It 's not going to be quick .
It is going to be requiring all of us -- Democrats , Republicans , independents -- to come together and to renew a spirit of sacrifice and service and responsibility .
I 'm absolutely convinced we can do it .
I would ask for your vote , and I promise you that if you give me the extraordinary honor of serving as your president , I will work every single day , tirelessly , on your behalf and on the behalf of the future of our children .
Thank you very much .
Schieffer : Sen. Obama , Sen. McCain , thank you very much .
This concludes the final debate .
I'm Bob Schieffer of CBS News , and I will leave you tonight with what my mother always said -- go vote now .
It will make you feel big and strong .
Good night , everyone .

With the political candidates all talking about energy independence and the rapid changes that they 'll bring to the nation 's industries , I wanted to point you to a freelance feature I wrote about California 's ethanol - importing infrastructure .
Built around California 's decision to change the formulation of its gasoline to include ethanol as an anti-smog additive , my takeaway from this 3,500 word feature – crowdfunded through Spot .
Us – is that making even small changes to the infrastructure we 've built over the last 50 years will be immensely difficult .
In particular , people working in clean tech tend to forget that there is a whole legacy fuel distribution infrastructure – the midstream , it 's called – that is built from steel and concrete .
It wo n't topple as easily as the old media distribution outlets have in the Internet age .
As one of my main sources , a young Berkeley - trained engineer told me , " Everybody is excited about cleantech and having some wiz bang widget , but it does n’t matter if you ’re talking about algae or jatropha biodiesel or switch - grass cellulosic ethanol .
None of it matters unless you can get it to market . ”
With tight oil supplies and climate change concerns rightly driving investment into new fuels and transportation modes , it 's worth taking a look at what had to happen so that Californians could start putting a billion gallons of a new fuel into their gas tanks .
So , regardless of what you think of ethanol , if you 're interested in pipelines and rail terminals , exurban towns and storage tanks , check out the article : Changing Locomotion in Midstream .

Sarah Palin ’s baby shower included a surprise guest : her own baby .
He had arrived in the world a month early , so on a sunny May day , Ms. Palin , the governor of Alaska , rocked her newborn as her closest friends , sisters , even her obstetrician presented her with a potluck meal , presents and blue - and - white cake .
Most had learned that Ms. Palin was pregnant only a few weeks before .
Struggling to accept that her child would be born with Down syndrome and fearful of public criticism of a governor ’s pregnancy , Ms. Palin had concealed the news that she was expecting even from her parents and children until her third trimester .
But as the governor introduced her son that day , according to a friend , Kristan Cole , she said she had come to regard him as a blessing from God .
“ Who of us in this room has the perfect child ? ” said Ms. Palin , who declined to be interviewed for this article .
Since that day , Trig Paxson Van Palin , still only 143 days old , has had an unexpected effect on his mother ’s political fortunes .
Before her son was born , Ms. Palin went to extraordinary lengths to ensure that his arrival would not compromise her work .
She hid the pregnancy .
She traveled to Texas a month before her due date to give an important speech , delivering it even though her amniotic fluid was leaking .
Three days after giving birth , she returned to work .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - California ’s state government is forming a “ water bank ” to buy water for local water agencies at risk of shortages next year should a current drought persist , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said on Thursday .

California 's state government is forming a " water bank " to buy water for local water agencies at risk of shortages next year should a current drought persist , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said on Thursday .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
Schwarzenegger in June declared the most populous U.S. state to officially be in drought and declared nine counties in its farm - rich Central Valley to be in a state of emergency because water supplies were so low after two years of below - average rainfall .
California ’s water shortages have been compounded by a federal court order to limit pumping water from the state ’s San Joaquin - Sacramento River Delta to protect a species of fish .
The delta area east of San Francisco is the state ’s fresh water hub .
Its water is conveyed across the state , including as far away as Southern California .
California ’s 2009 Drought Water Bank will buy water primarily from local water agencies and farmers upstream of the delta and make it available for sale to public and private water systems expecting to run short of water next year .
The last time California ’s Department of Water Resources set up a water bank was in the early 1990s and the agency plans much more strict guidelines for its new effort , said Wendy Martin , the statewide drought coordinator for the agency .
“ We will be paying closer attention to ... making sure water is being used for the greatest and highest public service .
We ’re not going to let people take water and use it for frivolous reasons , ” Martin told Reuters by telephone .
She noted that agencies buying water through the bank will have to commit to a 20 percent reduction in overall water use .
Schwarzenegger said the program will help ease water shortages if California ’s drought presses on and he once again urged lawmakers to agree on a bond bill for financing an expansion of the state ’s water storage and delivery infrastructure .
“ California ’s drought is impacting our economy , our agriculture and our families , and an end to these dry conditions is nowhere in sight , ” he said .
“ While we are taking action to address the state ’s drought situation , there remains an urgent need for Californians to step up conservation efforts and for the legislature to pass a comprehensive water plan that will ensure California has the water it needs to keep our economy strong and our people working , ” Schwarzenegger added .
The Republican governor has threatened the Democrat - led legislature he will not sign any of its bills until it crafts a state budget -- now more than two months overdue -- but he will make an exception for legislation approving state debt for water infrastructure , which he wants to put to voters as a ballot measure , said spokeswoman Lisa Page .
Schwarzenegger and U.S. Sen .
Dianne Feinstein , a Democrat , have teamed up to promote a $ 9.3 billion plan to lawmakers that would address the delta ’s environmental problems while expanding the state ’s water works .
Their plan and rival plans have been sidelined in the legislature as lawmakers haggle over a state budget .
“ Right now the No. 1 priority is passing a responsible budget .
No talks are taking place on water , ” said Alicia Trost , a spokeswoman for Senate President pro Tem Don Perata .
What he wants , he says , " is for these people at least to stand at attention to explain themselves .
I do n't know if you 've ever tried to get to Verizon .
. . .
You can not get to them .
They are insulated from things like this . "
" I was just doing my job , " he said .
" I was called out like a lot of other pilots to help and I was obviously happy to do that .
With the exception of the iPhone , Apple 's products largely lack technology to provide ubiquitous access to the outside world while on the go .
However , a new proposal from the company would attempt to solve this problem , and provide ever - present access to the Internet , through a series of tiny RF modules that can be toted or place just about anywhere .
In a 36 - page filing published for the first time Thursday and titled " Personal area network systems and devices and methods for use thereof , " the electronics maker outlines a system for allowing products with only short - range communications circuitry , such as iPods and MacBooks , to connect to and leverage those equipped with long - range technology , such as the iPhone or specially designed RF modules .
These special RF modules would be " constructed to be a high efficiency , low cost , devices " that may lack a direct user interface , like the company 's AirPort base stations .
They 'd package short - range circuity — such as WiFi , Bluetooth and other high frequency systems ( 2.4 GHz , and 5.6 GHz communication systems ) — for connecting to devices that lack long - range circuitry , in addition to long - range circuitry that those host devices can tap into , such as GSM , GPRS , EDGE , and CDMA .
The tiny RF modules would be " ubiquitous in that they permeate every aspect of a person 's life , " Apple says .
" For example , a user may keep a RF module on his or her person such in a purse , handbag or article of clothing , in a house , a transportation vehicle ( e.g. , a car ) , or an office .
This way , a user need not worry about having to carry a long - range communications device wherever he or she may go , as a RF module may be kept in locations frequently visited by the user . "
In some applications , multiple RF modules may be kept in a single location , such as a house , office building , or city .
" When the user moves from one location to another , the host device may determine which RF module to access when requiring use of a long - range communications protocol , " the company says .
For power , the RF modules would use a fixed or removable rechargeable battery , such as a lithium - ion battery , disposable alkaline battery , or any other portable power source , including kinetic energy converters .
They could also be constructed to receive power from an external source such as a conventional outlet , a car outlet , or an external battery pack .
In addition to serving as connectivity hubs for portable computers and handheld devices , a single or series of RF modules scattered through a specific locations could also form the backbone of a robust VoIP network .
For instance , host devices — such as iPods , car stereo systems or other devices that lack long - range technology — could tap into the AddressBook on a Mac or iPhone to make telephone calls or conduct text message conversation that would be routed to through the network of RF modules .
The host device may maintain a communication event ( e.g. , a telephone call ) without interruption ( e.g. , a dropped call ) when switching from one RF module to another or to a wireless phone , " Apple says .
What 's more , the company describes methods that would allow users to abstain from handling a short - range host device altogether by instead tying smaller peripheral — or accessory — devices into the communications network .
" Peripheral devices can be portable , handheld , miniature , or wearable devices .
The peripheral device can be used to control the operation of the host or hybrid device or may be used to display information relating to a function or feature of the host or hybrid device , " the filing says .
" For example , a peripheral device may be a fashion accessory such as a watch that may display information ( e.g. , the name of the currently playing song or name of the person on the call ) and also allow a user to control functions ( e.g. , playback , volume , or telephony features such as end call and accept call ) of the host device .
Other peripheral devices may provide host control functions but may not have a display , and yet other peripheral devices may provide input ( e.g. , keyboard ) and output ( e.g. , LCD or printer ) functions . "
Similarly , the same principles would apply to a personal area network formed in an automobile or in connection with a communications system in an automobile .
Apple explains that " host device may be physically connected to an automobile stereo system and may allow a user to access telephony features provided by the host device using the stereo system .
For example , a user may browse through contact list information ( stored on the host device ) using the stereo system and select a user to initiate a call .
When the call is initiated , the host device may access the long - range communications protocol of a RF module or wireless phone to conduct the call .
The user 's voice may be picked by a microphone that may be integrated within the host device , a cable interconnecting the host device and the stereo system , or associated with the car stereo or other communications system of the automobile . "
Fast food outlets are prevalent in South Los Angeles
The Los Angeles city council has imposed a ban on new fast - food outlets in a low - income neighbourhood with a high incidence of obesity and diabetes .
The aim of the one - year moratorium is to attract restaurants that offer healthier food choices , officials say .
About two - thirds of the restaurants in the South Los Angeles area , inhabited mainly by Latinos and African - Americans , are fast - food outlets .
Representatives of fast - food chains have criticised the move .
They say they already offer healthier food items on their menus .
" It 's not where you eat , it 's what you eat , " Andrew Pudzer , president and chief executive of CKE Restaurants , told the Associated Press news agency .
" We were willing to work with the city on that , but they obviously were n't interested . "
A recent report by the Community Health Councils found 73 % of South Los Angeles restaurants were fast food , compared with 42 % in affluent West Los Angeles .
About 30 % of adults in South Los Angeles are obese , compared with 19 % for the metropolitan area , according to the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health .
“ I ’m astounded that this issue is being trotted out again .
Based on what I saw in 2004 and 2006 , it ’s a scare tactic . ”
Who ’s that speaking ?
And what ’s he talking about ?
That ’s fired US Attorney David Iglesias talking about the news leaked today that the DOJ and FBI are opening a nationwide investigation into allegations that the community organization ACORN is somehow working to undermine the November election through fraud .
For more from Iglesias and his fellow fired US Attorney Bud Cummins , do n’t miss TPMMuckraker ’s Zack Roth ’s interview post from earlier this evening .
Iglesias got fired not long after the 2006 midterm election because he would n’t get off the dime and bring bogus vote fraud indictments against Democrats or time other indictments of Democrats to sway the 2006 election .
In other words , he got canned for not doing what a number of his former colleagues at the DOJ are happily doing this very day .
Nor was Iglesias simpy a respected attorney with solid enough connections to swing a US Attorney appointment .
He was a rising star in the New Mexico Republican party .
Iglesias was the Republican nominee for Attorney General in 1998 .
( Not that it ’s immediately relevant to this question , but Iglesias was the Navy JAG lawyer on whom Tom Cruise ’s character in A Few Good Men was based . )
This was that reassuring case where a political person ’s partisan attachments butted up against his integrity and the latter won the day hands down .
This is someone who knows this scam from the inside and whose testimony — literal and figurative — comes not in line with partisan attachments but in spite of them .
Everyone should listen .
Google is looking to bolster its efforts to open up the wireless industry .
Cofounder Larry Page had a few choice words for the FCC and its lack of progress on white space this week , and now a recently published Google patent details a plan that would give the wireless industry an easy way to open its services to all customers and easily compete on price and coverage .
Here 's the relevant part from Google 's patent application ( via NewScientist ) , titled Flexible Communication Systems and Methods :
Devices , systems , and methods for providing telecommunication access and applications to users in a flexible manner .
Devices may operate on multiple networks , and may in certain circumstances seek out bids from telecommunication service providers .
Google wants to break down the barriers that exist between wireless companies and the services they offer .
Emerging devices and services , like T - Mobile 's WiFi calling , allow customers to switch from the cellular network to hotspots — but only if you 're a T - Mobile customer , and even then , only at T - Mobile - run hotspots .
Services like these are one step in the right direction , and Google wants to take a giant leap even further .
Instead of the current paradigm of locking customers into a suite of services from a single provider , Google 's patent describes a system where a wireless device , say a cell phone or a netbook , can survey the communication technologies available in any particular area .
The device could then ping each provider for per-service prices , and display the available options , constraints , and cost to the user .
Google 's patent describes various scenarios in which providers could to compete with each other over these services , such as a regular phone call , data access , or VoIP .
It also covers methods for providers to opt - out on the fly if a local network is too saturated , as well as both micropayment and subscription options to cover the tab for all this per-service activity .
Naturally , there are a number of roadblocks to Google 's nickel - and - dime communication service ambitions , not the least of which are the major network providers ' affinity for subscription plans over pay - as - you - go services .
Not only do these plans ensure steady revenue and discourage customers from canceling or switching , but they also help keep things simple for the consumer from the standpoint of usability and billing .
There are some efforts from wireless carriers to move in the direction of more open services and networks .
Most recently , Verizon 's " open access " moves and BYOD plans show cracks in the walls surrounding the carriers ' wireless empires .
Taking the openness initiatives and contract - free service by letting consumers pay a nominal fee to hop on someone else 's network in a pinch for a VoIP call or to grab some e-mail would be a great next step , regardless of what happens to Google 's patent application .
Katie Holmes Broadway Debut Ensemble - Hit or Miss ? ( Photos )
, who has been giving All My Sons Broadway performances for over a month , made her official Broadway opening debut last night .
For the occasion she was sporting an interesting ensemble that she reportedly designed .
The slim fitting full sleeved black sheer lace top was worn under a white strapless bubble hem jumpsuit .
She carried a black clutch purse and the already statuesque beauty was sporting black spike heels .
The evening was reportedly a triumph for the actress but was partially marred by protesters who carried signs and shouted vehemently against Scientology .
Maybe that is why there were no Tom Cruise sightings .
Check out Katie 's Broadway fashion statement .
Was it a hit or a miss ?

Home Worlds : Controlling the Scope of Side Effects Worlds : Controlling the Scope of Side Effects by Alessandro Warth and Alan Kay , 2008 .
The state of an imperative program - â € ” e.g. , the values stored in global and local variables , objectsâ€™ instance variables , and arraysâ€ ” changes as its statements are executed .
These changes , or side effects , are visible globally : when one part of the program modiï¬es an object , every other part that holds a reference to the same object ( either directly or indirectly ) is also affected .
This paper introduces worlds , a language construct that reiï¬es the notion of program state , and enables programmers to control the scope of side effects .
We investigate this idea as an extension of JavaScript , and provide examples that illustrate some of the interesting idioms that it makes possible .
This introduces a new programming construct that 's just the kind I love : they stimulate the imagination and provide simple and strong dynamic invariants to make programs easy to reason about .

For the long view on the 2008 Arctic sea ice melt , see today ’s commentary on Nature Reports Climate Change by two National Snow and Ice Data Center researchers .
Mark Serreze and Julienne Stroeve recap the results :
The seasonal minimum for 2008 , occurring on 14 September , entered the books as the second - lowest of the satellite era , probably the second - lowest of at least a century , and just behind the standing record set in 2007 .
Barely second - lowest still came as a shock , given the cooler weather this year .
Said Stroeve in an NISDC press release , “ I find it incredible that we came so close to beating the 2007 record — without the especially warm and clear conditions we saw last summer .
I hate to think what 2008 might have looked like if weather patterns had set up in a more extreme way . ”
August 2008 saw the fastest melt ever recorded , according to NASA .
And ice volume , a bellwether for the future , probably was at its lowest this year – an observation that has n’t reached the broadsheets ( but see Climate Progress and Stoat ) .
NSIDC scientist Walt Meier explains , “ Warm ocean waters helped contribute to ice losses this year , pushing the already thin ice pack over the edge .
In fact , preliminary data indicates that 2008 probably represents the lowest volume of Arctic sea ice on record , partly because less multiyear ice is surviving now , and the remaining ice is so thin . ”
Yes , unlike you or me , Arctic sea ice is getting younger and thinner as the years pass .
Old , thick ice that has survived through multiple summers – which two decades ago grew fast enough to roughly match the loss of Arctic ice into the North Atlantic – is giving way to flimsy young stuff that readily melts into open water during the warm months .
The endpoint of this trajectory would be all - new ice in winter and no ice in summer .
Serreze and Stroeve :
With sharply rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations , the change to a seasonally ice - free Arctic Ocean seems inevitable .
The only question is how fast we get there .
The emerging view is that if we ’re still waiting for the rapid slide towards this ice - free state , we wo n’t be waiting much longer .
Looking back at recent changes , the authors talk triggers .
Models suggest that thinning Arctic sea ice is “ vulnerable to a ‘ kick ’ from natural variability that sets the feedback process into high gear , ” they note , resulting in “ abrupt transition ” to ice - free summers .
The warmth of 2007 , caused by an unusual atmospheric circulation pattern , is one of the candidates for a recent kick – and though this year brought a slight recovery of ice extent , signs point to more losses coming up .

Clumps of material have adhered to the legs of the Phoenix Mars Lander , and the clumps continue to change and grow .
The science team has discussed various possible explanations for these clumps .
One suggestion is that they may have started from a splash of mud if Phoenix ’s descent engines melted icy soil during the landing .
Another is that specks of salt may have landed on the strut and began attracting atmospheric moisture that freezes and accumulates .
The clumps are concentrated on the north side of the strut , usually in the shade , so their accumulation could be a consequence of the fact that condensation favors colder surfaces .
Below , compare images taken on September 1 , 2008 , or the 97th Martian Day or sol , since landing with another image taken about three months earlier , on Sol 8 .
Phoenix ’s Robotic Arm Camera took both images .
The top image from Sol 97 was taken at about 4 a.m. local solar time .
The view in this Sol 97 image is southward .
Illumination is from the early morning sun above the northeastern horizon .
This is quite different from the illumination in the Sol 8 image , bottom which was taken in mid-afternoon .
The two images also show a contrast in the flat , smooth patch of exposed ice underneath the lander .
Phoenix team members believe the ice was exposed from the spacecraft ’s thrusters as it landed .
In the latest image , the patches of ice exposed underneath the lander seem to be partly covered by darker material left behind as ice vaporizes away .
The flat patch in the center of the image has the informal name “ Holy Cow , ” based on researchers ’ reaction when they saw the initial image of it .

Yesterday , a " highly placed source " in Moscow was reported as saying the Kremlin intends to turn off the oil export pipeline to the EU on Monday , so great is Russian ire about the rhetoric in Brussels and warships in the Black Sea .
If this is true , we are entering a whole new ball game in what has come to be called " energy security " .
Even if the report proves false , the west should be on red alert about energy export weaponry .
Barely noticed in the runup to the crisis in Georgia , Russia signed a deal that gives its energy giant Gazprom control over gas supply from neighbouring Turkmenistan - one of three former Soviet satellite states around the Caspian sea on which Europe is pinning its hopes for a future gas supply .
This Turkmen coup deepens Britain 's possible energy dependence on Russia as North Sea production falls away .
Coyly worded press releases on Gazprom 's website shine a faint light on its Kremlin - driven machinations but stop short of illuminating the whole story .
Gazprom is on its way to achieving dominion over Caspian gas , and the Kremlin is making overtures to the other states in the region , Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan .
They in turn must be watching events in Georgia and wondering how they can refuse those advances .
At the same time , Moscow is cosying up to Beijing on energy and security : Russia and China signed an energy collaboration treaty before the G8 summit , and their armed forces have conducted joint exercises .
Caspian gas may yet end up heading eastward , not westward .
Gazprom has already threatened to withhold gas exports from Europe should Brussels try to stop it buying up European gas firms .
Ten EU states are already largely dependent on Russian gas .
The Kremlin has a strategy to control a vast slab of the world economy via oil and gas .
Dmitry Medvedev , lest we forget , used to run Gazprom .
The Georgia crisis , if not a planned piece in the strategy , certainly fits .
The EU intended to build a pipeline across the Caucasus , avoiding Russian soil , but the sudden unavailability of Turkmen gas , on top of war in Georgia , makes that unlikely now .
In the oil sector , all the major companies have been drawn into the Kremlin 's new great game .
Shell has lost majority ownership of its vast Sakhalin project ;
Total has been reduced to the status of a services company ; BP seems on the verge of having 25 % of its reserves expropriated by Russian oligarchs .
Would it be too cynical to suggest they might be acting as proxies for a company formerly run by the president ?
A company , it must be noted , that is actually quoted on the London Stock Exchange .
The UK , meanwhile , has no energy strategy , and what plans there are will not come to fruition before the end of the next decade , when it will be too late to escape the Russia trap .
We should be urgently embarking on a national clean - energy mobilisation .
The government should create investment conditions that allow City capital to flow into efficient - energy technologies that can be delivered in short order .
It is a strange kind of capitalism that takes pension contributions from people and invests them in an agency of a foreign power quoted on the LSE , despite the risk that pensioners will freeze because the foreign power delivers on threats to turn off the gas taps .
We have technologies to rid ourselves of the need for gas .
But we do next to nothing .
Energy efficiency is low priority , and our renewable generators languish in cottage industries .
Energy dependency could turn a new cold war red hot .
Energy independence would allow east and west merely to trade insults .
Let us start the independence movement in earnest , energy wise .

Packagekit aims to make the management of applications in the Linux and GNU systems .
The main objective to remove the pains it takes to create a system .
Along with this in an interview , Richard Hughes , the developer of Packagekit said that he aims to make the Linux systems just as powerful as the Windows or Mac systems .
He and another coder Robin Norwood wanted to create a tool which was n’t restrictive as the other distro tools .
Other distros usually re-invented the previous packages which gave bad translated specifications .
The duo developed Packagekit to get over the other shortcomings .

Astronomers announced today that a new “ minor planet ” with an unusual orbit has been found just two billion miles from Earth , closer than Neptune .
Using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey , astronomers detected a small , comet - like object called 2006 SQ372 , which is likely made of rock and ice .
However , its orbit never brings it close enough to the sun for it to develop a tail .
Its unusual orbit is an ellipse that is four times longer than it is wide , said University of Washington astronomer Andrew Becker , who led the discovery team .
The only known object with a comparable orbit is Sedna — the distant , Pluto - like dwarf planet discovered in 2003 .
But 2006 SQ372 ’s orbit takes it more than one - and - a - half times further from the Sun , and its orbital period is nearly twice as long .
2006 SQ372 is beginning the return leg of a 22,500 - year journey that will take it to a distance of 150 billion miles , nearly 1,600 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun .
Scientists believe the object is only 50 - 100 kilometers ( 30 - 60 miles ) across .

Becker ’s team was actually using the SDSS to look for supernova explosions billions of light - years away to measure the expansion of the universe .
“ If you can find things that explode , you can also find things that move , but you need different tools to look for them , ” said team member Lynne Jones , also of the University of Washington .
The only objects close enough to change position noticeably from one night to the next are in our own solar system , Jones explained .
The SDSS - II supernova survey scanned the same long stripe of sky , an area 1,000 times larger than the full moon , every clear night in the fall of 2005 , 2006 , and 2007 .
SQ372 was first discovered in a series of images taken in 2006 by the SDSS , and were verified from images taken in 2005 and 2007 .
The researcher team is trying to understand how the object acquired its unusual orbit .
“ It could have formed , like Pluto , in the belt of icy debris beyond Neptune , then been kicked to large distance by a gravitational encounter with Neptune or Uranus , ” said UW graduate student Nathan Kaib .
“ However , we think it is more probable that SQ372 comes from the inner edge of the Oort Cloud . ”
Even at its most distant turning point , 2006 SQ372 will be ten times closer to the Sun than the supposed main body of the Oort Cloud , said Kaib .
“ The existence of an ‘ inner ’ Oort cloud has been theoretically predicted for many years , but SQ372 and perhaps Sedna are the first objects we have found that seem to originate there .
It ’s exciting that we are beginning to verify these predictions . ”
Becker noted that 2006 SQ372 was bright enough to find with the SDSS only because it is near its closest approach to the Sun , and that the SDSS - II supernova survey observed less than one percent of the sky .
“ There are bound to be many more objects like this waiting to be discovered by the next generation of surveys , which will search to fainter levels and cover more area , ” said Becker .
“ In a decade , we should know a lot more about this population than we do now . ”
“ One of our goals , ” said Kaib , “ is to understand the origin of comets , which are among the most spectacular celestial events .
But the deeper goal is to look back into the early history of our solar system and piece together what was happening when the planets formed . ”
The discovery of 2006 SQ372 was announced today in Chicago , at an international symposium about the Sloan Digital Sky Survey .
A paper describing the discovery technique and the properties of 2006 SQ372 is being prepared for submission to The Astrophysical Journal .

When I moved from my native Canada to the UK in 2003 , I thought it was ironic that the Doctorows had returned to Europe .
My father was born to Polish - Russian parents in a refugee camp in Azerbaijan just before the second world war ended .
My grandparents – deserting Red Army conscriptees – destroyed their documents and became , in the parlance of the day , Displaced People .
When the war ended , they went west again , but when they reached Russia , they kept going .
When they reached Poland , they kept going .
They moved with the great refugee herd into Germany , to a camp near Hamburg ( where my aunt was born ) , before boarding a refugee boat and sailing to the port of Halifax , where an immigration official truncated their names – Doctorowicz became Doctorow – and gave them a train ticket to Toronto , where my great - uncle Max and his family lived .
My grandmother is still alive , and sharp as a tack .
I asked her recently why they did n't stay in the Soviet Union .
Despite her aversion to military service , she was a war hero .
She had gone through her adolescence as a civil defence worker during the hard years of the Siege of Leningrad , digging trenches and hauling bodies as a girl of 12 , until she was evacuated to Siberia at the age of 15 .
Her family still lived in Leningrad – mother , father , baby brother .
Leningrad is a majestic city , cosmopolitan and vibrant , even with the war scars on its face .
In Toronto she knew no one , did n't speak the language .
Her years as a refugee would stretch out for decades until she could truly consider herself a Canadian .
I asked her why she did n't stay , and she shook her head like I 'd asked the stupidest possible question .
" It was the Soviet Union " , she said .
She waved her hand , groped for the answer .
" Papers , " she said , finally .
" We had to carry papers .
The police could stop you at any time and make you turn over your papers . "
The floodgates opened .
They spied on you .
They made you spy on each other .
Your grandfather would n't have been allowed to stay – he was Polish , they would n't let him stay with the family in Russia , he'd have to go back to Poland .
My head bobbed unconsciously as she told me this .
I knew all of it , by way of innuendos and hints over the years , but I had never heard her say it all at once .
I 'd even seen it firsthand , when we visited the family in Leningrad in 1984 , having our conversations cut short when they strayed into political territory , with over - the - shoulder looks for the snoops who might be listening in and waiting to turn my family in to the KGB .
Half a century later , the Doctorows came back to Europe .
I set up residence in London , working for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , an American civil liberties nonprofit , running the European operations .
I was privileged to be given status as a " highly skilled migrant " ( the only visa category I qualified for , given my lack of a university degree ) .
A few years later , I was living with my partner , and had fathered a British daughter ( when I mentioned this to a UK immigration official at Heathrow , he sneeringly called her " half a British citizen " ) .
We were planning a giant family wedding in Toronto when the news came down : the Home Secretary had unilaterally , on 24 hours ' notice , changed the rules for highly skilled migrants to require a university degree .
My immigration lawyers confirmed it : people who'd established residence in the UK for years and years , who'd built businesses and employed Britons here , who owned homes and given birth to British children , were being thrown out of the country , taking their tax - payments , jobs and families with them .
My partner and I scrambled .
We got married .
We applied for a spousal visa .
A few weeks later , I presented myself in Croydon at the Home Office immigration centre to turn over my biometrics and have a visa glued into my Canadian passport .
I got two years ' breathing room .
My family could stay in Britain .
Then came last week 's announcement : effective immediately , spousal visa holders ( and foreign students ) would be issued mandatory , biometric radio - frequency ID papers that we will have to carry at all times .
And I started to look over my shoulder .
Once again , it seems as though the Doctorows may have to leave Europe .
The identity card I 'm to be issued when I renew my visa is intended to be linked to all my daily activities : my medical care , my use of transit , my banking and finance , my tax – a single identifier that will track me through time and space , forever .
The dossier thus gathered on me will be managed by the same agencies that have lost ( literally ) tens of millions ' worth of records on British people in the past year alone .
It will all be tied to my biometric identifiers , such as fingerprints .
Unless you wear gloves at all times , you leave these identifiers behind continuously , everywhere you go .
These identifiers are not only available to law enforcement and the state , but to anyone who cares to lift them off any smooth surface you happen to touch .
Once these identifiers are compromised , there is no means – short of amputation – to change them .
Consider the case of German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schauble , who advocates biometric IDs : his fingerprints were lifted from a water - glass at a public debate and published on 10,000 pieces of acetate by a group of media pranksters with no budget and who stood to gain no financial benefit from the stunt .
Will well - heeled identity thieves who can use these biometrics to commit crimes and empty bank accounts be less resourceful ?
The identity card will emit my personal information to people who are at a great distance from me , without my knowledge or consent .
The RFID tags in the cards are advertised as only being readable at a few centimetres ' distance , like an Oyster card , but , like an Oyster card , security researchers have shown that these cards can be read at tens of metres , and can be cloned using cheap , off - the - shelf technology .
So it 's fortunate that I got my spousal visa when I did , before these identity papers were made mandatory .
Indeed , it 's fortunate that I received my spousal visa at all , as Labour moves to limit the number of annual new visas of all kinds to 20,000 people , meaning that Britons who marry foreigners can no longer be assured that they will be able to settle and raise their families in the UK .
The national ID card does not exist in a vacuum .
It is part of an unprecedented , unparalleled programme to use technology to spy upon and control the movements of people in the UK .
Our internet connections are censored and wiretapped by advertisers .
Soon , our ISPs will be forced to log and retain the details of all our online activity for snooping by governments , bored employees , or any crook who can hack or bribe his way into the surveillance databases .
Our image is captured hundreds of times every time we leave the house .
Our number - plates are photographed hundreds of times by traffic cameras , creating a record of where we 've been .
Our Oyster card data is logged and made available to police , snoops , crooks and anyone else with the resources to get hold of it .
We can be arrested and held for weeks without charge .
Government tells academics which freely available information about terrorists they are allowed to study and what they are not allowed to look at .
We are encouraged to spy on our neighbours and report their suspicious activity .
We can be stopped and searched with no particularised suspicion , and during these searches , police officers can and do examine such things as the books we 're reading and the personal notes we 've made .
Every one of these measures was beta - tested on less - advantaged groups before it was rolled out to the general public .
CCTVs used the be the exclusive territory of bank vaults and prisons .
Network wiretapping and censorship began in schools , " to protect children " .
Now , we immigrants are to be the beta testers for Britain 's sleepwalk into the surveillance society .
We will have to carry internal passports and the press will say , " If you do n't like it , you do n't have to live here – it's unseemly for a guest to complain about the terms of the hospitality . "
But this beta test is not intended to stop with immigrants .
Government freely admits that immigrants are only the first stage of a universal rollout of mandatory biometric RFID identity cards .
What happens to us now will happen to you , next .
Not me , though .
If the government of the day when I renew my visa in 2010 requires that I carry these papers as a condition of residence , the Doctorows will again leave their country and find a freer one .
My wife – born here , raised here , with family here – is with me .
We wo n't raise our British daughter in the database nation .
It 's not safe .
These past couple days have been a blast .
j Query Conference this past Sunday followed by 3 days of The Ajax Experience here in Boston .
I ended up giving 9 talks and was on 2 panels in 3 days – completely exhausting .
We were able to get video of a bunch of the jQuery Conference so we should be posting it soon .
It was great getting to see the whole jQuery team again .
We talked a lot , did a lot of planning , and are ready to tackle the work in front of us .
Here are the presentations that I gave , if you ’re interested :
I alluded to some big news on Twitter a couple weeks ago and was able to announce it at the jQuery Conference : Microsoft and Nokia are both adopting jQuery as part of their official development platforms .
It ’s been a crazy couple days tracking all the feedback from the announcement ( as the links below will surely attest to ) but one thing is clear : People are really excited .
I was amused by the handful of posts from commenters , who obviously had never used jQuery , that were worried about Microsoft “ embracing and extending ” jQuery .
Honestly , there is nothing that I would like better for that to happen .
Considering that jQuery has a fantastic plugin architecture in place we fully expect Microsoft and Nokia to join the legion of other happy jQuery users who ’ve constructed powerful jQuery plugins to suit their specific needs .
Considering that it ’s possible to extend jQuery core , events , animations , and selectors all with explicitly - defined and documented APIs it seems pretty safe to assume that we ’ll continue to make jQuery as extensible as possible – keeping our core tight , optimized , and designed with the developer in mind .
Here ’s to jQuery in 2009 !

This blog is supported technically ( and , occasionally , editorially ) by Catherine Grant , and in all sorts of other important ways by Katerina Grant .
If the title of this article were quoted by Sarah Palin , she would no doubt attribute it to Hillary Clinton ( see Madeline Albright reference ) .
During the presidential primary Hillary voiced the following refrain : " Obama is not a Muslim , as far as I know . "
Her statement is redundant , as is mine , but neither is a tautology .
They both convey a sense of doubt while maintaining a warped sense of validity .
But there does exist a difference ; Hillary 's statement can essentially be proven true with facts , whereas mine remains gray around the edges .
The genius of this archetypal statement resides within its easily deniable purpose of excitation .
McCain may not be a racist , I do n't believe he is , but I can not say one way or another with absolute certainty .
I know I 'm walking a slippery slope , but so are 6,440,000 other people ; John included , especially after his " that one " comment in the most recent debate .
Yes , I 'm going there , but it 's not what you think .
Throughout the debate I recorded quotes and moments of significance for inclusion into the live analysis article .
When the " that one " exchange occurred I noticed it , I did a double take and mentioned the racial overtone to the other person watching with me , but I did n't think to write it down .
For some reason this statement did not strike me as news worthy ; likely because it should not have been news worthy .
I could not fathom the possibility of an intentionally racial remark ; I immediately assumed McCain garbled the sentence .
I then reasoned as to what McCain might have intended to say ; my best guess goes something along the lines of " he supported that one , " in reference to the energy bill , but it of course did not come out like that .
It took some time , an hour and sixteen minutes later to be exact ( while watching a replay ) for the gravity of this misstatement to solidify .
It finally clicked and when it did , I knew McCain 's campaign was over .
This blunder should not have been the defining moment of the campaign , but unfortunately I think it was .
The McCain campaign tried to walk the fine line required to effectively wage a negative campaign , but McCain lost his balance and the liberal media helped push him to the floor .
McCain became lost in a sea of blue ; while desperately struggling to find his own message he concurrently hurled the kitchen sink at his opponent .
McCain 's entire campaign has failed to realize the need for a systemic shift in their messaging .
The current Republican path does n't lead to glory as the road nears it 's November end , they need to find a new path .
At this point Obama should simply ignore the race issue and place the " that one " quote in his back pocket for a rainy day .
If the McCain campaign starts overly playing the race card , Obama can then easily counter .
I 've talked about it before , but I 'll say it again ; John McCain can do more good for the Republican party if he loses honorably , than if he blazes a path of divisiveness to the White House .
I do n't know if he knows this , his ego is clouding his judgment .
I fear the moral compass required to end the smears may extend beyond McCain 's scope of reasoning .
McCain , like his party sees the world in absolutes , the with us or against us mindset ; I just hope he realizes that his character is absolutely being questioned .

Picture the following scenario : you ’re driving your normal route to work , minding your own business .
Â
Then , out of the corner of your eye , you see that the car next to you started to slowly veer into your lane .
Â
You look over and see the driver next to you is busy texting .
How many times has this very scenario happened to you ?
Â
Or , more importantly , how many times have you been the driver guilty of texting while driving ?
It is currently illegal to text while driving in six states : Alaska , California , Connecticut , Minnesota , New Jersey , and Washington .
Â
Attempts to ban text messaging are currently being made by many more states as well .
Are these bans prime examples of state governments overstepping their bounds and interfering with private matters , or should every state step up and ban texting while driving in an effort to protect “ innocent ” motorists ?
According to a recent poll on Daily Fuel Economy Tip , a vast majority of drivers believe in the latter ( banning texting ) over the former ( not banning ) .
Â
Here ’s how nearly 200 readers responded when asked : “ Do you think it should be illegal to text while driving ? ”
78 % said texting while driving should be illegal
19 % said texting while driving should not be illegal
3 % said they were unsure or had no opinion
These numbers are pretty overwhelming , and since I ’m sure many state legislatures have seen similar data , it would n’t be at all surprising to see a spike in the number of states passing laws against driving while texting .
And , for that matter , I ’m sure we ’ll see even more states requiring the use of a hands - free device in order to use a cell phone while driving .
If it helps to make the roads safer for drivers and pedestrians , I do n’t see why we would n’t all be for that !

Home » Theology and Spirituality » Articles in English Printer friendly version Bishop Hilarion Alfeyev : Christ the Conqueror of Hell
The Descent of Christ into Hades in Eastern and Western Theological Traditions A lecture delivered at St Mary ’s Cathedral , Minneapolis , USA , on 5 November 2002 The Byzantine and old Russian icons of the Resurrection of Christ never depict the resurrection itself , i.e. , Christ coming out of the grave .
They rather depict ‘ the descent of Christ into Hades ’ , or to be more precise , the rising of Christ out of hell .
Christ , sometimes with a cross in his hand , is represented as raising Adam , Eve and other personages of the biblical history from hell .
Under the Saviour ’s feet is the black abyss of the nether world ; against its background are castles , locks and debris of the gates which once barred the way of the dead to resurrection .
Though other motifs have also been used in creating the image of the Resurrection of Christ in the last several centuries The Byzantine and old Russian icons of the Resurrection of Christ never depict the resurrection itself , i.e. , Christ coming out of the grave .
They rather depict ‘ the descent of Christ into Hades ’ , or to be more precise , the rising of Christ out of hell .
Christ , sometimes with a cross in his hand , is represented as raising Adam , Eve and other personages of the biblical history from hell .
Under the Saviour ’s feet is the black abyss of the nether world ; against its background are castles , locks and debris of the gates which once barred the way of the dead to resurrection .
Though other motifs have also been used in creating the image of the Resurrection of Christ in the last several centuries [ 1 ] , the above - described iconographic type is considered to be canonical , as it reflects the traditional teaching on the descent of Christ to hell , His victory over death , His raising of the dead and delivering them from hell where they were imprisoned before His Resurrection .
It is to this teaching as an integral part of the dogmatic and liturgical tradition of the Christian Church that this paper is devoted .
The descent of Christ into Hades is one of the most mysterious , enigmatic and inexplicable events in New Testament history .
In today ’s Christian world , this event is understood differently .
Liberal Western theology rejects altogether any possibility for speaking of the descent of Christ into Hades literally , arguing that the scriptural texts on this theme should be understood metaphorically .
The traditional Catholic doctrine insists that after His death on the cross Christ descended to hell only to deliver the Old Testament righteous from it .
A similar understanding is quite widespread among Orthodox Christians .
On the other hand , the New Testament speaks of the preaching of Christ in hell as addressed to the unrepentant sinners : ‘ For Christ also died for sins once for all , the righteous for the unrighteous , that he might bring us to God , being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit ; in which he went and preached to the spirit in prison , who formerly did not obey , when God ’s patience waited ’ [ 2 ] .
However , many Church Fathers and liturgical texts of the Orthodox Church repeatedly underline that having descended to hell , Christ opened the way to salvation for all people , not only the Old Testament righteous .
The descent of Christ into Hades is perceived as an event of cosmic significance involving all people without exception .
They also speak about the victory of Christ over death , the full devastation of hell and that after the descent of Christ into Hades there was nobody left there except for the devil and demons .
How can these two points of view be reconciled ?
What was the original faith of the Church ?
What do early Christian sources tell us about the descent into Hades ?
And what is the soteriological significance of the descent of Christ into Hades ?
1 . Eastern theological tradition
We come across references to the descent of Christ into Hades and His raising the dead in the works of Eastern Christian authors of the 2nd and 3rd centuries , such as Polycarp of Smyrna , Ignatius of Antioch , Hermas , Justin , Melito of Sardes , Hyppolitus of Rome , Irenaeus of Lyons , Clement of Alexandria and Origen .
In the 4th century , the descent to hell was discussed by Athanasius , Basil the Great , Gregory Nazianzen , John Chrysostom , as well as such Syrian authors as Jacob Aphrahat and Ephrem the Syrian .
Noteworthy among later authors who wrote on this theme are Cyril of Alexandria , Maximus the Confessor and John Damascene .
Let us look at the most vivid interpretations given to our theme in Eastern Christian theology .
The teaching on the descent of Christ into Hades was expounded quite fully by Clement of Alexandria in his ‘ Stromateis ’ [ 3 ] .
He argued that Christ preached in hell not only to the Old Testament righteous , but also to the Gentiles who lived outside the true faith .
Commenting on 1 Pet. 3:18 ¾ 21 , Clement expresses the conviction that the preaching of Christ was addressed to all those in hell who were able to believe in Christ :
Do not [ the Scriptures ] show that the Lord preached the Gospel to those that perished in the flood , or rather had been chained , and to those kept ‘ in ward and guard ’ ?…
And , as I think , the Saviour also exerts
His might because it is His work to save ; which accordingly
He also did by drawing to salvation those who became willing , by the preaching [ of the Gospel ] , to believe on Him , wherever they were .
If , then , the Lord descended to Hades for no other end but to preach the Gospel , as He did descend , it was either to preach the Gospel to all or to the Hebrews only .
If , accordingly , to all , then all who believe shall be saved [ 4 ] , although they may be of the Gentiles , on making their profession there … [ 5 ]
Clement emphasises that there are righteous people among both those who have the true faith and the Gentiles and that it is possible to turn to God for those who did not believe in Him while living .
It is their virtuous life that made them capable of accepting the preaching of Christ and the apostles in hell : ... A righteous man , then , differs not , as righteous , from another righteous man , whether he be of the Law [ Jew ] or a Greek .
For God is not only Lord of the Jews , but of all me n [ 6 ] ...
So I think it is demonstrated that God , being good , and the Lord powerful , save with a righteousness and equality which extend to all that turn to Him , whether here or elsewhere [ 7 ] .
According to Clement , righteousness is of value not only for those who live in true faith , but also for those who are outside faith .
It is evident from his words that Christ preached in hell to all , but saved only those who came to believe in Him .
Anyway , Clement assumes that this preaching proved salutory not for all to whom Christ preached in hell : ‘ Did not the same dispensation obtain in Hades , so that even there , all the souls , on hearing the proclamation , might either exhibit repentance , or confess that their punishment was just , because they believed not ? ’[ 8 ]
According to Clement , there were those in hell who heard the preaching of Christ but did not believe in Him and did not follow Him .
In Clement ’s works we find the notion that punishments sent from God to sinners are aimed at their reformation , not at retribution , and that the souls released from their corporal shells are better able to understand the meaning of punishment [ 9 ] .
In these words lies the nucleus of the teaching on the purifying and saving nature of the torment of hell developed by some later authors [ 10 ] .
We will come back to the question of whether the pains of hell can be salutory when considering the teaching of Maximus the Confessor on the descent of Christ into Hades .
An exhaustive discussion on this question , though , is beyond the scope of this paper .
Gregory of Nyssa entwines the theme of the descent in hell with the theory of ‘ divine deception ’ .
On the latter he builds his teaching on the Redemption .
According to this theory , Christ , being God incarnate , deliberately concealed His divine nature from the devil so that he , mistaking Him for an ordinary man , would not be terrified at the sight of an overwhelming power approaching him .
When Christ descended in hell , the devil supposed Him to be a human being , but this was a divine ‘ hook ’ disguised under a human ‘ bait ’ that the devil swallowed [ 11 ] .
By admitting God incarnate into his domain , the devil himself signed his own death warrant : incapable of enduring the divine presence , he was overcome and defeated , and hell was destroyed .
This is precisely the idea that Gregory of Nyssa developed in one of his Easter sermons on ‘ The Three - Day Period of the Resurrection of Christ ’ .
Judging by its contents , this homily was intended for Holy Saturday [ 12 ] , and in it Gregory poses the question of why Christ spent three days ‘ in the heart of the earth ’ [ 13 ] .
This period was necessary and sufficient , he argues , for Christ to ‘ expose the foolishness ’ ( moranai ) of the devil [ 14 ] , i.e , to outwit , ridicule and deceive him [ 15 ] .
How did Christ manage to ‘ outwit ’ the devil ?
Gregory gives the following reply to this question :
As the ruler of darkness could not approach the presence of the Light unimpeded , had he not seen in Him something of flesh , then , as soon as he saw the God - bearing flesh and saw the miracle performed through it by the Deity , he hoped that if he came to take hold of the flesh through death , then he would take hold of all the power contained in it .
Therefore , having swallowed the bait of the flesh , he was pierced by the hook of the Deity and thus the dragon was transfixed by the hook . [ 16 ]
A very original approach to the theme of the descent to Hades is found in a book entitled ‘ Spiritual Homilies ’ which has survived under the name of Macarius of Egypt .
There , the liberation of Adam by Christ , Who descended into Hades , is seen as the prototype of the mystical resurrection which the soul experiences in its encounter with the Lord :
When you hear that the Lord in the old days delivered souls from hell and prison and that He descended into hell and performed a glorious deed , do not think that all these events are far from your soul …
So the Lord comes into the souls that seek Him , into the depth of the heart ’s hell , and there commands death , saying : ‘ Release the imprisoned souls which have sought Me and which you hold by force ’ .
And He shatters the heavy stones weighing on the soul , opens graves , raises the true dead from death , brings the imprisoned soul from the dark prison …
Is it difficult for God to enter death and , even more , into the depth of the heart and to call out dead Adam from there ?…
If the sun , being created , passes everywhere through windows and doors , even to the caves of lions and the holes of creeping creatures , and comes out without any harm , the more so does God and the Lord of everything enter caves and abodes in which death has settled , and also souls , and , having released Adam from there , [ remains ] unfettered by death .
Similarly , rain coming down from the sky reaches the nethermost parts of the earth , moistens and renews the roots there and gives birth to new shoots [ 17 ] .
This text is significant first of all in that the author regards the descent of Christ into Hades as a commonly accepted and undisputed dogma , which he uses as a solid foundation on which to build his mystical and typological construction .
The use of the images of the sun rising over both the evil and the good , and rain sent upon both the righteous and the unrighteous [ 18 ] , indicates that the author of the ‘ Homilies ’ perceives the descent into Hades as a reality affecting not only the Old Testament righteous , but also entire humanity .
Moreover , it affects every person and inner processes which take place in the human soul .
For the author of the ‘ Homilies ’ , the doctrine of the descent into Hades is not an abstract truth , nor is it an event which occurred in the days of old and which affected only those who lived at that time , but it is an event which has not lost its relevance .
It is not just one of the fundamental Christian doctrines , not just a subject of faith and confession , but a mystery associated with the mystical life of the Christian , a mystery which one should experience in the depth of one ’s heart .
The doctrine of the descent of Christ into Hades occupies an essential place in the works of Cyril of Alexandria .
In his ‘ Paschal Homilies ’ , he repeatedly mentions that as a consequence of the descent of Christ into Hades , the devil was left all alone , while hell was devastated : ‘ For having destroyed hell and opened the impassable gates for the departed spirits , He left the devil there abandoned and lonely ’ [ 19 ] .
In his ‘ Festive Letters ’ , Cyril of Alexandria elaborates on the theme of the preaching of Christ in Hades , popular in the Alexandrian tradition since Clement .
He views the preaching of Christ in hell as the accomplishment of the ‘ history of salvation ’ , which began with the Incarnation : … He showed the way to salvation not only to us , but also to the spirits in hell ; having descended , He preached to those once disobedient , as Peter says [ 20 ] .
For it did not befit for love of man to be partial , but the manifestation of [ this ] gift should have been extended to all nature …
Having preached to the spirits in hell and having said ‘ go forth ’ to the prisoners , and ‘ show yourselves ’ [ 21 ] to those in prison on the third day , He resurrected His temple and again opens up to our nature the ascent to heaven , bringing Himself to the Father as the beginning of humanity , pledging to those on earth the grace of communion of the Spirit [ 22 ] .
As we can see , Cyril emphasises the universality of the salvation given by Christ to humanity , perceiving the descent of Christ into Hades as salvific for the entire human race .
He is not inclined to limit salvation to a particular part of humanity , such as the Old Testament righteous .
Salvation is likened to rain sent by God on both the just and the unjust [ 23 ] .
Putting emphasis on the universality of the saving feat of Christ , Cyril follows in the steps of other Alexandrian theologians , beginning with Clement , Origen , and Athanasius the Great [ 24 ] .
The descent of Christ into Hades , according to Cyril ’s teaching , signified victory over that which previously appeared unconquerable and ensured the salvation of all humanity : Death unwilling to be defeated is defeated ; corruption is transformed ; unconquerable passion is destroyed .
While hell , diseased with excessive insatiability and never satisfied with the dead , is taught , even if against its will , that which it could not learn previously .
For it not only ceases to claim those who are still to fall [ in the future ] , but also lets free those already captured , being subjected to splendid devastation by the power of our Saviour ...
Having preached to the spirits in hell , once disobedient , He came out as conqueror by resurrecting
His temple like a beginning of our hope and by showing to [ our ] nature the manner of the raising from the dead , and giving us along with it other blessings as well [ 25 ] .
Clearly , Cyril perceived the victory of Christ over hell and death as complete and definitive .
According to Cyril , hell loses authority both over those who were in its power and those who are to become its prey in the future .
Thus , the descent into Hades , a single and unique action , is perceived as a timeless event .
The raised body of Christ becomes the guarantee of universal salvation , the beginning of way leading human nature to ultimate deification .
An elaborate teaching of the descent of Christ into Hades is found in Maximus the Confessor .
In his analysis , Maximus takes as a starting point the words of St. Peter : ‘ For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead , that they might be judged according to men in the flesh , but live according to God in the spirit ’ [ 26 ] .
In Maximus ’s view , St. Peter does not speak about the Old Testament righteous , but about those sinners who , back in their lifetime , were punished for their evil deeds :
Some say that Scriptures call ‘ dead ’ those who died before the coming of Christ , for instance , those who were at the time of the flood , at Babel , in Sodom , in Egypt , as well as others who in various times and in various ways received various punishments and the terrible misfortune of divine damnation .
These people were punished not so much for their ignorance of God as for the offences they imposed on one another .
It was to them , according to [ St Peter ] that the great message of salvation was preached when they were already damned as men in the flesh , that is , when they received , through life in the flesh , punishment for crimes against one another , so that they could live according to God by the spirit , that is , being in hell , they accepted the preaching of the knowledge of God , believing in the Saviour who descended into hell to save the dead .
So , in order to understand [ this ] passage in [ Holy Scriptures ] let us take it in this way : the dead , damned in the human flesh , were preached to precisely for the purpose that they may live according to God by the spirit [ 27 ] .
Thus , according to Maximus ’s teaching , punishments suffered by sinners ‘ in the human flesh ’ were necessary so that they may live ‘ according to God by the spirit ’ .
Therefore , these punishments , whether troubles and misfortunes in their lifetime or pains in hell , had pedagogical and reforming significance .
Moreover , Maximus stresses that in damning them , God used not so much a religious as a moral criterion , for people were punished ‘ not so much for their ignorance of God as for the offences they imposed on one another ’ .
In other words , the religious or ideological convictions of a particular person were not decisive , but his actions with regard to his neighbours .
In John Damascene we find lines which sum up the development of the theme of the descent of Christ into Hades in Eastern patristic writings of the 2nd ¾8th centuries :
The soul [ of Christ ] when it is deified descended into Hades , in order that , just as the Sun of Righteousness rose for those upon the earth , so likewise He might bring light [ 28 ] to those who sit under the earth in darkness and the shadow of death : in order that just as he brought the message of peace to those upon the earth , and of release to the prisoners , and of sight to the blind [ 29 ] , and became to those who believed the Author of everlasting salvation and to those who did not believe , a denunciation of their unbelief , so He might become the same to those in Hades :
That every knee should bow to Him , of things in heaven , and things in earth and things under the earth [ 30 ] .
And thus after
He had freed those who has been bound for ages , straightway
He rose again from the dead , showing us the way of resurrection [ 31 ] .
According to John Damascene , Christ preached to all those who were in hell , but His preaching did not prove salutary for all , as not all were capable of responding to it .
For some it could become only ‘ a denunciation of their disbelief ’ , not the cause of salvation .
In this judgement , Damascene actually repeats the teaching on salvation articulated not long before him by Maximus the Confessor .
According to Maximus , human history will be accomplished when all without exception will unite with God and God will become ‘ all in all ’ [ 32 ] .
For some , however , this unity will mean eternal bliss , while for others it will become the source of suffering and torment , as each will be united with God ‘ according to the quality of his disposition ’ towards God [ 33 ] .
In other words , all will be united with God , but each will have his own , subjective , feeling of this unity , according to the measure of the closeness to God he has achieved .
Along a similar line , John Damascene understands also the teaching on the descent to Hades : Christ opens the way to paradise to all and calls all to salvation , but the response to Christ ’s call may lie in either consent to follow Him or voluntary rejection of salvation .
Ultimately it depends on a person , on his free choice .
God does not save anybody by force , but calls everybody to salvation : ‘ Behold , I stand at the door , and knock ; if any man hear my voice , and open the door , I will come in to him ’ [ 34 ] .
God knocks at the door of the human heart rather than breaks into it .
In the history of Christianity an idea has repeatedly arisen that God predestines some people for salvation and others to perdition .
This idea , based as it is on the literary understanding of the words of St. Paul about predestination , calling and justification [ 35 ] , became the corner - stone of the theological system of the Reformation , preached with particular consistency by John Calvin [ 36 ] .
Eleven centuries before Calvin , the Eastern Christian tradition in the person of John Chrysostom expressed its view of predestination and calling .
‘ Why are not all saved ? ’ Chrysostom asks .
‘ Because … not only the call [ of God ] but also the will of those called is the cause of their salvation .
This call is not coercive or forcible .
Every one was called , but not all followed the call ’ [ 37 ] .
Later Fathers , including Maximus and John Damascene , spoke in the same spirit .
According to their teaching , it is not God who saves some while ruining others , but some people follow the call of God to salvation while others do not .
It is not God who leads some from hell while leaving others behind , but some people wish while others do not wish to believe in Him .
The teaching of the Eastern Church Fathers on the descent of Christ into Hades can be summed up in the following points : 1 ) the doctrine of the descent of Christ into Hades was commonly accepted and indisputable ; 2 ) the descent into Hades was perceived as an event of universal significance , though some authors limited the range of those saved by Christ to a particular category of the dead ; 3 ) the descent of Christ into Hades and His resurrection were viewed as the accomplishment of the ‘ economy ’ of Christ the Saviour , as the crown and outcome of the feat He performed for the salvation of people ; 4 ) the teaching on the victory of Christ over the devil , hell and death was finally articulated and asserted ; 5 ) the theme of the descent into Hades began to be viewed in its mystical dimension , as the prototype of the resurrection of the human soul .
2 . Western theological tradition
To what degree did the approach to this theme of the Fathers and Doctors of the Western Church differ from that of the Eastern Fathers ?
In order to answer this question , let us look at the works of the two most significant theologians of the Christian West , Augustine and Thomas Aquinas .
The Augustinian teaching on the descent of Christ into Hades is expounded in the fullest way in one of his letters addressed to Evodius .
This letter contains a comprehensive interpretation of 1 Pet. 3:18 ¾ 21 .
It follows from Evodius ’ questions that the teaching on the evacuation of all in hell and the complete devastation of hell by the risen Christ was widespread in his time .
Augustine begins with the question of whether Christ preached only to those who perished in the days of Noah or to all the imprisoned .
In answering it , Augustine begins by refuting the opinion that Christ descended to Hades in the flesh [ 38 ] and argues that this teaching contradicts scriptural testimony [ 39 ] .
Augustine continues by setting forth the view that Christ led from hell all those who were there , as , indeed , among them were ‘ some who are intimately known to us by their literary labours , whose eloquence and talent we admire , ¾ not only the poets and orators who in many parts of their writings have held up to contempt and ridicule these same false gods of the nations , and have even occasionally confessed the one true God… , but also those who have uttered the same , not in poetry or rhetoric , but as philosophers ’ [ 40 ] .
The notion of the salvation of heathen poets , orators and philosophers was quite popular .
In Eastern patristic tradition it was most vividly expressed by Clement of Alexandria .
According to Augustine , however , any of the positive qualities of the ancient poets , orators and philosophers originated not from ‘ sober and authentic devotion , but pride , vanity and [ the desire ] of people ’s praise ’ .
Therefore they ‘ did not bring any fruit ’ .
Thus , the idea that pagan poets , orators and philosophers could be saved , though not refuted by Augustine , still is not fully approved , since ‘ human judgement ’ differs from ‘ the justice of the Creator ’ [ 41 ] .
Augustine neither rejects nor accepts unconditionally the opinion concerning the salvation of all those in hell .
Though very careful in his judgement , it is clear that the possibility of salvation for all in hell is blocked in his perception by his own teaching on predestination [ 42 ] , as well as by his understanding of divine mercy and justice :
For the words of Scripture , that ‘ the pains of hell were loosed ’ [ 43 ] by the death of Christ , do not establish this , seeing that this statement may be understood as referring to Himself , and meaning that he so far loosed ( that is , made ineffectual ) the pains of hell that He Himself was not held by them , especially since it is added that it was ‘ impossible for Him to be holden of them ’ [ 44 ] .
Or if any one [ objecting to this interpretation ] asks why He chose to descend into hell , where those pains were which could not possibly hold Him … the words that ‘ the pains were loosed ’ may be understood as referring not to the case of all , but only some whom
He judged worthy of that deliverance ; so that neither He supposed to have descended thither in vain , without the purpose of bringing benefit to any of those who were there held in prison , nor is it a necessary inference that divine mercy and justice granted to some must be supposed to have been granted to all [ 45 ] .
While Augustine also considers the traditional teaching that Christ delivered from hell the forefather Adam , as well as Abel , Seth , Noah and his family , Abraham , Isaac , Jacob ‘ and the other patriarchs and prophets ’ , he does not agree to it entirely , since he does not believe ‘ Abraham ’s bosom ’ to be a part of hell .
Those who were in the bosom of Abraham were not deprived of the gracious presence of the divinity of Christ , and therefore Christ , on the very day of His death immediately before descending to hell , promises to the wise thief that he will be in paradise with him [ 46 ] .
‘ Most certainly , therefore , He was , before that time , both in paradise and the bosom of Abraham in His beatific wisdom ( beatificante sapientia ) , and in hell in His condemning power ( judicante potentia ) ’ , concludes Augustine [ 47 ] .
The opinion that through the death of Christ on the cross the righteous receive that promised incorruption which people are to achieve after the end of time is also refuted by Augustine .
If it were so , then St. Peter would not have said about David that ‘ his sepulchre is with us to this day ’ [ 48 ] unless David was still undisturbed in the sepulchre [ 49 ] .
As for the teaching on Christ ’s preaching in hell contained in 1 Pet. 3:18 ¾21 , Augustine rejects its traditional and commonly accepted understanding .
First , he is not certain that it implies those who really departed his life , but rather those that are spiritually dead and did not believe in Christ .
Secondly , he offers the quite novel idea that after Christ ascended from hell His recollection did not survive there .
Therefore , the descent in Hades was a ‘ one - time ’ event relevant only to those who were in hell at that time .
Thirdly and finally , Augustine rejects altogether any possibility for those who did not believe in Christ while on earth to come to believe in him while in hell , calling this idea ‘ absurd ’ [ 50 ] .
Augustine is not inclined to see in 1 Pet. 3:18 ¾21 an indication of the descent into Hades .
He believes that this text should be understood allegorically , i. e. , ‘ the spirits ’ mentioned by Peter are essentially those who are clothed in body and imprisoned in ignorance .
Christ did not come down to earth in the flesh in the days of Noah , but often came down to people in the spirit either to rebuke those who did not believe or to justify those who did .
What happened in the days of Noah is a type of what happens today , and the flood was the precursor of baptism .
Those who believe in our days are like whose who believed in the days of Noah : they are saved through baptism , just as Noah was saved through water .
Those who do not believe are like those who did not believe in the days of Noah : the flood is the prototype of their destruciton [ 51 ] .
Augustine is the first Latin author who gave so much close attention to the theme of the descent of Christ into Hades .
However , he did not clarify the question of who was the object of Christ ’s preaching in hell and whom Christ delivered from it .
Augustine expressed many doubts about particular interpretations of 1 Pet. 3:18 ¾21 , but did not offer any convincing interpretation of his own .
Nevertheless , the ideas expressed by him were developed by Western Church authors of the later period .
Thomas Aquinas , in particular , makes continuous references to Augustine in his chapter devoted to the descent of Christ into Hades [ 52 ] .
During the Reformation , many Augustinian ideas were criticised by theologians of the Protestant tradition .
The teaching that the recollection of Christ did not survive in hell after His ascent was rejected by Lutheran theologians who insisted on the reverse [ 53 ] .
Thomas Aquinas was the 13th - century theologian who brought to completion the Latin teaching on the descent of Christ into Hades .
In his ‘ Summa Theologiae ’ , he divides hell into four parts : 1 ) purgatory ( purgatorium ) , where sinners experience penal suffering ; 2 ) the hell of the patriarchs ( infernum patrum ) , the abode of the Old Testament righteous before the coming of Christ ; 3 ) the hell of unbaptized children ( infernum puerorum ) ; and 4 ) the hell of the damned ( infernum damnatorum ) .
In response to the question , exactly which was the hell that Christ descended to , Thomas Aquinas admits two possibilities : Christ descended either into all parts of hell or only to that in which the righteous were imprisoned , whom He was to deliver .
In the first case , ‘ for going down into the hell of the lost He wrought this effect , that by descending thither He put them to shame for their unbelief and wickedness : but to them who were detained in Purgatory
He gave hope of attaining to glory : while upon the holy Fathers detained in hell solely on account of original sin ( pro solo peccato originali detinebantur in inferno ) , He shed the light of glory everlasting ’ .
In the second case , the soul of Christ ‘ descended only to the place where the righteous were detained ’ ( descendit solum ad locum inferni in quo justi detinebantur ) , but the action of His presence there was felt in some way in the other parts of hell as well [ 54 ] .
According to Thomistic teaching , Christ delivered from hell not only the Old Testament righteous who were imprisoned in hell because of original sin [ 55 ] .
As far as sinners are concerned , those who were detained in ‘ the hell of the lost ’ , since they either had no faith or had faith but no conformity with the virtue of the suffering Christ , could not be cleansed from their sins , and Christ ’s descent brought them no deliverance from the pains of hell [ 56 ] .
Nor were children who had died in the state of original sin delivered from hell , since only ‘ by baptism children are delivered from original sin and from hell , but not by Christ ’s descent into hell ’ , since baptism can be received only in earthly life , not after death [ 57 ] .
Finally , Christ did not deliver those who were in purgatory , for their suffering was caused by personal defects ( defectus personali ) , whereas ‘ exclusion from glory ’ was a common defect ( defectus generalis ) of all human nature after the fall .
The descent of Christ into Hades recovered the glory of God to those who were excluded from it by virtue of the common defect of nature , but did not deliver anybody from the pains of purgatory caused by people ’s personal defects [ 58 ] .
This scholastic understanding of the descent of Christ into Hades , formulated by Thomas Aquinas , was the official teaching of the Roman Catholic Church for many centuries .
During the Reformation , this understanding was severely criticised by Protestant theologians .
Many of today ’s Catholic theologians are also very sceptical about this teaching [ 59 ] .
There is no need to discuss how far the teaching of Thomas Aquinas on the descent of Christ into Hades is from that of Eastern Christianity .
No Father of the Eastern Church ever permitted himself to clarify who was left in hell after Christ descent ; no Eastern Father ever spoke of unbaptized infants left in hell [ 60 ] .
The division of hell into four parts and the teaching on purgatory are alien to Eastern patristics .
Finally , this very scholastic approach whereby the most mysterious events of history are subjected to detailed analysis and rational interpretation is unacceptable for Eastern Christian theology .
For the theologians , poets and mystics of the Eastern Church , the descent of Christ into Hades remained first of all a mystery which could be praised in hymns , and about which various assumptions could be made , but of which nothing definite and final could be said .
The general conclusion can now be drawn from a comparative analysis of Eastern and Western understandings of the descent into Hades .
In the first three centuries of the Christian Church , there was considerable similarity between the interpretation of this doctrine by theologians in East and West .
However , already by the 4th — 5th centuries , substantial differences can be identified .
In the West , a juridical understanding of the doctrine prevailed .
It gave increasingly more weight to notions of predestination ( Christ delivered from hell those who were predestined for salvation from the beginning ) and original sin ( salvation given by Christ was deliverance from the general original sin , not from the ‘ personal ’ sins of individuals ) .
The range of those to whom the saving action of the descent into hell is extended becomes ever more narrow .
First , it excludes sinners doomed to eternal torment , then those in purgatory and finally unbaptized infants .
This kind of legalism was alien to the Orthodox East , where the descent into Hades continued to be perceived in the spirit in which it is expressed in the liturgical texts of Great Friday and Easter , i.e. as an event significant not only for all people , but also for the entire cosmos , for all created life .
At the same time , both Eastern and Western traditions suggest that Christ delivered from hell the Old Testament righteous led by Adam .
Yet if in the West this is perceived restrictively ( Christ delivered only the Old Testament righteous , while leaving all the rest in hell to eternal torment ) , in the East , Adam is viewed as a symbol of the entire human race leading humanity redeemed by Christ ( those who followed Christ were first the Old Testament righteous led by Adam and then the rest who responded to the preaching of Christ in hell ) .
3 . The doctrine of the descent into Hades and theodicy Let us move now to the theological significance of the doctrine of the descent of Christ into Hades .
This doctrine , in our view , has great significance for theodicy , the justification of God in the face of the accusing human mind [ 61 ] .
Why does God permit suffering and evil ?
Why does
He condemn people to the pains of hell ?
To what extent is God responsible for what happens on earth ?
Why in the Bible does God appear as a cruel and unmerciful Judge ‘ repenting ’ of His actions and punishing people for mistakes which He knew beforehand and which He could have prevented ?
These and other similar questions have been posed throughout history .
First of all , we should say that the doctrine of the descent of Christ into Hades raises the veil over the mystery that envelops the relationship between God and the devil .
The history of this relationship goes back to the time of the creation .
According to common church teaching , the devil was created as a good and perfect creature , but he fell away from God because of his pride .
The drama of the personal relationship between God and the devil did not end here .
Since his falling away , the devil began to oppose divine goodness and love by every means and to do all he can to prevent the salvation of people .
The devil is not all - powerful , however ; his powers are restricted by God and he can operate only within the limits permitted by God .
This last affirmation is confirmed by the opening lines of the Book of Job where the devil appears as a creature having , first , personal relations with God and , secondly , being fully subjected to God .
By creating human beings and putting them in a situation where they choose between good and evil , God assumed the responsibility for their further destiny .
God did not leave man face to face with the devil , but Himself entered into the struggle for humanity ’s spiritual survival .
To this end , He sent prophets and teachers and then He Himself became man , suffered on the cross and died , descended into Hades and was raised from the dead in order to share human fate .
By descending into Hades , Christ did not destroy the devil as a personal , living creature , but ‘ abolished the power of the devil ’ , that is , deprived the devil of authority and power stolen by him from God .
When he rebelled against God , the devil set himself the task to create his own autonomous kingdom where he would be master and where he would win back from God a space where God ’s presence could be in no way felt .
In Old Testament understanding , this place was sheol .
After Christ , sheol became a place of divine presence .
This presence is felt by all those in paradise as a source of joy and bliss , but for those in hell it is a source of suffering .
Hell , after Christ , is no longer the place where the devil reigns and people suffer , but first and foremost it is the prison for the devil himself as well as for those who voluntarily decided to stay with him and share his fate .
The sting of death was abolished by Christ and the walls of hell were destroyed .
But ‘ death even without its sting is still powerful for us ...
Hell with its walls destroyed and its gates abolished is still filled with those who , having left the narrow royal path of the cross leading to paradise , follow the broad way all their lives ’ [ 62 ] .
Christ descended into hell not as another victim of the devil , but as Conqueror .
He descended in order to ‘ bind up the powerful ’ and to ‘ plunder his vessels ’ .
According to patristic teaching , the devil did not recognize in Christ the incarnate God .
He took Him for an ordinary man and , rising to the ‘ bait ’ of the flesh , swallowed the ‘ hook ’ of the Deity ( the image used by Gregory of Nyssa ) .
However , the presence of Christ in hell constituted the poison which began gradually to ruin hell from within ( this image was used by the 4th - century Syrian author Jacob Aphrahat [ 63 ] ) .
The final destruction of hell and the ultimate victory over the devil will happen during the Second Coming of Christ when ‘ the last enemy to be destroyed is death ’ , when everything will be subjected to Christ and God will become ‘ all in all ’ [ 64 ] .
The doctrine of the descent of Christ into Hades is important for an understanding of God ’s action in human history , as reflected in the Old Testament .
The biblical account of the flood , which destroyed all humanity , is a stumbling block for many who wish to believe in a merciful God but cannot reconcile themselves with a God who ‘ repents ’ of his own deed .
The teaching on the descent into hell , as set forth in 1 Pet. 3:18 — 21 , however , brings an entirely new perspective into our understanding of the mystery of salvation .
It turns out that the death sentence passed by God to interrupt human life does not mean that human beings are deprived of hope for salvation , because , failing to turn to God during their lifetime , people could turn to Him in the afterlife having heard Christ ’s preaching in the prison of hell .
While committing those
He created to death , God did not destroy them , but merely transferred them to a different state in which they could hear the preaching of Christ , to believe and to follow Him .
4 . The soteriological implications of the doctrine of the descent into Hades
The doctrine on the descent of Christ into Hades is an integral part of Orthodox soteriology .
Its soteriological implications , however , depend in many ways on the way in which we understanding the preaching of Christ in hell and its salutory impact on people [ 65 ] .
If the preaching was addressed only to the Old Testament righteous , then the soteriological implications of the doctrine is minimal , but if it was addressed to all those in hell , its significance is considerably increased .
It seems that we have enough grounds to argue , following the Greek Orthodox theologian , I. Karmiris , that ‘ according to the teaching of almost all the Eastern Fathers , the preaching of the Saviour was extended to all without exception and salvation was offered to all the souls who passed away from the beginning of time , whether Jews or Greek , righteous or unrighteous ’ [ 66 ] .
At the same time , the preaching of Christ in hell was good and joyful news of deliverance and salvation , not only for the righteous but also the unrighteous .
It was not the preaching ‘ to condemn for unbelief and wickedness ’ , as it seemed to Thomas Aquinas .
The entire text of the First Letter of St. Peter relating to the preaching of Christ in hell speaks against its understanding in terms of accusation and damnation ’ [ 67 ] .
Whether all or only some responded to the call of Christ and were delivered from hell remains an open question .
If we accept the point of view of those Western church writers who maintain that Christ delivered from hell only the Old Testament righteous , then Christ ’s salutory action is reduced merely to the restoration of justice .
The Old Testament righteous suffered in hell undeservedly , not for their personal sins but because of the general sinfulness of human nature and because their deliverance from hell was a ‘ duty ’ which God was obliged to undertake with respect to them .
But such an act could scarcely constitute a miracle that made the angels tremble or one to be praised in church hymns .
Unlike the West , Christian consciousness in the East admits the opportunity to be saved not only for those who believe during their lifetime , but also those who were not given to believe yet pleased God with their good works .
The idea that salvation was not only for those who in life confessed the right faith , not only for the Old Testament righteous , but also those heathens who distinguished themselves by a lofty morality , is developed in one of the hymns of John Damascene :
Some say that [ Christ delivered from hell ] only those who believed [ 68 ] ,
such as fathers and prophets ,
judges and together with them kings , local rulers
and some others from the Hebrew people ,
not numerous and known to all .
But we shall reply to those who think so
that there is nothing undeserved ,
nothing miraculous and nothing strange
in that Christ should save those who believed [ 69 ] ,
for
He remains only the fair Judge ,
and every one who believes in Him will not perish .
So they all ought to have been saved
and delivered from the bonds of hell
by the descent of God and Master —
that same happened by His Disposition .
Whereas those who were saved only through [ God ’s ] love of men
were , as I think , all those
who had the purest life
and did all kinds of good works ,
living in modesty , temperance and virtue ,
but the pure and divine faith
they did not conceive because they were not instructed in it
and remained altogether unlearnt .
They were those whom the Steward and Master of all
drew , captured in the divine nets
and persuaded to believe in Him ,
illuminating them with the divine rays
and showing them the true light [ 70 ] .
This approach renders the descent into Hades exceptional in its soteriological implications .
According to Damascene , those who were not taught the true faith during their lifetime can come to believe when in hell .
By their good works , abstention and chastity they prepared themselves for the encounter with Christ .
These are that same people about whom St. Paul says that having no law they ‘ do by nature things contained in the law ’ , for ‘ the work of the law is written in their hearts ’ [ 71 ] .
Those who live by the law of natural morality but do not share the true faith can hope by virtue of their righteousness that in a face - to - face encounter with God they will recognize in Him the One they ‘ ignorantly worshipped ’ [ 72 ] .
Has this anything to do with those who died outside Christian faith after the descent of Christ into Hades ?
No , if we accept the Western teaching that the descent into Hades was a ‘ one - time ’ event and that the recollection of Christ did not survive in hell .
Yes , if we proceed from the assumption that after Christ hell was no longer like the Old Testament sheol , but it became a place of the divine presence .
In addition , as Archpriest Serge Bulgakov writes , ‘ all events in the life of Christ , which happen in time , have timeless , abiding significance .
Therefore , the so - called ‘ preaching in hell ’ , which is the faith of the Church , is a revelation of Christ to those who in their earthly life could not see or know Christ .
There are no grounds for limiting this event … to the Old Testament saints alone , as Catholic theology does .
Rather , the power of this preaching should be extended to all time for those who during their life on earth did not and could not know Christ but meet Him in the afterlife [ 73 ] .
According to the teaching of the Orthodox Church , all the dead , whether believers or non-believers , appear before God .
Therefore , even for those who did not believe during their lifetime , there is hope that they will recognize God as their Saviour and Redeemer if their previous life on earth led them to this recognition .
The above hymn of John Damascene clearly states that the virtuous heathens were not ‘ taught ’ the true faith .
This is a clear allusion to the words of Christ : ‘ Go ye , therefore , and teach all nations , baptizing them in the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost ’ [ 74 ] ; and ‘ He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved ; but that believeth not shall be damned ’ [ 75 ] .
The damnation is extended only to those who were taught Christian faith but did not believe .
But if a person was not taught , if he in his real life did not encounter the preaching of the gospel and did not have an opportunity to respond to it , can he be damned for it ?
We come back to the question that had disturbed such ancient authors as Clement of Alexandria .
Is it possible at all that the fate of a person can be changed after his death ?
Is death that border beyond which some unchangeable static existence comes ?
Does the development of the human person not stop after death ?
On the one hand , it is impossible for one to actively repent in hell ; it is impossible to rectify the evil deeds one committed by appropriate good works .
However , it may be possible for one to repent through a ‘ change of heart ’ , a review of one ’s values .
One of the testimonies to this is the rich man of the Gospel we have already mentioned .
He realized the gravity of his situation as soon as found himself in hell .
Indeed , if in his lifetime he was focused on earthly pursuits and forgot God , once in hell he realized that his only hope for salvation was God [ 76 ] .
Besides , according to the teaching of the Orthodox Church , the fate of a person after death can be changed through the prayer of the Church .
Thus , existence after death has its own dynamics .
On the basis of what has been said above , we may say that after death the development of the human person does not cease , for existence after death is not a transfer from a dynamic into a static being , but rather continuation on a new level of that road which a person followed in his lifetime .
* * *
As the last stage in the divine descent ( katabasis ) and self - emptying ( kenosis ) , the descent of Christ into Hades became at the same time the starting point of the ascent of humanity towards deification ( theosis ) [ 77 ] .
Since this descent the path to paradise is opened for both the living and the dead , which was followed by those whom Christ delivered from hell .
The destination point for all humanity and every individual is the fullness of deification in which God becomes ‘ all in all ’ [ 78 ] .
It is for this deification that God first created man and then , when ‘ the time had fully come ’ ( Gal. 4:4 ) , Himself became man , suffered , died , descended to Hades and was raised from the dead .
We do not know if every one followed Christ when He rose from hell .
Nor do we know if every one will follow Him to the eschatological Heavenly Kingdom when He will become ‘ all in all ’ .
But we do know that since the descent of Christ into Hades the way to resurrection has been opened for ‘ all flesh ’ , salvation has been granted to every human being , and the gates of paradise have been opened for all those who wish to enter through them .
This is the faith of the Early Church inherited from the first generation of Christians and cherished by Orthodox Tradition .
This is the never - extinguished hope of all those who believe in Christ Who once and for all conquered death , destroyed hell and granted resurrection to the entire human race .

1 Cor. 15:28 .
A few months after they were sworn in as citizens , Ms. Scott - Ker was transferred to Bangalore by her employer , Accenture , a management consulting , technology and outsourcing company , as its marketing director for India .
She kept her eye on the election , filing the voter registration forms in August and getting the confirmation in early October .
Then she discovered that an absentee ballot would require a separate application to the city Board of Elections .
“ In this highly technological age and city , do we need to be mailing applications halfway around the world , just so you can get a piece of mail sent back to the same place ? ”
Ms. Scott - Ker wondered aloud .
In a word , yes .
So , she said , she followed the requirements “ to the letter .
I even provided an addressed envelope for the ballot to be sent back to us so it would be absolutely perfect , as it would have to have been for the India postal service . ”
Still , no ballots came .
The Board of Elections in Manhattan  its funding cut this year in a dispute with the mayor  has been laggard in sending out absentee ballots , officials say .
Ms. Scott - Ker and her husband , a university instructor , knew nothing of that squabble .
“ We realized we ’re not going to get to vote , and we were all geared up to do this , ” she said .
“ We thought , maybe a friend could get the ballots for us in Manhattan and have them couriered to India , and we could courier them back .
There were so many ifs and buts .
I did n’t want a bureaucratic process to get in the way of casting a ballot . ”
Her determination is clear .
Even so , was it really necessary to go to all that trouble to cast votes in New York State , where most polls give the Democratic ticket a lead of 30 percent or more ?
“ Then you ’re relying on other people to do your job , ” she said .
“ Apathy does n’t work in a democracy . ”
About Sarah Palin hiding from the press in Alaska , the latest “ spin ” from camp McCain is pretty damning .
If she goes out and makes a mistake , that is something that [ voters will ] care about , and that ’s something that will haunt [ McCain ] for awhile , so I think this is a smart move .
This basically confirms the Democratic point that Sarah Palin can’t handle the national spotlight unless she ’s reading off a script that someone else wrote .
It ’s incredible .
When you ’re a Republican there is always an interviewer out there willing to softball you through an awkward situation .
If she ca n’t handle Chris Wallace at FOX News , no doubt drooling for the chance to bend over backwards and shove his head up its own ass for the good of the Party , then what sort of challenge is she ready to handle ?
But .
The guy is a campaign flack managing an embarrassment .
You have to assume that he ’s shading the truth to cover up something worse .
Taking a wild guess , the answer most likely has to do with Palin ’s problem with telling the truth .
In her short time on the national stage Sarah Palin has lied about practically everything .
She lied about opposing the Ketchikan bridge , she lied about selling a state plane on eBay and about making a profit on the sale , she lied about visiting Ireland ( her plane refueled there ) , she lied about fighting lobbyists and pork ( she set a record for both ) , she lied about Obama ’s legislative accomplishments .
More , it now appears indisputable that Palin lied her moose hunting ass off about inappropriately using her authority to fire Alaska ’s public safety chief .
The public record already has more than enough proof that she lied to the Alaskan people about not putting pressure on the commissioner to fire her ex-brother in law .
Then she lied about cooperating with the commission .
This poses a vexing problem because even Larry King or Chris Wallace have to bring this up and there is literally nothing that Palin can say .
If she repeats her earlier denials the evidence will damn her now and the looming investigation report will damn her even worse .
The only credible answer would be to come to Jesus on national TV , except that she risks admitting to an impeachable offense .
She ca n’t lie , she ca n’t tell the truth .
I do n’t envy the campaign for the tough spot that McCain ’s rash decision left them in .
At the same time I do n’t much sympathy for Alaska ’s lying , power - abusing tinpot Bush .
*** Update ***
A couple more points .
One , the idea that Palin ca n’t handle a friendly presser is ludicrous .
Palin may be green but she is n’t a moron .
If Dan Quayle can stumble through at least one campaign without disqualifying daddy Bush then Sarah Palin can handle herself fine .
She ’s avoiding the press because the campaign does n’t want to deal with her lies .
Two , good lord .
I wo n’t even quote this one .
*** Update 2***
Forget about that last link .
Anonymous sources are n’t worth much when her public record is already a target - rich environment .
Former Fuller Seminary professor Peter Wagner , in his book , Praying with Power ( published in June of 2008 ) , provides a rather detailed — and frankly chilling — description of Sarah Palin ’s exorcist and witch hunting political ally Thomas Muthee .
Specifically , Wagner recounts the start of Muthee ’s career and his encounter with the “ witch ” known as “ Mama Jane . ”
Who is Peter Wagner ?
Here ’s a quote from his Wikipedia page :
In 1982 Wagner teamed up with John Wimber , a founder of the Vineyard Movement , to create a new course at Fuller called “ Signs , Wonders and Church Growth ” .
Since that point , Wagner has been formally associated with Charismatic teaching and theology .
Wagner describes himself as a Charismatic Evangelical .
During the 1990s he also taught a Sunday School class with a strong focus on the charismatic gifts , known as “ 120 Fellowship ” , at Lake Avenue Church in Pasadena , CA .
Below I quote and discuss various passages on Thomas Muthee from Wagner ’s book .
It ’s important to note that Wagner knows Muthee personally , and works with him on various projects .
This first quote is from page 23 of Praying with Power :
Notice that Muthee links politics , economics , and religion .
There is , in other words , no church - state separation for Muthee .
Economic and political battles are undergirded by spiritual battles against demons .
One can only wonder whether Sarah Palin thinks of economics and politics in similar terms .
Notice also that Wagner positions Thomas Muthee as someone who has unusual spiritual powers .
In any other context , we would say that Wagner is attributing to Muthee magical or psychic powers — but in the lingo of charismatics , these are called the “ gifts of the Spirit . ”
One of Muthee ’s gifts , apparently , is the ability to discern things in the spirit realm , for he “ had learned that the devil assigns . . . demons over towns , cities , and nations , as well as families . ”
This is a curious thing to discover , and if true , is an extremely important piece of information to communicate to an American vice - president or president .
Do you suppose that Sarah Palin would give weight to Thomas Muthee ’s words for her , whenever they might meet or talk by phone ?
The second quote is from p. 24 of Wagner ’s book :
Notice that Wagner presumes that witchcraft is something real — and he exercises no skepticism in the recounting of this story .
God is also presumed , without evidence , to be the source for Muthee ’s vision .
The next quote from Wagner ’s book , from page 26 , brings us to a characterization of Kiambu ’s local “ witch , ” Mama Jane :
Notice the adjectives used in the passage .
Mama Jane is “ notorious , ” “ perverse , ” and “ powerful . ”
The car accidents are “ mysterious . ”
The exact same narrative template could have been used by medieval Europeans to describe Jews in their community and a cluster of , say , drowning deaths in a particular part of town .
In other words , if this kind of talk was directed at Jews , and diabolical happenings were attributed to them , we would recognize immediately the mind of an anti-semite .
What we see , instead , is the mind of a mysogenist .
The next passage appears on page 27 :
Notice here that Wagner is setting up Mama Jane as being in a contest with Thomas Muthee ’s group , and that she is provoking confrontation .
Whether she was engaging in such confrontation is open to question .
Another way to interpret her behavior is that she was simply a woman with animist or magical beliefs , and that she was practicing her religious beliefs in proximity to Muthee ’s group , which they interpreted as a challenge .
Or it may be that Wagner ’s characterization of the situation is accurate , and Mama Jane was provoking a confrontation with Muthee ’s group .
But if this is the case , we can only wonder whether or not Mama Jane , as a woman besieged and outnumbered , was simply fighting back in the way that she knew how — by counter gestures of magical thinking .
But even this explanation sounds fishy .
A woman facing the paranoia of her community , and the violence it could entail , is unlikely to act out public gestures that would provoke further paranoia .
In short , Mama Jane ’s provocations may be akin to a story teller ’s rationalization after the fact .
It would be hard to justify harrassing a woman who mostly kept to herself .
In any case , the encounter between Muthee ’s group and this unfortunate woman appears to have been one saturated with paranoia , superstition , and magical thinking , perhaps from both sides .
And it got worse :
Yes , you read that right .
Stone her .
And yes , this is the 21st century , not the 16th .
And yes , it appears that no explanation but deviltry ( “ it could be no coincidence ” ) could be fathomed , by Muthee ’s followers , for Mama Jane ’s proximity to a dangerous traffic area .
On page 30 of Wagner ’s book is this description of Muthee ’s demand that Mama Jane leave the community :
By the way that Wagner describes it , it is hard to tell if these were individual or collective public gestures of iconoclastic burning and destruction .
And one can only wonder what else was deemed worthy of burning that Wagner does not mention .
Books ?
Whatever exactly went on in Kiambu , Muthee ’s cruel and arrogant behavior , and that of his agressive and frightened followers , must have been terrifying for Mama Jane to behold .
And Wagner might have , with the exact same evidence , depicted Muthee as a fanatic and hysteric trampling on the basic human rights of another human being .
But instead , Wagner makes Muthee into a modern day Elijah in the process of vanquishing a Satan - driven follower of Baal .
Wagner ’s triumphalism reaches a still more feverish and absurd pitch in this next passage , from pg. 31 of his book :
Mama Jane ’s arrest and detention is simply described by Wagner as “ questioning . ”
But Kenya is not the United States , and the police may well have threatened , intimidated , or even tortured her .
Her quick exit from the town , and her complete disappearance from the narrative , suggests that she may well have been threatened with death .
She may even have been killed , inside or outside the city , perhaps by the police , who then said that she “ left ” the community .
Why , one wonders , given the high degree of paranoia and superstition that Muthee had generated in the town , should we take for granted that Mama Jane got out of the community alive ?
Would n’t the rumor of her being a witch have followed her ?
Does it really make sense that she just went away and lived somewhere else in peace ?
Would n’t her life , after her encounter with Thomas Muthee , have been forever precarious ?
Wagner ’s gleeful statement that Kiambu became a witch ’s graveyard may , in literal fact , have been true .
I hope that Mama Jane got out of Kiambu alive .
But I do n’t trust the narrator of this story , or Thomas Muthee ’s version .
Something seems improbable here .
As Judge Judy used to say , “ If it does n’t make sense , it probably did n’t happen that way . ”
Wagner ’s telling of Thomas Muthee ’s rise to power in Kiambu ends on this note :
And they all lived happily ever after — except Mama Jane .
Beneath the rural tranquillity of the Geneva countryside , where ramshackle sheds dot the wide - open fields , scientists are getting ready for a trip into the unknown .
Here , under 100 metres of rock and sandstone , lies the biggest , most complex machine humans have ever built , and on Wednesday they will finally get to turn it on .
For Cern , the European nuclear research organisation , it will mark the end of a lengthy wait and the beginning of a new era of physics .
Over the next 20 years or so , the $ 9bn ( £ 5 bn ) machine will direct its formidable power towards some of the most enduring mysteries of the universe .
The machine will search for extra dimensions , which could be curled up into microscopic loops .
It might produce " dark matter " , the unknown substance that stretches through space like an invisible skeleton .
And it will almost certainly discover the elusive Higgs boson , which helps explain the origin of mass , and is better known by its wince - inducing monicker , the God particle .
At least that is the hope .
For the machine to work a dizzying number of electronic circuits , computer - controlled valves , airtight seals and superconducting magnets must all work in concert .
The machine is called the Large Hadron Collider ( LHC ) , and when working at full tilt it will drive two beams of particles in opposite directions around a 17 mile ( 27 km ) ring at 99.9999991 % of the speed of light .
Every second each of the beams will complete 11,245 laps of the machine .
At four points around the ring the beams will be steered into head - on collisions , causing the particles to slam into one another with enough energy to recreate in a microcosm the violent fireball conditions that existed one trillionth of a second after the big bang .
Giant detectors , one of which is so enormous it sits in a cavern that could accommodate the nave of Westminster Abbey , will then scrutinise the shower of subatomic debris in the hope of finding something no one has ever seen before .
" This is a once in a generation kind of machine , and we really do n't know what we will find , " said Brian Cox , a physicist at Manchester University who works on Atlas , LHC 's largest detector .
" It 's like going to Mars .
You know you 're going to find something new , because you 're going where no one has been before . "
The awesome power of the LHC has prompted a flurry of alarmist fears that the machine might create a black hole that would swiftly consume the planet .
In the run-up to the machine switching on the laboratory has received a steady stream of calls from people wanting reassurance , or simply asking the scientists to stop .
Two attempts to stop the machine through the courts were dismissed .
Scientists say far more energetic collisions happen regularly in nature , when cosmic rays strike stray particles in space .
The project has drawn more down - to - Earth criticisms too .
Sir David King , the government 's former chief science adviser , believes it diverts top scientists away from tackling the more pressing issues of the time , such as climate change and how to decarbonise the economy .
In total Britain has contributed more than £ 500 m towards the LHC project .
Although Cern has already conducted some basic tests with its machine , Wednesday will be the first attempt to get a beam of subatomic particles called protons circulating inside it .
" If the beam goes all the way round on the first go , that would be quite amazing .
It 's never happened in the history of particle colliders , " said Cern 's James Gillies .
If the test is successful , scientists may try to send the beam around in the opposite direction , though first collisions are not expected until next month .
They expect to spend a few months getting to grips with the machine before putting it to work in earnest .
" People might think we already know a lot about the way things work , but the wheels are coming off our understanding of the universe .
We can confidently say that 95 % of the universe is made up of stuff we do n't understand , " said Cox .
Only 5 % of the universe is made of matter scientists understand .
A further 25 % is so - called " dark matter " , which clusters around galaxies , and the remaining 70 % is even more enigmatic " dark energy " , which drives the expansion of the universe .
One of the first discoveries that could emerge is proof of a theory known as supersymmetry .
According to the theory , every particle in the universe has a slightly overweight but invisible twin .
One of these , called the neutralino , is a leading candidate for dark matter , and could be made as soon as the machine performs its first collisions .
For the 10,000 scientists and engineers involved in the project this is the culmination of more than 20 years of work , the last eight of which were dedicated to bolting the machine together .
The machine is designed to reach energies seven times higher than the existing most powerful particle collider in the world , the Tevatron at Fermilab near Chicago .
The International Rescue Committee ( IRC ) has felt first hand the heavy toll to be paid when humanitarians are targetted by violence .
Just two weeks ago , three IRC female staff working in Afghanistan and traveling in a clearly marked vehicle when they were attacked and killed by Taliban .
A symbolic attack , further prompting humanitarians to distantiate themselves from any military forces in countries like Afghanistan and Iraq .
No wonder that Non-governmental relief agencies are now criticizing the US decision to put the Pentagon in a prominent " humanitarian " role in Georgia .
They claim the " militarization " of the humanitarian operation puts them , the aid workers , at risk .
" We are concerned about blurring the lines between who is an aid worker and who is a soldier , " said Anne Richard , a vice president of the IRC .
" If we are mistaken for soldiers , in very dangerous situations we can become targets , " said Richard .

User Interface Design in Modern Web Applications
What is user interface design ?
What makes a user interface effective , and more importantly , how do you go about crafting a good user interface ?
This chapter looks at the theory as well as the practical techniques involved in visual interface design in modern Web applications .
What Is A User Interface ?
“ The way that you accomplish tasks with a product – what you do and how it responds – that ’s the interface ” — Jef Raskin
User interface design is n’t just about buttons and menus ; it ’s about the interaction between the user and the application or device , and in many cases , it ’s about the interaction between multiple users through that device .
This means that user interface design is n’t about how a product looks , but rather about how it works .
It ’s not just about arranging buttons and picking colors , but rather about choosing the right tools for the job .
Does a particular interface even need buttons ?
If so , what do those buttons need to do ?
What do I need to provide users with so that they can figure out how my application works and accomplish what they want to do with ease ?
Further Reading on SmashingMag :
Working on the user interface early on in the product development life cycle is vital because , as Jef Raskin succinctly puts it , “ As far as the customer is concerned , the interface is the product ” .
The user sees and interacts with the user interface , not the underlying back - end architecture of your application .
Getting this element right will thus have a big impact on how much your customers enjoy using your product and how easy your product is to use .
Start by designing the interface first and then coding the back - end engine that powers it , rather than building the back - end first and then putting an interface “ wrapper ” over top .
What Makes A Great User Interface ?
Before we proceed to build a user interface for our product , it ’s important to first understand what makes a good user interface ; what are the qualities we should aim to achieve ?
All great interfaces share eight qualities or characteristics :
Clarity :
The interface avoids ambiguity by making everything clear through language , flow , hierarchy and metaphors for visual elements .
Clear interfaces do n’t need manuals .
They also ensure users make less mistakes while using them .
Concision :
It ’s easy to make the interface clear by over - clarifying and labeling everything , but this leads to interface bloat , where there is just too much stuff on the screen at the same time .
If too many things are on the screen , finding what you ’re looking for is difficult , and so the interface becomes tedious to use .
The real challenge in making a great interface is to make it concise and clear at the same time .
Familiarity : Something is familiar when you recall a previous encounter you ’ve had with it .
Even if someone uses an interface for the first time , certain elements can still be familiar .
You can use real - life metaphors to communicate meaning ; for example , folder - style tabs are often used for navigation on websites and in applications .
People recognize them as navigation items because the metaphor of the folder is familiar to them .
Responsiveness :
This means a couple of things .
First , responsiveness means speed : a good interface should not feel sluggish .
Secondly , the interface should provide good feedback to the user about what ’s happening and whether the user ’s input is being successfully processed .
Consistency : Keeping your interface consistent across your application is important because it allows users to recognize usage patterns .
Once your users learn how certain parts of the interface work , they can apply this knowledge to new areas and features , provided that the user interface there is consistent with what they already know .
Aesthetics :
While you do n’t need to make an interface attractive for it to do its job , making something look good will make the time your users spend using your application more enjoyable ; and happier users can only be a good thing .
Efficiency : Time is money , and a great interface should make the user more productive through shortcuts and good design .
After all , this is one of the core benefits of technology : it allows us to perform tasks with less time and effort by doing most of the work for us .
Forgiveness : Everyone makes mistakes , and how your application handles those mistakes will be a test of its overall quality .
Is it easy to undo actions ?
Is it easy to recover deleted files ?
A good interface should not punish users for their mistakes but should instead provide the means to remedy them .
Designing a user interface that incorporates all of these characteristics is tricky because working on one characteristic often affects others .
The more interface elements you add , the more stuff your users will have to process .
Of course , the converse is also true : not providing enough help and support may make certain functions ambiguous .
Creating something that is simple and elegant and at the same time clear and consistent is the difficult goal of a user interface designer .
Visual Interface Design Toolbox
Visual interface design is the process of designing the physical representation of your interface as your users would see it on the screen of their electronic device .
The objective of visual interface design is to communicate meaning , which is done by crafting appropriate visuals that best represent what the application does and how it can be operated .
Creating the look and feel of a product is not the primary aim of visual interface design , merely a component .
The primary aim is communication : communicating behavior to help your users understand how your application works .
A number of core elements make up visual interface design .
Selecting appropriate types , calibrating each element and then combining them all in a meaningful way let us convey meaning for all the different functions and features of our user interface .
Here are the main building blocks of visual interface design :
Layout and Positioning
Layout provides structure to all the visual elements in your interface .
It also defines hierarchy and relationships through the spacing between elements .
Bringing elements closer together indicates a relationship between them ; for example , labels under icons .
Positioning can improve flow , too .
For example , positioning labels in forms above text fields , rather than to the left , allows us to move our eyes down them easily , rather than have to keep looking left to check which label applies to which field .
Shape and Size
Shape can be used to differentiate elements ; for example , by varying the silhouettes of icons to make them easier and quicker to recognize .
Size can be used to indicate importance , bigger elements being more significant .
Size can also make clickable controls more usable ;
Fitt ’s law tells us that the bigger a clickable area is , the quicker users can move their mouse cursor over it .
Making the most frequently used controls bigger will make it easier for your users to click on them , and thus improve the efficiency of the interface .
Color
Color is useful for several things .
Color can attract attention , provided that it contrasts enough with the background ( for example , a bright - yellow notice box on a white background ) .
Color can express meaning .
For example , red usually symbolizes danger or stopping ( as at a traffic light ) and so is best reserved for error messages ; while green generally tends to mean success or an invitation to proceed and so should be used for content of this kind .
Color can also highlight relationships , such as color coding things like buttons and toolbars to aid the user .
Keep in mind a couple of things when using color .
First , different cultures will associate different things with colors , so make sure that any meaning you intend to communicate with your color selection works in your markets .
Secondly , do n’t forget about color - blindness ; take extra care when differentiating items through color , like bars on a chart .
If a user is color - blind , they may not be able to distinguish between certain colors , most often red and green , so you may need to use other indicators , such as shape and texture , as well .
Contrast
How light or dark something is in relation to the elements around it will have an effect on the usability of an interface .
The key here is contrast .
Black text on a white background has a higher contrast , and is easier to spot and read , than gray text on a white background .
Tuning down the contrast of certain elements allows you to fade them into the background , letting the user differentiate between more important and less important elements .
Texture
There is a concept in interactive design called affordance .
Affordance is the quality that communicates to the user how something is meant to be used .
Think of door handles .
The best way to make a door that opens one way is to attach a handle on the pull side and leave a flat handle plate on the push side .
People will know whether to push or pull automatically because the interface communicates how it should be used ; i.e. it affords less methods of interaction and so focuses the user on the correct one .
We can translate this idea into user interface design on the screen with texture .
For example , some elements in a visual interface may be draggable , like the corner of a window that lets you resize it .
To indicate that you can click and drag it , a set of ridges usually appears on it , illustrating a rougher texture .
Rough textures are often used to add a stronger grip surface to real - life objects to help us pull them with our fingers , and that idea is translated onto the screen , where instead of fingers you would use a mouse cursor .
Practical Techniques For Crafting Effective User Interfaces
We ’ve talked about what user interfaces are , what characteristics all user interfaces should have and the core tools we can use to build them , so now let ’s look at some practical techniques you can use in your own Web applications and websites .
Use white space to build relationships
White space is the empty space between various content elements , such as headings , text and buttons .
White space is a great tool for building relationship between different elements .
By tightening the space between elements , you can form groupings of related items .
Increasing the space between these groupings will further accentuate their connection by separating them from the rest of the content .
Use white space to group related controls and to build a hierarchy of items on the page .
The Gmail toolbar features three groups of buttons separated by some white space .
Each group features buttons that perform related actions .
Rounded corners define boundaries
Rounded corners are often used to improve the look and feel of graphical elements .
They look nice and add that extra bit of visual polish to your interface ; but that ’s not all they can be used for .
Rounded corners define boundaries of objects .
When you see a rounded corner , you know it is the end of the container .
If the corner is straight , it could be attached to another container , so the boundary is not as clear .
Rounded corners , or any other visual corner treatment for that matter , can thus reinforce the boundaries of containers .
Notice how the rounded corners in Ballpark ’s clients list define the edges of each record .
There are also corners in the middle of each record , but these are used as separators between related data rather than as edges of the overall container .
Convey meaning with color
Color is a great tool for communicating meaning ; for example , to define different elements .
You could , if you so choose , use color coding to distinguish between different types of buttons in your application .
Red could be used for destructive buttons like delete and remove , blue could be used for standard buttons and green could be used for save and update actions .
Color coding can also be used to distinguish between various pieces of user - created data on overview screens to make them easy to scan .
Direct attention
Use animation to draw attention .
Sometimes , color and contrast alone are n’t enough to attract a user ’s attention .
If something crucial has happened , and you really must make sure the user has noticed it , use animation .
The human eye is attuned to catching movement , especially on static backgrounds .
If a user adds a to - do item to a list in a productivity application or adds a product to their shopping cart , use animation to highlight what has happened .
For example , you could use a highlight effect when an item is created on the screen .
This is especially useful for applications that use AJAX heavily ; in these cases , the page wo n’t refresh when a particular action has been taken , so it ’s up to the interface to tell the user that something has happened .
When you post a new message in Yammer , it combines slide - out and highlights animations .
Goplan uses color - coded labels along the left side of its dashboard to allow users to quickly differentiate between different types of items , like tasks , notes and blog entries .
Shadows and darkened backgrounds for focus
Another great way to focus user attention on an area is to use shadows and darkened backgrounds .
Shadows can be used around pop-up menus and modal windows and act as blankets that block out visual noise around the window .
Shadows decrease the contrast of elements that lie under them , which in turn increases the contrast of the items they ’re used for .
Modal windows can also have a darker ( or lighter ) semi- transparent layer underneath , which also helps reduce the visual noise of the content it covers and so focuses the user ’s attention on the modal window itself .
Emphasize core actions
Many applications have screens that feature primary and secondary actions .
For example , if you ’re creating a project in a project management application , the main form will probably have fields for the name of the project , the deadline , the priority level and so on .
At the bottom , you may see a “ Create ” button .
Often , you ’ll also see a “ Cancel ” button or link next to it .
The cancel action is less important because your users usually wo n’t need it , so you can decrease its visual “ weight ” .
For example , you could make “ Create ” a button and “ Cancel ” a simple hyperlink with no visual decoration .
This shifts the focus to the main action and helps the user locate it more quickly when they finish filling out the form .
MobileMe darkens the background around modal windows and applies drop - shadows to them .
This shifts the user ’s attention to the window by blocking out the noise below .
Use padded block links for easier cursor targeting .
Web applications rely on HTML building blocks for their construction , which means they make heavy use of the anchor ( better known as the “ link ” ) element .
The anchor element is “ inline ” by default , which basically means that its width and height cover only the text inside it .
This in turn means that the clickable area of the link is only as big as the text itself , which may be too small in many cases for users to comfortably click on .
We can apply padding to the anchor element to make it larger .
Notice how much more prominent the “ Create Client ” button is compared to “ Cancel ” on this Ballpark client creation form .
MobileMe uses padded links in its sidebar navigation panel .
The large clickable areas allow you to position the mouse cursor over them faster , thus improving usability .
For links in a list , like in a sidebar , turning the anchors into “ blocks ” may be an even better solution .
You can specify an element ’s type by using the CSS “ display ” property ; so , specifying the anchor as a “ block ” will turn it into a block element , which means its height and width will no longer follow the size of the text inside it but will instead span the full width of its container by default .
This is ideal for lists of links in a sidebar .
Use verbs as labels
When using your application , people will always be looking to do something .
This means they ’ll be thinking in verbs .
“ I want to save this file ” , or “ I want to update this entry ” .
When building dialog boxes , or any other type of user prompt , use verbs rather than exclamations like “ Yes ” , “ No ” and “ Okay ” .
When the user sees options like “ Okay ” and “ Cancel ” , they will have to read the message above to understand what they ’re being asked to do .
However , if you present the choices as verbs – for example , “ Save ” , “ Do n’t Save ” and “ Cancel ” – you make the dialog and selections clear to the user without them even having to read the accompanying message .
Backpack makes great use of verbs for its buttons and links , ensuring clarity for each choice .
Auto - focus / re-focus on input
Form - oriented applications might benefit from automatically activating the main form ’s input field when the Web page loads .
For example , search engines like Google focus on their main search field on the assumption that almost everyone arriving on their home page will want to type a search query into the input field , and so when the page loads you can start typing right away .
Automatically activating input fields can work in other contexts : for example , in applications that require successive inputs , like a shopping - list builder .
After the first item is entered , the user may want to enter more , so you should automatically re-focus on the input field to allow for quick , successive inputs .
Tadalist allows for quick , successive input of to - do items .
When you write a task and hit “ Enter ” , the application adds the new item and then automatically focuses back on the text field , ready for more .
Backpack makes great use of verbs for its buttons and links , ensuring clarity for each choice .
Use hover controls to simplify and de-clutter
Many applications have a set of context - sensitive controls , like buttons for deleting and editing individual records in a list .
To make it easy to target something directly , they ’re usually placed next to each item , but this causes a lot of duplication .
Most of the time the user wo n’t need these controls , and when they do , they ’ll only need them for one particular item .
To simplify your interface , use hover controls , which only show up when you hover over a specific area .
So , for example , when hovering over the record you want to edit , an edit button will show up , but the button will be hidden for all other records .
Twitter shows the “ Reply ” and “ Add to favorites ” buttons when hovering over each message .
Basecamp allows you to attach multiple files to a message but only shows one attachment field at a time .
Hover controls are a great way to de-clutter and simplify interfaces , but you should consider a couple of things before implementing them .
First , think about discoverability .
People need to discover the user interface element before they can use it : are your controls prominent enough that a user would stumble on them ?
People naturally move the mouse around the screen and hover over items they ’re looking at , so this may not be a big issue but is still worth taking into account .
Secondly ,
Web browsing interfaces on mobile devices like phones may not be able to simulate mouse cursor hovering , so these controls may be inaccessible .
Expanding forms
If your form requires multiple data items to be entered into the same input fields – for example , attaching multiple files to a message or adding multiple people to a company record in your database – then you could use expanding forms to achieve this in an elegant fashion .
Because the user only works with one field at a time , you should display only one field at a time to them .
When they fill out and add a record , the application creates an extra input field below it to allow them to enter more information .
This way , instead of displaying several empty input fields at once , you display only one empty field and add more as necessary .
Labels inside input fields
Simplifying interfaces depends mostly on thoughtful reduction .
You want to cut out the unnecessary and make better use of space for the stuff that remains .
One clever idea for forms is to put labels inside the actual input fields themselves .
This saves space and also makes it dead clear to which field each label applies .
MobileMe compacts its log - in screen by moving text - field labels inside the text fields themselves .
Context - sensitive interface elements
Sometimes you need to integrate additional functionality for more experienced users of your application but do n’t want to add weight to the interface .
What you can do is offer context - sensitive interface elements on demand .
For example , if you have a search bar somewhere in your application that has advanced filters , you could display just the search bar when it ’s not being used , and then reveal more controls when the user clicks on the box .
This way , the interface remains slim , while the advanced functionality is only a click away .
Vimeo displays extended search filters when you hover over the search bar , giving more experienced users of the website a little extra functionality on demand .
Icons
Icons can be used to simplify the interface and make it look more visually appealing , but there are some considerations to take into account before you implement them .
Icons are almost always less clear than words .
Writing out a label is easy : you just say exactly what the button does .
When designing an icon , however , you have to come up with an effective metaphor to describe the action in question .
Also , the metaphor you choose may not translate very well in different countries if the illustration is of something local ( even trash cans vary in appearance across the globe ) .
Icons work best when there are n’t too many of them on the screen at the same time and each one is visually different enough from the others to stand out .
This means that varying shape and color is key to building a successful set of icons .
Implemented correctly , icons make the interface easier to use , because once users familiarize themselves with the icon set , the distinctive shapes and colors help them jump right to the icon they want .
Make it responsive with loading Indicators
Nobody likes waiting .
Waiting means you ’re spending time doing nothing while you could be doing something valuable .
Unfortunately , every application has features that take time to execute ; whether it is exporting a large document or fetching the results of a search query , your users will have to wait .
But you can make the wait time feel considerably shorter by showing a loading indicator .
Whenever something loads , add a loading indicator , such as a spinning animation or progress bar .
Research shows that users perceive the wait time to be less when such indicators are displayed2 .
Loading indicators are great for short wait times , but what if an action takes a minute or more to complete ?
While you ca n’t do anything about the load time itself ( assuming you ’ve already done everything in your power about that ) , you can do something about the waiting experience of your users .
Take this time to entertain or inform .
For example , many applications display interesting hints and tips during long wait times .
If the user is n’t doing anything productive , at least they can learn something new .
Dropbox shows a progress bar when users upload files using the Web interface .
For events such as these , where wait times vary considerably , a progress bar is essential so that users do n’t have to keep guessing how much longer they will have to wait .
Make it responsive with pressed button states
The responsiveness of your application does n’t depend solely on the optimization of your back - end architecture .
The way your user interface behaves plays a big part in this , too .
One of the most used elements of any visual interface is the button .
In desktop applications , buttons have several states , the most common being the default state , in which the button just sits there , and the pressed state when you click on it .
OtherInbox has a set of icons for the main navigation bar , with labels under each one for clarity .
The default and pressed states of the search button in WordPress .
Campaign Monitor provides a detailed help message when you first log in , as well as a large button that takes you to the campaign creation screen .
The pressed state looks just like that : the button appears to have been pressed .
This state sends instant feedback to users that their click was successful .
Just as on the desktop , pressed button states can be used in Web applications to provide that extra bit of feedback and responsiveness .
Helpful blank states
When a user loads your application for the first time , there likely wo n’t be very much on the screen ; the user has n’t entered any data yet , so there is nothing to display .
Take this blank state as an opportunity to aid the user by including a short help message that provides information on how to get started .
To make things even easier , you can provide a link right in the help message pointing to the action it recommends ; so , for example , if your application is for managing email campaigns , and the user has just created a new account and logged in , the help message could provide a link to the creation page for new campaigns .
Advertise features
Your users wo n’t know your application inside out , so in some situations it may be a good idea to advertise features in the application itself .
Also , because Web applications tend to be updated constantly and substantial new features are introduced from time to time , it makes sense to inform your users about them .
Do this by placing a small notice in a prominent area of the screen .
It should be fairly eye - catching but not distract or handicap the user in performing their tasks .
The users should also be able to close the notice once they ’ve read it .
Gmail displays this undo message each time you delete an email , allowing you to get it back quickly .
Undo
One of the most relied - on features in desktop applications is the trusty undo shortcut .
Accidently changed the formatting of that chart you ’re working on ?
No problem : hit Ctrl / Cmd and Z on your keyboard , and the application takes a step back and restores the document to its state before your last action .
Undo is a crucial tool in forgiving interfaces , and it can be used in Web applications as well .
For example , you could either integrate the familiar keyboard shortcut or show temporary notice messages with undo links in them .
Yammer shows a helpful note under the main input area regarding the “ follow ” feature .
Once the users read it , they can close it using the little cross icon on the right .
Writeboard allows you to restore your work for up to two months after deleting it .
Restore
People often change their mind after deleting something , so it ’s wise to implement some extra protective measures when dealing with the more important bits of data in your application ; for example , project files in a project management application .
When a user deletes a project , you could , instead of deleting it right away , archive it for a certain amount of time .
If they change their mind and decide they need the project files back , you will be able to restore them easily .
A few extra megabytes of used space is worth the trade - off for making your customers really happy when they discover that all is not lost .
Confirmation dialogs
When allowing destructive actions in your application , such as deletion of items , it is a good idea to provide a confirmation dialog to ensure that the user really wants to go ahead with his action .
This is more important if the delete button is located close to other controls ; if users accidently click it , they should be able to cancel the action before it happens .
Be careful not to overuse this feature , though , because it will introduce interface friction by making actions longer and more tedious to perform than necessary .
Freckle uses a confirmation dialog to make sure you do n’t delete entries by accident .
Conclusion
There is a Japanese philosophy called Kaizen , which focuses on continuous improvement through small , gradual steps .
User interface design , especially in modern Web applications , does n’t have to be in a finished state because you can always keep evolving and improving it .
Think of it like Kaizen .
The old model of distributing software on CDs carried a big downside : once you burned and shipped the product , you could n’t change it … well , not very easily .
You could release a patch , but your users would have to download and install it before any changes took effect , and you could n’t guarantee that everyone would update .
Additionally , releasing a patch for every small change was n’t feasible , so you pretty much had to get things as perfect as possible the first time , which required a lot of testing before the release .
The software - as - a - service model changed all that .
The benefit of hosting your Web application online is that you can deploy little changes whenever you want , and all of your users will instantly gain access to them .
This means you do n’t have to get your interface 100 % right the first time .
If something does n’t work , you can change it .
By observing how users interact with your interface , you will begin to get a good feel for how well it works and where the friction is – where things slow your users down .
If any parts of the UI need improvement , you can update them for all of your users very easily .
This is the Kaizen approach to interface design : small , gradual , regular improvements .
So do n’t worry about getting things perfect the first time ; instead , iterate as you go , and you ’ll soon end up with a great interface that has evolved through real usage .

I ’ve been reading ( like everyone else ) “ Game of Shadows , ” the book about Barry Bonds and steroids and the BALCO scandal .
It ’s quite a remarkable feat of reporting .
What striking about it is something that you might not notice unless you ’ve journalist — which is the absence of obvious lawyering .
If you ever write something even remotely critical of someone , the lawyers invariably go through it , and before you know it your prose is strewn with “ apparently ” and “ allegedly , ” and “ according to ” and so - so “ denies . . . ”
There ’s almost none of that in “ Game of Shadows , ” which is amazing considering the book accuses , in devastating detail , several of the biggest names in sports — Barry Bonds , Gary Sheffield , Tim Montgomery and Marion Jones , among others — of being serious steroid users .
The two writers — Mark Fainaru - Wada and Lance Williams — must have had really impeccable sourcing .
When the book first came out , and several baseball writers predicted that Bonds ’ reputation was destroyed and his chances are getting in the Hall of Fame seriously damaged , I thought they were overstating things .
Now I ’m not so sure .
“ Game of Shadows ” is a death sentence for Bonds .
More to the point , it ’s impossible to read the book and accept that Bonds has a right either to the single season home - run record or , assuming he keeps playing , the career home run mark .
So what should we do ?
I think we need to set the bar a little higher for record - setters .
Justin Wolfers , an economist at Penn , just did a study analyzing college basketball scores , concluding that there is ample statistical evidence for point - shaving in about five percent of college games .
Steven Levitt ( I know , I know .
I ’m obsessed with him ) has done the same kind of work on student test scores .
Forensic economics look at large data sets and draw surprisingly sophisticated inferences about behavior and intention .
I think we should loose the forensic economists on all record - setters , and require that athletes pass a statistical plausibility test in the wake of their achievements .
Obvious example :
Florence Griffiths Joyner , in 1988 .
Before that year , her best times in the hundred meters and the two hundred meters were , respectively , 10.96 and 21.96 .
In 1988 , at the advanced ( for a sprinter ) age of 28 , a suddenly huskier FloJo ran 10.49 and 21.34 , times that no runner since has even come close to equaling .
At the time , people in the track world just rolled their eyes .
But since FloJo never failed a drug test , there was nothing they could do .
Well , there is something we can do .
We can bring in the forensic economists — and any statistical analysis of the career marks of world class sprinters would have told us that marginally world - class 28 year old do not , in the absence of some kind of help , suddenly turn into the greatest runners the world has ever seen .
Bonds falls into the same category .
From the moment he started his late career surge , everyone who knew anything about baseball suspected mischief .
“ Game of Shadows ” points out that Bonds had the second , ninth and tenth greatest offensive season in baseball history at the ages of 36 , 37 , and 39 respectively — and the average age of everyone else on that list ( Gehrig , Foxx , Ruth and Hornsby ) is 27 .
No one — no one — turns himself into one of the greatest hitters of all time in his late 30’s .
His home run record should have been denied as statistically implausible .
Will raising the bar this way mean we occasionally deny a genuine record ?
It ’s certainly possible .
Bob Beamon jumped 29 ft , 2.5 inches at the Mexico City Olympics , and had never jumped more than 27 ft , 3 inches before that , and never again jumped more than 27 feet .
No one has ever doubted that Beamon was clean .
But it ’s a totally weird performance .
On the other hand , it was at altitude .
Because of the difficulty in hitting the board , long jump performances are highly variable .
And the effect of drug enhancement is sufficiently long - lived , that a single anomalous performance in an otherwise quiet career is more statistically plausible than a string of closely - linked anomalous performances in an otherwise quiet career .
FloJo had a fantastic year in 1988 , which is why she raised so many eyebrows .
She was n’t Beamon .
She was Bonds .
I think if we ’re smart about it , we can learn to distinguish the fluke performances from the phony performances .
One obvious objection to this idea is that we have a tradition of presuming people innocent until proven guilty , and prima facia statistical tests violate that .
But the presumption of innocence is a legal principle .
We ’re dealing with sports records here , and it seems reasonable , particularly in this day and age of advanced athletic chemistry , to ask a bit more of record holders .
