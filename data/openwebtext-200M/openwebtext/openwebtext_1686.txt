Si Jefe !
We sure have a PLETHORA of fun with our illegals !
Mexican President Felipe Calderon on the new Arizona law : “ this opens the door to intolerance , hate , discrimination and abuse in law enforcement . ”
“ Jose Ramos , 18 , of El Salvador said the extortion ( by Mexican border police ) occurs at every stop in Mexico , until migrants are left penniless and begging for food .
Maria Elena Gonzalez , said female migrants often complain about abusive ( Mexican border ) police officers .
“ They ( Mexican border police ) force them to strip , supposedly to search them , but the purpose is to sexually abuse them , ” she said .
Others said they had seen migrants beaten to death by ( Mexican border ) police , their bodies left near the railway tracks to make it look as if they had fallen from a train …
” If you ’re carrying any money , they ( Mexican border police ) take it from you , ” said Guatemalan migrant Carlos Lopez in the same story , “ federal , state , local ( Mexican ) police–all of them . ”
Lopez had been shaken down repeatedly in 15 days of traveling through Mexico .
“ If you ’re on a bus , they pull you off and search your pockets , and if you have any money , ” added El Salvadoran migrant Jose Ramos , “ they ( Mexican Border police ) keep it all and say , ‘ Get out of here ! ' ”
In May of 2002 , 18 Americans –though holding perfectly legal Mexican visas–were unceremoniously booted out of Mexico .
“ And stay out ! ” yelled the Mexican immigration authorities while shaking their fists .
The Americans ’ crime ?
Why , the arrogant Gringo scoundrels participated in a May Day march in Mexico City !
Unreal .
( Trivia : The Mexican actor Alfonso Arau ( El Guapo ) went to Cuba promptly upon Castro ’s victory and founded Stalinist Cuba ’s Teatro Musical de La Habana , which he ran until 1964 .
He then scooted back to Mexico .
So he ’s a sure bet to appear soon on Univison , denouncing “ Gusano hardliners ! ” whose families were murdered and tortured during his stint as Castroite .
He certainly fits the bill . )

Photo manipulation is an art that could be done under advanced portrait retouching .
This is actually one of the advanced photo editing strategies that is the oldest in the book and could be done either by beginners or professionals .
A combined effort between photography and graphic design that is undergoing continuous evolution , photo manipulation is what others call photo art and provides some kind of illusion to a photo .
There are different kinds of photo manipulation , and these include digital editing and the use of prints , negatives , or transparencies that are made digital through feeding them into a scanner .
Image warping is just one of the things done during photo manipulation as well as the addition of some other special effects .
This post features a collection of animal photo manipulations .
Hope these photos will make smile on your face !

The Dell Streak !
The new Android tablet
The Dell Streak .
Though the idea of Michael Dell streaking through the streets is both amusing and disturbing , this happens to be the name of the newest addition to the Android tablet market .
It ’s sleek , it ’s new , and it ’s a tablet !
Just like the last couple years had netbooks be all the rage , this is the year of the tablet PC .
Admittedly this is a trend started by Apple , so when Apple starts something new you know you gotta jump on the bandwagon .
It has some fairly impressive specs and is running the Android OS to boot ( no pun intended ) :
Android 2.1
1GHz Snapdragon processor
5 - inch multi - touch WVGA display
VGA front facing camera
Removable battery
3G + WiFi + Bluetooth
UMTS / GPRS / EDGE class 12 GSM radio with link speeds of up to HSDPA 7.2 Mbps / HSDPA
HDMI out
5 MP autofocus camera with dual LED flash
2GB of internal memory
Micro SD expandable memory available up to 32 GB ( 42 movies , 32,000 photos , or 16,000 songs )
Cushions made from 100 percent sustainable , compostable bamboo
( Information obtained from PCWorld.com )
It is known as the “ fat ” smartphone in some circles since it realistically is only a bit larger than a regular smartphone .
Dell is trying to pitch it as a more business driven device that can be a companion to your regular phone although I think this is silly because that is what notebooks are for .
Even the Apple iPad has a more decently sized screen and then there is the feature rich HTC EVO 4G by Sprint .
Not only is the EVO 4 G ’s camera more powerful ( 8 - megapixels vs the Streak ’s 5 - megapixels ) , it has a more spacious screen and even the brand new 4G Internet .
I ’ll say at the least Dell is planning on making 7 and 10 inch screens soon but I doubt pricing wise it will get any better .
The Streak model described above is going for a hefty $ 500 to compete with the iPad , which is a risky move if you ask me .
Dell is probably going to use its established market in the business world to sell this product , a market Apple has had some trouble breaching , which may be why it is priced so high .
Other than all that , I am glad to see Android is moving up in the ranks .
Geek Ink : 20 Wonderfully Nerdy Scientific Tattoos
When science journalist Carl Zimmer wondered aloud whether scientists got tattoos related to their field of research , much like musicians often sport music - related tattoos , he was immediately flooded in pictures .
Scientists and researchers from around the world started sending pictures of their tattoos , and eventually Zimmer decided to house them on the Science Tattoo Emporium .
For every inked - up geek and nerd out there , here ’s some inspiration for your next piece of scientific body art .
Scientific tattoos often have a very deep and personal meaning for their owners .
Some researchers tattoo a depiction of an atom or molecule they admire , some depict a more abstract image of the work they do , and others search for a more emotional connection .
The tattoo above on the bottom left is called “ Pandora ’s Viruses ” and belongs to a viral immunologist .
He got it to represent what , for him , was a difficult and life - changing career choice .
Not all scientific tattoos are work - related , though .
Some people simply love science and want a permanent reminder of a part of science that moves them .
The periodic table of elements tattoos , above , show two very different ways to suggest a love of chemistry .
The tattoo on the top right , above , is a replica of the Pioneer Plaque , a constant reminder of our quest for intelligent extraterrestrial life .
It ’s interesting to note just how many science - related tattoos are out there .
Tattoos were once in the realm of outlaws and renegades , but today they ’re positively mainstream .
The scientific tattoos here are a far cry from the sailor tattoos of a few hundred years ago .
One of the biggest benefits ( and arguably , the biggest curse ) for bearers of scientific tattoos is having to explain the tattoo constantly .
By tattooing a scientific sketch , a mathematical equation , or a portrait of a favorite scientist on their body , the owner of the art can spread the word about their pet cause .
Whatever the inspiration behind scientific tattoos , most scientists ( and science fans ) seem to put a great deal of thought into their geek ink .
Provided the mathematical theory inked onto their forearm is n’t discredited at some point in the future , owners of science tattoos can always be proud of their super - nerdy tats .
Chau Linh Uyen was playing in front of her primary school in Ho Chi Minh City two months ago when she touched a cash machine a few feet from the front gate .
In a flash , as more than 100 volts coursed through her small body , the 10 - year - old fourth - grader foamed at the mouth and lost consciousness .
She died within minutes .
The accident , caused by a state bank ’s ATM that was n’t properly grounded , was hardly a fluke .
An investigation a few days later found that 121 of the city ’s 866 cash machines were leaking electricity through their keyboards and other surfaces , many at potentially fatal levels .
As communist Vietnam embraces consumerism and the middle - class dream , more citizens are questioning the shoddy construction and slapdash power system accompanying its headlong rush into the future and lamenting a lost sense of integrity .
“ If you bring me these new gadgets related to modern life , that ’s supposed to mean everything is safe , ” said Chi Mai , a writer .
“ No one thought ATM machines would kill people .
Suddenly you feel , ‘ Oh my God , this could happen to me . ’ ”
The girl ’s death is the latest in a string of fatal accidents .
In April 2009 , a 22 - year - old woman was sitting in traffic on Au Co Street in Ho Chi Minh City , formerly known as Saigon , when a power line fell on her .
She died instantly .
In August , a 13 - year - old boy rode his bike through a puddle after a heavy rain here and was electrocuted by a faulty lamppost .
And a month later , a 10 - year - old boy was electrocuted while playing soccer in the rain near faulty underground municipal power lines .
The government has promised to beef up safety standards in an effort to reduce what the Ministry of Industry and Trade estimates are 450 to 500 electrocution deaths each year .
However , the deadly shocks do n’t seem to be diminishing the appetite for modern appliances .
At the mammoth Nguyen Kim Electronics Superstore in the city center , electronics pulsate behind several giant “ money god ” statues on three floors as a legion of blue - vested clerks stalks customers .
Nguyen Van Toan , 56 , a garment factory engineer , stopped for a rest near the escalator , briefly stalled by sensory overload during his search for a 37 - inch TV .
“ I ’ve got a 29 - inch model but need something bigger , ” he said .
“ Sure , I ’m concerned about the electricity and the ATM case .
But our house has n’t had any shocks yet , so basically life is pretty good . ”
Part of this willingness to accept the bad with the good may reflect the fast pace of change in Vietnam , social observers say .
For a nation that barely had electricity two decades ago , a relatively low number deaths may be an acceptable price for such heady progress .
Over the last 10 years , Vietnam ’s average economic growth has topped 7 % annually , while the proportion of those living in poverty has fallen to 11 % of the nation ’s 86 million people last year from 58 % in 1993 .
Per capita yearly income is about $ 1,000 , up from $ 400 in 2000 .
“ Things are moving so fast , the sociologists ca n’t keep up , ” journalist Lan Anh Nguyen said .
Phan
An is a case in point .
The 26 - year - old freelance IT consultant and five siblings grew up in Danang without electricity or running water , took baths in flooded rice fields and read by oil lamp , sleeping with the rest of the family in a single room and walking three miles to school .
Nowadays
Phan sits at his computer listening to digital music files in a building on land that was a field a few years back .
The two - room apartment he shares with a friend is stuffed with a fan , washing machine ( equipped with “ Fuzzy Logic 6.4 " ) , flat - screen television , Sanyo refrigerator and electric guitar .
The way Phan sees it , the ATM electrocution is a tragedy , but the real problem runs deeper : a corrupt system that is n’t safeguarding its citizens or giving them enough voice in how society should be organized .
“ The ATM death , the boy in the puddle , these are symptoms of a system that is n’t working , ” he said .
For some , the answer lies in harsher penalties .
“ If businesspeople knew they faced bankruptcy and years in prison for deadly ATMs , they ’d stop ignoring ” these safety problems , said a student in Ho Chi Minh City .
Others , including some who remember Saigon ’s decadence before the Communists took over , cite the need for better education on ethics and core values .
“ The young people are less moral , and society only thinks about money , ” said Nguyen Thanh Minh , 56 , a former South Vietnamese soldier who spent seven years in a jungle reeducation camp after the war ended in 1975 .
“ It ’s worse than the old Saigon . ”
In some ways , the ATM case reflects how far Vietnam has and has not come , said Chuck Searcy , a representative of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund and a Hanoi resident since 1995 .
On the one hand , the middle class is prosperous and proud of what it has accomplished , he said .
At the same time , luxury apartment buildings are built with too much sand in the concrete and office towers have bricks missing .
“ They ’re following the same pattern as the U.S. , despite being aware of the misgivings , ” Searcy said .
“ I used to admire their family values and real strength .
Now there ’s so much that ’s superficial , so much greed . ”
On a recent afternoon , a white sign on the Agribank ATM two doors down from the Nguyen Thai Binh Primary School said it was closed for maintenance .
After the accident , a police investigation traced the problem to exposed wiring in a power cord jury - rigged by bank staff to run along a stairway .
The head of Vietcombank ’s ATM department told Tuoi
Tre newspaper that landlords often balk at letting ATM operators install grounding wires for reasons of cost or appearance , and that operators often cut one of the three prongs off foreign - made plugs so they fit into Vietnam ’s two - prong outlets , removing the grounding .
That ’s of little solace to parents who feel increasingly insecure .
“ I just ca n’t imagine such a thing , ” said Minh Hang , picking up her first - grade son at the school , which has since barred students from playing outside the gate after class .
“ We ’re scared .
The kids are scared .
The other parents are scared .
Everyone ’s scared . ”

Editor 's note : Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist and a regular contributor to CNN.com .
San Diego , California ( CNN ) --
During a recent interview with CNN's John King , Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said that , if the Obama Justice Department winds up suing her state over an immigration law that President Obama has called " misguided " and many constitutional scholars label unconstitutional , she 'll go to court .
" I have a pretty good record of winning in court , " Brewer said .
We 'll see about that , governor -- and sooner than many people thought .
Sources within the administration are telling reporters that this much anticipated legal showdown is about to take place .
Attorney General Eric
Holder is expected as early as next week to file a lawsuit challenging Senate Bill 1070 , which essentially deputizes every local and state enforcement officer in the Grand Canyon state to act as surrogates for the Border Patrol by requiring that they question the citizenship of anyone who they suspect of being an illegal immigrant ( read : Latinos ) .
According to polls , most Arizonans support the law , as do most Americans .
But fortunately for opponents , we do n't live in a pure democracy .
That 's where three people stranded in a lifeboat take a vote , and two decide to throw the third overboard .
Life in a constitutional republic means we get majority rule but not at the expense of the rights of the minority .
That 's why we have a Constitution -- to protect the rights of minorities .
Majorities generally can protect themselves .
So this could be a long , hard slog for Brewer and the state of Arizona .
Good .
It should be .
It 's one thing to take the easy way out politically and pander to the nativist mob by signing such a bill to get a leg up during a re-election campaign .
It 's another to step into the legal arena and force a square peg into a round hole by arguing that a state law that usurps federal authority to enforce immigration law does n't violate Article 1 , Section 8 of the Constitution , which enumerates the powers bestowed to Congress .
Among them : the authority " to establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization . "
According to media reports , that 's likely to be the basis of the government 's challenge .
Although , in a significant development , part of the lawsuit is also expected to raise the issue of racial and ethnic profiling , insisting -- while SB 1070 specifically bans the practice -- its implementation , in the real world of policing , all but ensures it .
I 'm glad to hear it .
Race and ethnicity should be part of this discussion .
After all , given the growing anxiety in Arizona and around the country over changing demographics , it 's hard to deny that they were part of the reason that this ghastly law was passed in the first place .
The federal government enforces immigration law .
It is n't self - serve .
Like it or not , governor , that 's the law .
What part of " unlawful " do n't you and other crusaders against anti-illegal immigration understand ?
Supporters of Arizona 's SB 1070 argue that the federal government is n't doing enough to secure the border and so , that being the case , Arizona can pitch in and lend a hand .
That 's interesting .
I 'm curious , governor .
Since the Constitution also gives Congress the power to coin money , does this mean that you believe that -- if Arizonans decided that Ronald Reagan 's picture belongs on the $ 50 bill , and the federal government did n't happen to agree -- these folks could buy lots of paper and green ink and start printing bills ?
Wait .
That does n't make much sense .
But then neither does the bill you signed into law for the sake of politics and now have to defend in court with barely a leg to stand on .
Speaking recently to a high - level official with the Border Patrol , I asked what he thought of SB 1070 .
He said he did n't know what to think because he does n't understand it .
This is someone who clearly can't be accused of condoning illegal immigration or supporting an open border .
Hello ?
He 's with the Border Patrol !
It 's just that , as a federal agent who has received many weeks of specialized training that allows him to enforce immigration law without wiping his feet on the Constitution or the rights of U.S. citizens , he has a tough time understanding how clueless state legislators who 've spent limited time on the border could think for a moment that the job he does and the job that local police officers do are interchangeable .
Ah , there 's the rub .
Arizona lawmakers are not thinking .
They 're too busy pandering .
It looks like the Justice Department , and the federal courts , are going to have to do the thinking for everyone .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr .
Domestic violence is not an act , it is a process in which the identity of one person is eroded by another .
It is not a random act of violence , be it physical or verbal , it is the relationship between an abuser and a victim .
The continuation of the abuse alters the personalities of the parties creating a set of variables in which the abuse becomes ' normal ' .

With the World Cup comes the quadrennial ritual in which Americans try to redesign and improve the rules of soccer .
As usual , it ’s a bad idea to redesign something you do n’t understand — and indeed , most of the proposed changes would be harmful .
What has surprised me , though , is how rarely anyone explains the rationale behind soccer ’s rules .
Once you understand the rationale , the rules will make a lot more sense .
So here ’s the logic underlying soccer ’s rules : the game is supposed to scale down , so that an ordinary youth or recreation - league game can be played under the exact same rules used by the pros .
This means that the rules must be designed so that the game can be run by a single referee , without any special equipment such as a scoreboard .
Most of the popular American team sports do n’t scale down in this way .
American football , basketball , and hockey — the most common inspirations for “ reformed ” soccer rules — all require multiple referees and special equipment .
To scale these sports down , you have to change the rules .
For example , playground basketball has no shot clock , no counting of fouls , and nonstandard rules for awarding free throws and handling restarts — it ’s fun but it ’s not the same game the Lakers play .
Baseball is the one popular American spectator sport that does scale down .
The scaling principle accounts for soccer ’s seemingly odd timekeeping .
The clock is n’t stopped and started , because we ca n’t assume a separate timekeeping official and we do n’t want to burden the referee ’s attention with a lot of clock management .
The time is not displayed to the players , because we ca n’t assume the availability of a scoreboard .
And because the players do n’t know the exact remaining time , the referee gives the players some leeway to finish an attack even if the nominal finishing time has been reached .
Most of the scalable sports lack a clock — think of baseball and volleyball — but soccer manages to reconcile a clock with scalability .
Americans often want to “ fix ” this by switching to a scheme that requires a scoreboard and timekeeper .
The scaling principle also explains the system of yellow and red cards .
A hockey - style penalty box system requires special timing and ( realistically ) a special referee to manage the penalty box and timer .
Basketball - style foul handling allows penalties to mount up as more fouls are committed by the same player or team , which is good , but it requires elaborate bookkeeping to keep track of fouls committed by each player and team fouls per half .
We do n’t want to make the soccer referee keep such detailed records , so we simply ask him to record yellow and red cards , which are rare .
He uses his judgment to decide when repeated fouls merit a yellow card .
This may seem arbitrary in particular cases but it does seem fair on average .
( There ’s a longer essay that could be written applying the theory of efficient liability regimes to the design of sports penalties . )
It ’s no accident , I think , that scalable sports such as soccer and baseball / softball are played by many Americans who typically watch non-scalable sports .
There ’s something satisfying about playing the same game that the pros play .
So , my fellow Americans , if you ’re going to fix soccer , please keep the game simple enough that the rest of us can still play it .
It 's a polyglot for C ( not C++ ) , brainf *** , Python , Perl , Ruby , and ( nearly ) any other scripting language for that matter .
Interestingly , it is also a Befunge - 93 program .
Here 's a comprehensive breakdown .
C
After preprocessing , the program becomes :
main ( ) {putchar ( 4+putchar ( putchar ( 52 ) - 4 ) ) ; return 0;}
The function putchar is stated by the standard as int putchar ( int c ) inside < stdio.h > .
As there is no #include directive , this is not a valid C program either .
It could be valid if there is a compiler that implicitly includes < stdio.h > if it notices certain functions being used , but I have yet to encounter one .
It could also be valid if you were using gcc and added - include " {stdio} " to the command line .
However , the - include parameter expects a relative path .
If there was an #include < stdio.h > line , the program would still be valid in scripting languages ( as explained below ) , and brainf *** as the only control characters are <> .
It would not function however as the pointer is set to 0 on start , and setting it to - 1 should crash the interpreter .
Disregarding all of that , when we reformat the code a bit , and replace 52 with its ASCII equivalent ( ' 4 ' ) , we get :
int main ( ) { putchar ( 4 + putchar ( putchar ( ' 4 ' ) - 4 ) ) ; return 0 ; }
As for the putchar declaration , it is defined by the standard to return it 's input , like realloc .
First , this program prints a 4 , then takes the ASCII value ( 52 ) , subtracts 4 ( 48 ) , prints that ( ASCII 0 ) , adds 4 ( 52 ) , prints that ( 4 ) , then finally terminates .
This results in the following output :
404
As for this polyglot being valid C++ , unfortunately , it is not as C++ requires an explicit return type for functions .
This program takes advantage of the fact that C requires functions without an explicit return type to be int .
brainf ***
brainf *** works by reading its input character by character , and ignoring anything except the brainf *** operators ( any of .<> [ ]+- ) .
This results in the following ( line breaks included , sans first line ) :
+- >++++++++[>++++++<-]>++++.----.++++. >.
Stepping through this program , we get :
+- ; nothing > ; set ptr to 1 ++++++++ ; set arr [ 1 ] to 8 ( iter count ) [ > ; set ptr to 2 ++++++ ; add 6 to arr [ 2 ]
< ; set ptr to 1 - ; decrement loop count ] ; arr [ 2 ] now contains 48 ( 6*8 ) > ; set ptr to 2 ++++. ; set arr [ 2 ] to 52 ( ' 4 ' ) and print ----. ; set arr [ 2 ] to 48 ( ' 0 ' ) and print ++++. ; set arr [ 2 ] to 52 and print >. ; print arr [ 3 ] ( `\0 ` )
The reasoning behind the output of a null character at the end is unknown to me .
However , this all results in the same output as above :
404
Scripting languages
Nearly all popular scripting languages ( Perl , Python , Ruby , etc. ) contain a function called print that casts whatever is passed to it to a string then writes it to stdout .
They also interpret # as a single line comment ( akin C and C++'s // ) .
This results in the following with the " comments " removed :
print ( 202*2 ) ; exit ( ) ;
It should be obvious what this does .

TODO
The Nintendo 3DS is n’t limited to games with 3D models .
A proof of concept video shown on Nintendo ’s upcoming handheld had classic games – Punchout , Tennis , Mega Man 2 , and Super Mario Bros. running in 3D .
All of the games retained their original sprite graphics with a newly applied 3D filter .
Tennis had a blocky ball bounce towards the player from an opponent who was far away .
Nintendo ’s Table Tennis game had a floating hand that looked like was stacked on top of the screen .
The clip from Mega Man 2 was taken from Wood Man ’s stage .
See the fire ?
It appeared as if it was on its own plane in front of Mega Man .
The robot wolf and Mega Man were on their own plane and the background was behind .
Super Mario Bros. in 3D may be the easier to explain .
The 3D filter appeared to create layers – one with Mario and goombas , one for pipes , and another for background objects like bushes in the distance .
The 3D effect made the pipes appear smaller , but in the distance when 3D was on .
Turning 3D off with the depth slider would revert Super Mario Bros. back to a regular NES game shown in a letterbox on the Nintendo 3DS .
Sarah Palin will meet with Margaret Thatcher while in London .
| AP photo composite by POLITICO Palin to visit Margaret Thatcher
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is planning a trip to London and a visit with former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , her staff has confirmed to POLITICO .
In a Facebook post scheduled to go up Monday , Palin writes : “ I have received an invitation for a visit to London , and part of that invitation included the offer of arranging a meeting between myself and one of my political heroines , the ‘ Iron Lady , ’ Margaret Thatcher . ”

“ I would love to meet her and hope I 'll be able to arrange the trip in the future , ” Palin writes of the former conservative leader whom the former governor frequently cites in speeches .
“ As I wrote last year when I offered her birthday wishes , Baroness Thatcher ’s life and career serve as a blueprint for overcoming the odds and challenging the ‘ status quo , ' ” Palin continues .
“ She started life as a grocer 's daughter from Grantham and rose to become Prime Minister — all by her own merit and hard work .
I cherish her example and will always count her as one of my role models .
Her friendship with my other political hero , Ronald Reagan , exemplified the Special Relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom . ”
The news of a possible trip was first reported by London ’s Daily Mail , which wrote on Sunday that Thatcher has agreed to the visit .
Palin recently touted Thatcher during a speech at a fundraising breakfast for the Susan B. Anthony List in Washington — a speech in which Palin highlighted many of the “ mama grizzlies ” she believes are reshaping the Republican Party .
“ Mrs . Thatcher , she never set out to be a woman prime minister , just a prime minister , ” Palin said .
“ Mrs. Thatcher used to say about politics ‘ You want something said , ask a man .
You want something done , ask a woman . ’ ”
Dispersants clear the visible oil , but what happens to the marine life ?
( Image : Petty Officer 2nd Class Andrew Kendrick / US Coast Guard )
As arguments rage over how to clean up the Deepwater Horizon oil spill , an examination of toxicity tests reveals flaws in the data used to determine the safety of dispersants .
The US Environmental Protection Agency and BP have locked horns over the toxicity of the dispersants being used to break up the oil spewing from the Deepwater Horizon well .
Now , New Scientist has learned that huge variability in the safety test results submitted by different manufacturers makes it very difficult to judge which of the available dispersant chemicals poses the least threat to marine life .
“ It screams to me that I ca n’t make a judgement on any of these data , ” says Carys Mitchelmore , a toxicologist at the University of Maryland ’s Chesapeake Biology Laboratory in Solomons , and co-author of a 2005 National Research Council report on the use of oil dispersants .

The EPA commissioned a new round of tests in late May , but it remains unclear when these will be completed .
As of 14 June , more than 3.34 million litres of dispersant had been sprayed onto oil on the sea surface .
At least a further 1.52 million litres had been pumped into the oil gushing from the stricken well some 1500 metres below sea level .
The use of such large volumes at depth is unprecedented , and marine biologists are concerned about possible toxicity to organisms , including shrimp and fish larvae .
BP vs EPA
So far BP has used a dispersant called Corexit EC9500A made by Nalco Energy Services of Sugar Land , Texas .
But on 20 May , the EPA ordered BP to find a less toxic alternative .
The company quickly responded , stating that only five dispersants met the EPA ’s requirements .
Only one , called Sea Brat # 4 , made by Alabaster of Pasadena , Texas , was stockpiled by BP .
This contained a chemical that would degrade into nonylphenol ; this is a hormone disrupter likely to harm the reproductive systems of marine organisms .
“ BP continues to believe that Corexit EC9500A remains the best alternative , ” the company concluded .
Since then , there has been an uneasy stand - off , with the EPA telling BP on 26 May to stop surface spraying , and limit its subsea use of dispersant to a maximum of some 57,000 litres on any given day .
Toxicity tests
However , a close examination of the EPA ’s website reveals that the agency ’s assumptions about dispersant toxicity are based on unreliable data .
When it demanded that BP find less toxic dispersants , the EPA referred to a table summarising experiments in which a fish called Menidia beryllina and Mysidopsis bahia shrimp were exposed to a mixture of dispersant and diesel fuel oil in a ratio of 1:10 .
These are standard experiments that must be submitted for inclusion on the EPA ’s National Contingency Plan Product Schedule , which lists products authorised for use on an oil spill .
They determine the concentrations in parts per million ( ppm ) required to kill half of the animals in a given time .
But they are only part of a series of tests that are required by the EPA : the dispersant must also be tested alone , the fuel oil must be tested alone , and finally the lab must run controls testing a “ reference toxicant ” known as dodecyl sodium sulphate ( DSS ) .
Looking across all the listed dispersants , test results for the fuel oil alone are highly variable , with the concentrations required to kill half of the fish varying from 5.95 to 201.8 ppm .
This could indicate that some of the tested oil samples had lost their most toxic volatile components .
This is a major problem .
The tests reveal varying toxicity for the different dispersant - oil mixes .
But given the significant differences between results for samples of oil alone , it becomes very difficult to compare the results for the mixes .
“ It ’s absurd , ” says Joannie Docter , president of GlobeMark Resources in Atlanta , Georgia , which makes a dispersant called JD - 2000 .
Incomplete data
The DSS control experiments pose even bigger problems , says Mitchelmore .
The concentrations of DSS required to kill half of the fish , for example , vary from 1.14 ppm for the tests submitted for Sea Brat # 4 , to 159.6 ppm for the controls submitted for Nokomis 3 - F4 , made by Mar - Len Supply of Hayward , California .
Presumably , this huge variation reflects inconsistencies in the testing procedures used by the labs hired by manufacturers to run the tests .
If so , it throws the EPA ’s conclusions about the products ’ relative toxicities into serious doubt .
Docter has complained to the EPA about its reliance on “ incomplete and misleading ” data ; Nalco has similarly drawn the agency ’s attention to the huge variability in the results supplied by different dispersant manufacturers .
“ They acknowledged that there are some shortcomings , ” says David Horsup , vice - president for research and development with Nalco Energy Services .
Mitchelmore argues that the EPA should also run tests on the growth and reproduction of shrimp and fish , to judge the dispersants ’ longer - term effects .
Those tests are not yet being run .
The EPA says it has commissioned a single laboratory to retest all the authorised dispersants , running the standard tests but using Louisiana crude rather than fuel oil .
Establishing uniform conditions and ensuring the animals are all of the same age takes time , the agency told New Scientist .
“ These tests take more than a few days to run . ”
The Linux - based MeeGo mobile platform made a strong showing at the Computex conference this year in Taipei .
The platform is attracting some interest from hardware makers and mobile Linux software vendors .
When we reviewed the MeeGo 1.0 netbook environment last week , we noted that the official MeeGo system image does not supply a complete Linux distribution .
It will be up to downstream Linux distributors and hardware vendors to handle hardware drivers , codecs , and other important bits that are needed to make the operating system practical to use on real hardware .
At the time , we expressed our hope for an openSUSE - based MeeGo build from Novell so that users would have an end - to - end MeeGo platform .
Fortunately , it looks like Novell is getting ready to deliver exactly that .
In a statement this week , the software vendor announced plans to release its own SUSE MeeGo operating system .
The company says that it is already working closely with some OEMs and expects to see SUSE MeeGo ship preinstalled on devices over the next year .
" Novell is passionate about providing users with a better computing experience and MeeGo will deliver on that promise , " said Guy Lunardi , Novell 's director of client preloads , in a statement .
" Our experience as the leading commercial provider of desktop Linux environments — from thin clients , to workstations , through netbooks , notebooks and desktop devices — puts us in a great position to deliver SUSE MeeGo to a broad base of original equipment and device manufacturers . "
Novell 's commitment to MeeGo is unsurprising because the company played a major role in developing the MeeGo netbook environment alongside Intel .
Novell is n't the only Linux vendor that is getting in on the MeeGo action , however .
Linpus , the company behind the custom Fedora - based operating system that shipped on the Acer Aspire One , is also planning to deliver a MeeGo version of its Linpus Lite netbook platform .
Linpus says that its own MeeGo version will have extra features , like enhanced social networking support , improved power management , and interoperability with Windows on dual - boot computers .
Other Linux distributors who are planning to offer their own MeeGo versions include Mandriva and instant - on Linux vendor DeviceVM .
It appears as though many of the original Moblin backers are committing to MeeGo , though there are some exceptions .
Canonical , which used to have its own Ubuntu Moblin Remix , is n't on the roster and is backing its own innovative Unity environment instead .
Hardware and carriers
Intel revealed a MeeGo tablet prototype that was developed in collaboration with Quanta , a major Taiwanese OEM .
The 10 - inch prototype has an Atom processor and runs a variant of the MeeGo netbook user experience that was customized for the tablet form factor .
Products based on the prototype are said to be coming next year .
Engadget scored some hands - on time with the prototype and found it impressive .
Several hardware vendors , including Asus and Acer , have announced plans to release MeeGo netbooks .
Acer has n't given an expected launch date , but Asus says it 's on track for bringing some MeeGo products to market in 2011 .
Asus has also committed to ship Intel 's AppUp Center , a cross- platform software store for both Windows and MeeGo .
The store is currently in beta .
Several European network operators have pledged support for MeeGo during Computex .
Telefonica plans to use the platform across a wide range of devices , including set - top boxes and mobile phones .
Telecom Italia and Orange are also on board .
If the buzz emanating from Computex is any indication , it seems like MeeGo is going to become a major force in the mobile Linux market as devices start to arrive next year .
Between MeeGo , Ubuntu Unity , and Chrome OS , hardware vendors will have a very rich assortment of mobile Linux platforms to choose from for their netbooks and tablets next year .
It seems like this should be one of the easiest things to understand in CSS .
If you want a block - level element to fill any remaining space inside of its parent , then it ’s simple — just add width : 100 % in your CSS declaration for that element , and your problem is solved .
Not so fast .
It ’s not quite that easy .
I ’m sure CSS developers of all skill levels have attempted something similar to what I ’ve just described , with bizarre results ultimately leading to head scratching and shruggingly resorting to experimenting with absolute widths until we find just the right fit .
This is just one of those things in CSS that seems easy to understand ( and really , it should be ) , but it ’s sometimes not — because of the way that percentages work in CSS .
Use box -sizing : border - box
This was originally an older post that did n’t take into consideration possible use of the border - box property .
If you add the following at the top of your CSS file , you should be able to avoid many of the problems inherent in using 100 % width on your elements :
* { box -sizing : border - box ; }
This ensures padding is factored into the width of your elements .
Of course , not all projects use this and this does n’t fix the fact that margins can affect the position of an inner element .
But in most cases , I strongly recommend you use padding inside a box , rather than margins , to ensure you do n’t have this problem .
Blocks Do n’t Need 100 % Width
When we understand the difference between block - level elements and inline elements , we ’ll know that a block element ( such as a < div > , < p > , or < ul > , to name a few ) will , by default expand to fit the width of its containing , or parent , element ( minus any margins it has or padding its parent has ) .
Most CSS developers understand this concept pretty well , but I thought it would be useful to point it out here as an introduction to explaining how percentages work when used on the width property .
What width : 100 % Really Means
When you give an element a width of 100 % in CSS , you ’re basically saying “ Make this element ’s content area exactly equal to the explicit width of its parent — but only if its parent has an explicit width . ”
So , if you have a parent container that ’s 400 px wide , a child element given a width of 100 % will also be 400 px wide , and will still be subject to margins , paddings , and borders — on top of the 100 % width setting .
The image below attempts to illustrate this :
And of course , the exact same rule would apply to any percentage value .
The content area will be the percentage of the parent ’s explicitly - set width setting .
NOTE ADDED :
The width of the child ’s content area will equal the width of the parent ’s content area , but will not move outside the parent unless its own padding or margins are affecting it .
Thanks to the comment by Fabio Brendolin for clarifying this .
Should it Ever Be Used ?
In many cases , applying width : 100 % to a block level element is either unnecessary or will bring undesirable results .
If you ’re using padding on the inner element and you use box - sizing : border - box , then you ’ll be safe .
One case where you might use width : 100 % is when the element is inheriting a set width value that you want to override .
But even in this case , a better option would be to use “ width : auto ” , which is the default for block elements .
The other instance where this is necessary is when using flexbox , which sometimes requires that an element be set to 100 % width in order to take up a full line and override flexbox ’s natural manner of spacing elements evenly on a single line .
But this depends on what layout you ’re trying to achieve .
Height Works the Same Way ( in All Browsers ! )
And this little lesson provides a reminder of one of the frustrating things about CSS layouts — that you ca n’t give an element a height that fills its parent , unless the parent is given ( you guessed it ) an explicit height setting .
The only difference is that in this case “ auto ” will not work , but instead “ height : 100 % ” is required .
And the great part is that all browsers ( even IE6 and IE7 ) use percentage height exactly the same ( IE bugs excluded ) , so as long as you explicitly set a height on the parent , the child element will fill the height to 100 % as expected .
What do you think ?
Have you ever misinterpreted percentage widths , and abandoned using them because they did n’t work as you expected ?
I know I ’ve done this , and it took me quite some time to get it right and understand them better .
It could be the world 's largest elevator .
Measuring about the size of my living room , an office in Osaka , Japan , has installed five of Mitsubishi Electric 's largest elevators — capable of squeezing in 80 people each .

It measures 3.4 m wide , 2.8 m long and 2.6 m high , and can take 5,250kg of weight — an average of 65 kgs per person .
If all five elevators were in operation at once , with full capacity , they could carry 400 people up the 41 floors of the Umeda Hankyu Building .
I do n't wish to be gruesome , but I sure do hope Mitsubishi has adequately secured the suspension of those lifts .

There is good news and bad news surrounding the Penguins ’ injury situation heading into Thursday night ’s Game 4 against the Canadiens at Bell Centre .
“ I always want to play .
Whether or not I do , we will see how it goes . ”
Jordan Staal
Going with the good news first , Selke Trophy finalist Jordan Staal , who has been out of the lineup since undergoing a procedure to repair a lacerated tendon in his foot following Game 1 , was called a “ game - time decision ” for Game 4 by head coach Dan Byslma after Staal took part in the morning skate with his teammates , the second straight day he has fully participated in practice “ We saw him out there and he was comfortable skating around and in some battle situations , ” Bylsma said .
“ We will see tonight .
” Now onto the bad news , it appears that veteran winger Bill Guerin will miss his second consecutive contest with an undisclosed injury despite also taking part in the morning skate on Thursday .
“ It was a surprise to get him out on the ice ( Thursday ) , ” Bylsma said .
“ He looked good ; he did n’t look a day over 39 .
It was good to have him back out there .
He is day - to - day but not probable for ( Game 4 ) .
” Finally , forward Mike Rupp , who did not skate on Thursday morning , is likely to miss Game 4 .
“ I will not change my policy but he is not dealing with a hockey injury , ” Bylsma said .
“ It is undisclosed but I do n’t expect him ( Thursday ) .
It is still a possibility .
” While Guerin ’s and Rupp ’s absences would be huge losses in terms of the physical and forechecking presence each provides , possibly getting Staal back into action could offset missing two veteran leaders .
Staal suiting up less than a week after undergoing surgery might not equal Willis Reed ’s dramatic entrance onto the court at Madison Square Garden for Game 7 of the 1970 National Basketball Association Finals , but it ’s still impressive nonetheless .
Speaking to reporters in the locker room at Bell Centre on Thursday , Staal gave a thumbs up when asked how he felt after skating with his teammates for the second straight day .
“ I felt good , ” Staal said .
“ I felt more confident and stronger out there this morning .
” Despite offering a positive progress report on his foot , neither Staal nor Bylsma was willing to guarantee that Staal would be in the lineup for Game 4 .
“ I do n’t know , ” Staal said .
“ It ’s tough to say right now .
We ’ll see how it goes .
Again , I ’m feeling really good out there and really comfortable .
” “ With his situation , talking to the doctors and talking to Jordan , it is about him being comfortable in the boot , ” Byslma said .
“ There is no danger in regards to the procedure that he had .
It is just a matter of getting the boot and being comfortable and able to push off .
” Not surprisingly since it was just last Friday when Staal suffered the injury , he said that there is still swelling and soreness he must deal with both on and off the ice .
He credited head athletic trainer Chris Stewart and the entire training staff for helping get him well enough to possibly return .
“ Every morning it is a little sore , ” Staal said .
“ All throughout the night it is going to swell up a little bit .
The trainers did a good job of loosening it up and making it feel pretty good .
” Staal ’s availability for Game 4 will be a group decision that will include , among others , Staal and Byslma .
“ It ’s obviously up to the coaches , ” Staal said .
“ It ’s their decision whether I am in or not .
I ’m going to give my two cents to them and see how they take it .
” Staal was n’t willing to come clean with what his two cents will be , but he did offer up a hint : “ I always want to play .
Whether or not I do , we will see how it goes .
” Upon Staal ’s return , Bylsma suggested that his ice time would be cut back a bit at first from the 19:18 minutes per game he had been averaging prior to the injury as Staal builds his way back to game shape .
“ When and if he is able to play , we would probably see a situation where we do n’t put him back directly into a situation where he is playing 20 minutes a night .
We ’ll have to wait and see how that goes .
When news of Staal ’s injury hit the hockey world shortly after Game 1 on April 30 , many were fearing the worst and expecting the 21 - year - old Thunder Bay , Ontario native to miss at least the remainder of the series , if not the entire duration of the postseason .
Bylsma quickly discounted that notion , labeling the center as day - to - day , which caused more than a few snickers at Southpointe that day .
But true to form , Staal , who had appeared in 358 consecutive contests including the postseason prior to sitting out Game 2 , made his coach look like a genius when he hit the ice briefly in his warmup suit for five minutes on Tuesday .
Staal then put on all his equipment for the Penguins ’ optional practice Wednesday .
Now , days ahead of when he was expected to return , and despite being far from 100 percent , Staal stands a chance of dressing for the Penguins in Thursday night ’s crucial Game 4 as Pittsburgh hopes to take a commanding 3 - 1 lead in the series .
“ Nobody really knows when they are 100 percent well enough to get back into the lineup , ” Staal said .
“ It ca n’t really get worse so we will see how it goes . ”
Playboy Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono :
Published in January 1981 issue
Interviewed by David Sheff , September 1980
Article © 1981 Playboy Press
Introduction / Page 1 / Page 2 / Page 3
(... continued ) PLAYBOY : " What do you say to those who insist that all rock since the Beatles has been the Beatles redone ? "
LENNON : " All music is rehash .
There are only a few notes .
Just variations on a theme .
Try to tell the kids in the Seventies who were screaming to the Bee Gees that their music was just the Beatles redone .
There is nothing wrong with the Bee Gees .
They do a damn good job .
There was nothing else going on then . "
PLAYBOY : " Was n't alot of the Beatles ' music at least more intelligent ? "
LENNON : " The Beatles were more intellectual , so they appealed on that level , too .
But the basic appeal of the Beatles was not their intelligence .
It was their music .
It was only after some guy in the ' London Times ' said there were Aeolian cadences in ' It Wo n't Be Long ' that the middle classes started listening to it ... because somebody put a tag on it . "
PLAYBOY : " Did you put Aeolian cadences in ' It Wo n't Be Long ? ' "
LENNON : " To this day , I do n't have any idea what they are .
They sound like exotic birds . "
PLAYBOY : " How did you react to the misinterpretations of your songs ? "
LENNON : " For instance ? "
PLAYBOY : " The most obvious is the ' Paul is dead ' fiasco .
You already explained the line in ' Glass Onion . '
What about the line in ' I am the Walrus ' ... ( correction : Strawberry Fields Forever ) ...' I buried Paul ' ? "
LENNON : " I said ' Cranberry sauce . '
That 's all I said .
Some people like ping - pong , other people like digging over graves .
Some people will do anything rather than be here now . "
PLAYBOY : " What about the chant at the end of the song : Smoke pot , smoke pot , everybody smoke pot ' ? "
LENNON : " No , no , no .
I had this whole choir saying , ' Everybody 's got one , everybody 's got one . '
But when you get 30 people , male and female , on top of 30 cellos and on top of the Beatles ' rock 'n roll rhythm section , you can't hear what they 're saying . "
PLAYBOY : " What does ' everybody got ' ? "
LENNON : " Anything .
You name it .
One penis , one vagina , one asshole -- you name it . "
PLAYBOY : " Did it trouble you when the interpretations of your songs were destructive , such as when Charles Manson claimed that your lyrics were messages to him ? "
LENNON : " No .
It has nothing to do with me .
It 's like that guy , Son of Sam , who was having these talks with the dog .
Manson was just an extreme version of the people who came up with the ' Paul is dead ' thing or who figured out that the initials to ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds ' were LSD and concluded I was writing about acid . "
PLAYBOY : " Where did ' Lucy in the Sky ' come from ? "
LENNON : " My son Julian came in one day with a picture he painted about a school friend of his named Lucy .
He had sketched in some stars in the sky and called it ' Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds , ' Simple . "
PLAYBOY : " The other images in the song were n't drug - inspired ? "
LENNON : " The images were from ' Alice in Wonderland . '
It was Alice in the boat .
She is buying an egg and it turns into Humpty Dumpty .
The woman serving in the shop turns into a sheep and the next minute they are rowing in a rowing boat somewhere and I was visualizing that .
There was also the image of the female who would someday come save me ... a ' girl with kaleidoscope eyes ' who would come out of the sky .
It turned out to be Yoko , though I had n't met Yoko yet .
So maybe it should be ' Yoko in the Sky with Diamonds . ' "
PLAYBOY : " Do you have any interest in the pop historians analyzing the Beatles as a cultural phenomenon ? "
LENNON : " It 's all equally irrelevant .
Mine is to do and other people 's is to record , I suppose .
Does it matter how many drugs were in Elvis ' body ?
I mean , Brian Epstein 's sex life will make a nice ' Hollywood Babylon ' someday , but it is irrelevant . "
PLAYBOY : " What started the rumors about you and Epstein ? " LENNON : " I went on holiday to Spain with Brian ... which started all the rumors that he and I were having a love affair .
Well , it was almost a love affair , but not quite .
It was never consummated .
But we did have a pretty intense relationship .
And it was my first experience with someone I knew was a homosexual .
He admitted it to me .
We had this holiday together because Cyn was pregnant and we left her with the baby and went to Spain .
Lots of funny stories , you know .
We used to sit in cafs and Brian would look at all the boys and I would ask , ' Do you like that one ?
Do you like this one ? '
It was just the combination of our closeness and the trip that started the rumors . "
PLAYBOY : " It 's interesting to hear you talk about your old songs such as ' Lucy in the Sky ' and ' Glass Onion . '
Will you give some brief thoughts on some of our favorites ? "
LENNON : " Right . "
PLAYBOY : " Let 's start with ' In My Life . ' "
LENNON : " It was the first song I wrote that was consciously about my life .
( sings )
' There are places I 'll remember / all my life though some have changed ...'
Before , we were just writing songs a la Everly Brothers , Buddy Holly -- pop songs with no more thought to them than that .
The words were almost irrelevant .
' In My Life ' started out as a bus journey from my house at 250 Menlove Avenue to town , mentioning all the places I could recall .
I wrote it all down and it was boring .
So I forgot about it and laid back and these lyrics started coming to me about friends and lovers of the past .
Paul helped with the middle - eight . "
PLAYBOY : " ' Yesterday . ' "
LENNON : " Well , we all know about ' Yesterday . '
I have had so much accolade for ' Yesterday . '
That is Paul 's song , of course , and Paul 's baby .
Well done .
Beautiful -- and I never wished I had written it . "
PLAYBOY : " ' With a Little Help from My Friends . ' "
LENNON : " This is Paul , with a little help from me .
' What do you see when you turn out the light / I can't tell you , but I know it 's mine ...' is mine . "
PLAYBOY : " ' I am the Walrus . ' "
LENNON : " The first line was written on one acid trip one weekend .
The second line was written on the next acid trip the next weekend , and it was filled in after I met Yoko .
Part of it was putting down Hare Krishna .
All these people were going on about Hare Krishna , Allen Ginsberg in particular .
The reference to ' Element 'ry penguin ' is the elementary , naive attitude of going around chanting , ' Hare Krishna , ' or putting all your faith in any one idol .
I was writing obscurely , a la Dylan , in those days . "
PLAYBOY : " The song is very complicated , musically . "
LENNON : " It actually was fantastic in stereo , but you never hear it all .
There was too much to get on .
It was too messy a mix .
One track was live BBC Radio -- Shakespeare or something -- I just fed in whatever lines came in . "
PLAYBOY : " What about the walrus itself ? " LENNON : " It 's from ' The Walrus and the Carpenter . '
' Alice in Wonderland . '
To me , it was a beautiful poem .
It never dawned on me that Lewis Carroll was commenting on the capitalist and social system .
I never went into that bit about what he really meant , like people are doing with the Beatles ' work .
Later , I went back and looked at it and realized that the walrus was the bad guy in the story and the carpenter was the good guy .
I thought ,
Oh , shit , I picked the wrong guy .
I should have said , ' I am the carpenter . '
But that would n't have been the same , would it ? ( singing ) ' I am the carpenter .... ' "
PLAYBOY : " How about ' She Came in Through the Bathroom Window ' ? "
LENNON : " That was written by Paul when we were in New York forming Apple , and he first met Linda .
Maybe she 's the one who came in the window .
She must have .
I do n't know .
Somebody came in the window . "
PLAYBOY : " ' I Feel Fine . ' "
LENNON : " That 's me , including the guitar lick with the first feedback ever recorded .
I defy anybody to find an earlier record ... unless it is some old blues record from the Twenties ... with feedback on it . "
PLAYBOY : " ' When I 'm Sixty - Four . ' "
LENNON : " Paul completely .
I would never even dream of writing a song like that .
There are some areas I never think about and that is one of them . "
PLAYBOY : " 'A Day in the Life . ' "
LENNON : " Just as it sounds : I was reading the paper one day and I noticed two stories .
One was the Guinness heir who killed himself in a car .
That was the main headline story .
He died in London in a car crash .
On the next page was a story about 4000 holes in Blackburn , Lancashire .
In the streets , that is .
They were going to fill them all .
Paul 's contribution was the beautiful little lick in the song ' I 'd love to turn you on . '
I had the bulk of the song and the words , but he contributed this little lick floating around in his head that he could n't use for anything .
I thought it was a damn good piece of work . "
PLAYBOY : " May we continue with some of the ones that seem more personal and see what reminiscences they inspire ? "
LENNON : " Reminisce away . "
PLAYBOY : " For no reason whatsoever , let 's start with ' I Wanna Be Your Man . ' "
LENNON : " Paul and I finished that one off for the Stones .
We were taken down by Brian to meet them at the club where they were playing in Richmond .
They wanted a song and we went to see what kind of stuff they did .
Paul had this bit of a song and we played it roughly for them and they said , ' Yeah , OK , that 's our style . '
But it was only really a lick , so Paul and I went off in the corner of the room and finished the song off while they were all sitting there , talking .
We came back and Mick and Keith said , ' Jesus , look at that .
They just went over there and wrote it . '
You know , right in front of their eyes .
We gave it to them .
It was a throwaway .
Ringo sang it for us and the Stones did their version .
It shows how much importance we put on them .
We were n't going to give them anything great , right ?
That was the Stones ' first record .
Anyway , Mick and Keith said , ' If they can write a song so easily , we should try it . '
They say it inspired them to start writing together . "
PLAYBOY : " How about ' Strawberry Fields Forever ' ? "
LENNON : " Strawberry Fields is a real place .
After I stopped living at Penny Lane , I moved in with my auntie who lived in the suburbs in a nice semidetached place with a small garden and doctors and lawyers and that ilk living around ... not the poor slummy kind of image that was projected in all the Beatles stories .
In the class system , it was about half a class higher than Paul , George and Ringo , who lived in government - subsidized housing .
We owned our house and had a garden .
They did n't have anything like that .
Near that home was Strawberry Fields , a house near a boys ' reformatory where I used to go to garden parties as a kid with my friends Nigel and Pete .
We would go there and hang out and sell lemonade bottles for a penny .
We always had fun at Strawberry Fields .
So that 's where I got the name .
But I used it as an image .
Strawberry Fields forever . "
PLAYBOY : " And the lyrics , for instance : ' Living is easy ... ' "
LENNON : ( singing ) " '... with eyes closed .
Misunderstanding all you see . '
It still goes , does n't it ?
Are n't I saying exactly the same thing now ?
The awareness apparently trying to be expressed is -- let 's say in one way I was always hip .
I was hip in kindergarten .
I was different from the others .
I was different all my life .
The second verse goes , ' No one I think is in my tree . '
Well , I was too shy and self - doubting .
Nobody seems to be as hip as me is what I was saying .
Therefore , I must be crazy or a genius -- ' I mean it must be high or low , ' the next line .
There was something wrong with me , I thought , because I seemed to see things other people did n't see .
I thought I was crazy or an egomaniac for claiming to see things other people did n't see .
As a child , I would say , ' But this is going on ! ' and everybody would look at me as if I was crazy .
I always was so psychic or intuitive or poetic or whatever you want to call it , that I was always seeing things in a hallucinatory way .
It was scary as a child , because there was nobody to relate to .
Neither my auntie nor my friends nor anybody could ever see what I did .
It was very , very scary and the only contact I had was reading about an Oscar Wilde or a Dylan Thomas or a Vincent van Gogh -- all those books that my auntie had that talked about their suffering because of their visions .
Because of what they saw , they were tortured by society for trying to express what they were .
I saw loneliness . "
PLAYBOY : " Were you able to find others to share your visions with ? "
LENNON : " Only dead people in books .
Lewis Carroll , certain paintings .
Surrealism had a great effect on me , because then I realized that my imagery and my mind was n't insanity ; that if it was insane , I belong in an exclusive club that sees the world in those terms .
Surrealism to me is reality .
Psychic vision to me is reality .
Even as a child .
When I looked at myself in the mirror or when I was 12 , 13 , I used to literally trance out into alpha .
I did n't know what it was called then .
I found out years later there is a name for those conditions .
But I would find myself seeing hallucinatory images of my face changing and becoming cosmic and complete .
It caused me to always be a rebel .
This thing gave me a chip on the shoulder ; but , on the other hand , I wanted to be loved and accepted .
Part of me would like to be accepted by all facets of society and not be this loudmouthed lunatic musician .
But I can not be what I am not .
Because of my attitude , all the other boys ' parents , including Paul 's father , would say , ' Keep away from him . '
The parents instinctively recognized what I was , which was a troublemaker , meaning I did not conform and I would influence their kids , which I did .
I did my best to disrupt every friend 's home I had .
Partly , maybe , it was out of envy that I did n't have this so - called home .
But I really did .
I had an auntie and an uncle and a nice suburban home , thank you very much .
Hear this , Auntie .
She was hurt by a remark Paul made recently that the reason I am staying home with Sean now is because I never had a family life .
It 's absolute rubbish .
There were five women who were my family .
Five strong , intelligent women .
Five sisters .
One happened to be my mother .
My mother was the youngest .
She just could n't deal with life .
She had a husband who ran away to sea and the war was on and she could n't cope with me , and when I was four and a half , I ended up living with her elder sister .
Now , those women were fantastic .
One day I might do a kind of ' Forsyte Saga ' just about them .
That was my first feminist education .
Anyway , that knowledge and the fact that I was n't with my parents made me see that parents are not gods .
I would infiltrate the other boys ' minds .
Paul 's parents were terrified of me and my influence , simply because I was free from the parents ' strangle hold .
That was the gift I got for not having parents .
I cried a lot about not having them and it was torture , but it also gave me an awareness early .
I was n't an orphan , though .
My mother was alive and lived a 15 - minute walk away from me all my life .
I saw her off and on .
I just did n't live with her . "
PLAYBOY : " Is she alive ? " LENNON : " No , she got killed by an off - duty cop who was drunk after visiting my auntie 's house where I lived .
I was n't there at the time .
She was just at a bus stop .
I was 16 .
That was another big trauma for me .
I lost her twice .
When I was five and I moved in with my auntie , and then when she physically died .
That made me more bitter ; the chip on my shoulder I had as a youth got really big then .
I was just really re-establishing the relationship with her and she was killed . "
PLAYBOY : " Her name was Julia , was n't it ?
Is she the Julia of your song of that name on ' The White Album ? ' "
LENNON : " The song is for her ... and for Yoko . "
PLAYBOY : " What kind of relationship did you have with your father , who went away to sea ?
Did you ever see him again ? "
LENNON : " I never saw him again until I made a lot of money and he came back . "
PLAYBOY : " How old were you ? " LENNON : " 24 or 25 .
I opened the ' Daily Express ' and there he was , washing dishes in a small hotel or something very near where I was living in the Stockbroker belt outside London .
He had been writing to me to try to get in contact .
I did n't want to see him .
I was too upset about what he'd done to me and to my mother and that he would turn up when I was rich and famous and not bother turning up before .
So I was n't going to see him at all , but he sort of blackmailed me in the press by saying all this about being a poor man washing dishes while I was living in luxury .
I fell for it and saw him and we had some kind of relationship .
He died a few years later of cancer .
But at 65 , he married a secretary who had been working for the Beatles , age 22 , and they had a child , which I thought was hopeful for a man who had lived his life as a drunk and almost a Bowery bum . "
PLAYBOY : " We 'll never listen to ' Strawberry Fields Forever ' the same way again .
What memories are jogged by the song ' Help ' ? "
LENNON : " When ' Help ' came out in ' 65 , I was actually crying out for help .
Most people think it 's just a fast rock 'n roll song .
I did n't realize it at the time ; I just wrote the song because I was commissioned to write it for the movie .
But later , I knew I really was crying out for help .
It was my fat Elvis period .
You see the movie : He -- I -- is very fat , very insecure , and he 's completely lost himself .
And I am singing about when I was so much younger and all the rest , looking back at how easy it was .
Now I may be very positive ... yes , yes ... but I also go through deep depressions where I would like to jump out the window , you know .
It becomes easier to deal with as I get older ; I do n't know whether you learn control or , when you grow up , you calm down a little .
Anyway , I was fat and depressed and I was crying out for help .
In those days , when the Beatles were depressed , we had this little chant .
I would yell out , ' Where are we going , fellows ? '
They would say , ' To the top , Johnny , ' in pseudo - American voices .
And I would say , ' Where is that , fellows ? '
And they would say , ' To the toppermost of the poppermost . '
It was some dumb expression from a cheap movie , a la ' Blackboard Jungle , ' about Liverpool .
Johnny was the leader of the gang . "
PLAYBOY : " What were you depressed about during the ' Help ' period ? "
LENNON : " The Beatles thing had just gone beyond comprehension .
We were smoking marijuana for breakfast .
We were well into marijuana and nobody could communicate with us , because we were just all glazed eyes , giggling all the time .
In our own world .
That was the song , ' Help . '
I think everything that comes out of a song -- even Paul 's songs now , which are apparently about nothing -- shows something about yourself . "
PLAYBOY : " Was ' I 'm a Loser ' a similarly personal statement ? "
LENNON : " Part of me suspects that I 'm a loser and the other part of me thinks I'm God Almighty . "
PLAYBOY : " How about ' Cold Turkey ? ' "
LENNON : " The song is self - explanatory .
The song got banned , even though it 's antidrug .
They 're so stupid about drugs , you know .
They 're not looking at the cause of the drug problem :
Why do people take drugs ?
To escape from what ?
Is life so terrible ?
Are we living in such a terrible situation that we can't do anything without reinforcement of alcohol , tobacco ?
Aspirins , sleeping pills , uppers , downers , never mind the heroin and cocaine -- they 're just the outer fringes of Librium and speed . "
PLAYBOY : " Do you use any drugs now ? " LENNON : " Not really .
If somebody gives me a joint , I might smoke it , but I do n't go after it . "
PLAYBOY : " Cocaine ? " LENNON : " I 've had cocaine , but I do n't like it .
The Beatles had lots of it in their day , but it 's a dumb drug , because you have to have another one 20 minutes later .
Your whole concentration goes on getting the next fix .
Really , I find caffeine is easier to deal with . "
PLAYBOY : " Acid ? " LENNON : " Not in years .
A little mushroom or peyote is not beyond my scope , you know , maybe twice a year or something .
You do n't hear about it anymore , but people are still visiting the cosmos .
We must always remember to thank the CIA and the Army for LSD .
That 's what people forget .
Everything is the opposite of what it is , is n't it , Harry ?
So get out the bottle , boy ... and relax .
They invented LSD to control people and what they did was give us freedom .
Sometimes it works in mysterious ways its wonders to perform .
If you look in the Government reports on acid , the ones who jumped out the window or killed themselves because of it , I think even with Art Linkletter 's daughter , it happened to her years later .
So , let 's face it , she was n't really on acid when she jumped out the window .
And I 've never met anybody who 's had a flashback on acid .
I 've never had a flashback in my life and I took millions of trips in the Sixties . "
PLAYBOY : " What does your diet include besides sashimi and sushi , Hershey bars and cappuccinos ? "
LENNON : " We 're mostly macrobiotic , but sometimes I take the family out for a pizza . "
ONO : " Intuition tells you what to eat .
It 's dangerous to try to unify things .
Everybody has different needs .
We went through vegetarianism and macrobiotic , but now , because we 're in the studio , we do eat some junk food .
We 're trying to stick to macrobiotic : fish and rice , whole grains .
You balance foods and eat foods indigenous to the area .
Corn is the grain from this area . "
PLAYBOY : " And you both smoke up a storm . "
LENNON : " Macrobiotic people do n't believe in the big C .
Whether you take that as a rationalization or not , macrobiotics do n't believe that smoking is bad for you .
Of course , if we die , we 're wrong . "
PLAYBOY : " Let 's go back to jogging your memory with songs .
How about Paul 's song ' Hey Jude ' ? "
LENNON : " He said it was written about Julian .
He knew I was splitting with Cyn and leaving Julian then .
He was driving to see Julian to say hello .
He had been like an uncle .
And he came up with ' Hey Jude . '
But I always heard it as a song to me .
Now I 'm sounding like one of those fans reading things into it ...
Think about it : Yoko had just come into the picture .
He is saying .
' Hey , Jude ' -- ' Hey , John . '
Subconsciously , he was saying , ' Go ahead , leave me . '
On a conscious level , he did n't want me to go ahead .
The angel in him was saying , ' Bless you . '
The devil in him did n't like it at all , because he did n't want to lose his partner . "
PLAYBOY : " What about ' Because ' ? " LENNON : " I was lying on the sofa in our house , listening to Yoko play Beethoven 's ' Moonlight Sonata ' on the piano .
Suddenly , I said , ' Can you play those chords backward ? '
She did , and I wrote ' Because ' around them .
The song sounds like ' Moonlight Sonata , ' too .
The lyrics are clear , no bullshit , no imagery , no obscure references . "
PLAYBOY : " ' Give Peace a Chance . ' "
LENNON : " All we were saying was give peace a chance . "
PLAYBOY : " Was it really a Lennon - McCartney composition ? "
LENNON : " No , I do n't even know why his name was on it .
It 's there because I kind of felt guilty because I 'd made the separate single -- the first -- and I was really breaking away from the Beatles . "
PLAYBOY : Why were the compositions you and Paul did separately attributed to Lennon - McCartney ? "
LENNON : " Paul and I made a deal when we were 15 .
There was never a legal deal between us , just a deal we made when we decided to write together that we put both our names on it , no matter what . "
PLAYBOY : " How about ' Do You Want to Know a Secret ? ' "
LENNON : " The idea came from this thing my mother used to sing to me when I was one or two years old , when she was still living with me .
It was from a Disney movie : ' Do you want to know a secret ?
Promise not to tell ?
You are standing by a wishing well . '
So , with that in my head , I wrote the song and just gave it to George to sing .
I thought it would be a good vehicle for him , because it had only three notes and he was n't the best singer in the world .
He has improved a lot since then ; but in those days , his ability was very poor .
I gave it to him just to give him a piece of the action .
That 's another reason why I was hurt by his book .
I even went to the trouble of making sure he got the B side of a Beatles single , because he had n't had a B side of one until ' Do You Want to Know a Secret . '
' Something ' was the first time he ever got an A side , because Paul and I always wrote both sides .
That was n't because we were keeping him out but simply because his material was not up to scratch .
I made sure he got the B side of ' Something , ' too , so he got the cash .
Those little things he does n't remember .
I always felt bad that George and Ringo did n't get a piece of the publishing .
When the opportunity came to give them five percent each of Maclen , it was because of me they got it .
It was not because of Klein and not because of Paul but because of me .
When I said they should get it , Paul could n't say no .
I do n't get a piece of any of George 's songs or Ringo's .
I never asked for anything for the contributions I made to George 's songs like ' Taxman . '
Not even the recognition .
And that is why I might have sounded resentful about George and Ringo , because it was after all those things that the attitude of ' John has forsaken us ' and ' John is tricking us ' came out ... which is not true . "
PLAYBOY : " ' Happiness Is a Warm Gun . ' "
LENNON : " No , it 's not about heroin .
A gun magazine was sitting there with a smoking gun on the cover and an article that I never read inside called ' Happiness Is a Warm Gun . '
I took it right from there .
I took it as the terrible idea of just having shot some animal . "
PLAYBOY : " What about the sexual puns : ' When you feel my finger on your trigger ' ? "
LENNON : " Well , it was at the beginning of my relationship with Yoko and I was very sexually oriented then .
When we were n't in the studio , we were in bed . "
PLAYBOY : " What was the allusion to ' Mother Superior jumps the gun ' ? "
LENNON : " I call Yoko Mother or Madam just in an offhand way .
The rest does n't mean anything .
It 's just images of her . "
PLAYBOY : " ' Across the Universe . ' "
LENNON : " The Beatles did n't make a good record of ' Across the Universe . '
I think subconsciously we ...
I thought Paul subconsciously tried to destroy my great songs .
We would play experimental games with my great pieces , like ' Strawberry Fields , ' which I always felt was badly recorded .
It worked , but it was n't what it could have been .
I allowed it , though .
We would spend hours doing little , detailed cleaning up on Paul 's songs , but when it came to mine ... especially a great song like ' Strawberry Fields ' or ' Across the Universe ' ... somehow an atmosphere of looseness and experimentation would come up . "
PLAYBOY : " Sabotage ? " LENNON : " Subconscious sabotage .
I was too hurt ...
Paul will deny it , because he has a bland face and will say this does n't exist .
This is the kind of thing I 'm talking about where I was always seeing what was going on and began to think , Well , maybe I 'm paranoid .
But it is not paranoid .
It is the absolute truth .
The same thing happened to ' Across the Universe . '
The song was never done properly .
The words stand , luckily . "
PLAYBOY : " ' Getting Better . ' "
LENNON : " It is a diary form of writing .
All that ' I used to be cruel to my woman , I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved ' was me .
I used to be cruel to my woman , and physically ... any woman .
I was a hitter .
I could n't express myself and I hit .
I fought men and I hit women .
That is why I am always on about peace , you see .
It is the most violent people who go for love and peace .
Everything 's the opposite .
But I sincerely believe in love and peace .
I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence .
I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster . "
PLAYBOY : " ' Revolution . ' "
LENNON : " We recorded the song twice .
The Beatles were getting really tense with one another .
I did the slow version and I wanted it out as a single : as a statement of the Beatles ' position on Vietnam and the Beatles ' position on revolution .
For years , on the Beatle tours , Epstein had stopped us from saying anything about Vietnam or the war .
And he would n't allow questions about it .
But on one tour , I said , ' I am going to answer about the war .
We can't ignore it . '
I absolutely wanted the Beatles to say something .
The first take of ' Revolution ' ... well , George and Paul were resentful and said it was n't fast enough .
Now , if you go into details of what a hit record is and is n't ... maybe .
But the Beatles could have afforded to put out the slow , understandable version of ' Revolution ' as a single .
Whether it was a gold record or a wooden record .
But because they were so upset about the Yoko period and the fact that I was again becoming as creative and dominating as I had been in the early days , after lying fallow for a couple of years , it upset the apple cart .
I was awake again and they could n't stand it ? "
PLAYBOY : " Was it Yoko 's inspiration ? "
LENNON : " She inspired all this creation in me .
It was n't that she inspired the songs ; she inspired me .
The statement in ' Revolution ' was mine .
The lyrics stand today .
It 's still my feeling about politics .
I want to see the plan .
That is what I used to say to Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin .
Count me out if it is for violence .
Do n't expect me to be on the barricades unless it is with flowers . "
PLAYBOY : " What do you think of Hoffman 's turning himself in ? " LENNON : " Well he got what he wanted .
Which is to be sort of an underground hero for anybody who still worships any manifestation of the underground .
I do n't feel that much about it anymore .
Nixon , Hoffman , it 's the same .
They are all from the same period .
It was kind of surprising to see Abbie on TV , but it was also surprising to see Nixon on TV .
Maybe people get the feeling when they see me or us .
I feel , What are they doing there ?
Is this an old newsreel ? "
PLAYBOY : " On a new album , you close with ' Hard Times Are Over ( For a While ) . '
Why ? "
LENNON : " It 's not a new message : ' Give Peace a Chance ' -- we 're not being unreasonable , just saying , ' Give it a chance . '
With ' Imagine , ' we 're saying , ' Can you imagine a world without countries or religions ? '
It 's the same message over and over .
And it 's positive . "
PLAYBOY : " How does it feel to have people anticipate your new record because they feel you are a prophet of sorts ?
When you returned to the studio to make ' Double Fantasy , ' some of your fans were saying things like , ' Just as Lennon defined the Sixties and the Seventies , he 'll be defining the Eighties . ' "
LENNON : " It 's very sad .
Anyway , we 're not saying anything new .
A ) we have already said it and , B ) 100,000,000 other people have said it , too . "
PLAYBOY : " But your songs do have messages . "
LENNON : " All we are saying is , ' This is what is happening to us . '
We are sending postcards .
I do n't let it become ' I am the awakened ; you are sheep that will be shown the way . '
That is the danger of saying anything , you know . "
PLAYBOY : " Especially for you . "
LENNON : " Listen , there 's nothing wrong with following examples .
We can have figure heads and people we admire , but we do n't need leaders .
' Do n't follow leaders , watch the parking meters . ' "
PLAYBOY : " You 're quoting one of your peers , of sorts .
Is it distressing to you that Dylan is a born - again Christian ? " LENNON : " I do n't like to comment on it .
For whatever reason he 's doing it , it is personal for him and he needs to do it .
But the whole religion business suffers from the ' Onward , Christian Soldiers ' bit .
There 's too much talk about soldiers and marching and converting .
I 'm not pushing Buddhism , because I 'm no more a Buddhist than I am a Christian , but there 's one thing I admire about the religion :
There 's no proselytizing . "
PLAYBOY : " Were you a Dylan fan ? " LENNON : " No , I stopped listening to Dylan with both ears after ' Highway 64 ' [ sic ] and ' Blonde on Blonde , ' and even then it was because George would sit me down and make me listen . "
PLAYBOY : " Like Dylan , were n't you also looking for some kind of leader when you did primal - scream therapy with Arthur Janov ? "
ONO : " I think Janov was a daddy for John .
I think he has this father complex and he 's always searching for a daddy . "
LENNON : " Had , dear .
I had a father complex . "
PLAYBOY : " Would you explain ? " ONO : " I had a daddy , a real daddy , sort of a big and strong father like a Billy Graham , but growing up , I saw his weak side .
I saw the hypocrisy .
So whenever I see something that is supposed to be so big and wonderful , a guru or primal scream , I 'm very cynical . "
LENNON : " She fought with Janov all the time .
He could n't deal with it . "
ONO : " I 'm not searching for the big daddy .
I look for something else in men ... something that is tender and weak and I feel like I want to help . "
LENNON : " And I was the lucky cripple she chose ! " ONO : " I have this mother instinct , or whatever .
But I was not hung up on finding a father , because I had one who disillusioned me .
John never had a chance to get disillusioned about his father , since his father was n't around , so he never thought of him as that big man . "
PLAYBOY : " Do you agree with that assessment , John ? " LENNON : " Alot of us are looking for fathers .
Mine was physically not there .
Most people 's are not there mentally and physically , like always at the office or busy with other things .
So all these leaders , parking meters , are all substitute fathers , whether they be religious or political ...
All this bit about electing a President .
We pick our own daddy out of a dog pound of daddies .
This is the daddy that looks like the daddy in the commercials .
He 's got the nice gray hair and the right teeth and the parting 's on the right side .
OK ?
This is the daddy we choose .
The dog pound of daddies , which is the political arena , gives us a President , then we put him on a platform and start punishing him and screaming at him because Daddy can't do miracles .
Daddy does n't heal us . "
PLAYBOY : " So Janov was a daddy for you .
Who else ? "
ONO : " Before , there was Maharishi . "
LENNON : " Maharishi was a father figure , Elvis Presley might have been a father figure .
I do n't know .
Robert Mitchum .
Any male image is a father figure .
There 's nothing wrong with it until you give them the right to give you sort of a recipe for your life .
What happens is somebody comes along with a good piece of truth .
Instead of the truth 's being looked at , the person who brought it is looked at .
The messenger is worshiped , instead of the message .
So there would be Christianity , Mohammedanism , Buddhism , Confucianism , Marxism , Maoism -- everything -- it is always about a person and never about what he says . "
ONO : " All the 'isms ' are daddies .
It 's sad that society is structured in such a way that people cannot really open up to each other , and therefore they need a certain theater to go to to cry or something like that . "
LENNON : " Well , you went to est . "
ONO : " Yes , I wanted to check it out . "
LENNON : " We went to Janov for the same reason . "
ONO : " But est people are given a reminder ... "
LENNON : " Yeah , but I would n't go and sit in a room and not pee . "
ONO : " Well , you did in primal scream . "
LENNON : " Oh , but I had you with me . "
ONO : " Anyway , when I went to est , I saw Werner Erhardt , the same thing .
He 's a nice showman and he 's got a nice gig there .
I felt the same thing when we went to Sai Baba in India .
In India , you have to be a guru instead of a pop star .
Guru is the pop star of India and pop star is the guru here . "
LENNON : " But nobody 's perfect , etc. , etc .
Whether it 's Janov or Erhardt or Maharishi or a Beatle .
That does n't take away from their message .
It 's like learning how to swim .
The swimming is fine .
But forget about the teacher .
If the Beatles had a message , it was that .
With the Beatles , the records are the point , not the Beatles as individuals .
You do n't need the package , just as you do n't need the Christian package or the Marxist package to get the message .
People always got the image I was an anti-Christ or antireligion .
I 'm not .
I 'm a most religious fellow .
I was brought up a Christian and I only now understand some of the things that Christ was saying in those parables .
Because people got hooked on the teacher and missed the message . "
PLAYBOY : " And the Beatles taught people how to swim ? "
LENNON : " If the Beatles or the Sixties had a message , it was to learn to swim .
Period .
And once you learn to swim , swim .
The people who are hung up on the Beatles ' and the Sixties ' dream missed the whole point when the Beatles ' and the Sixties ' dream became the point .
Carrying the Beatles ' or the Sixties ' dream around all your life is like carrying the Second World War and Glenn Miller around .
That 's not to say you can't enjoy Glenn Miller or the Beatles , but to live in that dream is the twilight zone .
It 's not living now .
It 's an illusion . "
PLAYBOY : " Yoko , the single you and John released from your album seems to be looking toward the future . "
ONO : " Yes , ' Starting Over ' is a song that makes me feel like crying .
John has talked about the Sixties and how it gave us a taste for freedom ... sexual and otherwise .
It was like an orgy .
Then , after that big come that we had together , men and women somehow lost track of each other and a lot of families and relationships split apart .
I really think that what happened in the Seventies can be compared to what happened under Nazism with Jewish families .
Only the force that split them came from the inside , not from the outside .
We tried to rationalize it as the price we were paying for our freedom .
And John is saying in his song , OK , we had the energy in the Sixties , in the Seventies we separated , but let 's start over in the Eighties .
He 's reaching out to me , the woman .
Reaching out after all that 's happened , over the battlefield of dead families , is more difficult this time around .
On the other side of the record is my song , ' Kiss Kiss Kiss , ' which is the other side of the same question .
There is the sound of a woman coming to a climax on it , and she is crying out to be held , to be touched .
It will be controversial , because people still feel it 's less natural to hear the sounds of a woman 's lovemaking than , say , the sound of a Concorde , killing the atmosphere and polluting nature .
Altogether , both sides are a prayer to change the Eighties . "
PLAYBOY : " What is the Eighties ' dream to you , John ? " LENNON : Well , you make your own dream .
That 's the Beatles ' story , is n't it ?
That 's Yoko 's story .
That 's what I 'm saying now .
Produce your own dream .
If you want to save Peru , go save Peru .
It 's quite possible to do anything , but not to put it on the leaders and the parking meters .
Do n't expect Jimmy Carter or Ronald Reagan or John Lennon or Yoko Ono or Bob Dylan or Jesus Christ to come and do it for you .
You have to do it yourself .
That 's what the great masters and mistresses have been saying ever since time began .
They can point the way , leave signposts and little instructions in various books that are now called holy and worshiped for the cover of the book and not for what it says , but the instructions are all there for all to see , have always been and always will be .
There 's nothing new under the sun .
All the roads lead to Rome .
And people cannot provide it for you .
I can't wake you up .
You can wake you up .
I can't cure you .
You can cure you . "
PLAYBOY : " What is it that keeps people from accepting that message ? "
LENNON : " It 's fear of the unknown .
The unknown is what it is .
And to be frightened of it is what sends everybody scurrying around chasing dreams , illusions , wars , peace , love , hate , all that ... it 's all illusion .
Unknown is what what it is .
Accept that it 's unknown and it 's plain sailing .
Everything is unknown ... then you 're ahead of the game .
That 's what it is .

Posted May 25 , 2010 , at 1:53 p.m. CSTBiomass power has gained new government support in Ireland , with recently announced renewable energy feed - in tariffs that range from 15 cents per kilowatt hour ( kWh ) to 8.5 cents per kWh depending on the technology deployed , as well as a miscanthus pilot demonstration program .
Ireland has provided feed - in tariffs for wind and hydro power since 2006 .
Energy Minister Eamon Ryan introduced the new biomass tariffs May 24 , supporting technologies including anaerobic digestion ( AD ) , combined heat and power ( CHP ) and biomass combustion .
The tariffs are to be indexed and offered on a 15 - year basis and include : AD CHP equal to or less than 500 kW : 15 cents / kWh ; AD CHP greater than 500 kW : 13 cents / kWhAD ( non CHP ) equal to or less than 500 kW : 11 cents / kWh ; AD ( non CHP ) greater than 500 kW : 10 cents / kWhBiomass CHP equal to or less than 1,500 kW : 14cents / kWh ; Biomass CHP greater than 1,500 kW : 12 cents / kWhBiomass combustion ( including existing plants ) using energy crops : 9.5 cents / kWh ; for all other biomass 8.5 cents / kWh .
The legislation limits combustion to 30 percent of the maximum rated capacity cofiring in any plant until 2017 , 40 percent between 2017 and 2019 , and 50 percent thereafter .
The legislation also limits each technology in terms of eligible megawatts - AD is capped at 50 MW ; biomass CHP at 100 MW ; biomass combustion ( including cofiring ) at 160 MW until December 2015 and no limit from January 2016 on .
Ireland 's Department of Communications , Energy and Natural Resources predicts the new prices will allow connection of more than 200 MW of renewable electricity to the national grid .
In late April , the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland launched a miscanthus pilot demonstration program to provide assistance for the deployment of renewable heating systems fueled by miscanthus in commercial / industrial services , public sectors , community organizations and power utilities in the country .
To date , the use of miscanthus as a fuel in Ireland has been minimal , according to the DCENR , due to a number of issues including limited experience internationally with its use as a boiler fuel particularly with peat , a common boiler fuel in the Ireland .
The new program is intended to support the establishment of a number of exemplar boiler sites , likely between five and 15 depending on the mix of size ranges and costs submitted , to provide important information on the supply chain logistics and suitability of miscanthus as a boiler fuel in Ireland , as well as providing a solid basis for creating market confidence .
A budget of � 500,000 ( $ 629,721 ) has been allocated to the program , which will provide a support level of up to 50 percent of a project 's eligible cost .
As the Obama administration enters its second year , I -- and undoubtedly millions of others -- have struggled to develop a shorthand term that captures our emotional unease .
Defining this discomfort is tricky .
I reject nearly the entire Obama agenda , but the term " being opposed " lacks an emotional punch .
Nor do terms like " worried " or " anxious " apply .
I was more worried about America 's future during the Johnson or Carter years , so it 's not that dictionary , either .
Nor , for that matter , is this about backroom odious deal - making and pork , which are endemic in American politics .
After auditioning countless political terms , I finally realized that the Obama administration and its congressional collaborators almost resemble a foreign occupying force , a coterie of politically and culturally non-indigenous leaders whose rule contravenes local values rooted in our national tradition .
It is as if the United States has been occupied by a foreign power , and this transcends policy objections .
It is not about Obama 's birthplace .
It is not about race , either ; millions of white Americans have had black mayors and black governors , and this unease about out - of - synch values never surfaced .
The term I settled on is " alien rule " -- based on outsider values , regardless of policy benefits -- that generates agitation .
This is what bloody anti-colonial strife was all about .
No doubt , millions of Indians and Africans probably grasped that expelling the British guaranteed economic ruin and even worse governance , but at least the mess would be their mess .
Just travel to Afghanistan and witness American military commanders ' efforts to enlist tribal elders with promises of roads , clean water , dental clinics , and all else that America can freely provide .
Many of these elders probably privately prefer abject poverty to foreign occupation since it would be their poverty , run by their people , according to their sensibilities .
This disquiet was a slow realization .
Awareness began with Obama 's odd pre-presidency associations , decades of being oblivious to Rev. Wright 's anti-American ranting , his enduring friendship with the terrorist guy - in - the - neighborhood Bill Ayers , and the Saul Alinsky - flavored anti-capitalist community activism .
Further add a hazy personal background -- an Indonesian childhood , shifting official names , and a paperless - trail climb through elite educational institutions .
None of this disqualified Obama from the presidency ; rather , this background just does n't fit with the conventional political résumé .
It is just the " outsider ? " quality that alarms .
For all the yammering about George W. Bush 's privileged background , his made - in - the - USA persona was absolutely indisputable .
John McCain might be embarrassed about his Naval Academy class rank and iffy combat performance , but there was never any doubt of his authenticity .
Countless conservatives despised Bill Clinton , but nobody ever , ever doubted his good - old - boy American bonafides .
The suspicion that Obama is an outsider , a figure who really does n't " get " America , grew clearer from his initial appointments .
What " native " would appoint Kevin Jennings , a militant gay activist , to oversee school safety ?
Or permit a Marxist rabble - rouser to be a " green jobs czar " ?
How about an Attorney General who began by accusing Americans of cowardice when it comes to discussing race ?
And who can forget Obama 's weird defense of his pal Louis Henry Gates from " racist " Cambridge , Massachusetts cops ?
If the American Revolution had never occurred and the Queen had appointed Obama Royal Governor ( after his distinguished service in Kenya ) , a trusted locally attuned aide would have first whispered in his ear , " Mr. Governor General , here in America , we do not automatically assume that the police were at fault , " and the day would have been saved .
And then there 's the " we are sorry , we 'll never be arrogant again " rhetoric seemingly designed for a future President of the World election campaign .
What made Obama 's Cairo utterances so distressing was how they grated on American cultural sensibilities .
And he just does n't notice , perhaps akin to never hearing Rev. Wright anti-American diatribes .
An American president does not pander to third - world audiences by lying about the Muslim contribution to America .
Imagine Ronald Reagan , or any past American president , trying to win friends by apologizing .
This appeal contravenes our national character and far exceeds a momentary embarrassment about garbled syntax or poor delivery .
Then there 's Obama 's bizarre , totally unnecessary deep bowing to foreign potentates .
Americans look foreign leaders squarely in the eye and firmly shake hands ; we do n't bow .
But far worse is Obama 's tone - deafness about American government .
How can any ordinary American , even a traditional liberal , believe that jamming through unpopular , debt - expanding legislation that consumes one - sixth of our GDP , sometimes with sly side - payments and with a thin majority , will eventually be judged legitimate ?
This is third - world , maximum - leader - style politics .
That the legislation was barely understood even by its defenders and vehemently championed by a representative of that typical American city , San Francisco , only exacerbates the strangeness .
And now President Obama sides with illegal aliens over the State of Arizona , which seeks to enforce the federal immigration law to protect American citizens from marauding drug gangs and other miscreants streaming in across the Mexican border .
Reciprocal public disengagement from President Obama is strongly suggested by recent poll data on public trust in government .
According to a recent Pew report , only 22 % of those asked trust the government always or most of the time , among the lowest figures in half a century .
And while pro-government support has been slipping for decades , the Obama presidency has sharply exacerbated this drop .
To be sure , many factors ( in particular the economic downturn ) contribute to this decline , but remember that Obama was recently elected by an often wildly enthusiastic popular majority .
The collapse of trust undoubtedly transcends policy quibbles or a sluggish economy -- it is far more consistent with a deeper alienation .
Perhaps the clearest evidence for this " foreigner in our midst " mentality is the name given our resistance -- tea parties , an image that instantly invokes the American struggle against George III , a clueless foreign ruler from central casting .
This history - laden label was hardly predetermined , but it instantly stuck ( as did the election of Sen. Scott Brown as " the shot heard around the world " and tea partiers dressing up in colonial - era costumes ) .
Perhaps subconsciously , Obama does remind Americans of when the U.S. was really occupied by a foreign power .
A Declaration of Independence passage may still resonate : " HE [ George III ] has erected a Multitude of new Offices [ Czars ] , and sent hither Swarms of Officers [ recently hired IRS agents ] to harass our People , and eat out the Substance . "

Ruby 1.9 Fibers + EventMachine for Big Ruby Webapp Performance Gains
By Peter Cooper
Developers hankering for more performance from their Rack and Rails applications are using Ruby 1.9 fibers and event - based EventMachine - driven libraries as a way to boost the performance of their applications - in opposition to scaling by merely running multiple processes or using threads .
It 's no secret that thread - based development can be Hard™ , even if you did n't have to deal with Ruby quirks like autoloading not working properly and the GIL ( Global Interpreter Lock ) .
Luckily , Ruby 1.9 provides fibers , light - weight " execution units " that are manually scheduled by their parent application .
Back in April , Mike Perham introduced Phat , an asynchronous Rails 2.3.5 app running on Ruby 1.9 and supporting " many concurrent requests in a single Ruby process . "
In his explanation , he referred back to Scalable Ruby Processing with EventMachine , a talk he gave at Austin On Rails that 's worth checking out .
Event - based database drivers are used to keep database queries asynchronous ( this , however , is not a new concept ) so that execution can be switched deftly between multiple fibers each serving a separate Web request by the rack - fiber_pool middleware component .
Ilya Grigorik 's EM - Synchrony can then be used to make a collection of common EventMachine clients fiber - aware ( for using Memcached , MongoDB , Beanstalk , and more ) .
All of this works with any Rack app , not just in Rails .
This week , Aaron Gough has written an article called Improving application throughput 9 x with asynchronous responses in Rails 3 that covers the concepts at a higher level and demonstrates how he ported an existing Rails app to use the concepts outlined above .
In doing so , he increased his requests per second from 5.46 to 52 .

Evopedia
Evopedia is an offline Wikipedia viewer .
It allows to search for articles based on their title or the geographic location on a map .
If there is a connection to the internet , even images are displayed .
The information here is partly outdated .
Please visit the project website .
edit ] Dumps
BitTorrent
Since downloads of the dumps caused 2 TB of data transfer on the server in one week , the big dumps are now only available via BitTorrent .
Please install a BitTorrent client ( if not already installed on your system ) to use the .torrent files .
New dumps :
Note that you need evopedia version 0.3.0 ( NOT 0.3.0 RC 3 ) for the search function to work properly for languages not based on the latin alphabet .
Dumping Wikipedia is a very time - consuming task .
Please be patient or help creating the dumps .
Please report if you find errors in the dumps .
Distributed dump processing
edit ] Dump Installation
Extract one ( or more ) of the .zip - Files to your device and select it from within evopedia .
The dump that is used can be changed using the ( second ) link at the top - left of the search screen .
Note that you cannot directly download dumps greater than 4 GB onto your device ( FAT file size limitation ) .
Please download it to a computer with a non-FAT filesystem and then unzip it directly onto your device ( via USB for example ) .

Tweaks
Evopedia creates a configuration file at / home / user / .evopediarc when it is first started .
Most of the options are self - explanatory .
By changing listen_address to 0.0.0.0 you ( or anybody else , so be careful ) can also access evopedia from a different computer using the url http://< ip adress of your device >: 8080 /
maptile_repositories is a string that specifies which map types are available and where the tile images are stored .
If it is empty , tiles are not stored at all and only OpenStreetmap is available .
If this is not done automatically , you can set it to

Please consider joining the distributed dump system mentioned above .
Also , the information below is a bit outdated .
Creating a Wikipedia dump is unfortunately a rather lengthy process ( some days ) .
If you have any suggestions for speeding it up , please step forward .
Concerning space , 20 GB should be enough for creating the dump .
For the advanced users , note that the process can be distributed over many computers by calling dumpWiki with the slice number to process on each computer .
edit ] 1 . install needed software ( please add packages if I forgot some ) :

call createdump.sh
( Do n't be too optimistic though .
After part of the day the database is filled with several gigabytes of downloaded wikipedia content , but something is broken and the final dump gives no results . )
-- Brett Connolly spent Thursday afternoon seated in a chair on the Target Terrace , five stories above the bustling L.A. Live plaza , which was packed with thousands of fans getting ready for the red-carpet premiere of the latest " Twilight " movie .
That 's a long way from Prince George , B.C. But there was Connolly , the Prince George Cougars ' right wing ranked No. 3 among North American skaters by NHL Central Scouting for the 2010 Entry Draft , soaking in the California sun and enjoying another day in the spotlight with nine of the other top prospects .
" It 's a different city , for sure , " Connolly said .
" It 's nice to get out of Prince George and come here where the weather 's nice , the palm trees .
Definitely a good change , for sure .
" It 's been quite a hectic few days .
Since Wednesday , he 's visited the famed Hollywood sign , walked along the Hollywood Walk of Fame , taken batting practice at Angels Stadium ( he was the only one of the five prospects to clear the fence ) , and led a youth hockey clinic at the Kings ' practice site , Toyota Sports Center .
Following Thursday 's media session , he 'll be walking on the red carpet for the " Twilight Saga : Eclipse " premiere .
Oh yeah , and then there 's the draft , which starts Friday ( Round 1 : 7 p.m. ET , Versus , TSN ; Rounds 2 - 7 : 1 p.m. ET , NHL Network ) .
" It 's surreal , " said Plymouth Whalers center Tyler Seguin , Central Scouting 's top-rated skater .
" I 've said that a couple times .
It 's just one step closer to my dream ( Friday ) .
All that stuff that comes with it is a huge bonus and it's a blast .
" Windsor Spitfires defenseman Cam Fowler said he wo n't soon forget taking batting practice at Angels Stadium .
A varsity high - school baseball player before giving up the sport after his sophomore year to concentrate on hockey , Fowler sprayed balls all over the yard during BP , which was thrown by former major - leaguer and current Angels batting coach Mickey Hatcher .
After that , they got to sit in the Angels ' dugout and then got a tour of the team 's indoor batting cage and video room .
They also got to meet Baseball Hall of Famer Tommy Lasorda and Angels manager Mike Scioscia , as well as stand on the field while the Angels and Dodgers took batting practice .
But there was another stop on his tour that he liked almost as much .
" The In and Out burger was delicious , " Fowler said .
" Just so cool .
" Those words also describe the entire experience for him .
" I 'm so thankful the NHL has set up these fun things for us to do -- Angels Stadium , the Walk of Fame , " he said .
" L.A. has so much to offer .
I think it 's great the draft has come out here .
It 's good expansion for the League , helping out the kids at the youth clinic this morning was a great experience for me , and just being able to take the draft off my mind a little bit .
" There certainly has been a lot going on , from events to interviews with teams to media requests .
But rather than be stressed , the players said they 're all just enjoying their time in the spotlight .
" I'm just soaking up the opportunity , " said Medicine Hat Tigers forward Emerson Etem , the de facto host for the event due to his growing up in nearby Long Beach , Calif .
" This is once in a lifetime , the draft .
I 'll find out my NHL team tomorrow .
Ca n't believe it 's going to be tomorrow .
I 'm extremely excited . " " Everyone I 've talked to , guys that have been drafted last year on my team , they said soak it all in because it goes fast , and you never have the opportunity to get drafted again , " Fowler said .
" You 've just got to relax and you 've just got to take in the sun and the city .
There 's no place I 'd rather be right now .
I 'm so fortunate to be in this position .
No complaints .
I 'm just waiting to hear my name called on Friday .
" Fowler , No. 5 on Central Scouting 's list , wo n't have to wait long to hear his name called .
The same goes for his Windsor teammate , Taylor Hall .
All the attention is nothing new to Hall , who has been in the glare of the spotlight since the season started , and he has n't disappointed .
He 's No. 2 on Central Scouting 's list , and this season he 's earned a share of the OHL scoring title , a World Junior Championship silver medal and a second straight Memorial Cup title -- while becoming the first - ever two - time Memorial Cup MVP .
Hall has enjoyed all the attention , and when he was asked what part of his time in Hollywood has been his favorite , he did n't hesitate to answer .
" I think the event tomorrow is going to be the most important one , " he said .
A new initiative by Coulomb Technologies aims to install 4,600 free electric vehicle ( EV ) charging stations in nine metropolitan areas around the US by September 2011 as part of its ChargePoint America program .
The project will be supported by three automotive partners — Chevrolet , Ford , and Smart — to ensure the availability of electric vehicles in those nine regions in an attempt to solve the chicken - and - egg problem of developing a viable charging infrastructure .
Coulomb Technologies makes a line of ChargePoint networked EV charging stations , and also operates a network of stations for EV drivers to use to " fill up . "
The company will supply , free of charge , a total of 4,600 charging stations for installation in public spaces , businesses , and individual homes .
Those charging stations will hopefully blanket the Austin , Detroit , Los Angeles , New York , Orlando , Sacramento , San Jose / San Francisco , Redmond , and Washington DC metropolitan areas , establishing a viable network for charging EVs .
The $ 37 million project is funded in part by a $ 15 million Department of Energy grant from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act .
" The Obama Administration has set significant and considerable goals for the widespread adoption of electric vehicles in the coming years , " said Coulomb Technologies CEO Richard Lowenthal in a statement .
" This grant will bring thousands of networked charging stations to nine US regions , will build upon our already growing and established network of infrastructure , and will accelerate the deployment of public and private charging infrastructure which will in turn encourage consumers to buy electric vehicles . "
Part of the problem of establishing a network of EV charging stations is that there currently are n't enough EVs on the road to make building and supporting the charging stations economically viable .
And without a network of charging stations available , it is n't feasible to drive an EV for much more than a relatively short urban commute .
That 's why the ChargePoint America project is partnering with Chevy , Ford , and Smart .
These automakers have committed to making the Chevy Volt , Ford Transit Connect , Ford Focus BEV , and Smart Fortwo electric cars available in all nine regions , thereby ensuring a supply of EVs to use the charging stations .
The networked ChargePoint charging stations can be configured to offer free charging , though they most will likely be configured to integrate with the ChargePoint FlexBill system for billing purposes .
Businesses can request to have them installed on site , but individuals and governments can also request that they be installed in convenient public places as well .
Individuals may also qualify to have a home charging station installed .
Coulomb Technologies plans to have at least 1,000 public charging stations in place by the end of the year , with the remainder installed before the end of 2011 .
Data about EV charging patterns will be collected from each station installed by the project , and analyzed by research groups from Purdue University and Idaho National Labs .
The idea of “ toning your muscles ” is one of the biggest lies to become firmly cemented in conventional wisdom .
There is no such thing as “ toning your muscles . ”
Sorry , it does n’t exist .
The concept that conventional wisdom calls “ toning ” is a combination of two very real things : gaining muscle mass and reducing excess body fat .
But if the problem stopped there it would just be a matter of phrasing .
What we call “ potato chips ” the British call “ crisps , ” but it does n’t really matter because we ’re referencing the same products produced in the exact same way .
Unfortunately , when it comes to “ muscle tone ” that is n’t the case .
Conventional wisdom about “ muscle tone ” does n’t reflect the reality of achieving it .
Here ’s the conventional wisdom : “ If you use light weight at high reps then you will tone your muscles .
This results in a trim , lean body that ’s not too bulky and has good muscle definition . ”
Please keep in mind that the preceding quote was a load of crap .
Bringing myself to type it was exceedingly difficult , so I hope you appreciate it .
You ’re welcome .
Here ’s the first half of the truth : Muscles are fixed at all ends by tendons and bone .
They do not magically assume different shapes .
Sets of 2 - 3 reps do not produce the shape of a teapot while 10 - 12 reps produce the shape of a lampshade .
Muscles just do n’t have that much artistic license .
However , muscles do change shape : they grow in response to exercise .
That ’s the first half of the equation in achieving what most people want when they refer to muscle tone : larger muscles .
That does n’t have to mean “ Conan the Barbarian large , ” but if you ’ll honestly analyze what you ’re thinking about when the fallacy of muscle tone comes to mind , you ’ll find that growing your muscles to some degree is certainly a part of it .
The good news is that conventional wisdom on toning has a tiny element of truth to it :
High rep schemes with low weight do stimulate muscle growth .
However , low rep schemes with heavier weight stimulate it much more .
I ’m not advocating one rep scheme at the expense of the other .
My advice is a balanced program like CrossFit .
But if you want larger muscles ( part of the elusive muscle tone ) then you ca n’t be hesitant to lift heavy .
Conventional wisdom says lifting heavy is not part of “ toning . ”
That ’s probably because lifting heavy is tough and requires some motivation and determination .
People like to find reasons not to do things that are difficult .
The second half of the truth : body fat is all that really determines how well your muscles can be seen .
Grab a competitive bodybuilder , an elite CrossFitter , and an Abercrombie and Fitch model .
They have vastly different exercise routines and physical capabilities , but chances are they ’re all ripped .
They all have low body fat percentages .
While some form of physical exercise will undoubtedly make you leaner , the unfortunate truth is that diet is the dominant factor controlling your body fat .
Abs are made in the kitchen — not on an Abmat , a GHD machine , and certainly not on some contraption with cables .
Yeah , that kind of sucks , but it ’s true .
So how do you achieve the traditional notion of “ muscle tone ? ”
Simple : strength training and proper nutrition .
I recommend a fitness program like CrossFit that will include a mix of heavy lifting and lighter , high - rep exercises in functional movements .
That translates to larger muscles .
For proper nutrition I recommend some flavor of low - carb eating coupled with high - quality foods that are minimally processed .
Using the proportions of the Zone Diet with an emphasis on food quality from the Paleo Diet is an excellent place to start .
The things we learn from blowhards in the gym and Saturday afternoon infomercials are often incorrect .
Such is the case with muscle tone .
But the idea that most people are visualizing when they think “ muscle tone ” is n’t elusive at all .
However , unlike conventional wisdom would indicate , hard work and dedication are required to achieve it .
If you really want muscle tone then toss conventional wisdom aside , put down the cupcakes in the office break room , and pick up a barbell .
John Goodman shows off his shrinking frame at awards ceremony in Los Angeles
He 's made his name as an overweight , larger - than - life character throughout his Hollywood career .
But the pounds have been falling off portly actor John Goodman as he showed off a slimmer physique at an awards ceremony in Los Angeles last night .
The 57 - year - old , who was rumoured to weigh 28 stone 18 months ago , looked almost half the man he was just under a year ago as he attended the AFI Life Achievement Award party .
Shrinking : John Goodman is several pounds slimmer than the man he was last August ( R ) as he attends an award ceremony in Los Angeles last night
The actor , who shot to fame in the Nineties as Roseanne Barr 's long - suffering husband Dan Conner on the sitcom Roseanne , looked happy and healthy as he posed on the red carpet .
And the weight loss was all too obvious , his tuxedo fitting him perfectly , with not a bulge in sight .
The event , held at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City , was in honour of director Mike Nichols .
Celebrity friends : John poses with acclaimed British actress Helen Mirren
The actor 's weight , which is known to fluctuate , has been the subject of many showbiz columns and stories over the years .
But yesterday , the 6ft 3in actor 's slimmer figure was a far cry from the obesity he has struggled with .
In August 2009 , he was snapped on set in New York in a red polo shirt that barely concealed his large size , as he filmed You Don't Know Jack , alongside Al Pacino .
Obese :
This picture of Goodman , taken on set of his movie Confessions of a Shopaholic in New York in December 2008 sparked concerns about his weight
But the picture that sparked so much concern about his weight , was one taken while he filmed the comedy Confessions of a Shopaholic in New York in December 2008 .
The snap of an obese Goodman walking round Manhattan smoking a cigarette prompted US tabloid The Globe to publish an article about his weight .
With the headline ' 400 - lb Goodman eating himself to death ! ' , the feature spoke about his friends ' fears that his weight and eating habits were getting out of control .

Among the chatterati these days the favorite topic of conjecture is what the catastrophic Gulf oil spill means for President Obama .
Pundits argue hotly over the correct historical comparison :
Will the spill prove to be his Hurricane Katrina ?
His Three Mile Island ?
Or maybe his Iranian Hostage Crisis ?
Meanwhile , a strange reticence has taken hold of Mr. Obama 's ideological opponents .
Where are the livid patriots who enthralled us for months with their fevered dreams of a socialist - minded , power - hungry federal government ?

AMID the legal battles between investors who lost money in mortgage securities and the investment banks that sold the stuff , one thing seems clear : the investment banks appear to be winning a good many of the early skirmishes .
But some cases are faring better for individual plaintiffs , with judges allowing them to proceed even as banks ask that they be dismissed .
Still , these matters are hard to litigate because investors must persuade the judges overseeing them that their losses were not simply a result of a market crash .
Investors must argue , convincingly , that the banks misrepresented the quality of the loans in the pools and made material misstatements about them in prospectuses provided to buyers .
Recent filings by two Federal Home Loan Banks  in San Francisco and Seattle  offer an intriguing way to clear this high hurdle .
Lawyers representing the banks , which bought mortgage securities , combed through the loan pools looking for discrepancies between actual loan characteristics and how they were pitched to investors .
You may not be shocked to learn that the analysis found significant differences between what the Home Loan Banks were told about these securities and what they were sold .
Android updates will likely become a once a year event , according to Andy Rubin , chief of Google 's mobile platforms .
The big question :
Will that help or hurt Android in the smartphone race ?
Rubin told the Mercury News ' Troy Wolverton :
Our product cycle is now , basically twice a year , and it will probably end up being once a year when things start settling down , because a platform that 's moving — it 's hard for developers to keep up .
I want developers to basically leverage the innovation .
I do n't want developers to have to predict the innovation .
The point is well taken from a developer perspective .
However , Android 's innovation velocity is the mobile operating system 's best feature .
One of the most striking things about Android is that it innovates quickly .
That fast pace is why Android is largely on par with Apple 's iPhone .
That pace is how Android can pass the iPhone .
Further downstream , Android 's rapid development is why its market share is surging .
What happens if Android 's development cycle slows once a year and matches Windows Phone 7 on the innovation cycle ?
Does Android let Microsoft off the carpet ?
There 's a balance here .
How frequently should Android be released to balance developer interests and innovation ?

IE and HTML5 testing Thursday 3 June 2010
In the 18 months I ’ve really focussed on HTML5 , I ’ve seen approximately 238 different HTML5 “ testing ” sites appear .
Most of them wildly pick and mix specs , checking for HTML5 , related WHATWG - derived specifications such as Web Workers and then , drunk and giddy with buzzwords , throw in SVG , CORS , CSS Media Queries , and some Apple proprietary CSS extension before hyperventilating and going to bed for a lie down .
( Added 4 June 2010 : As a case in point , take Apple ’s hilariously disingenous “ HTML5 ” showcases , of which only the video and audio demos have anything to do with HTML5 , and which offer “ browser upgrade ” messages even to other WebKit browsers ( screenshot courtesy of Peter Nelson ) .
And do n’t get me started on “ Standards are n’t add - ons to the web .
They are the web ” coupled with browser - sniffing and proprietary vendor extensions . )
As an analogy , imagine that HTML5 is the Starship Enterprise to HTML 4 ’s pogostick .
Imagining it ?
Good .
237 HTML5 testing sites check for
Does it do most pogostick functions ?
Does it do Starship Enterprise things , too ?
Oh ! what about Millenium Falcon functionality ?
Wow ! can it also behave like a spacehopper ?
OMG !?!
And what about CSS 4D Canvas Gradient Transforms ™?
Therefore , it ’s particularly refreshing to see the new Microsoft IE9 HTML5 Testing Centre bringing some sanity to the party .
None of the scope - creep for our friends in Microsoft .
It ’s purely HTML5 , and only selected bits so we ca n’t even speculate about thinking about considering accusing them of scope - creep .
So they avoid any mention of fripperies like canvas ( who uses that ? ) or native multimedia ( who ’s even heard of that ? ) .
Why would any web developer care about Web Forms ?
Instead , we look only at The text selection APIs , parsing foreign content and getElements ByClassName to determine that IE9 has the best HTML5 support .
To return to our analogy , the Microsoft test to detect Starship Enterprises is :
Is the colour of the grouting in the shower cubicles exactly Pantone 7401 C ?
Are the menus in the staff canteen printed on 180 gsm matt card ?
Is the main power cable to the transporter room secured to the wall with cable grips at precisely 10 centimeter intervals ?
Yes to all ?
Wow !
It ’s the Starship Enterprise !
Actually , it ’s HTML5 , Jim , but not as we know it .
( Related : What HTML5 is and is n’t , an IE9 speed comparison . )
Caveat : Yeah , I ’m having a chuckle .
This does not represent the position of my employer .
I wrote it outside company time .
On a different computer .
With a different personality .
So chill out , it ’s a sunny day .

Now , generally I 'm not the sort of person who likes to cheaply strawman their enemies by repeating their sentences back to them in a high - pitched mocking tone of voice , but here 's a brief summary of my email inbox after the Monster Hunter Tri review : " Mneh mneh mneh .
You did n't play it long enough .
Mneh mneh mneh .
Metacritic said it was good .
Mneh mneh mneh .
I just did one in my pants .
Mneh . "
I wo n't bother quoting specific examples , suffice to say there were a lot of them .
The main thrust of the argument was that Monster Hunter Tri totally gets good once you 've gotten past the tutorial , which takes about ten hours of gameplay .
Ten hours .
Do you people listen to yourselves ?
Maybe if I had your kind of wealthy , privileged lifestyle and could spend most of my days idly playing Wii by the pool as a team of oiled bodybuilders fanned me with palm fronds , but some of us have jobs to do .
Articles to write .
Other , better games to review .
Fun Space Games to avoid working on .
As I 've said time and again , " it gets better later " as an excuse does not wash for me .
Even if the game is 50 percent poo and 50 percent mind - blowing envelope - pushing extravaganza , that 's still mediocre on average .
I have a simple rule when playing a game to review .
I play until the game is finished , or until I can't stand any more .
And if the game ever falls below that point of tolerance , that 's an automatic write - off .
You know when you play Guitar Hero , and you 're given a fail if you play badly for long enough for the crowd reaction to sink below the red ?
You do n't get to play the rest of the song , and you do n't get any points based on how well you might , potentially , have played it .
I use the same approach for reviewing games .
If I 'm fed up to the back teeth , out the console you go .
No buts .
No reprieves .
No more of it for me .
Besides , does the game really get better after ten hours , or is that just the point when you become numb to the pain ?
Unless at that magic ten hour mark the game goes " Ha ha , just kidding , here 's a completely different game " and magically transmutes the disk into Shadow of the Colossus or something , I do n't see how it could significantly improve .
It 'd need to change a lot of the interface , for a start .
Someone explain to me how it makes sense that you can only change your equipment in your bedroom .
Well , sure , OK , it would make sense in real life , but what if I 'm in the overworld fighting big slow lumbering monsters with my giant two - handed sword , but now I 've spotted some of those quick , whippy little bastards and want to switch to a shortsword and shield ?
I 'd have to go all the way back home to do it .
That 'd just be embarrassing .
Like having to come back to school in the evening because you left your P.E. kit there .
MISPLACED ARROGANCE IS HARD TO IGNORE ….
Here ’s a terrific example of a problem we talked about last week .
The lead story on CNN ’s political blog this afternoon is an item about a tweet former half - term Gov. Sarah Palin ( R ) wrote about drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
The tweet is factually wrong .
Do I ignore it ( because she ’s ridiculous ) or write about it ( because people might see the media coverage and wonder if she ’s right ) ?
It ’s not like we can count on the truth to come out in the course of media interviews —
Palin is far too big a coward to talk to reporters about her positions , which is why she counts on outlets like CNN to treat her tweets and Facebook messages as “ news . ”
I ’ll go ahead and write up an item , for a reason I ’ll get to in a minute .
Here ’s the CNN report :
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is using the Gulf Coast oil spill to promote the issue of drilling in the Alaskan Wildlife National Refuge – the 20 - million protected acres where untapped oil and gas reserves have long served as a lightning rod of controversy .
“ Extreme Greenies : see now why we push ‘ drill , baby , drill ’ of known reserves & promising finds in safe onshore places like ANWR ?
Now do you get it ? ” the former Republican vice presidential nominee wrote Tuesday evening on her Twitter account .
And here ’s the truth .
The message is clear : “ drill , baby , drill ” was never about dangerous offshore drilling like the Deepwater Horizon site , it was about safe “ onshore ” locations like ANWR .
Except that it was n’t .
Not even close .
Palin sees the oil spill disaster in the Gulf and thinks it ’s evidence of how correct she was .
But the pathologically dishonest former half - term governor seems to have forgotten that Google exists , and many of us know how to use it .
Palin has repeatedly called for coastal drilling , and incorporated coastal exploration as part of her child - like “ drill , baby , drill . ”
She is , in other words , lying about claims that are surprisingly easy to check .
But what really gets me is the condescending tone .
I do n’t mind arrogance ; I mind idiots who think they ’re smarter than everyone else , too ignorant to recognize their own ignorance .
It ’s one thing for Palin to shamelessly lie about her own approach to drilling , but it ’s so much worse when she tops it off with , “ Now do you get it ? ”
It suggests the rest of us would understand the nuances of her policy positions if we ’d only pay closer attention .
Believe me , gov , we “ get it ” just fine .
We “ get ” that you ’re lying about easily - checked claims .
We get that you ’re a conspicuously unintelligent demagogue who posts online because you ’re too scared to talk to a reporter directly .

Ela Darling is one of the hottest MILFs in the VR industry !
Ela Darling is the first porn actress to offer webcam shows in virtual reality .
The studied librarian does not want to go back to her old profession .
She wants to revolutionize her industry with virtual reality .
The strange man in Ela ’s bedroom looks around very carefully .
There she kneels on the bed , dressed only in a black lace bra and tight panties , twirls her long blond hair seemingly embarrassed with thumb and index finger and looks directly at the man with big questioning eyes .
The visitor looks back , looks at these green - grey eyes , the skilfully painted , barely visible pimple next to her nose , the slightly open lips with the bright red lipstick , and finally , after a little fantasy journey over her upper body , the fine hairs on her belly .
Then he looks at the rest of the bedroom : beneath him he sees the light pink bedding .
On the right the blue cloth that covers the window , on the left on the wall the poster of a diver , above the bed photos and postcards , in the background next to the room door the desk with the computer on it , the screensaver glows pale blue .
The man finally turns back to Ela Darling and asks if she wants to undress further .
Of course she wants to .
He pays her for every minute .
“ Some also ask if they can see my feet .
Feet are number five in all fetishes . ”
Others have other wishes .
And they ’re not really there .
And yet somehow they are .
You are visiting Ela Darling in Virtual Reality .
Anal sex .
Fistfucking .
Throat fucking .
Sex Machine .
Cunnilingus .
This is how Ela Darling lists her professional skills .
The list on her Facebook page goes a whole lot further .
She graduated with a bachelor ’s degree in psychology and a master ’s in library science .
However , the library has receded into the background since the 30 - year - old lateral thinker decided to pursue a career as a porn star .
Today she is the first to offer live porn videos in virtual reality .
The technical equipment in her bedroom is still improvised , but it works : she flirts with a huge apparatus consisting of twelve Gopro cameras , some of which are connected with adhesive tape , whose images are stitched together by software to form a perfect 360 - degree panorama , just like a sewing machine sews a patchwork quilt .
The visitor feels as if he is in the bedroom
For your visitor it feels as if he is really in your bedroom , even if he is in a completely different place in the world .
He turns his own bedroom into a kind of holodeck with a virtual reality headset and beams himself to Darling ’s side .
To do this , he is shown two images in the headset , one for each eye , which the brain combines to create a deceptively real three - dimensional spatial impression .
He feels as if he were physically present .
He can not yet walk around freely in the room , and when he looks down at himself he sees – nothing .
From Darling ’s point of view , this is better than seeing something that either does not correspond to the real body or does not correspond to the real emotion .
After all , the magic word of virtual reality is “ immersion ” , the total immersion into another world as if one were really there .
But if a black person looks down on himself and suddenly has a white penis , or a transsexual looks down on himself and sees the wrong genitals , immersion dies immediately .
And not only that : “ These people will then think :
This is something that is not meant for me , ” says Darling .
She knows this perspective , she herself has been shooting exclusively lesbian porn for a long time – for both men and women .
“ Women like hardcore porn , not soft stuff , but they know their bodies and want to see scenes that are realistic . ”
All too often , however , male fantasy alone plays a role .
“ When women then have to watch for minutes on end how a woman is stimulated in places where we feel nothing , it is clear that the ecstasy is only feigned .
It ’s not a turn - on . ” Ela Darling
Virtual Reality Conference in Potsdam .
The hall is full to bursting , the voices of the visitors buzz in the air .
Everyone wants to know what the future looks like with virtual reality .
And everyone has his or her own ideas about this .
Ela Darling runs up the steps to the stage .
She wears black cowboy boots in vintage look , an equally black underdress with many laces and a black hooded sweater .
Suddenly it is very quiet .
Hundreds of people hang on her red lips even before she has said the first word .
“ Whenever I get to know a new technology , I ask myself two questions , ” she says .
“ One : How can I fuck her ? ”
She ’s taking a break , smiling .
The chain around her neck , it ’s made of the vertebrae of a viper , rises and falls .
The listeners hold their breath .
“ And two : How can others watch me fuck ? ”
Virtual reality is supposed to democratize porn
These questions have turned the porn actress into the porn entrepreneur Ela Darling .
And from her point of view this should happen to as many of her colleagues as possible .
She uses the attention she gets as the first VR webcam girl to promote tolerance .
On stage , she reports how she wants to democratize the porn industry by giving the actresses the means of production themselves through her company VRTube.xxx .
Empowerment ’ is the English buzzword for this , it means giving power back to the exploited .
“ Sex workers are marginalized people , porn closes many doors ” , she says : “ Once you work here , you ca n’t do many other jobs .
“ I could never work in a kindergarten , for example . ”
But there ’s a danger in this : Payment has gotten worse over the years because porn on the Internet has fallen into the hands of laymen .
Today , every housewife and every student can shoot porn on the side as a hobby .
“ People are no longer willing to pay for it , ” says Darling .
She senses how this is changing every day with the great demand for her VR shows .
At some point , she hopes , the visual immersion will be joined by a haptic one : “ If it ’s possible to feel the skin or moisture in virtual reality , it will turn the entire porn industry inside out . ”
Ela Darling
Already today there are sex toys that transmit the movements of one person to another over distances .
Ela Darling also wants to be at the forefront of this revolution .
She is already in contact with a manufacturer of dildos that transmit pressure over spatial distances .
At the end she calls out to the audience : “ It ’s a great technology , we have to do our job especially well right now ! ”
From the library counter to lesbian anal sex in VR
Ela Darling has been doing her job well since she can remember .
At school she skipped a grade , went through her studies , and by the age of 21 she was already head of the local library .
“ I could have done this the rest of my life , ” she says today .
But what sounds reassuring to some , sounded like a threat to Ela Darling .
“ Why not take a little more risk , ” she asks , as if it were the most normal step in the world from the counter of a library to lesbian anal sex .
She had been modeling as a student , normal photos , that was fun .
Finally , a friend asked her if she wanted to model for nude photos – she thought that was a good idea , too .
This friend later became her husband , but that too is already over .
Today she has a friend , she is terribly in love , very connected , and also a man , whom she calls “ primary partner ” , but who is not more important than the friend .
Her third relationship is her porn business .
“ I ’m very focused , I care about my work . ”
Even with the first porn , she earned a lot of money , she says , in a day as much as in a week in the library .
And she enjoys it much more .
“ The people in the scene are just incredibly nice ! ”
Does n’t it bother you that men sexualize her ?
Using them for their fantasies ?
“ They do that anyway .
But at least now they ’re paying for it . ”
Once upon a time , in her old life , a friend of hers posted nude photos of her on the Internet .
“ Now I ’m gonna do it myself and I ’m gonna say , ‘ Burn . ”
The path from librarian to porn entrepreneur is also a kind of empowerment for her .
And the other world ?
That of the bookworm who lost himself in fantasy worlds as a child ?
That of the psychology student ?
Her parents were only worried for a moment and are now proud of their entrepreneur ’s daughter .
Silly comments , of course .
They ’re endless .
“ I get stupid comments on every aspect of my life , there ’s no limit to human stupidity . ”
But why should she care ?
The first VR sex on camera was like the first day at school
The first time naked in front of the camera , the first sex with a woman – no , it was not strange .
“ It was probably as exciting as my first day at school . ”
During her marriage , she restricted herself professionally to lesbian sex .
Her husband was otherwise jealous .
“ Now I do men , too . ”
And then came the new technology and its old question .
How can I use it to fuck ?
Ela Darling googled and finally found a reddit - post from her future business partner :
This young man asked himself the same question , but had the other side , the technology .
When she first met him at a train station in Washington DC , she considered asking him for his ID .
“ He looked so young . ”
The two of them went to his home to shoot their first project , where the next surprise was waiting : some extremely frightened roommates of the studio flat .
Their new project partner , who eventually turned out to be a student of quantum physics , finally left them alone in his room without any further instructions .
“ Just make a good porno , ” he said .
After all , with a camera that films the entire room , no one else in the room can – the viewer would see it .
The student was very impressed with the result .
“ ‘ It was the first time I felt like I was watching a real person ’ , he said , and I wondered :
What else did he see when he watched porn ? ”
Ela Darling
Ela Darling is convinced that technology will not only revolutionize porn , but also the relationship between men and sex workers : “ People feel connected to you .
There are fewer assholes . ”
She herself also feels closer to her visitors .
At first glance , this makes her sceptical ; after all , she experiences the opposite side of immersion : instead of a real person , her counterpart in the live shows is a camera .
“ I quickly got used to that , ” she says .
“ I talk to the camera like someone who pays me by the minute . ”
And he is sitting behind it , far away and yet very close .
Darling raves about how quickly you get close in Virtual Reality .
“ It ’s a bit like therapy .
People often seek something they do n’t realize . ”
One of them had recently just wanted to talk , he had been freshly left , “ he needed someone who understood him , he felt more at home in my bedroom than anywhere else in the world .
7 reasons why men like older women – not only in VR
At the latest since Stifler ’s Mum caused sexual dreams in the cult comedy American Pie , MILF has been on everyone ’s lips .
It ’s called “ Mom i’d like to fuck ” .
But where does the fascination come from ?
Why do so many men go for mothers and mature women ?
The following seven reasons reveal it .
1. A MILF knows what she wants
Many men feel most comfortable with women when they know exactly what they want .
Insecurity , shyness or playful games are not what men like .
They prefer a lustful , self - confident MILF as their sex partner , because she takes what they want .
At a young age women are often still marked by insecurities .
They spend hour after hour conjuring up the perfect make - up , moving around in bed as attractively as possible and forget one thing above all : fun !
Older women are aware of the fact that they no longer look perfect , have the odd blemish or two , and therefore give up the hunt for perfection .
With a certain degree of maturity , women realise that they prefer to enjoy rather than desperately chasing an ideal .
2 . She has experience to show
Older women have already experienced a lot in their lives , including sexually of course .
Men profit from this , because MILF wraps them around their finger with its experience .
It is not for nothing that MILF portals are so popular .
There are numerous experienced , mature women here who simply want casual sex .
Contrary to widespread belief , it is not only young men who like to be seduced by a woman with experience .
Men of all ages have long since discovered that MILF is worth a sin .
If you have never had the pleasure of being seduced by such an experienced woman , you have really missed out on something in life .
Most mothers know sexual games that you have only seen in porn movies .
3. A MILF is open for sex adventures
Most older women are married or in a committed relationship .
As is the case in married life , these ladies often have sex very rarely .
Mostly it is the husbands who do not appreciate the advantages of a MILF .
Young and also older men like MILFs !
But since women over 30 often need even more attention and are really keen on regular sex , they start looking for adventures .
So it ’s not surprising that you can get a MILF interested in a sex date much faster than a young woman who gets a lover on every corner .
The mature ladies have another advantage , they do n’t cling to you .
The MILF does not need a new partner , she just wants a little sexual pleasure every now and then .
Call her , fuck her , go home !
4. MILFs are the highlight of the VR porn scene
If you are looking for the most popular porn terms today , the MILF is guaranteed to be at the top .
More and more porn stars are no longer in their early 20s , but in their mid-30s , mid-40s and older .
The success proves the dirty , mature ladies right , because the terms MILF , Mother and Stepmom are at the top of the most popular porn terms .
This of course awakens in men the desire for a hot sex adventure with a MILF .
After all , just watching is too boring .
Already in porn , mature women show unrestrainedly what they have to offer .
For many MILFs , porn is not just a movie they make , but a real passion .
They do n’t have to play the climax , they actually enjoy the porn shoot and get their money ’s worth .
As a viewer , you see this immediately and it excites you even more when you see a hot MILF on the screen .
5. A MILF likes to experiment
Sex is much more than just mission statement .
However , the younger the sex partner is , the less willing she usually is to experiment .
Yet it is precisely men who are interested in all kinds of variations .
Here a hot threesome , there a new sextoy and very brave ones even dare to go to a swinger club .
MILF is the perfect sex partner for all these and other adventures .
She is eager to experiment , always ready to experience new things and has great fun with such sex adventures .
With mature age comes often the feeling to miss something if you do n’t try everything .
This is exactly how a mature woman thinks and feels .
She becomes more and more curious , she wants to know how it feels to share a sex partner with another woman .
Your chances of having a special kind of sex experience are particularly good with MILF .
6 . Men like to sin
You do n’t have sex with a mother , do you ?
At least for a long time it was considered taboo when younger , but also older men had sex with mature ladies .
The more maternal the outward appearance , the more despicable the idea of actually having sex with the woman .
But it ’s exactly this apparent sin that attracts desire in men .
Older women are caring , loving , they may remind you a little bit of your own mommy and are able to stimulate forbidden sexual fantasies and give you a very special horny experience .
Even young men are so attracted to these very thoughts that they would often prefer a mature lady to a playmate of the same age .
And the desire for maturity does not even stop at older men .
7 . Mature women are natural
Make - up , false eyelashes , extensions – many young women are only a shadow of themselves , because they change their whole appearance with beauty cheating .
This is not the case with MILF .
Most older women are completely natural without appearing unkempt .
They simply do n’t feel like sticking false eyelashes on their face for hours and perfecting their make - up just to please .
MILF appreciates their natural attractiveness and focuses on other attributes than the perfect make - up .
Mature women are also more natural during sex .
They do n’t fake orgasms to please you , they let you give them a real orgasm .

In 10th paragraph , corrects to say Boehner spoke by telephone with Souder -- rather than met privately with him
U.S. Republican congressman from Indiana Mark Souder ( R - IN ) ( C ) , congressman Eliyah E. Cummings ( L ) and congressman John Shaddeg talk to the press after meeting the deposed king of Afghanistan Mohammad Zahir Shah at the king 's residence in the outskirts of Rome in this file image from November 9 , 2001 .
REUTERS / Paolo Cocco / Files
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican Representative Mark Souder , a self - proclaimed evangelical Christian , said on Tuesday that he had an affair with a female staffer and would resign , effective on Friday .
“ I ’m resigning rather than put my family through a painful drawn out process , ” Souder said at a hastily called news conference in his home district in Fort Wayne , Indiana .
Souder likely faced an investigation by the House of Representatives ethics committee if he did not step aside .
In a statement issued by his office , Souder , 59 , said he had “ sinned against God , my wife and my family by having a mutual relationship with a part - time member of my staff . ”
David Wasserman , who tracks congressional races for The Cook Political Report , said the Republicans were likely to retain the seat because it serves “ one of the most Republican districts in the state of Indiana . ”
The Republican Party will first have to move quickly to come up with a candidate to replace Souder in November ’s election .
Souder is the 20th House Republican to announce plans to resign or run for higher office in November .
There are 19 House Democrats who plan to retire , run for higher officer or have lost their party ’s primary .
Democrats now control the U.S. House , 254- 177 , but with polls showing plenty of voter anger at Washington , lawmakers are scrambling to retain the advantage .
Souder ’s profile in “ The Almanac of American Politics ” quotes him as saying he is “ most defined by the fact that I ’m an evangelical Christian . ”
He also has been an advocate of abstinence in sexual education .
On the eve of his announcement on Tuesday , Souder spoke by phone with House Republican Leader John Boehner .
Michael Steel , a Boehner spokesman , said he was not aware of the details of their conversation but “ Boehner has been perfectly clear that he will hold our members to the highest ethical standards . ”
Souder ’s resignation comes a few months after a first - term House Democrat , Eric Massa , resigned amid allegations of sexual misconduct .
In 2008 , Souder won re-election with 55 percent of the vote in his northeast Indiana district , which is home to many manufacturers .
Souder , who was an aide to former Senator Dan Coats , gained a reputation early in his House career for challenging Republican leaders , arguing that bills they were pushing were not conservative enough .
During his House career , Souder worked to toughen U.S. drug policy and was one of only 32 House Republicans who voted for the 2008 bailout of domestic automobile companies .
When he first ran for office , Souder promised to serve no more than 12 years .
He is now in his 16th year in the House .
Avocados have been a mainstay of my culinary life for about as long as I can remember .
Growing up in Southern California in the 60's , avocados were locally grown , plentiful and part of just about every party and celebration , usually in the form of guacamole .
But all that changed and guacamole became the springboard for a host of dishes , sweet and savory , but for me , nothing beats a plain slice of perfectly ripe avocado .
It really needs nothing to enhance its lusciousness , but then ....
The other day as I was listening to one of my food podcasts , Evan Kleiman was interviewing an avocado grower who mentioned that one of his favorite ways to eat avocados is to grill them .
What ?!
That 's brilliant !
Why I had n’t I thought of that ?!
The avocado and the grill were simply made for each other .
THAT night I ’m so grilling an avocado .
Oh. My. Goodness .
Really , people .
Grilled avocados are the bomb .
Just cut your avocado in half , remove the seed , and brush it with some lime juice and olive oil .
Place it flesh - side down on your hot grill for about 5 to 7 minutes .
Remove it from your grill and and sprinkle with a little lime juice and salt .
Unbelievable .
If you want to take it a step further , fill the hole with your favorite salsa and top that with a little sour cream .
Sprinkle the whole thing with some chopped cilantro , a good sprinkling of kosher salt and maybe another drizzle of lime juice .
The avocado meat gets a little soft and warm and smoky , and you honestly will just want to curl up in it .
We scooped it out with a spoon , but it would be just as yummy to scoop it out with some tortilla chips .
Late last night we posted a trailer for a trailer and now we can bring you the full teaser trailer for Tangled .
Tangled is Disney ’s take on the story of Rapunzel , directed by Nathan Greno and Byron Howard who preside over a voice cast that includes Mandy Moore , Zachary Levi , Donna Murphy , Ewan McGregor and Steve Martin .
It ’s a pretty good trailer , cute and slapstick in good measure and this one will draw the crowds , and Disney need have set the bar up pretty high with their recent return to hand drawn animation , The Princess and the Frog .
While this is another 3D CG animation I ’m hoping it will be a little more subversive than this trailer suggests .
For indispensable reporting on the coronavirus crisis , the election , and more , subscribe to the Mother Jones Daily newsletter .
The National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) just released this horrifying animation of how ocean currents may carry all the oil in the Gulf of Mexico .
According to their computer modeling of currents and the oil , the spill “ might soon extend along thousands of miles of the Atlantic coast and open ocean as early as this summer . ”
“ I ’ve had a lot of people ask me , ‘ Will the oil reach Florida ? ' ” says NCAR scientist Synte Peacock in a statement accompanying the animation , which he worked on .
“ Actually , our best knowledge says the scope of this environmental disaster is likely to reach far beyond Florida , with impacts that have yet to be understood . ”
The models show oil hitting Florida ’s Atlantic coast within a few weeks , then moving north as far as about Cape Hatteras , N.C. , before heading east .

SHE was too sexy for her shirts , so sexy it hurt - her career , court papers say .
A curvy New York City woman said she was forced out of her job at Citibank because her male co-workers found her figure " too distracting " ,
Debrahlee Lorenzana said she was dressing professionally on the job , but her male bosses and co-workers still found her too hot to be around .
See pictures of Debrahlee Lorenzana here
Ms Lorenzana began working for Citibank as a business banking officer at their Chrysler Building branch in September 2008 .
" Shortly after the commencement of her employment , branch manager Craig Fisher and assistant branch manager Peter Claibourne began articulating inappropriate and sexist comments concerning plaintiff 's clothing and appearance , " her court filings said .
" The improper comments made to plaintiff by Fisher and Claibourne included , but were not limited to , advising her that she must refrain from wearing certain items of clothing , in particular , turtleneck tops , pencil skirts , fitted business suits , or other properly tailored clothing .
Ms Lorenzana " complained to management , pointing out that other female colleagues wore similar professional attire " and that some dressed far more provocatively , her court filing said .
She was also told that " as a result of her tall stature , coupled with her curvaceous figure , she should not wear classic high heeled business shoes , as this purportedly drew attention to her body in a manner that was upsetting to her easily distracted male managers " .
The fed - up woman made a formal complaint to human resources in May of last year , and asked for a transfer to another branch , according to the court filing .
The transfer did n't go through , and she was stripped of some of her duties , and then not given proper training for her new ones , the suit said .
She was finally transferred in July , but matters did n't improve at the next branch , where she was chided for failing to recruit new customers despite being given an out of the way post on the second floor , her filings say .
She was fired that August .
" The purported reasons for plaintiff 's termination included that she failed to meet the required new account opening quotas , in addition to the credulity - straining assertion that her clothing choices were ' inappropriate ' , " the suit said .
Ms Lorenzana 's gender discrimination suit was dismissed last month because her deal with Citibank called for any disputes to be settled in private arbitration .
She 's pressing on with her case there .
Citibank did not immediately return a call for comment .

EDITOR'S NOTE : On June 17 , 2010 , we rated the statement by Sen. Jim DeMint , R - S.C. , that " 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate , no vote , no amendments , no reading of the bill , no online disclosure , and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office . "
We said that the actual percentage was 27.9 and called it a Pants on Fire .
( We 've archived our original item here . )
We soon received a number of letters from readers critical of the math we had used to come up with the percentage .
We also received criticism from DeMint 's office , for our math as well as for other issues .
As a result , we decided to assign a new reporter to the item in order to take a fresh look .
Below is our new analysis .
On May 26 , 2010 , Sen. Jim DeMint , a Republican from South Carolina , posted a video of one of his speeches on YouTube .
Speaking about legislative openness , DeMint said that Congress is plagued with secrecy and lack of debate on important issues :
" At this point in the Senate , 94 percent of all the bills are passed unanimous consent -- 94 percent .
So this is hardly a lack of productivity .
And what this means is 94 percent of the bills that pass the Senate have no debate , no vote , no amendments , no reading of the bill , no online disclosure , and very often no score from the Congressional Budget office . "
DeMint 's number seemed high to us , so we decided to investigate .
We see two broad areas to analyze .
One is whether the percentage DeMint cites is accurate .
The other is whether DeMint 's percentage says anything valuable about how the Senate handles legislation .
We asked DeMint 's office for the source of his claim and were told it comes from a July 2008 report from the Congressional Research Service , the nonpartisan research arm for Congress .
The report , which DeMint 's office had originally asked CRS to prepare , notes that as of June 30 , 2008 , the Senate had passed 911 measures of various kinds during the 110th Congress .
Of these measures , 855 were passed via unanimous consent -- an expedited process by which bills are passed unless a senator objects .
This is the source of DeMint 's 94 percent figure -- 855 bills passed by unanimous consent out of 911 total measures taken up .
DeMint in his speech referred to all of these measures as " bills . "
But the CRS report broke them down more precisely .
Some were formal bills or joint resolutions , both of which are binding .
Others were simple resolutions or concurrent resolutions , which do not have the force of a law and do not require the president 's signature .
Of the 911 total measures , only 376 were legally binding bills and joint resolutions , according to the CRS report .
The rest were simple and concurrent resolutions .
Occasionally these non-binding resolutions inspire some controversy , but a look through the full list provided by CRS confirms that the vast majority are ceremonial or symbolic in nature .
An example is a resolution " congratulating Charles County , Maryland , on the occasion of its 350th anniversary . "
Others from the CRS report include :
• A resolution commending the University of Nebraska - Lincoln women 's volleyball team for winning the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Women 's Volleyball Championship .
• A concurrent resolution honoring the memory of Napa Valley winemaker Robert Mondavi .
• A concurrent resolution authorizing the use of the Capitol Grounds for the District of Columbia Special Olympics Law Enforcement Torch Run .
In making his calculation , the senator decided to include all measures , regardless of whether they were binding .
But there 's another way to do it :
Remove from the calculation the measures that most people would agree do n't require debate .
DeMint spokesman Wesley Denton argues that DeMint was on solid ground calculating the numbers his way .
" Nowhere in DeMint ’s speech does he ever say that all 94 percent of these bills are controversial , or that all 94 percent need a roll call vote , " Denton said .
" DeMint is criticizing the process , not every bill passed by that flawed process .
So to try to whittle down the number by focusing on only the bills PolitiFact finds controversial is a disingenuous attempt to discredit DeMint ’s factual statement . "
We disagree .
We think the fairer test is to focus on the bills that include some element of substance that demands debate .
Doing it DeMint 's way , in our view , essentially stacks the deck by enlarging the pool of undebated measures to include simple and concurrent resolutions .
The CRS report does not consider them bills , and no one seriously expects the Senate to spend time debating the merits of whether to honor a college volleyball team or to praise the life of a late vintner through non-binding resolutions .
So why should we pretend that all 911 measures deserve official debate -- which is what would be required to produce the 94 percent figure DeMint cites ?
We 'll take the alternate approach .
We started with the 376 legally binding measures ( that is , the bills and joint resolutions ) .
Then we looked closer .
Of the 376 , 88 were naming bills for U.S. Postal Service facilities -- legislation that , while legally binding , is almost always non-controversial and treated as pro-forma business by the House and the Senate .
According to CRS , all of the naming bills passed by unanimous consent .
Because these bills are not the kinds of measures requiring substantive debate , we 'll subtract them .
That gets us down to 288 bills .
Another 30 passed by unanimous consent re-named a federal building , park , office or highway after someone -- another common category of bill that rarely if ever inspires debate .
And four additional bills that were passed by unanimous consent addressed what seem to be non-controversial issues involving U.S. coins .
That leaves 254 bills .
We could scrutinize the CRS list for other non-controversial bills passed by unanimous consent , but we 'll stop there ; once you get beyond common categories like building namings , it gets tricky to determine whether a bill addresses a major , debatable issue just by its title , which is all that CRS lists .
So , stopping here would define our universe of legally binding , non-naming , non-coinage bills at 254 .
The CRS study says ( and DeMint 's original math concurs ) that 46 roll call votes and three voice votes were subject to debate in the chamber .
If you subtract these 49 bills from the total number of non-trivial , binding bills ( 254 ) , you get 206 bills passed by unanimous consent .
We now have a couple ways to crunch the numbers .
One is to say that 81 percent of non-trivial , binding bills ( 206 out of 254 ) were passed by unanimous consent .
Alternately , you could separate out the 64 binding resolutions that CRS said were passed by unanimous consent but which received some debate .
Doing this would mean that 56 percent of non-trivial , binding bills , received absolutely no debate .
( DeMint 's office argues that the " debate " on these bills cited by CRS was cursory and thus should n't be counted as debate . )
Either figure would be lower than what DeMint said on the floor , and one of the percentages is quite a bit lower .
They 're also higher than the 27.9 percent we had in our previous article , which we now acknowledge is incorrect .
However , we think what 's wrong with DeMint 's statement is actually broader than the arithmetic .
We arrived at the percentages above after first excluding as ceremonial or symbolic 657 measures the senator had counted .
These largely non-substantive measures that DeMint included accounted for more than 70 percent of the measures he used in his calculation .
This significantly skews the picture of what kinds of measures were taken up in the Senate .
As any veteran Congress - watcher can tell you , the Senate , with its byzantine rules and back - room wheeling - dealing , can be a maddening institution .
DeMint 's call for reforming procedures and increasing openness likely has merit .
His bipartisan efforts with Sens. Tom Coburn , R - Okla. , and Claire McCaskill , D - Mo. , to ensure that legislation is disclosed and easily reviewable online prior to passage , and that it be pre-scrutinized for conflicts of interest and budgetary impact , among other things , are the kinds of goals that should be able to garner broad , bipartisan support .
At the very least , one can question the wisdom of spending taxpayer money to pass hundreds of symbolic resolutions every two years , rather than debating the great issues at stake .
Indeed , those unfamiliar with Senate procedures might be shocked to learn that even 56 percent of legally binding bills passed the chamber without debate .
But DeMint was n't content to limit himself to such evidence .
In making his point , he ran up the score .
Ultimately , we find that DeMint 's goals , laudable though they may be , are undercut -- not strengthened -- by the math he chose to present in his floor speech .
We 'll own up to our own mathematical error , but we stand by our overall judgment from the initial article : Pants on Fire !
I knew as soon as I saw the wrapping paper with robots dressed as Santa & Xmas trees that this was going to be a cool gift .
The reddit alien was so well done that I thought it was bought in a store ( until I read the attached story and found out it was crocheted ! ) .
The next thing I found in the box was a book that I 've been wanting for a long time , " Good Omens " .
I like the note that came in it too :)
Finally , random stories are definitely fun ... although sorry to hear what a nightmare that trip was !
Thanks again , extremely cool gifts .
Antibodies made entirely from plastic have saved the lives of mice injected with bee venom – the first time such a strategy has worked in live animals .
Researchers developing the antibodies say it is the first step towards customised antibodies for a host of other medical applications , from treating people who have been poisoned to combating infection .
Natural antibodies are made by the body ’s immune system to lock onto a specific “ antigen ” .
Likewise , the plastic antibodies contain cavities moulded in exactly the right shape to capture target molecules , in this case , melittin – the active agent in bee venom .
Faking it
Kenneth Shea of the University of California at Irvine led the team which made melittin antibodies through a process called molecular imprinting .
They used a catalyst to stimulate polymers to form around molecules of bee venom , then dissolved away the venom itself , leaving empty cavities with the exact shape to trap melittin .
Advertisement
Shea injected these tiny plastic nanoparticles into mice 20 seconds after they ’d been injected with bee venom , 60 per cent survived whereas all the untreated mice died .
The plastic antibodies were then destroyed by the liver .
“ We conclude that imprinted polymer nanoparticles efficiently capture melittin in the bloodstream , ” say Shea and his colleagues in the paper .
“ We see this as a very significant paper , and the first demonstration in living things of these materials , effectively using them as a drug , ” says Mike Whitcombe , whose lab at Cranfield University in the UK develops imprinted polymers and runs a database of the polymers available .
Plastic copycats
Philipp Holliger of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge , UK , said that the plastic antibodies do perform some of the functions of natural antibodies – capturing toxins and sending them to the liver for destruction .
“ These properties should make them attractive alternatives to antibodies in antidote anti-toxin treatments , ” he says .
However , Holliger doubts whether they could perform other important functions of natural antibodies , such as priming the body ’s immune system to fight future infections .
Unlike natural antibodies , they are not equipped to communicate with other cells and components of the immune system .

SAN FRANCISCO , May 19 ( Reuters ) - Schlumberger Ltd
SLB .N
, the world 's largest oilfield services company , said on Wednesday it had a crew on the Deepwater Horizon that departed only hours before the explosion and fire that engulfed the rig .
The company , which had not previously revealed its work on the Horizon , said in an emailed statement that it performed wireline services for BP Plc
BP.L
on the rig in March and April , completing the last services on April 15 and leaving a crew on standby in case any more were needed .
" On the morning of April 20 , 2010 , BP notified the Schlumberger crew that it could return to its home base in Louisiana , " Schlumberger said in a statement , which a spokesman for the company confirmed by phone .
The crew departed the rig at about 11:00 a.m. on April 20 on one of BP 's regularly scheduled helicopter flights , Schlumberger said .
The explosion occurred at about 10:00 p.m. that night , and the rig sank two days later , which led to a massive oil spill off the Gulf Coast .

South Africa opened the first World Cup in Africa with a 1 - 1 tie against Mexico in Johannesburg on Friday , weathering early nerves , scoring the tournament ’s first goal and hitting the post with a potential winning shot in the 90th minute .
Henry Romero / Reuters
After a shaky first half dominated by Mexico , Siphiwe Tshabalala corraled a long pass down the left side in the 55th minute and fired the ball across the goalmouth over Mexican goalkeeper Oscar Perez and into the far , top corner .
The crowd of more than 94,000 roared , and suddenly anything seemed possible for the host country .
But Mexico pushed forward and tied the score in the 79th minute when a cross - field pass fell to Rafael Marquez at the far post .
Marquez deadened the ball with his first touch and then lifted it over the charging goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune .
South Africa nearly grabbed a victory in the 90th minute , when forward Katlego Mphela ran down a long ball in the penalty area .
But his shot hit the outside of the left post and bounced away .
Still , South Africa preserved a noteworthy streak : no host country has ever lost in its first game at the World Cup .
Mexico had an apparent goal disallowed in the first half when the linesman ruled — correctly — that Carlos Vela had been in an offside position when he scored from the goalmouth on a corner kick .
In charging for the cross , Khune — who failed to touch it — had played Vela offside .
South Africa ’s next game will be against Uruguay on Wednesday .
Mexico plays France on Thursday .
For a recap of the match as it happened :
Now it ’s South Africa that looks frustrated , especially after taking the lead and then getting one final great chance .
But a tie is fair , the game was clean and we ’re off and running .
Check back later for the second game of the day : Uruguay vs. France .
We ’ll wrap this up in a few minutes .
After that scare , you have to think Mexico would gladly take its point and get out .
Another long ball , but this time Perez comes waaay out and heads the ball over the touch line .
Mphela seemed to be the only one taking that deep ball seriously .
He beat Rodriguez and Perez stayed on his line , but Mphlea knocked it off the left post .
Good thing ; probably would ’ve brought the stadium down .
Was that the last good chance of the game ?
Bernard Parker comes on for him .
Played well .
Forgot to note that Javier Hernandez replaced Franco in the 73rd minute , their third sub .
Guardado lofts a pass to a teammate on the left wing .
But Blanco is not Vela or Aguilar , and it rolls ahead of him out of bounds .
He looked every one of his 37 years there .

Tie game !!
Mexico ’s pushing finally pays off .
On a short corner , Juarez has his pick of players on the far post .
He picks the one farthest — Rafa Marquez — and he calmly pulls the ball down unmarked and fires it past Khune .
It ’s going to be a great final 10 minutes .
You can see South Africa getting behind the defense a lot more as Mexico commits players forward for the tying goal .
It ’s a dangerous game — one they obviously have to play — because it only takes a second for someone to race behind them to a long pass .
At this point , that would finish them .
Masilela cuts down Juarez to slow a Mexican attack , seconds after Mphela missed a another chance to make it 2 - 0 .
He had gotten behind Rodriguez , but fell as they pushed and shoved and could n’t get anything on his shot at Perez .
So close to putting it away .
Blanco comes on for Vela .
Aguirre needs a veteran , and Blanco has been a lucky charm for him over the years .
South Africa has been energized by the goal , and nearly went ahead 2 - 0 there when a deflection fell to Mphela , but he turned it wide .
Dos Santos cuts in on the left — does n’t seem to be getting better there for South Africa — and fires a shot that was going in but for the diving Khune .
Yellow card for Torrado after the goal .
And Andres Guardado has replaced Aguiar .
Gerry Penny / European Pressphoto Agency Thsabalala opens the scoring , sprung down the left side by a great pass from midfield .
Quick touch and then a ripped shot across the goal to the far top corner .
Tremendous shot .
Tremendous goal .
South Africa 1 , Mexico 0
Please stop commenting about the offside call .
I understand the rule ; what I should have said was it appeared Vela was n’t in an offside position with or without the goalkeeper .
But after seeing the replay I can see the call is correct .
So let ’s move on .
With the one change I just mentioned ( Masilela for Thwala at left back ) , we are back under way .
Just did some checking on the offside call ( I ’m not an official ) .
Remember , the offensive player must be even with the second - to - last defender , so when Khune charged that corner and missed it he actually did himself a favor .
Vela was left with only one player between himself and the goal .
Was just going to say something about how Mexico had tortured South Africa ’s left back , Lucas Thwala , in the first half , but he ’s out now — Masilela , who many had expected to start , is on .
Pedro Ugarte / Agence France - Presse — Getty Images
The whistle goes for halftime .
Mexico ’s players look frustrated not to be ahead , and they probably should be — but not just because the referee disallowed an apparent clear goal by Vela .
They controlled the possession for long stretches and have only themselves ( O.K. , mostly Guillermo Franco , who missed a couple of good ones ) to blame for not grabbing the lead .
South Africa is just where is needed to be at halftime — not behind .
They stared very slowly , and were lucky not to fall behind by a goal or even two .
Mphela missed a sitter just before the break , and they had one or two other chances .
But it seems clear that they ’re going to have to find a way to score off a set piece ; that will certainly be easier than carving up Mexico .
Pienaar ( corrected : it was Tshabalala ) breaks down the left and curls a cross in front for Mphela on the spot .
But he just misses the header .
Great chance .
That would have been a bitter pill for Mexico .
This could be where Mexico is vulnerable , and even though the ball sailed through the box you can see why .
Perez mis-timed his leap and missed the ball , and South Africa ’s size advantage was apparent across the box .
Martin Tyler ’s seen a lot more soccer than I have , and even he ca n’t explan why Mexico ’s not leading , 1 - 0 , right now .
A Torrado corner finds Vela alone at the back post , and he traps it off his chest and slams it home — but the whistle has stopped play .
A bit confusing , because there was a defender on the line with the goalkeeper , so Vela could n’t have been offside .
Aguirre is furious !!!
A wheeling Vela on the right corner of the box springs Franco into the area , but Khune charges and knocks the ball down .
Great play on both sides .
Still no score , but Mexico is once again looking like it ’s going to get a goal before the half .
As I wrote that , Vela fired in another cross from the right wing — again , just a step in front of Franco .
This time it ’s Mexico ’s Marquez .
But maybe the goalkeepers knew what they were talking about when they complained about the new ball .
If they do n’t have to worry about free kicks from distance dropping over walls , though , it could change the way they play .
A six - man move forces a diving stop from Perez on the end line .
But Mexico is still dominating possession with their four - man midfield .
South Africa is cluttering things up a bit ; it ’s in a 3 - 5 - 1 , but the players still seem to be doing more chasing .
Matt Dunham / Associated Press Efrain Juarez gets the first yellow of the tournament for an awkward chest trap that included a lot more of his left arm than his chest .
He broke up a South African possession , though , so there was a tradeoff .
Dos Santos , meanwhile , drives the other way and fires past Khune from about 18 yards .
A whistling shot , it went wide left .
Steven Pienaar takes South Africa ’s first free kick — straight on from about 25 yards — but it sails over Perez and the crossbar .
Fly Jabulani !
Fly !
Another driven corner from dos Santos , and Franco slices in for an open header but sends it over the bar .
South Africa better tighten up in there .
Dos Santos is dropping the ball wherever he wants , and it ’s only a matter of time before someone on the other end connects .
It took a while , but South Africa finally got a ball in the Mexican penalty area .
Unfortunately it was Khumalo , a central defender , doing the crossing , and his pass landed five yards behind the two men charging into the box .
South Africa ’s only touches in the first two minutes were three frantic attempts to clear .
Aguilar fired in a dangerous cross that the goalkeeper parried into the path of Dos Santos , but Mokoena arrived just in time to slam it away .
On the ensuing corner , Marquez ’s flicked header was also cleared .
But both chances were very threatening .
Soccer City , as you ’d think , is pulsing after the anthems .
You can see the tension in the players ’ faces .
GK - Oscar Perez , Franciso Rodriguez , Carlos Salcido , Rafael Marquez , Ricardo Osorio , Gerardo Torrado , Guillermo Franco , Carlos Vela , Paul Aguilar , Efrain Juarez , Giovanni dos Santos .
So a mix of cool veterans and flashy youth from Javier Aguirre , just as expected .
And the 37 - year - old Perez in goal .
the more experience Franco for Javier Hernandez is the only change from their last exhibition .
Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira announced Thursday he would go with the same lineup he used in South Africa ’ most recent qualifiers : GK–Itumeleng Khune , DEF–Siboniso Gaxa , Bongani Khumalo , Aaron Mokoena , Lucas Thwala , MF–Teko Modise , Reneilwe Letsholonyane , Kagisho Dikgacoi , Siphiwe Tshabalala , Steven Pienaar , F–Katlego Mphela .
Good morning everyone , and welcome to the Times ’s live analysis of the World Cup .
What can we expect ?
Just as it is difficult to overstate the importance of today ’s game to South Africans , it is tough to overstate the task that awaits their team if it hopes to get off to a winning start .
A trendy pick to make a deep run in the tournament , Mexico enters as one of the hottest teams in the world .
The Mexicans are fresh off a unity - building exhibition tour in which they played 12 games — the most of any of team in the field .
They went 8 - 2 - 2 in those games , losing only to England and the Netherlands but earning their first victory against Italy .
Unlike past Mexican squads , populated mostly by home - based pros , this year ’s team is bolstered by a growing number of players groomed in tougher European leagues .
There are rising stars like Giovanni dos Santos and Carlos Vela , as well as a core of World Cup - tested veterans like Rafael Marquez , Gerardo Torrado and the seemingly ageless Cuauhtemoc Blanco .
After flirting with disaster in qualifying , they are now hoping to become the first Mexican team to advance past the quarterfinals .
South Africa will look for leadership from the speedy midfielder Steven Pienaar and the captain Aaron Mokoena , but its biggest advantages today could be pride , emotion and the full - throated , vuvuzela - honking backing of more than 94,000 fans inside Soccer City .
“ Our 12th man , ” Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira said .
Today it might feel like 13 , or 14 , or 20 .
The South Africans may need all the help they can get .
As we await kickoff , here are a few things to watch for as the game progresses :
Experience .
Will Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre lean toward experience with his lineup rather than younger talents — like the new Manchester United signing Javier Hernandez — who might get overwhelmed by the stakes and the setting ?
As confident as he is , the one thing he ca n’t afford is a loss , especially since Mexico plays France , the group favorite , in its second game .
Momentum .
If South Africa can grab the lead , or keep the score tied late in the second half , watch to see if Mexico starts to feel the pressure .
Bickering , finger - pointing and rough fouls would be a sure sign that the players are getting rattled .
The unexpected .
A red card , an injury , or a penalty kick given or denied could change everything .
And we ’ll never see it coming .
Check back in a bit for updates .
But in the meantime , what are you hoping to see today ?

Congress must ensure that obscenity laws are enforced so that children are not exposed to pornography on the Internet , researchers and advocates of Internet safety said Tuesday .
Speaking at a briefing at the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center , researchers said because obscenity laws have not been upheld or enforced , illegal adult pornography has flooded and polluted the Internet .
“ Today we are calling on Congress and the Department of Justice to ensure that the enforcement of our current obscenity laws is a priority , ” said Donna Rice Hughes , president of Enough Is Enough , a Virginia - based nonprofit that works to make the Internet safer for children and families .
“ Our children ’s innocence is worth fighting for . ”
Under the law , illegal adult pornography is known as obscenity .
Obscenity is defined as graphic material that focuses on sex or sexual violence , and it includes lewd exhibition of the genitals , close - ups of graphic sex acts and deviant activities such as group sex , bestiality and incest .
“ It continues to grow and to spread and has reached epidemic proportions , ” Mrs. Hughes said .
“ We are facing a national crisis that is every bit as damaging to our citizens and our culture as the oil spill is to the Gulf and the Gulf community . ”
Statistics show that seven in 10 children have accidentally accessed pornography on the Internet and one in three have done so intentionally .
Forty percent of children accidentally access Internet pornography through innocent word searches such as “ water sports . ”
Statistics show that the average age of exposure is 11 years old - some start at 8 years old .
Any child is too young , Mrs. Hughes said .
“ Imagery definitely affects children , ” said Dr. Sharon Cooper , a forensic pediatrician and faculty member at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill School of Medicine .
“ Adult pornography is a good example of giving children unhealthy sexual images . ”
Pornography normalizes sexual harm , Dr. Cooper said .
It shows children a lack of any kind of emotional commitment or relationship between two consensual partners , shows unprotected sexual contact and visual examples often of violent rape .
“ When a child sees this image of adult pornography , the mirror neurons that are in their brain will convince them that they are actually experiencing what they are seeing , ” she said .
Children are very vulnerable as compared to adults because of the presence of mirror neurons in the brain , Dr. Cooper said .
Mirror neurons are part of the brain that convince us that when we see something we are actually experiencing it .
According to the American Psychological Association , over the past 12 years , girls have changed in their thinking .
They are beginning to see themselves as having their only value in sexuality .
“ When a child sees herself only as a sexual object , she is no longer able to demand the kind of respect she deserves , ” Dr. Cooper said .
“ The new definition of ‘ love ’ these days is sending a sexually explicit picture . ”

Who does Irelands befuddled Prime Minister Brian Cowen think hes kidding ?
In the same day as two seminal reports into Irelands banking crisis emerged -- a catastrophic event of historic proportions that has brought this small , open economy to its knees -- Cowen does what he 's always done :
He avoids any responsibility and tries to pass the buck .
The Sources of Irelands Banking Crisis by economic consultants Klaus Regling and Max Watson and The Irish Banking Crisis : Regulatory and Financial Stability Policy 2003 - 2008 by Central ...
South Australian Treasurer Kevin Foley has admitted he knew about a cost blowout for the proposed Adelaide Oval redevelopment before the election was called this year .
Mr Foley said in Parliament last week he was first told of a cost blowout 10 days after the March 20 election .
But now he has admitted there was a meeting on February 19 at which the head of the SANFL , Leigh Whicker , warned him of increased costs .
" I was concentrating on the Stadium Management Authority meetings .
I had completely forgot about a meeting I had the day before we called the election , " he said .
" I did not hide it , I did not keep it a secret .
I knew I 'd made a mistake , I told plenty of people in government that , it was an honest error .
" Why would I go into Parliament , knowingly lie , when people knew I had a meeting with Leigh Whicker ?
I 'm not that dumb - I got full of myself and made a statement to the Parliament that was wrong and the record needs to be corrected . "
Mr Whicker is also the head of the Stadium Management Authority .
Authority chairman Ian McLachlan said the Government 's steering committee was alerted in February about cost pressures , but the Government was written to formally at the end of April about a cost blowout .
" I can't remember what we said but we would have said , probably informed them ... the whole thing was very difficult and tight .
We told them that a number of times and then we went into caretaker mode for the election so we did n't have any meetings - it was inappropriate , " he said .
Another $ 85 million of state funding was committed to the project last month , taking the SA Government 's contribution to $ 535 million .
Shadow treasurer Iain Evans is demanding drastic action .
" There is a very high standard for Ministers .
Ministers that mislead the Parliament resign .
That is a Westminster standard , " he said .
The Treasurer says he will correct the record in State Parliament as soon as he can .
Teachers at Mount Si High School , in the Snoqualmie Valley in western Washington State , could have done more to aid the 14 - year - old freshman boy attacked in the locker room after coming to the defense of a friend perceived as gay by bullies , according to the just - released results of an independent investigation .
Like call 911 .
The attack , which took place in November after weeks of taunts , left the defender of the “ suspected gay ” with a broken eye socket , concussion , and two broken teeth .
This is high school , might we remind you .
The Seattle Times reports in an extensive story on the school :
On Friday , Nov. 6 , shortly after noon , the two 14 - year - olds came into the locker room to change after PE class .
Johnson said the freshman who allegedly led the harassment started taunting the one boy about his presumed sexual orientation .
When Johnson ’s son swore and told him to leave his friend alone , a 16 - year - old junior stepped into the dispute .
He struck Johnson ’s son twice in the face , lifted him off a bench , kneed him in the face and , when he fell to the ground , kicked him , according to witness statements to the police .
A school - surveillance camera caught the 16 - year - old leaving the locker room , shaking his hand as if in pain , said Johnson , who has watched the tape .
Johnson was summoned to the school by a frantic call from her son .
When she arrived about 1 p.m. , she said her son was bleeding from the eye and nose and was nearly “ unrecognizable ” on the left side of his face .
She assumed that an aid car had been called , but one was n’t summoned until 1:16 p.m. , according to police records .
She also learned that a vice principal had asked the boy to go back to the locker room and search for his missing tooth .
And so here comes the report .
Late Thursday afternoon , the Snoqualmie Valley School District released the report of an independent investigation into the assault and the school ’s response .
The report concluded that administrators could have handled some things differently .
For example , numerous administrators could have called 911 but did not , the report said .
Nonetheless , it concluded the failings were unintentional .
The report makes no conclusions about the school ’s handling of possible bullying .
The report ends with the hope that the high school and district can work with the assault victim and his family to rebuild trust so the boy can “ have a successful high - school career . ”
The parents of the beating victim and the friend who was taunted said they both removed their sons from school .
They have not seen the district ’s report , but say that seven months after the assault they remain angry over the school ’s handling of the incident .
No wonder .
When one of the boys ’ mothers met with the principal and requested he merely make an announcement about the assault to students and faculty , he refused .
Administrators left the suspected attacker attend the same class as the victim .
And they warned the boys ’ mothers against telling their teachers about the assault because of legal confidentiality rules .
And so ,
After several months of frustration , the mothers took their concerns to the Snoqualmie Valley School Board which in March ordered the investigation .
But Sommers said the investigator did not talk to her or her son , and she remains critical of the district for not addressing the bullying as a factor in the assault .
From there it ’s been reduced to he - said she - said .
The school says it did n’t know sexuality was a factor in the assault , and claims the boys did n’t tell administrators about the taunts until weeks later .
The mothers , meanwhile , did not inform administrators about their taunts .
This is the same high school that , in 2008 , saw hundreds of protesters on each side of the Day of Silence debate “ clash ” outside ( see top photo ) .
It happened again in 2009 ( see photo , right ) .
In April of this year , the Seattle Times notes , there were no protests .
But 432 people , or 30 percent of the student body , skipped .
And it ’s not getting any better .
George Potratz , a language - arts teacher at Mount Si , said he ’s been disciplined twice for standing up for gay students , once when he booed Hutcherson ’s appearance as the school ’s Dr. Martin Luther King Day speaker in 2008 , and again last year when he taught a poem before the Day of Silence by Walt Whitman about the loss of a male lover .
School administrators have done little in the last two years , he said , “ to foster student understanding of gay people . ”
The result , Potratz said , is that some students “ feel entitled and empowered to aggressively voice their intolerant attitudes . ”
The school has published a response ( PDF ) to the Times article .
It does n’t get into many specifics , but it assures parents “ school administrators and staff immediately attended to the needs of the injured student and worked to gather facts surrounding the incident , which then resulted in appropriate sanctions for those involved . ”
Further : “ Over the past two years , Mount Si High School has initiated a number of activities that focus on respect and diversity .
These efforts range from establishing a Diversity and Respect Team ( DART ) comprised of students , parents , staff and community members ; providing staff training ; increasing student awareness through presentations and recognition ; and ongoing initiatives that center on cultural responsiveness .
This is an area we value and have made a priority during the past two years .
We intend to continue and expand these efforts in the future . ”

A few hours before the start of the G8 , CNW Group refused to distribute my factual press release respecting a long - term case of systemic corruption at the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ; the same well - documented case that I have been addressing on this blog and which is directly associated with my precedent - setting legal case ( Mahar v Rogers Cable Systems Ltd. ) ( Allegations of Canadian corruption blocked hours before start of G8 , 25 June 2010 ) .
Despite several phone calls , emails , and providing the company with all of the documents submitted to Prime Minister Stephen Harper by my legal counsel Paul Armarego , CNW Group representatives did not budge and refused to distribute my press release as I requested to the New York media market .
Although CNW Group has previously issued several related press releases for me in relation to this issue , company representative Mr Marche said that press releases are evaluated on a “ case - by - case basis ” and it was not possible for his company to distribute this particular one unless it was authorized by the company ’s legal department ; which was closed at the time .
Here are some of my previous press that CNW Group did recently distribute : ( Prime Minister Harper notified of billion - dollar CRTC scandal , 3 June 2010 ) : ( Allegation CBC ’s Richard Stursberg aware of ‘ Mediascam ’ , 10 June 2010 ) : ( CRTC chairman notified of corruption in 2007 and 2008 , 14 , June 2010 ) and ( Letter to PM alleging systemic corruption posted online , 21 June 2010 ) .
Frankly , I am at a loss to find a logical rationale for this news blockage right before the start of the G8 Summit in Canada ; precisely at a time when this unique case of systemic corruption and its potential implications would be appreciated by world leaders .
Furthermore , I have also been informed by CNW Group that PR Newswire in the US is refusing to distribute my press release .
“ The Editorial Supervisor of our US affiliate has deemed that the release cannot be issued citing that the release contains allegations of corruption with no reference to actual legal proceedings . ”
Basically , I ’ve been press release blacklisted in North America !
Maybe it is a good thing that I live in Australia .
Anyway , the whole thing might simply be a misunderstanding .
I ’ve sent additional information to CNW to share with PR Newswire and I am looking forward to the pending decisions by their respective lawyers on whether or not the companies will distribute my press release .
Better late than never .
But if you do not want to wait for lawyers to determine what is acceptable for public distribution in terms of this case of government corruption in the G8 , I ’ve posted a copy of the blocked press release below for your review .
Also , here are some online forums that you may wish to join and documents to read if you are interested in the facts contained in the blocked press release below .

Allegations of unprecedented case of government corruption in G8
New York Times correspondent Ian Austen has today been notified of an alleged billion - dollar scandal at the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) ; the same quasi- judicial regulatory tribunal which restricts the distribution of American television programming in Canada .
The highly damning allegations involve Canadian companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange : Rogers Communications Inc ( NYSE : RCI ) and Shaw Communications Inc ( NYSE : SJR ) .
On 3 June 2010 , Prime Minister Stephen Harper was provided with a pound of documents and a letter from lawyer Paul Armarego in relation to this issue , on behalf of former Canadian broadcasting insider Keith Mahar .
Mr Austen has been provided with the same documents submitted to Canada ’s prime minister ; as well as a copy of the response by the Prime Minister ’s Office , dated 9 June 2010 .
A copy of Mr Armarego ’s letter is available on Mr Mahar ’s blog , where he claims “ the long - term case of systemic corruption addressed to Prime Minister Harper by Mr Armarego is unprecedented in the G8 ” ( www.mentalympian.wordpress.com).
Professor Matthew Fraser has publicly stated that the CRTC is plagued by “ institutionalized corruption ” and that its operations are based on “ backroom deals , furtively dispensed favours and institutionalized cronyism ” ( National Post , 10 June 2000 ) .
At issue is a long - term scheme that first surfaced in the final month that the Right Honourable Brian Mulroney was Canada ’s prime minister , one permitting influential Canadian media corporations to overcharge millions of citizens for cable television service if donations were made to subsidize private companies .
According to information in Mr Armarego ’s letter , this scheme was designed by CRTC commissioners to unjustly enrich some of the wealthiest Canadians at that time ; including Ted Rogers , JR Shaw and André Chagnon .
Features of the unjust corporate enrichment scandal reported to Prime Minister Harper include the following :
Monopoly cable companies permitted by CRTC officials to overcharge millions of Canadians for basic cable service if the firms opted to donate money to subsidize private companies .
Monopoly cable companies not required to do any work or provide any service for the revenue retained .
Monopoly cable companies not required by CRTC officials to account for the use of the money retained under the scheme ; thereby fostering cross-subsidization and unfair competition in contravention of public policy .
Monopoly cable companies permitted by CRTC officials to improperly siphon revenue out of the Canadian broadcasting system .
CRTC officials sanctioned monopoly cable companies to collect monthly fees under false pretence from millions of Canadians .
CRTC officials provided false and misleading information to Parliament and journalists .
On 31 May 2010 , in an unrelated Canadian public inquiry , Justice Jeffrey Oliphant determined that Mr Mulroney ’s business dealings were “ inappropriate ” in relation to the former prime minister accepting envelopes stuffed with $ 1,000 bills from a German arm ’s dealer after he left office in June 1993 .

In last week ’s newsletter , we reported that the staff of the Senate Committee on Aging , led by Senator Kohl ( D - WI ) , was preparing a surprise ambush of dietary supplements in a Senate hearing held last Wednesday .
We were right .
But we did n’t anticipate how seriously distorted the major media news stories would be .
The centerpiece of the hearing was a report by the GAO ( Government Accounting Office ) of the testing they had done on 40 herbal supplement bottles at the Committee ’s request .
An incomplete account of the GAO report was leaked to major media , probably by committee staff , the night before the hearing and produced dramatic headlines .
The trouble is that all these headlines were seriously misleading .
Here are a few examples :
New York Times : “ Study Finds Supplements Contain Contaminants ”
CBS News : “ Many Supplements Contain Lead , Arsenic ”
AOL News : “ Herbal Supplements May Pose Health Risk ”
At least AOL told the reader that this was n’t about vitamins or minerals , just herbs .
But , contrary to the AOL headline , the GAO found that the herbal supplements did not pose health risks .
The GAO reported that “ FDA and EPA officials did not express concern regarding any immediate negative health consequences from consuming these supplements . ”
To understand why this is so , you have to know that the GAO found only “ trace ” amounts of the metals , in many cases barely above the level of detectability , far below the levels that the FDA or EPA worries about .
And you also have to know that these metals naturally occur in air , water , soil , and food , so they are to be expected at some level in herbal supplements .
The critical question is not whether they are there , but rather at what level .
The human body has evolved with these metals in our food .
Consequently we have the ability to metabolize and excrete them and we do so every day .
A problem arises when we ingest or absorb too much for our bodies to handle .
AOL also claimed in the first sentence of its story that the supplements were “ laced ” with heavy metals .
Laced ?
This suggests large amounts and that someone had put them there intentionally .
( We thank AOL News for subsequently deleting the word “ laced ” at our request . )
Here is an example of what would have been a truthful headline : Trace Amounts Of Lead , Arsenic , And Other Metals , Naturally Found In Air , Water , Soil , And Consequently Food , Were Found In A Limited Sample of Herbal Supplements Derived From Plants , But At Levels Generally Considered Safe .
That headline would not of course have run .
It would have made it clear that there was n’t much of a story .
Why did the major media get their reporting so wrong ?
In some cases , the stories directly contradicted their headlines .
Of course the New York Times , CBS News , and similar mainstream media have a long history of attacking natural health approaches in general , and supplements in particular .
They are also on the financial ropes these days and would probably go bankrupt without the major drug company advertising they get .
Please do n’t misunderstand .
ANH - USA is not in favor of heavy metals .
In fact we often have defended the right of integrative doctors to treat for heavy metal contamination .
And we are not shills for the supplement industry .
One of our supporters ( Charles ) recently sent us the following message : “ The way you are spinning this [ story ] sounds like you are speaking for the supplements industry .
I am not interested in taking contaminated supplements .
I want clean , uncontaminated supplements that I do n’t have to worry about .
I ’d rather pay more and know that there are some standards for evaluating supplements .
I do n’t want to be ingesting lead ! ”
We could n’t agree more about not wanting to ingest lead .
But there is much more to know about it .
For example , we need to understand that each time we take a bite of spinach we are ingesting lead .
FDA testing suggests that there is 7.0 mcg of lead in an average serving of four ounces of boiled spinach .
Shrimp is higher : 23.8mcg .
Peaches are lower : 3.4 mcg .
Whole wheat bread is lower still at 2.8 mcg and milk is 1.2 mcg .
We do not , however , stop eating spinach .
Even with the small amount of lead ( equivalent to about 7 parts per million ) , nutritional scientists agree that spinach does us much more good than harm .
Overall the FDA says that we should try not to ingest more than 75 mcg of lead per day .
The World Health Organization says we can ingest ( and safely excrete ) up to 243 mcg per day ( this assumes we weigh 150 pounds ) .
The amount of lead we know is too much to excrete safely is higher still .
How much lead was in the 40 bottles tested by the GAO ?
Of the 37 bottles with trace amounts of lead , the echinacea had the most ( .043 mcg to 1.290 mcg ) .
The peppermint had the least ( .007 mcg to .023 mcg ) .
Note that .007 is barely detectable ; the lowest lead that can be detected is .005 mcg .
Is this what the media were terrifying us about ?
This leads to an important point .
Some supplements will be more lead free than others .
The highest end supplement companies test each batch of supplement material to be sure it is what it is supposed to be , for potency , for heavy metals , and for pesticides .
These tests are very important , especially since so much supplement material comes from China .
Not surprisingly , supplements that have been put through more tests may cost more .
Of course many consumers cannot afford any supplements at all , much less high end products , and if the FDA has its way , supplements would cost as much as drugs .
You may be able to consume less lead by choosing carefully among supplements .
But keep in mind that there is a paradox here .
The more “ natural ” a supplement , the more it is based on plants , the more likely it is to contain lead .
Even the highest end supplement companies cannot remove every bit of the lead in a product that is based on spinach and other similar greens .
By the way , the GAO report covered four heavy metals and a number of pesticides as well .
Some of the stories spoke of “ illegal ” pesticide levels .
One or more trace pesticide was found in fewer than half the herbal samples and , like the metals , was in an amount lower than what you might get in food .
The reason any amount of pesticide may be illegal is that in many cases the EPA has not gotten around to stating an allowable level , something it is supposed to do , and absent a guideline any amount is technically illegal , even though the pesticide may be common in food .
To reduce the risk of pesticides , supplement buyers might try , in addition to choosing brands carefully , to buy organic supplements , but even these may have tiny trace amounts of pesticides from rain water and other sources .
Lastly , let ’s not imagine , as Charles may or may not have meant to suggest , that increasing the FDA ’s budget will lead to safer , higher quality supplements .
The 1994 law governing supplements ( DSHEA ) ordered the FDA to establish good manufacturing practices ( GMP ’s ) for supplement makers .
The FDA dragged its heals for years .
GMP ’s for supplement makers will only finally come into force for all supplement companies next month , sixteen years after passage of the bill !
There always have been and , we have to assume , still are some bad actors among supplement companies .
The FDA should move against them , but does not .
It has plenty of regulatory authority to do so .
The testimony of the Deputy Director of the FDA at the Kohl Senate hearing acknowledged this authority .
So why does the Agency hold back ?
There is evidence that , at least in the past , the Agency had a conscious policy of not regulating supplements in the hope that this would lead to a crisis ; the crisis would then lead to a requirement for full drug approval for supplements .
Currently the Agency claims it lacks the money to do its job although it ’s budget has been sharply increased .
There is a lot more we could tell you about the Senate hearing .
But this is plenty for this week ’s report .
The bottom line : although designed to “ ambush ” supplements , the facts presented were hardly an indictment .
They could just as easily be taken as a validation of the general safety even of herbal supplements , the supplements most likely to contain heavy metals or pesticides .
All of us at ANH - USA are consumers of supplements .
We care about supplement safety for the same reasons you do .
We will have more to say about this important subject in future newsletters .
By the way , supplements have recently been under steady attack in Congress , so naturally our newsletter has focused on them .
But we cover all of natural health and health freedom and have lots of non-supplement news to share with you as soon as space permits .

Less than 24 hours after making his first trade of the offseason , Sharks General Manager and Executive Vice President Doug Wilson announced a major shakeup in the Sharks lineup : goalie Evgeni Nabokov will not be returning to the team after Wilson declined to offer him a UFA contract .
“ We ’ve made a decision to go a different direction on the goaltender , ” explained Wilson in a meeting with Bay Area media on Tuesday at Sharks Ice .
“ I had a conversation with him this morning because he deserves that respect and he ’ll get nothing but great reviews on what he ’s meant to this organization .
" According to Wilson , Nabokov ’s reaction to the news was “ professional ” and “ the type of emotion that would be expected . ”
The Sharks General Manager delivered the news at Sharks Ice in a face - to - face meeting prior to sitting down with the media .
“ He ’s been a big part of our successes and I have a great respect for him as a player , as a man , as a teammate and a guy who gets involved with his community .
We ’ve got some very good , young goaltenders that are trending up and Nabby certainly deserves credit for their growth .
” Wilson explained that after examining trends in the National Hockey League over the last three or four years --- in particular , the dollars that are spent on goalies --- the organization has decided to put their faith in 24 - year - old Thomas Greiss , 22 - year - old Alex Stalock and possibly a veteran goalie from the free agency market .
“ I ca n’t talk about other team ’s players obviously for many reasons , but there is a pool of people that are out there that I think you ’ll see available going forward .
” It 's a prosperous market for GM 's looking for goaltending .
Unrestricted free agents include Marty Turco , Jose Theodore , former Shark Vesa Toskala , Chris Mason , Dan Ellis , Ray Emery , Martin Biron , Johan Hedberg , Patrick Lalime , Alex Auld , Stephen Valiquette , Stephen Valiquette and Antero Niittymaki ( to name a few ) .
Wilson ’s looking for not just “ who ” , but “ what ” has been winning in this League .
And it ’s not hard to see the trend .
25 - year - old back - up goaltender Jaroslav Halak ( now with the St. Louis Blues ) was paid $ 750,000 last season when he led the No. 8 seeded Canadiens to the Eastern Conference Finals .
26 - year - old rookie Antti Niemi led the Chicago Blackhawks to their first Stanley Cup win in 49 years on $ 826,875 after stealing the starting spot from Cristobal Huet who earns $ 5,625,000 .
Former Shark Brian Boucher and Michael Leighton back - stopped Philadelphia to the Stanley Cup Finals with salaries of $ 925,000 and $ 600,000 respectively .
It ’s possible to steal the show with lesser known goalies .
On the opposite end of the spectrum , New Jersey Devil ’s goaltender Marin Brodeur has made $ 5,200,000 for each of the past four seasons even though he has n’t led his team past the first round since 2006 .
Vancouver ’s Roberto Luongo made $ 7,500,000 last year but could n’t get his Canucks past the second round .
Apart from the goalie saga , the Sharks focus seemingly turns to Patrick Marleau , the other top unrestricted free agent whose contract expires June 30 .
Does Wilson ’s decision to let Nabokov go mean that he ’s making an effort to re-signing Marleau ?
“ I think under this system , it ’s a concerted effort to re-sign all our guys that we want here going forward , ” said Wilson .
“ The dedication of dollars is not to just a one - year number .
What we ’re all looking at is getting some terms .
Some of these players --- Patty , Pavelski , etc. --- are not going to be one or two year deals .
You ’re looking at probably four to five year deals .
” So although Marleau is a priority , he ’s not the only priority .
Wilson is also working on re-signing Joe Pavelski , Devin Setoguchi , Manny Malhotra , Scott Nichol and Niclas Wallin who will be restricted free agents starting July 1 .
Pavelski , the darling of the Sharks playoffs , scored 17 points ( nine goals , eight assists ) and three game - winning goals in the postseason after coming off a 51 point season ( 25 goals , 26 assists ) where he played a steady presence on the Sharks second line .
Since Pavelski is just coming into his prime , it can be argued that his contract negotiation ranks right up there with Marleau ’s .
STAUBITZ TO MINNESOTAPrior to discussing his decision about Nabokov , Wilson commented on the deal that sent Brad Staubitz to Minnesota in exchange for a fifth round pick in the upcoming Draft .
“ The Brad Staubitz deal was based on the pretty extensive depth on the right side , ” explained Wilson .
“ We were adding players like Cam MacIntyre and Tommy Wingles into the mix in addition to the guys that we ’ve had this past year .
I always promised Brad that if he was n’t going to get the opportunity to play , that I would provide that opportunity to him .
He ’s going to a good place and a coach that knows him very well .
” SHARKS PR EARNS NOMINATIONThe Professional Hockey Writers Association announced today that the Boston Bruins , Chicago Blackhawks , Philadelphia Flyers , Phoenix Coyotes , San Jose Sharks and Washington Capitals are finalists for the Dick Dillman Award , given annually to the team judged to be tops in media relations .
The Dillman Award honors the memory of the late Dick Dillman , who was a highly respected media relations guru for the now - defunct Minnesota North Stars .
The PHWA presents separate Dillman awards for the Eastern and Western Conferences .
The Bruins , Capitals and Flyers are the Eastern candidates , while the Blackhawks , Coyotes and Sharks are finalists in the West .
The winners will be announced at the NHL draft in Los Angeles on June 25 .
The Sharks won the Dillman award in 2004 , and have won the last three Dillman awards in the Western Conference .
The Capitals have won the Eastern Conference Dillman for the past three seasons .
All members of the PHWA are eligible to vote for the Award , and voters are asked to consider multiple factors , including , fairness , cooperation , efficiency , accuracy and presentation of media notes , quality of media guide and willingness to help facilitate interviews .
" Dick Dillman was a quality PR executive and wonderful man , " said PHWA President Kevin Allen .
" He was a friend to our members for many years , and it's a privilege to honor people who do their job the way Dick did his . "
We often have visitors chatting in different languages ; Comm100 ’s auto - translation feature is great .
We also love the canned messages tool because it makes it easy to ensure all of our customer - facing communication is aligned and customers are getting the same answer .
The Comm100 dashboard is also super easy to use : I can see how many agents are currently on chat , how many ongoing chats they currently have , and if there ’s a queue .
I can then make informed decisions about how and when to deploy our chat agents .
I ’m not exactly sure what is going on , but apparently the LDS Church is increasingly worried about this whole atheism thing .
Russell M. Nelson just gave a talk to young adults in Massachusetts in which he railed against atheism .
This combines with a talk from the October 2009 conference ( I did n’t listen to it , but caught mention of it in this Mormon Expression podcast ) that decried atheism as well .
While the entire text of his talk is missing , I get the distinct impression he is saying that everything about atheism is bad and it will lead to the downfall of the U.S .
So , here ’s my guess why this is popping up these days :
The LDS Church is losing even more people these days than it did in the early oughts ( 2000 - 2009 ) , and people today are telling their bishops ( or writing in their resignation letters ) that the reason for their decision to leave is that they do n’t believe in a god anymore , particularly the Mormon god ( you know , Elohim , the embodied , hyper - sexual , uber - polygamist , misogynistic , genocidal maniac who supposedly listens to prayers , but never seems to do anything except cause natural disasters , probably because he ’s too busy having sex with his billions of wives ) .
What do you think ?
What ’s with the recent spate of anti-atheist rants by Mormon GAs ?
( On a side note , I ’m clearly really far out of Mormonism at this point as I have a hard time even understanding why the LDS Newsroom would be proud of something like Nelson ’s talk and post it on their blog .
If someone I knew spoke this unintelligently about atheism , I ’d do my very best to distance myself from him / her .
It seems like damage control is more in order than advertising , though they are the ones who broke the news about Bruce Hafen ’s gay bashing , and they seemed to think that was good news as well .
Someone in the PR department needs to be fired … )
West Ham United have sacked manager Gianfranco Zola after a traumatic season which nearly ended in relegation .
Zola , who took charge in September 2008 , led the side to just seven home wins in a campaign disrupted by public criticism from the club 's new co-owners , David Sullivan and David Gold .
They finished fourth from bottom , five points above Burnley .
The announcement was made following a meeting between Zola and the owners to discuss the club 's future structure .
The future of his assistant Steve Clarke is unclear .
Mark Hughes and Slaven Bilic have been linked with the vacancy .
A club statement said : " West Ham United can confirm that they have terminated the contract of Gianfranco Zola .
" The Board of Directors would like to thank him for his contribution and wish him well for the future .
The club will now be focusing its efforts on seeking a replacement . "
“ The dirtiest little secret in America ” is that family courts , in deciding custody , often wreak devastation upon mothers and children .
So argue Mo Therese Hannah and Barry Goldstein , editors of the new anthology Domestic Violence , Abuse , and Child Custody , which brings to light what many familiar with the family court system have long known :
Designed to dispense justice , the system has become instead “ an instrument of oppression , ” particularly in cases involving domestic violence .
To find a chilling example of what the editors mean , we need look no further than the recent murder of infant Wyatt Garcia , reported in the Daily Beast :
Wyatt Garcia was born in April 2009 .
Nine months later , he was shot and killed by his father , who then turned the gun on himself .
It might have turned out differently — if a family - court judge had listened to Wyatt ’s mother .
Wyatt ’s mother , Katie Tagle , had previously filed three motions in family court for an order of protection against the baby ’s father , Stephen Garcia , alleging that he had physically assaulted her and harassed her and her family .
Garcia was apparently jealous that she was dating again .
In the last motion , Tagle charged that Garcia “ had threatened to kill her and their baby . ”
The San Bernardino County Superior Court Judge Robert Lemkau chose to believe Garcia ’s denials over the evidence supplied by Tagle–which included emails , text messages , and voice messages , according to the Daily Beast .
Tagle says she was treated like a “ criminal ” and “ complaining woman . ”
One goal of Hannah and Goldstein ’s book is to convince judges , attorneys , and others who work in the court system that all forms of abusive behavior , whether physical , verbal , financial or legal , cause harm to women and children .
On the legal side , men who abuse their female intimate partners have successfully used strategies such as false accusations , harassment , manipulation , and intimidation to win custody while often driving their victims into poverty .
According to contributing author and lawyer Joan Zorza :
Abusive men not only harass their victims , many harass their partners ’ lawyers and manipulate those in and connected with the court system who are supposed to insure that children are placed with their better parent in a safe , nurturing environment .
This makes it all the stranger that about half of the time batterers win custody in family courts .
They are actually more likely to win custody than men who do not abuse their partners , according to Zorza .
Over the past nine months , 75 children have been murdered by abusive fathers who used custody battles to get even with the mothers , according to the Daily Beast .
Yet Katie Tagle ’s dismissive treatment by family courts is all - too - familiar .
While there has been a growing awareness over the last 30 years of the harm domestic violence causes , courts are more and more ignoring women ’s allegations of domestic violence and holding them responsible for their own abuse .
This is largely due to courts ’ reliance upon mental health experts who have inadequate training in intimate violence or child sexual abuse and who are easily manipulated by batterers .
Gender bias plays a large role in this backlash , according to the editors :
Compared to men , women are disbelieved more often , held to much higher standards , and judged far more punitively for failings such as drinking , use of drugs , adultery , or hostility to their partners .
… Such behaviors are readily seen as grounds for giving the father custody .
Hannah and Goldstein hope to also expose two particularly harmful court practices that have evolved over the last several decades : Parental Alienation Syndrome ( PAS ) , and “ friendly parent ” statutes .
PAS provides a handy–and utterly without basis–refutation to incest and abuse claims by blaming mothers for any hostility that the children feel towards their fathers , maintaining that children love and respect their fathers unless a “ poisonous ” mother has convinced them otherwise .
Even alleged incest and violence are not deemed reason enough for children to independently turn against their fathers .
Since PAS has been deemed by the American Psychological Association to have no scientific backing , at least 32 states have incorporated the milder sounding “ friendly parent ” concept into their custody laws .
This gives custody to the parent who will encourage the child to have more contact and a better relationship with the other parent .
Often mothers are hurt by the friendly parent concept , since they can be deemed “ unfriendly ” for saying anything against the father , including alleging abuse .
Zorza says that , ironically enough :
The unfriendly behavior of noncustodial parents ( usually the father ) , such as not paying child support , physically or verbally abusing the mother , or stalking her , is not considered as meeting the definition of unfriendly .
With such an approach , Zorza says , family violence is discounted , and abusers are empowered while battered women are disempowered .
Ultimately , children are harmed .
Domestic Violence , Abuse , and Child Custody will be instructive for policymakers , those working in the family justice system , and members of the media–which the authors say has by - and - large failed to expose custody court scandals .
But it is a must - read for any mother involved in a child custody battle , and especially for mothers trying get free from an abusive relationship .

We 've been pointing out for a while that , based on a cyclically adjusted PE ratio , the stock market is significantly overvalued -- say , 20 % or so .
To arrive at this view , we use a " fair value " estimate for the S&P 500 of about 900 , which is close to the one used by fund manager Jeremy Grantham , fund manager John Hussman , and others .
This compares to the S&P 's current level of about 1100 .
But now Andrew Smithers , an excellent economist based in London , is telling us that we 're way too optimistic , that fair value for the S&P 500 is actually in the 700 - 750 range .
Smithers , therefore , thinks the stock market is about 50 % overvalued .
Smithers constructs his estimate in two ways : 1 ) the same cyclically adjusted PE ratio that we use , and 2 ) something called " Tobin's Q , " which is a measure of replacement value .
Like Yale professor Robert Shiller , Smithers charts these valuation measures for the last century , which provides some context for where we are today :
The big story :
Over the long haul , valuations revert to the mean .
Smithers & Co .
Now , as always , the big caveat here is that valuation does n't tell you much about what stocks are going to do over the near - to - intermediate term ( 1 - 3 years ) .
To paraphrase Keynes , overvalued markets can keep on getting more overvalued for longer than you can stay solvent ( and sane ) .
But valuation does give you a pretty good sense of what future long - term returns are likely to be ( 7 - 10 years ) .
And all of these valuation analyses still suggest that long - term stock market returns are likely to be pretty crappy .
For a similar look at the market 's valuation over time , here 's Robert Shiller 's chart , which charts the cyclically adjusted PE ratio .
Smithers ' chart above plots the valuation measures against their own average .
Shiller 's chart below plots them against their absolute levels ( ie. today 's PE is in the 20X range ) :
Blue line = cyclically adjusted PE ; Red line = interest rates Professor Robert Shiller , Yale University
Lastly , here 's Smithers ' explanation for his valuation chart .
It 's complicated , but basically the idea is that near - term earnings are way too volatile to provide a meaningful read on the market 's valuation at any given moment .
Thus , to get a meaningful sense of valuation , you need to look at a fundamental measure that is more stable than quarterly earnings .
The cyclically adjusted PE , which averages 10 years of earnings , and Tobin 's Q , which looks at assets , provide this .
And as you can see in the chart , over the long haul , the market does tend to revert to the means .
Here 's Smithers :
US CAPE and q chart
US q
With the publication of the Flow of Funds data up to 31st March 2010 ( on 10th June 2010 ) , we have updated our calculations for q and CAPE , which show very little change from our previous calculations .
Non-financial companies , including both quoted and unquoted , were 62 % overvalued according to q at 31st March 2010 , when the S&P 500 index was 1169 .
Adjusting for the subsequent decline to 1087 ( 10th June , 2010 ) , the overvaluation had fallen to 50 % .
Revisions to data had little impact on q , with downward revision to net worth for Q4 2009 of 2.9 % being offset by a downward revision to the market value of non-financial equities of 2.1 % .
Net worth for Q1 2010 fell slightly as equity buy - backs exceeded profit retentions .
The listed companies in the S&P 500 index , which include financials , were 58 % overvalued at 31st March 2010 , according to our calculations for CAPE , based on the data from Professor Robert Shiller ’s website .
Adjusting for the subsequent decline to 1087 ( 10th June , 2010 ) , the overvaluation had fallen 46 % .
( It should be noted that we use geometric rather than arithmetic means in our calculations . )
Data for our calculations of q are taken for 1900 to 1952 from Measures of Stock Market Value and Returns for the Non-financial Corporate Sector 1900 - 2002 by Stephen Wright , published in the Review of Income and Wealth ( 2004 ) and for 1952 to 2009 from the Flow of Funds Accounts for the United States ( “ Z1 ” ) published by the Federal Reserve .
Data for our calculations of CAPE are taken from the data published on Robert Shiller ’s website .
As net worth and cyclically adjusted earnings per share change little during a quarter , only changes in share prices are important for changes in the market value between our quarterly updates .
The value of the market can thus be readily adjusted by viewers to this website .
As the S&P 500 index changes , viewers can simply insert the new value and calculate the q and CAPE values , i.e :
With the S&P 500 at 1169 as at 31st March 2010 , q was 1.6166 and CAPE was 1.5761 .
To update as at 10th June 2010 , when the S&P 500 was 1087 , for q take 1.61 × 1087 ÷ 1169 = 1.50 and for CAPE take 1.58 × 1087 ÷ 1169 = 1.46 .
WikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange has given his strongest indication yet about the next big leak from his whistleblower organisation .
There has been rampant speculation about WikiLeaks ' next revelation following its recent release of a top secret military video showing an attack in Baghdad which killed more than a dozen people , including two employees of the Reuters news agency .
Bradley Manning , a US military intelligence officer based in Iraq , has been arrested on suspicion of leaking the video but it is also claimed that Manning bragged online that he had handed WikiLeaks 260,000 secret US State Department cables .
In an interview with the ABC's Foreign Correspondent , Mr Assange said cryptically of WikiLeaks ' current project :
" I can give an analogy .
If there had been mass spying that had affected many , many people and organisations and the details of that mass spying were released then that is something that would reveal that the interests of many people had been abused . "
He agreed it would be of the " calibre " of publishing information about the way the top secret Echelon system - the US - UK electronic spying network which eavesdrops on worldwide communications traffic - had been used .
Mr Assange also confirmed that WikiLeaks has a copy of a video showing a US military bombing of a western Afghan township which killed dozens of people , including children .
He noted , though , it was a very intricate case " substantially more complex " than the Iraq material WikiLeaks had released - referring to the gunship video .
European news media are reporting that Mr Assange has " surfaced from almost a month in hiding " , speaking at a freedom of information seminar at the European parliament in Brussels .
But during the course of the past month , Mr Assange has been talking to Foreign Correspondent for a program examining the efficacy of the WikiLeaks model .
" What we want to create is a system where there is guaranteed free press across the world , the entire world , that every individual in the world has the ability to publish materials that is meaningful , " he said .
Whistleblower speaks
The program has also spoken directly to former computer hacker Adrian Lamo who blew the whistle on Bradley Manning after a boastful online discussion in which Lamo alleges the military intelligence adviser revealed himself as a significant WikiLeaks source .
" He proceeded to identify himself as an intelligence analyst and pose the question :
What would you do if you have unprecedented access to classified data 14 hours a day seven days a week ? "
Mr Lamo said .
" He ( Manning ) was firing bullets into the air without thought to consequence of where they might land or who they might hit . "
WikiLeaks has built an information repository it thinks is foolproof .
Instead of secret documents physically changing hands , they are anonymously sent to digital drop boxes and stored on servers around the world .
Finally , they are posted on the WikiLeaks site .
During Foreign Correspondent 's assignment Mr Assange had been preparing to fly to New York to meet his hero - Daniel Ellsberg - the former US military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers which amounted to a devastating expose of the Vietnam War .
Instead , concerned about travelling in the US and attracting the interest of authorities , he used Skype to speak to the conference .
He told the crowd : " Leaking is inherently an anti-authoritarian act .
It 's inherently an anarchist act . "
Mr Assange has been quoted as saying he feels perfectly safe in Europe , " but I have been advised by my lawyers not to travel to the US during this period " .
Daniel Ellsberg , named by Henry Kissinger as " the most dangerous man in America " , told Foreign Correspondent that Mr Assange was " a good candidate for being the most dangerous man in the world , in the eyes of people like the one who gave me that award " .
" I 'm sure that Assange is now regarded as one of the very most dangerous men and he should be quite proud of that . "
Truth or Dare , Foreign Correspondent 's examination of Julian Assange and WikiLeaks , airs tonight at 8 PM on ABC 1
PHYSICIST Stephen Hawking , a man who has probably done more than any other human to advance our understanding of the universe , has deeply annoyed Catholic League President Bill Donohue .
In an interview this week with ABC News , Hawking , 68 , said :
What could define God [ is thinking of God ] as the embodiment of the laws of nature .
However , this is not what most people would think of that God .
They made a human - like being with whom one can have a personal relationship .
When you look at the vast size of the universe and how insignificant an accidental human life is in it , that seems most impossible .
Hawking added :
There is a fundamental difference between religion , which is based on authority , [ and ] science , which is based on observation and reason .
Science will win because it works .
This was all too much for Donohue :
How any rational person could belittle the pivotal role that human life plays in the universe is a wonder , but it is just as silly to say that all religions are marked by the absence of reason .
While there are some religions which are devoid of reason , there are others , such as Roman Catholicism , which have long assigned it a special place .
It was the Catholic Church that created the first universities , and it was the Catholic Church that played a central role in the Scientific Revolution ; these two historical contributions made possible Mr. Hawking ’s career .
Reason , in pursuit of truth , has been reiterated by the Church fathers for nearly two millennia .
That is why Hawking posits a false conflict : in the annals of the Catholic Church , there is no inherent conflict between science and religion .
Quite the contrary : science and religion , in Catholic thought , are complementary properties .
Ergo , nothing is gained by alleging a “ victory ” of science over religion .
Religion without reason , Pope Benedict XVI instructed us in his Regensburg address in 2006 , leads to fanaticism .
That much Hawking seems to understand .
What he does n’t get is its contra : science without faith also leads to disasterâ € ” the genocidal regimes in Germany , the Soviet Union , China and Cambodia being Exhibits A , B , C and D .
In a brilliant riposte , Â Prof P Z Myers , over at Pharyngula , cut Donohue down to size :
Human life plays a pivotal role in the universe ?
How ?
Is the orbit of Mars influenced by human activities , does the Andromeda galaxy , 2.5 million light years away , care in the slightest about a species so remote that they ’re still waiting for the glimmerings of light from the fires they used to roast a mammoth ?
We could wink out of existence right now and the universe would go on , fundamentally unchanged .
He added :
I agree that the Catholic church has assigned reason a special place : apologetics .
Rationalizing the irrational .
Throwing up a smokescreen of scholarship to hide the fact that deep down , they ’re worshipping a jealous bronze age patriarchal myth wedded to a howling crazy Eastern mystery religion .
But they are n’t any different than any other religion : for instance , the Baptists found universities and pay lip service to logic , too .
As Hawking said , science works , and every charlatan in every church dreams of hitching a ride on its record .
P Z continued :
The Catholic Church was a religion laced throughout the substrate of Western culture ; everyone was Catholic ( or alternatively , after the 16th century , some flavor of Protestant ) , and being anything else was not tenable because the Catholic Church would set you on fire .
After centuries of waging war on every alternative that emerged , the Church does not now get to claim , â€ ˜
Oh , yeah , we did that ’ when a powerful and better way of thinking does manage to rise up out of the foolishness of superstition .
There is an inherent conflict between science and religion .
Mr Donohue believes a cracker turns into a slice of god in his mouth ; he thinks there is a magic man in the sky who speaks to the Pope ; he believes a series of rituals will allow an invisible ghost in his body go to Disneyland in Space after his meat dies .
He also believes that one young species of ape on this planet somehow plays a â€˜pivotal role ’ in affairs on Jupiter .
These are irrational , unscientific beliefs â€ ” they are anti-science , because he believes in arriving at conclusions because they are what he wishes to be true , or because the dogma has been repeated to him enough times , or because someone claims a supernatural revelation .
Sure , science arose out of Catholicismâ€ ¦in the same sense that plumbing , sanitation systems , and public health policies arose out of sewage .

WAVES : animation of a sine wave or sinusoidal wave ( sine curve or sine function ) and its corresponding cosine wave
SINE WAVES (y = sin x ) are ubiquitous .
They represent the behaviour of a simple oscillator .
This animation illustrates the relationship between a circle ( the wheel in this movie ) and the phase ( stage ) of the sine wave .
As the wheel rotates the attached horizontal pointer traces out a sine wave on the purplish screen .
The maximum amplitude of the wave is the same as the radius of the circle ( wheel in this case ) .
The height of the wave at any point depends on the sine of the angle that the radius of the circle ( yellow line ) makes with a horizontal plane ( not shown ) .
The labelled diagram at left explains the relationship between the angle , the sine and the resulting sine wave .
COSINE WAVES (y = cos x ) are identical to sine waves but are shifted by 1/2 π with respect to the sine wave .
In this animation the cosine wave ( yellowish green undulation ) is shown traced out on the lower greenish screen by the vertical pointer .
The height ( value ) of the cosine wave at any point depends on the cosine of the yellow radial arm .
At the beginning of the animation notice how the sine wave has a value of zero and the cosine wave a value of one ( we assume the diameter of the wheel is one ) .
The two arms projecting from the wheel are at right angles to each other ( i.e. 90 o or 1/2 π ) apart and this helps you to visualise the phase difference of 1/2 π between the sine and cosine curves .
RADIANS : labelled graphic explaining the relationship between radians and degres and how they map onto a sine wave .
RADIANS are a fundamental way of describing angles .
We are used to angles like 90 o for a right angle but radians use the arc of a circle to describe a degree of rotation .
The length of this arc is measured in terms of the radius of the circle .
The circumference of a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by two ( gives the diameter ) multiplied by a constant called pi(π ) which has a value of about 3.141 .
Consequently a complete circle contains 2π radians .
This helps to explain why a graph of a sine wave is measured in fragments of π .
Next to the type a bunch of models are posed in moronic poses .
I guess it ’s supposed to be creative .
A guy with a smoking helmet covering his head is very attractive .
Riding the rails .
This is the one that particularly annoys me .
How many creators out there like to think of themselves as stupid .
Perhaps the “ creative ” character that came up with this campaign .
Living in New York , you find at least some wit in the public .
That ’s Sarah Palin stuck to poster .
No matter how many times researchers try , there 's just no getting around the weirdness of quantum mechanics .
In the latest attempt , researchers at the University of Geneva in Switzerland tried to determine whether entanglement — the fact that measuring a property of one particle instantly determines the property of another — is actually transmitted by some wave - like signal that 's fast but not infinitely fast .
Their test involved a series of measurements on pairs of entangled photons ( particles of light ) that were generated in Geneva ( satellite view at left ) and then split apart by optical fiber to two villages 18 kilometers ( 11 miles ) apart where the team had set up photon detectors .
( In 2007 , researchers transmitted entangled light 144 kilometers between two of the Canary Islands . )
The idea in the new experiment is that the photons in each entangled pair are hitting the distant detectors simultaneously , so there 's no time for them to exchange a signal .
By comparing results from the two detectors , the researchers determined whether the photons were entangled or not , using a test known as Bell 's inequalities .
The photons were indeed entangled , the group reports in Nature .
But in reality , no experiment is perfect , so what they end up with is a lower limit on how fast the entanglement could be traveling : 10,000 times the speed of light .
To appreciate the weirdness of entanglement , consider that the outcome of a single quantum measurement is random .
By all tests , a photon * has * no definite polarization until it hits a detector capable of measuring it .
So it 's like the entangled particles share one big quantum state .
There 's one other subtlety to the experiment .
If entanglement is traveling through space like some kind of faster - than - light wave , that would violate Einstein 's theory of special relativity , which says the laws of nature are the same no matter which way you 're moving with respect to anything else .
So the group had to run their experiment repeatedly for more than 24 hours , counting on Earth 's rotation to sample all the different orientations relative to the stars .
( Imagine a laser pointer shining into space along the direction of the optical fiber . )
It 's always conceivable that quantum mechanics might break down ( read : show some signs of everyday normalcy ) if experimenters could test it the right way .
In a 2007 study , researchers in Vienna tested the idea that maybe the instantaneous - ness of entanglement ( called nonlocality ) was consistent with hidden " variables " that can explain the randomness of quantum measurements .
But no dice for that idea .
Theoretical physicist Terence Rudolph of Imperial College London , author of a commentary on the new paper , says that putting bounds on faster - than - light entanglement is useful for researchers trying to imagine theories that might extend beyond quantum mechanics .
What might such a theory look like ?
Rudolph says we 're probably stuck with instantaneous entanglement , which seems impossible to us because we 're stuck in everyday space and time .
" We need to understand how quantum mechanics sees space and time , " he says .
" I think there 's probably much deeper issues . "

One person briefed on the inquiry said it was in an early stage and that no subpoenas had been issued yet to BP , the owner of the well .
It was unclear whether any had gone to Transocean , which leased the Deepwater Horizon , the nine - year - old drilling rig that exploded and sank in April , to BP ; Cameron , the company that manufactured a “ blowout preventer ” that failed to function after the explosion ; or Halliburton , which performed drilling services like cementing .
Administration officials said they were reviewing violations of the Clean Water Act , which carries criminal and civil penalties and fines ; the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , which can be used to hold parties responsible for cleanup costs ; the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Endangered Species Act , which provide penalties for injury and death of wildlife .
“ BP will cooperate with any inquiry that the Department of Justice undertakes , just as we are doing in response to the other inquiries that already are ongoing , " the company said in a statement .
Having abandoned the attempt to plug the gushing well , BP and the government moved ahead on the latest plan , to contain the oil and gas as it flows from the floor of the gulf and siphon it to the surface .
BP prepared to sever the pipe that once connected the well to the surface and is now snaking along the sea floor from the wellhead .
That pipe , called a riser , had been attached to a blowout preventer , a stack of valves sitting on top of the well .
Removing the pipe could increase the flow of oil into the gulf until response crews can complete the next phase of the operation , affixing a cap to the remaining stub of the riser at the blowout preventer and siphoning the leaking oil into the cap through a new riser and up to a ship on the surface .
Update : Please see update from Jay Brooks in the comments with corrections on how these week - long beer fests got started .
Also , added Louisville .
Thanks , Jedi .
In September of 2008 , I wrote about how “ Beer Week ” was starting to pick up steam in the U.S. with prime examples being Philadelphia , San Francisco and New York City.
18 months later there are nearly 20 cities that host Beer Week .
That ’s right .
There are enough week - long beer events scattered over 2010 to cover over 1/3 of the calendar year .
How did it all start ?
American Beer Month .
Stan Hieronymus reported on Real Beer a few years back , “ The Brewers Association conducted the promotion for six years , the last in 2005 . ”
The BA then whittled it down to American Craft Beer Week .
Oregon was the only state to continue the tradition with its own Beer Month .
Philadelphia then got the whole thing beer week thing going on a city - level in March of 2008 .
Indiana followed with a beer week of its own in July 2008 but appears to have dropped the week - long fest in 2009 .
New York City joined Philadelphia as the second city in September 2008 and the rest is history .
Update 2 : To clarify , Oregon started Oregon Beer Week in 2005 and upped it to Oregon Beer Week in 2006 .
Update 1 : Ohio was among the first states with its own beer week .
I was able to track down references for Ohio Beer Week dating back to 2006 though it may have started earlier .
San Francisco was the first city with a beer week - esque schedule of events with its Beerapalooza dating back to 2003 .
[ Thanks , Jay ! ]

Planning appears to be underway for Atlanta Beer Week and Raleigh Beer Week .
Asheville was named Co-Beer City USA with Portland last year .
I wonder if we will hear of Asheville Beer Week before the end of 2010 ?
Largest Cities without Beer Week ( followed by U.S. size rank per City - data.com )
Houston ( 4 )
Phoenix ( 5 )
San Antonio ( 7 )
Dallas ( 9 )
Lots of South / Southwest ( or Texas ) representation here .
Maybe if no one city in Texas has the resources or enough interest to pull it off , beer people from the three or four cities above could help coordinate Texas Beer Week ?
There is no doubt that it would give craft beer great exposure in the Lonestar State .
Not Teacher 's Pet German Teen in Court for Drawing Rabbits on Blackboard
In Germany , drawing rabbits on the blackboard can land you in court .
A schoolteacher has made nationwide headlines by filing a lawsuit against a 16 - year - old pupil who allegedly did just that .
The girl is also accused of claiming that the teacher had a rabbit phobia .
The case continues .
Israel 's Dangerous Turn After Israel ’s lethal attack in international waters on a civilian flotilla carrying relief supplies to Gaza , a troubling question arises :
Have Israeli authorities , who possess a major nuclear arsenal , become dangerously erratic ?
Email

This question can't be posed publicly in the American mainstream news media nor in U.S. political circles , where fear of the pro-Israel lobby remains strong .
But it is a concern that is being discussed quietly by foreign policy analysts around the world .
Even as America ’s commentariat again generates the predictable excuses for Israeli latest actions , the political reality inside Israel is one that is shifting more and more toward a society dominated by Jewish fundamentalists , including an aggressive and racist settler bloc .
The ultra-Orthodox Shas Party is now in the Likud ruling coalition and holds important Cabinet posts such as housing .
Shas leaders have made it clear that they favor a country segregated not just between Arab and Jew but between secular and ultra-Orthodox Jews .
If these fundamentalist elements continue to consolidate their political power , the world could soon be facing an isolated and paranoid religious state with some 200 to 400 nuclear warheads along with a sophisticated collection of chemical and biological weapons .
One Israeli émigré , who spent his young adulthood working for the Israeli government , told me that he fears Israel is becoming like North Korea , except qualitatively more dangerous because Israel has an advanced nuclear arsenal and sits in a more strategic part of the world .
The current government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also appears excessively confident that Israel ’s sophisticated propaganda network and its American neoconservative allies can overwhelm any criticism of Israeli actions in Washington and ensure eventual U.S. backing for a military strike on Iran .
Netanyahu has been dismissive toward President Barack Obama ’s peace initiatives , particularly Obama ’s demand that Israel stop building Jewish housing in traditionally Arab areas .
Ignoring those wishes , Netanyahu ’s Shas Party allies announced new Jewish construction in Arab East Jerusalem last March as Vice President Joe Biden arrived to reaffirm U.S. solidarity with Israel .
Though Obama let his annoyance be known , Netanyahu followed up by announcing that the Jewish housing construction would go forward .
‘ Kiss - and - Make - Up ’ Faced with this Israeli intransigence , Obama quieted his criticism .
He was reportedly looking forward to a “ kiss - and - make - up ” session with Netanyahu on Tuesday before Israel ’s lethal assault on the “ Freedom Flotilla ” caused Netanyahu to cancel the meeting and rush back to Israel .
Obama also has fallen in line behind Israeli insistence that a confrontation over Iran ’s nuclear program be put at the top of the international agenda and that a new Iranian offer to ship about half its low - enriched uranium out of the country be rejected .
The President had privately urged the leaders of Brazil and Turkey to draw Iran into that agreement , which they did two weeks ago .
But Israel and American neocons denounced and ridiculed the deal , demanding instead stiffer sanctions and stepped - up efforts for “ regime change ” in Iran .
Instead of admitting that he had backed the Iran - Brazil - Turkey deal , Obama stayed silent , as he has in the wake of Israel ’s middle - of - the - night commando raid on the flotilla , which left nine peace activists dead early Monday .
In a P.R. blitz on Tuesday , Israeli officials made a point of showing off knives and other hand - made weapons that some of the activists allegedly used to defend the Turkish ship , the Mavi Marmara , when the Israeli commandos landed by ropes from helicopters .
According to Israeli accounts , the resistance from the people onboard led the commandos to open fire .
The Israeli government and many U.S. commentators blamed the ship 's resistance for the violence .
However , it would not be unusual – and certainly not illegal – for a ship ’s crew and passengers in international waters to defend themselves from an armed assault , especially one launched in the dark of night .
If the attackers were Somalis instead of Israelis , the ship ’s defenders would be hailed as heroes .
In an e-mail to me , Marquette Professor of Moral Theology Daniel C. Maguire cited one important distinction between “ Somali piracy and Israeli piracy – Israel kills during its piracy and then claims it does so in self - defense .
That is [ a ] first in the history of piracy .
“ Traditionally , pirates have been outlaws and admit it .
It is very much like a rapist saying : ‘ The victim I was raping resisted and so I killed her in self - defense . ’
A defense like that would make even a mob lawyer blush . ”
Act of War Craig Murray , a former British ambassador and Foreign Office specialist on maritime law , said the Israeli commando raid was a violation of international law and the Law of the Sea , since the ship under a Turkish flag was in international waters .
If “ the Israeli commandoes were acting on behalf of the government of Israel in killing the activists in international waters , the applicable law is that of the flag state of the ship on which the incident occurred , " in this case Turkey .
" In legal terms , the Turkish ship was Turkish territory .
So , ” Murray continued , “ Israel is in a position of war with Turkey , and the attack by Israeli commandos falls under international jurisdiction as a war crime . "
However , not surprisingly , the Israeli P.R. response to the intense international criticism worked wonders in winning over the U.S. news media .
After playing video of the Israeli assault and the efforts of some passengers to resist the attackers , MSNBC ’s Chris Matthews came down decisively on the Israeli side , calling criticism of the lethal attack “ an unfair shot at Israel . ”
Matthews added that he agreed with the pro-Israeli position taken by the Washington Post 's neoconservative editorial page , which faulted Israel for the sloppiness of its attack while siding with its purpose .
“ We have no sympathy for the motives of the participants in the flotilla -- a motley collection that included European sympathizers with the Palestinian cause , Israeli Arab leaders and Turkish Islamic activists , ” the Post wrote on Tuesday .
“ Israel says that some of the organizers have ties to Hamas and al - Qaeda .
What 's plain is that the group 's nominal purpose , delivering " humanitarian " supplies to Gaza , was secondary to the aim of provoking a confrontation . ”
New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman weighed in Wednesday with an op -ed that downplayed the human tragedy in Gaza where some 1,400 Palestinians died in an Israeli month - long offensive at the end of 2008 and the start of 2009 and where a blockade has continued for three years .
" That concern for Gaza and Israel 's blockade is so out [ of ] balance with ... other horrific cases in the region that it is not surprising Israelis dismiss it as motivated by hatred -- not the advice of friends , " Friedman wrote .
So , in the view of the mainstream U.S. news media , Israel is justified in maintaining a fierce embargo on the 1.5 million people crowded into the tiny Gaza Strip and any “ motley collection ” of activists that tries to run the blockade is at fault for whatever happens .
Plus , it seems , when Israel launches an attack on a ship in international waters , the people onboard must accept whatever treatment they receive at Israeli hands .
They must not fight back .
By contrast , one can only imagine how the U.S. press corps would rise up in collective fury if , say , Iran sent its commandos into international waters to attack and seize vessels that were on a humanitarian mission .
Lost Objectivity
What ’s striking in all this is how far the U.S. news media has veered away from its supposed commitment to objectivity , even as it pretends to continue abiding by that journalistic principle .
The U.S. media also would drip with sarcasm over some of the post - facto rationales used to justify the attack , if the attacking nation was n’t Israel .
For instance , there ’s the Israeli accusation that the cargo on the ships was n’t packed properly .
Shuki Sagis , chief executive of the Israel port at Ashdod , complained to the Jerusalem Post that the supplies – including scooters for the handicapped , wheelchairs , stretchers , hospital beds , boxes of medicine , food products and toys – were n’t neatly stacked .
“ The cargo ships were loaded haphazardly , with all of the equipment mixed up in the large holds , ” Sagis said .
“ Ships loaded in this way would not be accepted in any port .
We are loading the equipment on the trucks far more carefully than it was loaded on to the ships . ”
Other Israeli officials claimed that the humanitarian supplies on the ships were not items that were needed by the Gazans .
“ I can say with great assurance , ” said Colonel Moshe Levi , “ that none of the equipment on board is needed in Gaza .
The equipment that we found is all equipment that we have regularly allowed into the Strip over the past year . ”
Levi said that fact “ proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that the whole premise of the voyage was for propaganda and provocation and not for humanitarian purposes . ”
However , the Israelis did concede that their searches of the vessels turned up no weapons being smuggled into Gaza .
The only “ contraband ” was construction equipment , including sacks of concrete and metal rods , Levi said .
Levi explained that Israel wo n’t let construction equipment in to rebuild Gaza , which was devastated by a month - long Israeli offensive that ended in January 2009 , because the material might be used to build fortifications for " terrorists . "
The notion that bombed - out Gazans must be made to survive in makeshift shanties so some future Israeli assault wo n’t be complicated by the existence of buildings that might be used by Gaza ’s defenders could be regarded in a different context as evidence of grotesque inhumanity .
That is , if the perpetrators were some nation or group that the U.S. media did n’t like .
The Israeli Navy also claimed that it had learned an important lesson from its assault on the Freedom Flotilla .
A top Navy commander told The Jerusalem Post that the next time , Israel will use much more military force to stop the ships .
" We boarded the ship and were attacked as if it was a war , " said the officer , who was n’t identified by name .
" That will mean that we will have to come prepared in the future as if it was a war . "
Combined with other recent incidents , like Israel 's Jan. 20 assassination of Hamas leader Mahmoud Al - Mabhouh in a Dubai hotel room and its open threats about bombing Iran , Israel might be diagnosed as suffering from a violent form of paranoia if it were a patient in a psychiatric ward rather than a nuclear - armed state .
Yet , instead of addressing this growing threat to world peace -- that is , Israel 's increasingly erratic behavior and deepening religious fervor -- the U.S. news media continues to give this favored country a free pass .

Israel boosts space presence :
The defense establishment launched another spy satellite to space Tuesday evening , thereby boosting Israel 's intelligence - gatherings capabilities , mostly at distant theaters .
The latest satellite , Ofek 9 , will be the sixth one to be deployed simultaneously .
" When we wish to examine targets , we need our own satellites to do the job , " a senior defense official said .
" The new satellite will enable us to perform frequent activity at higher resolution . "
The satellite was launched from the Palmachim Air Force base in central Israel , in line with a pre-determined plan unrelated to recent developments , officials said .
The Defense Ministry issued an official statement , saying that the Ofek 9 satellite " was launched and successfully injected into orbit by means of a Shavit satellite launcher . "
" In the next phase , the satellite will undergo several tests for validation of its serviceability and satisfactory performance , " the statement said , noting that Ofek 9 is an " advanced technology remote sensing satellite . "
Officials want another $ 300 million
Defense Minister Ehud Barak praised Israel 's defense industries and security establishment officials following the launch .
" The launch today is a technological and operational achievement ; few states , especially states the size of Israel , are capable of handling such a complex challenge , " he said .
" The success of the launch is an expression of the valor , thinking , and extensive abilities of the defense industries and security establishment in Israel .
A security source said that the launch of Ofek 9 further boosts Israel 's intelligence capabilities , as the Jewish State now has several satellites deployed in space , thereby considerably improving the results of its efforts .
Previous Israeli satellites were launched in January 2008 , in June 2007 , and in May 2002 .
In September 2004 , the launched of Ofek 6 failed .
The new satellite is expected to join Israeli efforts related to Iran and other states in the region .
Despite the Israeli success on this front , officials prefer to maintain a low key attitude and not say much about the accomplishments achieved thus far .
However , officials are supporting a proposal to earmark another $ 300 million in the next five years in order to continue developing similar means .
Israeli singer Ninet Tayeb on Tuesday lashed out at American indie rocker Devendra Banhart , who canceled his planned performance in Tel Aviv one day earlier , just three hours before he was due to arrive in the Israel .

" A few days ago I played him on my program with pride because he is a great musician and mainly because he was clear , strong and decisive on his stand to come to Israel , " Tayeb said .
" I likened him to the king of the animals , a mighty lion .
Today , I think he is a great musician but more like the lion from the Wizard of Oz – a coward and pitiful . "
" I thought , like many others , that he was above politics and religion .
This is truly a great disappointment . "
Banhart 's agents said that the musician was pressured into canceling the performance for political reasons .
" We love the land and people of Israel , and have been looking forward to our third show there with unimaginable anticipation , " Banhart 's official website said .
" Unfortunately , we tried to make it clear that we were coming to share a human and not a political message but it seems that we are being used to support views that are not our own .
We will be overjoyed to return to Israel on the day that our presence is perceived and reported on as a cultural event and not a political one .
We truly hope that day comes soon . "
Bernhart was booked for two concert's at Tel Aviv 's Barbie club – June 15 , 16 – and the concerts were nearly sold out .
The show 's Israeli producers said that they were " very disappointed by the cancellation and very surprised by the last - minute decision , particularly in light of the fact that his managers repeatedly stated that they would not cancel under any circumstance and would arrive in Israel as planned . "
Ticket holders will be reimbursed .
Trente mois et puis s'en va .
Le patron de Radio France a annoncé ce mercredi matin , dans une interview au Monde. fr , le départ de l'humoriste Stéphane Guillon de la matinale de France Inter .
D'après Jean - Luc
Hees , « l ' humour ne doit pas ê tre confisqué par de petits tyrans » .
« Je trouve que ce n'est pas très décent d'insulter la direction d'une entreprise comme Radio France , elle ne le mérite pas , c'est une maison de liberté et tous les gens qui y travaillent peuvent en témoigner » , a ajouté Jean - Luc Hees dans le journal de la mi-journée de France Inter .
Dans la foulée , peu avant midi , un autre humoriste de la station publique , Didier Porte , a annoncé qu'il était « licencié » de France Inter .
Il en a également fait mention dans sa chronique diffusée dans l'émission du Fou du roi .
Dans son courrier , Philippe Val explique qu'il souhaite « renouveler et faire évoluer » l'antenne , a expliqué Didier Porte .
« La conception d'une nouvelle grille contraint nécessairement la direction à renoncer à certaines émissions ou chroniques » , poursuit la lettre , selon l'humoriste , dont le contrat s'arrête vendredi .
« J'ai un contrat de grille qui dure jusqu'à fin juin .
Comme ça fait dix ans que je suis dans la maison , c'est comme si j'avais un CDI , donc c'est bien un licenciement qui n'est pas justifié puisque je n'ai eu qu'un seul avertissement » , a -t - il ajouté .
Didier Porte avait reçu début juin un avertissement de sa direction à la suite d'une chronique dans laquelle il mettait en scène l'ancien Premier ministre Dominique de Villepin insultant le chef de l'Etat .
« Ce petit dérapage sur Villepin et Sarkozy reste un prétexte , ça fait dix ans que je fais des chroniques engagées » , a réagi le chroniqueur .
Stéphane Guillon a lui-même fait part de son éviction en direct et en deux temps : hier matin et ce matin lors de ce qui fut donc sa dernière chronique :
« J'ai eu de nombreuses discussions avec Stéphane Guillon à propos de ses chroniques , déclare Jean - Luc Hees .
Si l'humour se résume à l'insulte , je ne peux le tolérer pour les autres mais également pour moi . »
Et le PDG de Radio France d'ajouter avoir « un certain sens de l'honneur » et ne pouvoir accepter qu'on lui « crache dessus en direct » .
Didier Porte , autre chroniqueur qui partageait la tranche matinale avec Stéphane Guillon et François Morel , avait indiqué qu'il ne se battrait pas pour conserver sa chronique .
Il avait annoncé qu'il retrouverait sa place à la rentrée dans Le Fou du roi , l'émission de Stéphane Bern diffusée en fin de matinée et qui vient de fêter ses 10 ans sur France Inter .
Ce ne sera donc pas le cas .
Réactions de soutien
Dans un communiqué , Martine Aubry , première secrétaire du PS , a exprimé la solidarité de son parti à Stéphane Guillon et Didier Porte , « renvoyés brutalement de France Inter » .
L'année dernière , elle avait été elle - même la cible d'une chronique de Stéphane Guillon qui l'avait comparée « à un pot à tabac » .
« Si certains ( de leurs ) propos ont pu choquer , écrit aujourd ' hui la Première secrétaire du PS , c'est la force et l'honneur d'une démocratie de laisser libre la parole des humoristes et leur droit à la moquerie et même à l'outrance . »
De son côté , Stéphane Bern , qui anime l'émission
Le fou du roi sur France Inter , a confié qu'il se sentait « désavoué » par cette décision .
« Je vous soutiens , a déclaré Stéphane Bern à Didier Porte .
Nous vivons des moments pénibles .
Je le vis comme un désaveu personnel .
Didier Porte n'a pas démérité dans Le Fou du roi .
Je croyais avoir obtenu de la direction de France Inter qu'il serait reconduit à la rentrée .
Or j'ai appris ( le licenciement de Didier Porte ) pendant mon émission , c'est très violent .
Ca me met dans une situation embarrassante .
Quelles conclusions je dois en tirer ? » , s'interroge le présentateur .
« Je ne cautionne pas ce que Didier Porte a pu dire dans la matinale mais ma logique est de soutenir les humoristes de mon équipe , et j'ai toujours en tête cette phrase de Voltaire : " même si je ne suis pas d'accord avec ce que vous dites , je me battrai pour que vous puissiez le dire " .
Didier Porte a du talent .
Qui n'a jamais fauté , qui n'a jamais dérapé à l'antenne ? » , s'est interrogé Stéphane Bern .
Les humoristes Guy Bedos et Guy Carlier , confient , eux , ne plus reconnaître le patron de Radio France , Jean - Luc Hees , qui « a changé » selon eux depuis sa nomination par Nicolas Sarkozy .
« Je suis très peiné car j'aime bien Jean - Luc et j'ai de très bons souvenirs de liberté avec lui , mais il a changé , a déclaré Guy Bedos .
C'est un procès fait à l'humour politique .
Ils ( Jean - Luc Hees et Philippe Val , directeur de France Inter , ndlr ) perdent la tête » , a commenté l'humoriste , qui se considère comme le « parrain » de Stéphane Guillon .
De son côté , Guy Carlier , qui a travaillé il y a quelques années à France Inter , s'est dit « très surpris » .
« Ca ne correspond pas au souvenir que j'ai de Jean - Luc » quand il était patron de France Inter à la fin des années 90 .
« Lorsque les hommes politiques téléphonaient - à l'époque Jean - Marie Cavada était le patron de Radio France - Jean - Luc venait me voir et me disait de continuer » , se souvient Guy Carlier , qui officie actuellement sur Europe 1 .
June 7 , 2010  --
Celebrated physicist Stephen Hawking knows more about the universe than almost any other person ever to walk the planet , but some answers still escape even him .
When asked by ABC News ' Diane Sawyer about the biggest mystery he'd like solved , he said , " I want to know why the universe exists , why there is something greater than nothing . "
Hawking , who was honored last week at the World Science Festival in New York , is famous for probing the deepest questions of the cosmos .
Until he stepped down last fall , he held the post of Lucasian professor of mathematics at Cambridge University , a position once held by Sir Isaac Newton , the " father of physics " himself .
During Hawking 's 30 years in the post , he gave his colleagues new ways to look at the universe .
But he also gave the public , through his many books and occasional appearances , a way to connect with the often obscure world of theoretical physics .
' Brief History of Time ' Is an International Best - Seller
" Stephen has had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the universe , particularly of warp space and warp time in the universe , black holes , the origin of the universe , " said physicist Kip Thorn at last week 's World Science Festival event honoring Hawking .
Hawking 's most well - known book , " A Brief History of Time , " sold more than 9 million copies and is an international best - seller .
He 's even made brief cameos in pop culture staples like " The Simpsons " and " Star Trek . "
But exploring the origins of time inevitably leads to questions about the ultimate origins of everything and what , if anything , is behind it all .
" What could define God [ is thinking of God ] as the embodiment of the laws of nature .
However , this is not what most people would think of that God , " Hawking told Sawyer .
" They made a human - like being with whom one can have a personal relationship .
When you look at the vast size of the universe and how insignificant an accidental human life is in it , that seems most impossible . "
When Sawyer asked if there was a way to reconcile religion and science , Hawking said , " There is a fundamental difference between religion , which is based on authority , [ and ] science , which is based on observation and reason .
Science will win because it works . "
Hawking : Alien Visit Would Be Like Columbus ' Arrival in the Americas
Hawking , 68 , was diagnosed with the motor neuron disorder ALS , or Lou Gehrig 's disease , when he was 21 .
He was told that he likely would not live more than a few years .
But on his personal website he said that with " a cloud hanging over my future , I found , to my surprise , that I was enjoying life in the present more than before . "
" I suddenly realized that there were a lot of worthwhile things I could do if I were reprieved , " he said .
He went on to have a family ( he has three children and one grandchild ) and , though his condition progressed , he continued his research unabated with the help of a wheelchair and , later , an electronic speech synthesizer .
Though Hawking no longer holds his position with Cambridge University , he continues to hold the public 's attention .
In April , he grabbed headlines after the premiere of the Discovery Channel series , " Into the Universe With Stephen Hawking . "
Aliens Might Look to Conquer , Colonize , Hawking Said
In the program , he said it is likely that alien life exists , but a visit from extraterrestrials might be similar to Christopher Columbus ' arrival in the Americas .
" If aliens visit us , the outcome would be much as when Columbus landed in America , which did n't turn out well for the Native Americans , " he said .
" We only have to look at ourselves to see how intelligent life might develop into something we would n't want to meet . "
He also speculated that aliens ' capabilities " would be only limited by how much power they could harness and control , and that could be far more than we might first imagine . "
It might even be possible for aliens to harvest the energy from an entire star , he added .
" Such advanced aliens would perhaps become nomads , looking to conquer and colonize whatever planets they can reach , " Hawking said .
Hawking to His Children : Look Up at the Stars
But though Hawking may think that looking for aliens is not a wise choice , his daughter Lucy , with whom he has written a children 's book , told Sawyer that she disagrees .
" We have a fundamental disagreement on that one , " she said good - naturedly .
" Because I think if they 're so smart that they could destroy us , then it does n't matter if we look for them or not .
Because if they 're that clever , they know we 're here .
They can find us whether we look for them or not . "
But Lucy said she and her father agree on many other things .
" We like the bustle , we like the excitement , we like the lights , we like the company , " she said .
" We like all the complicated things that human civilization has created . "
As Hawking 's children navigate the many complexities of human life , he told Sawyer that he 's offered up three pieces of advice .
" One , remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet .
Two , never give up work .
Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it , " he said .
" Three , if you are lucky enough to find love , remember it is there and do n't throw it away . "

In late July 1997 , police officers fanned out across this Phoenix suburb searching for illegal immigrants .
Working side by side with Border Patrol agents , police demanded proof of citizenship from children walking home from school , grandmothers shopping at the market and employees driving to work .
At the end of what became known as the Chandler Roundup , 432 illegal immigrants had been arrested and deported .
But during those five days , local police and federal officers also detained dozens of U.S. citizens and legal residents — often stopping them because they spoke Spanish or looked Mexican .
Now , as Arizona prepares to enact SB 1070 , the controversial new immigration law , many of Chandler ’s Latino residents say they are reminded of those terrifying days — and fearful of a repeat of the past .
“ SB 1070 just brought home the point :
If you are Hispanic or Mexican , you are just not wanted in Arizona , ” said Joe Garcia , 65 , a U.S. citizen who owned a video store in downtown Chandler and helped form a civil rights coalition to demand answers after the roundup .
The state attorney general later determined that authorities had engaged in racial profiling and violated the rights of residents .
The new law , which takes effect July 29 , during the 13th anniversary of the sweeps , requires police to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop for another lawful reason and suspect is in the country illegally .
It also makes it a state crime to lack proper immigration papers .
Gov. Jan Brewer has said that racial profiling will not be tolerated under the law , which is supported by a majority of Arizona residents .
Though not well - known outside Arizona , the Chandler Roundup was n’t unique .
Throughout U.S. history , raids conducted by local police and federal immigration agents have resulted in the deportation of U.S. citizens , according to Francisco Balderrama , a Chicano studies professor at Cal State Los Angeles .
In the 1930s , beginning with a dramatic raid in Los Angeles at La Placita Olvera , federal agents and police arrested more than a million people in operations around the U.S. and sent them to Mexico .
By researching records at Mexican consulates , Balderrama estimates that as many as 60 % of those deported were U.S. citizens .
Other deportation efforts , including the infamous Operation Wetback , continued into the 1940s and 1950s .
Balderrama said that history accounts for some of the unease in the Latino community about SB 1070 .
“ It underscores the situation that your skin color and your surname are used as ways of measuring if you are American or not , ” he said .
Teresa Rodriguez , 69 , knows what it is like to be singled out .
Although she — and her parents — were born in the United States , Rodriguez was stopped three times by Chandler police and Border Patrol agents during the roundup .
In one incident , she was speaking Spanish to a friend while walking to the store to pick up medicine for her grandson .
A police officer on a bicycle came up on one side of her , an immigration officer on the other .
She recalled one saying in Spanish , “ You do n’t belong here , do you ? ”
When Rodriguez , who speaks English , answered in Spanish that she was a citizen and that her birth certificate was at home , they did n’t believe her .
She said the police officer grabbed her arm and forced her to sit on the curb until she finally convinced them that she was a citizen .
“ They made me feel like I was being stepped on , like I was an animal , ” she said .
Garcia , a retired Mesa police lieutenant , and his wife , Rosalia , said they were still disappointed and angry about the way officers behaved during the roundup .
Rosalia remembered customers fleeing into the video shop and police officers on bicycles arbitrarily stopping people .
“ They were literally sweeping , coming through the sidewalks ” until finally , she said , the streets were empty .
“ Police officers , knowing full well what probable cause they needed , just ignored the law and took the law into their own hands , ” Joe Garcia said .
“ If you were Hispanic , you were a target , ” he said .
“ Especially if you had a dark complexion . ”
Arizona State University professor Mary Romero , who specializes in social justice issues and has written several articles about Chandler , said authorities even used reports with some information completed in advance : nationality , Mexican ; skin color , medium ; hair color , black ; occupation , laborer .
Stephen Montoya , a lawyer who represented U.S. citizens and legal residents in a lawsuit against the city , said the new Arizona law paves the way for more such raids .
“ It knocks down the wall and legitimizes a constant , statewide roundup , ” he said .
Chandler authorities , who conducted the sweeps as part of a plan to revitalize the city , settled the lawsuit with 29 plaintiffs for $ 400,000 and pledged to not let it happen again .
And in 1999 , the City Council adopted a policy saying police could only ask about the immigration status of people arrested on suspicion of felonies and certain misdemeanors .
Mayor Boyd Dunn , who was on the City Council at the time , said in an interview that “ mistakes were made ” and that officers engaged in racial profiling .
But he said the department has since conducted extensive officer training and outreach to the Latino community .
Earlier this year , in anticipation of SB 1070 becoming law , the council unanimously repealed the 1999 policy and gave police more freedom to ask the immigration status of people arrested .
“ We need to give our officers discretion and tools to make sure the bad guys are caught , ” Chandler Police Chief Sherry Kiyler said .
Dunn said the policy change , which he considered the “ closing chapter ” on the roundup , was necessary to bring Chandler up - to - date with other Arizona cities .
Dunn said SB 1070 would n’t result in anything like what happened 13 years ago .
“ We will protect not only our citizens , but their rights , ” he said .
Chandler , once a small agricultural town , now has a population of 250,000 and is home to several high - tech factories .
The city is 21 % Latino .
The downtown square is surrounded by new condos , shops and restaurants , including a tea house and an upscale bridal store .
A few blocks down Arizona Avenue , however , day laborers still wait for work , as they have for years .
One of the workers , Nasario Ramos , 38 , said he was deported to Mexico during the roundup and sneaked back into the U.S. days later .
Ramos said he worried that the calm that had prevailed in Chandler for 13 years was about to end .
“ It ’s going to be worse than ’ 97 , ” he said .
Illegal immigrants like Ramos continue to be a sore point for some residents of Chandler .
Fred Blevins , 62 , said that although he believed police went too far when they stopped U.S. citizens in 1997 , something had to be done .
He supports SB 1070 as a way to get more illegal immigrants out of Arizona and believes local police will do it the right way .
“ Chandler learned its lesson , ” he said .
“ They got slapped . ”
In addition to the legal settlement after the sweeps , Chandler authorities also formed a human relations commission to promote dialogue and started several cultural events to celebrate the Latino community .
Chandler community activist Juanita Encinas said the city made efforts to build bridges with the Latino community but a level of distrust remains .
“ The scars will never go away , ” she said .
For Rodriguez , who said she received about $ 27,000 of the cash settlement , a reminder of the roundup is never far away .

WordPress has long been known as a dedicated blogging platform , giving users the tools they need to publish their message and interact with readers .
However , with the official release of version 3.0 , set to drop this month , the platform will be much closer , if not well within the territory of a content management system ( CMS ) .
The list of new features in WordPress 3.0 is n't very long in comparison to previous releases .
However , the changes that are coming will certainly have a significant impact , particularly if you use WordPress as a CMS .
Here is a rundown of the most important new features arriving in version 3.0 .
Let us know in the comments which features of WordPress 3.0 you are most looking forward to .
1. Custom Post Types
By default , WordPress lets you publish two types of content : " Posts " and " Pages . "
In version 3.0 , you can define additional content types with their own attributes .
For example , if you 're running a WordPress site for a design agency , you might create a custom post type to display portfolio items , another for employee pages , and another for client testimonials .
From there , you can customize your theme to better suit each individual post type .
You might even want to turn your WordPress site into something more like Tumblr .
This will be easy to do in WordPress 3.0 simply by creating custom post types for Text , Photo , Quote , Link , Chat , Audio , and Video .
Thanks to custom post types , there are many new possibilities for how you use WordPress to publish any sort of content .
2. Menu Management
Menu management is one of the most exciting and talked about features in WordPress 3.0 .
This feature gives you full control over your site 's navigation menus .
With an easy drag and drop interface , users can create menus that include any mixture of links to internal pages , external URLs , categories , you name it .
Then you can embed these custom menus as a widget wherever your theme allows .
So let 's say you 're running a site which has several informational pages , plus a blog , featured video posts , and you also want to promote your social media presence .
You can customize your main navigation to look something like this :
HOME
BLOG ( links to the main blog page )
VIDEOS ( links to the video category , or post type )
INFO PAGE
INFO PAGE SUB INFO PAGE
TWITTER ( links to your Twitter profile )
FACEBOOK ( links to your Facebook Fan Page )
Changing the order , titles , and destination of these links is a piece of cake with menu management in WordPress 3.0 .
3. Custom Taxonomies
While this new feature may seem a bit complex to non-developers , it certainly brings WordPress 3.0 closer to a true CMS .
Custom taxonomies allow you to create additional pieces of meta information .
By default , there are " Categories " and " Tags . "
Now we can add additional types , with the option of being hierarchical or not .
So what does this mean exactly ?
Here are some examples of what you can do with custom taxonomies :
Let 's say you 're a film fanatic and you use your WordPress blog to post reviews and rate new movies .
You can create a custom taxonomy for " Rating , " then add R , PG - 13 , PG , G to every review .
Another example would be real estate listing websites .
In addition to photos and descriptions , you might use additional taxonomies to provide a list of specs on each property such as asking price , number of bedrooms , year built , etc .
4. New Default
Theme : " Twentyten "
Twentyten is the long - overdue default theme packaged with new installations of WordPress 3.0 .
It features a clean , yet bold design and introduces some nice functionality not found in many themes .
Two features built into Twentyten are particularly useful if you 're new to WordPress and do n't have the coding skills to customize your theme .
They are :
Custom Header Image
The Twentyten theme gives you the ability to easily change your site 's header image .
Packaged with the theme are eight interesting banner images to choose from .
You can also upload your own image .
This feature is n't limited to the Twentyten theme .
It can be activated and included by theme developers as well .
Custom Background Image
Another nifty feature found in Twentyten is the ability to upload your own background image for your site .
You can also set a solid background color if you want .
While this is likely an easy thing to tweak even for those with only light knowledge of web development , it 's certainly useful for those who do n't want to get their hands dirty and edit CSS .
Again , custom background functionality can be included in other themes as well if activated by the theme developer .
5. Multi-site
You can't discuss WordPress 3.0 without mentioning the new multi-site capabilities .
That is , you can manage several different websites ( with different domains and / or sub- domains ) all with a single installation of WordPress .
What was previously known as WordPress MU ( Multi - User ) is now merged with the core WordPress system in 3.0 .
Enabling multi-site capabilities likely is n't something for the average user , as it requires some tinkering with the code and configuring server settings .
That said , the average user likely is n't interested in having multi-site capabilities .
So who benefits from running a multi-site installation of WordPress ?
It 's perfect if you 're running a blog network , or manage a large news organization with many different departments .
Perhaps your business has each employee running their own blog with a unique design or even their own domain .
These are situations where multi-site functionality can be useful .
What Else ?
Here are a few of the minor feature enhancements arriving in WordPress 3.0 :
Get Shortlink ( with your own domain )
We all know how useful URL shorteners can be , especially for tweeting links .
WordPress 2.9 gave you the ability to use the wp.me URL shortener .
WordPress 3.0 takes this feature a step further by allowing you to get a shortlink for your post based on your own domain name .
For example : http://mashable.com/?post=7127.
You do n't need to mask your URL with other services like bit.ly .
Now you can keep your branding intact when you tweet your links .
Author Templates
New in 3.0 is the ability to create unique author templates .
This is great if you 're running a multi- author blog and you 'd like to apply unique styles or layouts to individual author pages .
Select Username and Password During Installation
Before WordPress 3.0 , new installations automatically set your master account to username " admin " with an auto - generated password .
Now , you can define these during installation , saving you the hassle of changing them later .
It also adds a new layer of security .
WordPress sites have been known to be compromised simply because they use the most common username , " admin . "
Get the entire list of new features and changes at the official WordPress Codex page for 3.0 .
Which feature are you most excited to get your hands on in WordPress 3.0 ?

More WordPress resources from Mashable :
Half a loaf is supposed to be better than none , but not when it comes to overhearing half a cellphone conversation , researchers say .
Such forced eavesdropping often leaves people irritated .
Called " halfalogues , " these one - way conversations drain more attention and concentration than when overhearing two people talk in person , Cornell University researchers found .
" When you hear half of a conversation , you get less information and you can't predict as well , " Lauren Emberson , a co-author of the study , said in an interview with Reuters .
" It requires more attention .
" Since halfalogues really are more distracting and you can't tune them out , this could explain why people are irritated , " she said .
The study , which will be published in the journal Psychological Science , involved 41 college students who did concentration exercises , such as tracking moving dots , while hearing one or both ends of a cellphone conversation .
( No indication whether the content of the conversations or lack thereof added to the annoyance factor ... )
The U.S. wireless trade association CTIA estimates that last year Americans spent 2.3 trillion minutes on their mobiles .
That 's a 900 % increase since 2000 .

The Real Hero of Raiders
I ’d like to take a moment to mention perhaps the greatest movie archeologist / adventure of all time …
Rene Belloq .
You might be more familiar with Normandy Belloq , no , nothing ?
From Normandy Belloq and the Liberators of the Lost Ark played by Paul Freeman .
Okay , some of you may remember Belloq as the other archeologist , the “ evil ” archeologist , from Raiders of the Lost Ark .
However , the only reason Belloq is the bad guy is because we see him through Indiana Jones ’s perspective , the reality is that Rene Belloq is the hero of the film , while Indiana Jones is the evil invader .
Let ’s look at Belloq ’s offenses :
1. Belloq stole the golden idol .
2. Belloq tried to seduce Marion Ravenwood .
3. Belloq helped the Nazi ’s acquire the Ark of the Covenant .
Belloq Stole Indie ’s Gold Idol
Yes , Indie did the leg work .
Yes , Indiana Jones navigated his way through all the booby traps , jumped chasms , dodged poison darts , and out ran a giant boulder .
Belloq most likely enjoyed a cool glass of lemonade at the time .
But does that mean Indiana deserved the gold idol ?
The Indiana Jones school of archeology teaches , “ It belongs in a museum . ”
He says it like 37 times throughout the series .
Belloq , however , believes that history belongs to the people , not just the privileged college kids who can afford museums .
Belloq was , in fact , working with the indigenous Hovitos people ( the rightful owners of the idol ) in order to keep the idol with the people it belonged to and away from grave robbers like Indiana Jones .
It ’s all perspective .
Indie assumes Belloq is going to double cross the Hovitos , but we never actually see this .
For all we know , Belloq handed it to idol over the the Hovitos chieftain right after Indie took off , and toasted the occasion with some tasty lemonade .
Belloq Seduced Marion
As far as I know , it ’s not a crime to like the same girl as someone else , just because Indie called dibs does n’t mean Belloq is some sort of scoundrel .
Belloq brought Marion food , brought her a nice dress , and shared several dozen drinks with her .
And the most important thing of all , he kept Marion alive .
If Belloq had n’t taken an interest in her , the Nazi ’s would have killed her .
Belloq did everything in his power to make sure Marion was comfortable , cared for … and alive .
Indiana , on the other hand , abandoned her 4 times in the film ( once at bar , once at the market , once in the desert , and once on the boat ) , and at least once before the film ever began , breaking the poor girl ’s heart .
Yet , she still chose Indiana , and Belloq had those dreamy blue eyes .
Belloq Helped Nazis
Nazis are a very convenient enemy because they are taken as being inherently evil .
You do n’t need back story , you do n’t need motivation , we ’re just supposed to assume they ’re evil and everyone associated with them are evil .
This makes it very okay to mow them down in large numbers .
Let ’s remember though that Belloq is French and France would later be occupied by the Third Reich .
We do n’t know the exact relationship he had with Nazi Germany , perhaps they threatened his family or his homeland .
We do n’t know Belloq ’s exact motivation , but should we assume it ’s because he ’s a big Hitler fan ?
And yes , Belloq did aid the Nazis by heading their dig , by heading a terrible dig , slowly digging in the wrong spot .
Belloq did whatever it took to keep the Ark of the Covenant out of Nazi hands .
It was his idea to open the ark on a far off island instead of Berlin .
He even gave Indiana Jones a chance to blow the ark up , which would have been great , it kept the ark away from the Nazi and everyone survives .
Instead , Belloq had to sacrifice his own life in order to kill the Nazis and save humanity , all while Indiana Jones sat safely tied to a post with his eyes closed .
Is Indiana Jones only a hero because the title has his name in it ?
Given the right circumstances , the right perspective , can the even the villain be the hero ?
“ And the next question , for 10 000 points : Where is Jimmy Hoffa ’s body buried ? ”
We already know for sure that Japanese anime studio Madhouse is developing an animated version of cult TV series Supernatural .
But are these leaked character sketches for demon- hunting brothers Sam and Dean Winchester ?
Signs point to yes .

AnimeNews reports that these images surfaced online after fans found them .
They look very much like the art that 's in the background of the Supernatural Animation logo , so it 's likely that these character sketches are genuine - though of course they may not be the final versions of what we 'll see when the anime hits next year .
As thrilled as I am to see Sammy and Dean with anime hair , what I really want is some concept art of the monsters and demons they 'll encounter .

FBI / DHS Attempt to Seize Colorado Indymedia Server and Silence Our Users By Ringo 24 Jun 2010
On Jun 17 , Colorado Indymedia was contacted by Special Agent Adam Kowalski of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) / Department of Homeland Security ( DHS ) .
As part of an " ongoing investigation " by Federal Protective Services , they attempted to seize the Colorado Indymedia server , believing that we kept logs ( such as IP address access logs ) that could identity users on our site ...
We told the FBI that " Colorado Indymedia does not retain this [ identifying ] information because we strongly believe in the First Amendment right to free , anonymous speech . "
[ I 'm glad Colo . Indymedia ( essentially ) told the DHS to go f*ck themselves .
They spend so much time on the CLG site , they should pay a portion of our webhosting bill .

HOUSTON — BP and government officials said Friday that a cap installed over a gushing well in the Gulf of Mexico was funneling some oil and gas to the surface , but they cautioned that much was still leaking and that it would be days before they could declare this latest containment effort a success .
As the large metal cap was inched into place late Thursday , about 80 engineers , scientists and government officials crowded into the hive — as the room in the subsea operations command center is called — here to watch on video screens .
The maneuver was their handiwork , and a critical step in the latest of what had been a string of dismal efforts to capture some of the oil leaking since the Deepwater Horizon drill rig exploded on April 20 .
As the cap hit the oil and gas streaming with great force from the top of the well , it suddenly disappeared , hidden from the video cameras by clouds of hydrocarbons spewing everywhere , said a technician who was there .
The operation was briefly flying blind .
But a few tense moments later the cap was successfully centered over the wellhead , 5,000 feet below the surface , then lowered half a foot to make a seal .
The crowd , including Energy Secretary Steven Chu , gave a cheer .
“ I would say that things are going as planned , ” Kent Wells , a BP executive , said at a briefing Friday afternoon .
“ I am encouraged .
But remember , we only have 12 hours ’ experience . ”
What is Technical Debt ?
In the tech world , we are familiar with the concept of technical debt .
Technical debt represents areas in the code that makes changing something more time - consuming and hinder the stability of the system .
Introducing the Social Debt
I would like to introduce you to something I experienced in my online ventures called Social Debt .
In the lean startup movement , people encourage you to interact with your users / customers as soon as possible to get feedback as early as possible to make sure you build what they want and need .
You need to know that by being in contact with users , customers or even partners , you start to build up Social Debt .
Now people are using your product , customers have paid for a specific service , partners have spent time and money to grow with you .
You ca n’t change your application as easily as before anymore .
People entered data they do n’t want to lose , some customers have bought your application just for the exact feature you are trying to remove , And partners are betting on your success and investing time and effort and you have to discuss any change with them otherwise their businesses are at risk .
This is Social Debt .
Social commitments you make throughout the development of your product that make future changes harder .
Like technical debt , each social debt increment should be a conscious decision .
Real life example
I am working on the platform TaskArmy.com , a freelance marketplace that aims to be fair for clients and freelancers and try to simplify the whole outsourcing process .
When I started inviting freelancers to the application so that they can add their services , social debt started building up .
For example , at the early launch of TaskArmy , the commission the site was set to 15 % .
Later on , it was harder to change the commission percentage taken from the freelancers because some had signed in for 15 % not 20 % or 30 % .
Social Debt .
When I allowed people to start using TaskArmy for their own niche market , ( taskrr ) , I built more social debt .
Today , if I want to drastically change the design of the landing page , I need to add some exceptions in my code to only apply them on my version of the website .
Social Debt .
Conclusion
Some changes have to be made and some users will not be happy .
You ca n’t avoid that and you should n’t try to avoid that at all cost .
But like taking in more technical debt , social debt must be a conscious decision otherwise you will gradually lose your leanness .
Do n’t build up social debt too early to allow you to iterate or pivot quickly and without damage .
How do you manage Social Debt in your application ?

As the collapse of the U.S. housing sector accelerated in 2008 and the precise nature of this supply - driven bubble became apparent , I laid out a very specific " blueprint " for putting a genuine " bottom " in this market .
The U.S. government needed to commit $ 1 trillion to $ 2 trillion to paying down the mortgage balances of U.S. homeowners in order to restore some badly needed equity for these homeowners , which in turn , would provide some stability to the U.S. housing market by eliminating most / all " underwater " mortgages , thus ending the incentive to " walk away " from these mortgages .
By 2009 , with the U.S. government having done nothing to mitigate this collapse and U.S. homeowners having lost much more equity , I raised the necessary government ante to $ 3 trillion : enough to pay down mortgage balances by roughly 20 % ( only a small fraction of the $ 10 trillion used to bail out Wall Street ) .
But there was a second structural problem in the U.S. housing market that I identified : a supply glut that could only be " fixed " by bulldozing vast numbers of homes .
Not only was there a gross excess of total housing inventory , but the bubble - driven insanity had resulted in the construction of vast numbers of homes in totally impractical locations : the " exurbs . "
These were new housing ( and population ) enclaves that were springing up so far from major population ( and employment ) centers that they could n't even be classified as " suburbs . "
In February of 2009 , I wrote a piece that I referred to as a " case study " of the U.S. housing collapse : the town of Merced , Calif .
Merced was located 110 miles southeast of San Francisco , the nearest employment center .
If such housing developments were ever viable , it was only in a world of cheap oil .
That world no longer exists .
Given this reality , I reiterated my position that the U.S. government would have to demand that at least 1 million of these homes be bulldozed .
This would solve two problems .
It would eliminate housing units that would likely never be sold and remedy the problem of overall excess supply , where there are currently somewhere around 20 million empty homes in the U.S. ( and an even greater number of " underwater " mortgages ) .
The problem with this solution is that the U.S. banks holding these mortgages -- and holding trillions of dollars of leveraged housing - derivatives -- would have to take virtually 100 % writedowns on these units .
Although the U.S.'s " mark - to - fantasy " accounting rules allow U.S. banks to maintain totally fictitious valuations on U.S. housing units ( and their derivatives ) as long as the homes are still intact , that will not be the case once they are razed .
In the efforts by U.S. banks to maintain fictitious valuations on U.S. homes and to create the artificial appearance of a " bottom " in the U.S. housing market , U.S. banks have been holding vast numbers of " REO " homes off the market .
Part of this game is being played by U.S. banks dragging their heels on foreclosure proceedings , which has been aided by the sheer quantity of defaulting mortgages : enough to totally clog up the court systems of many U.S. states .
In Florida alone , there is a backlog of more than 500,000 foreclosures , with only a trickle of those homes actually reaching the market .
Even after U.S. banks take possession of homes , they frequently hold those homes off the market in order to allow the propaganda machine to distribute fictitious numbers for U.S. " housing inventories . "
This is especially true with high - end homes , where for the first time in U.S. housing history , mortgage defaults are comparable with the rates of defaults for lower - end homes .
The difference is that buyers are more likely for low - priced homes .
With this " shadow inventory " of unsold / unlisted U.S. homes totaling somewhere between 5 million and 10 million units , another wave of foreclosures / defaults is about to explode upon this market , as millions of the infamous " option - ARM " mortgages will be resetting over the next two years , with a large chunk of those millions of units representing certain defaults .
For those still not familiar with this terminology , an " option - ARM " is an " adjustable rate mortgage " that also allows reckless borrowers to pay no principle during the " teaser period " before these mortgages reset and pay less than 100 % of interest , with that unpaid interest being added to the principal .
Thus , when these mortgages reset , many borrowers will face a triple shock to their budgets .
First , the interest rates will rise on most of these mortgages .
Second , all that additional principal will now be factored into their new payments .
Lastly , they will now have to make full payments on these mortgages .
Some homeowners will now be forced to make payments of up to three to five times their current , partial payments .
What makes this upcoming crisis truly horrifying to anyone foolish enough to venture into the U.S. housing market is that more than 40 % of these option holders have been making minimum payments ( or less ) on these mortgages , and virtually 100 % of those mortgages are certain to default .
The combination of the massive " shadow inventory " of U.S. homes and the new tidal wave of defaults about to hit the U.S. market means that the U.S. housing market is about to suffer a second , worse collapse .
With U.S. housing valuations still grossly inflated in relation to income / wealth levels , and with the total " equity " held by U.S. homeowners continuing to shrink , the next collapse in the U.S. housing sector either will be even steeper than the first collapse ( which was three times as bad as the worst year of the Great Depression ) or will simply grind on much , much longer ( a more likely scenario ) .
As regular readers already know , this next collapse in the U.S. housing market will also be severely aggravated by two other factors .
First , in an effort to create a second U.S. housing bubble , most of the new mortgages written up by government fraud factories in 2009 had zero down payments .
This means that none of these homeowners has any equity in these homes and ( with U.S. house prices now falling again ) these homeowners are virtually all " underwater " on their new mortgages .
With these new " homeowners " ( who actually " own " nothing ) having no equity in these homes and having just started making payments , these new buyers will be even more likely to default , or simply walk away , than the U.S. homeowners who already were defaulting or walking away in the largest numbers in history .
Secondly , with the pensions of spendthrift baby boomers grossly underfunded ( by as much as $ 3 trillion ) , there is zero possibility of these retirees collecting full pensions .
This will necessitate that baby boomers dump trillions of dollars more homes onto this grossly oversupplied market or drastically reduce their standard of living ( and spending ) .
Both of these developments will have a severe ( negative ) impact on the U.S. housing market .
The only difference is that one ( dumping real estate ) will impact the market directly , while the other will impact the market indirectly ( reducing spending , which reduces employment ) .
With the U.S. government and the U.S. propaganda machine no longer able to pretend that there is a " bottom " in this market , we are at last seeing glimmers of reality seep into the reporting of this coming crisis .
Recently , the " chief economist " for Fannie Mae( FNM ) bluntly stated the obvious :
Some of the absurd real estate developments " might have to be torn down . "
The reality is that most of these " exurb " housing units will have to be torn down , along with some of the worst areas of " urban blight " in the U.S.
In many of the most economically devastated U.S. cities , the combination of waves of foreclosures , crime and a lack of city funding for basic maintenance have left vast areas looking like Baghdad during the worst periods of the U.S. invasion .
The Fannie Mae economist offered no specifics or ideas of any kind on how many units would have to be destroyed , and ( naturally ) left open who would absorb the massive bank losses on these demolitions .
Obviously , as a fellow bankster , the Fannie Mae economist did n't think that Wall Street would or should absorb any of its own losses .
( Is n't that what the Federal Reserve 's printing - press is for ? )
In the real world , as I have mentioned in previous commentaries , this demolition process has already begun .
Some new housing developments have already been quietly bulldozed , while at least one U.S. city is already deeply into planning mass demolitions of entire neighborhoods .
These were realities that totally contradicted the mythical " U.S. economic recovery " , and so were ignored by media propagandists and politicians alike .
Sadly , what Americans are about to discover is that instead of being more than one year into a " U.S. economic recovery , " they are standing in the " eye " of an economic hurricane .
This period of false stability is over .
The pretend bottom in the housing market is gone .
The feeble wave of Census hiring is over .
The flood of " stimulus dollars " has slowed to a trickle , and bankrupt state and local governments now either will have to formally default or radically slash spending and raise taxes to prevent such bankruptcies .
When the government - sponsored enterprises , which bankroll 95 % of U.S. mortgages , start talking about demolishing homes , you know that " the party is over . "
When a group of UCLA students set out recently to deliver food they had collected for the homeless and needy , they did n’t have to travel far .
Pushing carts laden with hundreds of pounds of goods , they walked a few dozen yards to the Student Activities Center .
There , a small room is stocked with such items as canned soups , beans , instant noodles , macaroni and cheese , breakfast cereals , fruit juice and water .
Many on the Westwood campus are unaware of the Food Closet , as it is known .
But for those students who are cash - strapped or homeless , it has become an indispensable feature of campus life .
The door is always open , and 40 to 50 students drop by each day .
Microwaves , plates and utensils are located in a student lounge across the hall .
After the newly organized student - run service group Swipes for the Homeless learned of the pantry , it seemed like a natural fit .
Students helping students .
Founder Bryan Pezeshki said he heard about the pantry during a food drive a few months ago .
Students had been collecting food for homeless shelters downtown , but they also took about 40 sandwiches to the campus pantry .
When Pezeshki returned a few hours later , all of the sandwiches were gone .
“ I did a little more research , and we decided to focus our drive this quarter on getting UCLA students help , ” Pezeshki , 20 , said .
“ Students really wanted to help other students out , especially during these tough times . ”
Campus officials began hearing anecdotal evidence in 2008 of the economic downturn ’s effect on students , said Antonio Sandoval , director of UCLA ’s Community Programs Office .
No one knows the exact number of homeless or hungry students on campus , he said .
Some are undocumented , some are veterans .
Many have parents who have become destitute either through divorce or lost jobs .
Concern grew enough that the chancellor created an economic response team to provide resources and gather more information .
But many students in need prefer to remain hidden .
“ It ’s hard for people to talk about food here , ” Sandoval said .
“ We ’re situated in a community where people all around seem to have plenty .
Students in need try to pretend they do n’t need help . ”
To anyone involved in campus life , the extent of financial distress and hunger was obvious , said Abdallah Jadallah , a former president of the Muslim Student Assn. at UCLA .
He said he knew 10 to 15 homeless students .
He noticed students who were spending nights in campus libraries that are open around the clock , showering in gyms , sleeping in cars or bunking with a succession of friends .
And those whose breakfast , lunch and dinner consisted of Taco Bell $ 1 burritos .
At the same time , he saw excess food from campus events being tossed away .
Jadallah spoke with Sandoval , who found an unused utility room , and the Food Closet was born .
The pantry operates on the honor system .
Jadallah put a notebook in the pantry for students to leave comments .
Many are poignant .
“ The hardest thing to accept is the notion that there are times in life when you become dependent on [ the ] charity of others , ” wrote one student .
“ I have been working most of my life and was working 35 + hours at my community college .
I always had problems with money because my family is dependent on my income .
Due to the recession , in the summer of ’09 I was unemployed for 4 months .
I spend all my savings paying off my debt and my family ’s debt ( they also lost their jobs ) . ”
“ Currently I am homeless , sleeping in my truck , attending school full time .
If I did not have the food closet I would have to settle for the $ 1 burrito at Taco Bell .
I have no money to my name .
I have no home .
I am grateful to have the charity of others in the form of a food closet .
Thank you for restoring my faith in humanity and for making it possible to continue working towards my dream of becoming my family ’s first college graduate .
Thank you . ”
Several campus offices now regularly donate food , and Jadallah is reaching out to businesses in the community .
He was one of four UCLA students honored recently with the 2010 Charles E. Young Humanitarian Award for their commitment to public service .
“ It ’s part of my religion that when you see something wrong , you have to try to change it , ” said Jadallah , 22 , a civil engineering student from Perris .
“ It ’s really cool that other UCLA students are involved , and with Swipes for the Homeless , we ’re tackling this problem together . ”
Under the Swipes program , UCLA students can donate money to the needy from the unused meal plans they purchase each quarter .
Students redeem their prepaid meals when they swipe their identification cards in the cafeteria , but some do n’t use them all .
On Friday , as other students were celebrating graduation , Pezeshki and Jadallah met for the first time , hauling pallets of food from a dining hall to the pantry .
Pezeshki’s group collected 2,362 swipes during a recent food drive , which the dining hall converted into about 1,000 pounds of food .
Brittany Taylor donated 10 swipes to the cause .
“ This is being recycled in the best way possible and going to people that actually need it , ” said Taylor , 18 , an English major who is ending her freshman year .
“ I was in a high school program where we passed out food to homeless people downtown .
Students need to know about these issues . ”
Pezeshki and Jadallah are working to make that happen and hoping to expand their programs in the fall .
Both have received inquiries from other colleges and universities that want to start similar projects .
“ We want to work with more homeless shelters in the Los Angeles community , ” Pezeshki said , “ but we ’ll also have a direct connection the Food Closet from now on . ”

A synthetic substance similar to ones found in marijuana stimulates cell growth in regions of the brain associated with anxiety and depression , pointing the way for new treatments for these diseases , according to University of Saskatchewan medical research published today in The Journal of Clinical Investigation .
Xia Zhang , an associate professor in the U of S neuropsychiatry research unit , led the team that tested the effects of HU - 210 , a potent synthetic cannabinoid similar to a group of compounds found in marijuana .
The synthetic version is about 100 times as powerful as THC , the compound responsible for the high experienced by recreational users .
The team found that rats treated with HU - 210 on a regular basis showed neurogenesis – the growth of new brain cells in the hippocampus .
This region of the brain is associated with learning and memory , as well as anxiety and depression .
The effect is the opposite of most legal and illicit drugs such as alcohol , nicotine , heroin , and cocaine .
“ Most ‘ drugs of abuse ’ suppress neurogenesis , ” Zhang says .
“ Only marijuana promotes neurogenesis . ”
Current theory states that depression may be sparked when too few new brain cells are grown in the hippocampus .
It is unclear whether anxiety is part of this process , but if true , HU - 210 could offer a treatment for both mood disorders by stimulating the growth of new brain cells .
But Zhang cautions that HU - 210 is only one of many cannabinoids .
His previous work with marijuana shows that while the plant may contain medicinal compounds , they come in the same package as those that cause symptoms such as acute memory impairment , addiction , and withdrawal .
Also , the HU - 210 used in the study is highly purified .
“ This is a very potent cannabinoid oil , ” Zhang says .
“ It ’s not something that would be available on the street . ”
Marijuana has been used for recreational and medicinal purposes for centuries , evoking public interest and controversy along the way .
As a medicine , the plant is used to ease pain in multiple sclerosis patients , combat nausea in cancer patients , and stimulate appetite in people afflicted with AIDS .
It has also been used to treat epilepsy and stroke .
Zhang ’s work is the latest product of the U of S Neural Systems and Plasticity Research Group ( http://www.usask.ca/neuralsystems/group.htm), a multidisciplinary effort by researchers from the Colleges of Arts and Science , Engineering , Kinesiology , Medicine , Pharmacy and Nutrition , and Veterinary Medicine .
The group collaborates to study the function of neural systems , from nerves to brain , in living organisms .
In particular , they look at how these systems change over time with experience .
Zhang ’s research is supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) , as well as a CIHR New Investigator Award .
The Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation provided funding support to establish the Neural Systems and Plasticity Research Group , as well as post - doctoral fellowship awards to research team members Wen Jiang and Shao - Ping Ji .
European leaders urged Israel over the weekend to lift its blockade of Gaza , as they drafted plans to revive and expand the European Union ’s role in monitoring goods heading into the area .
The quantity and variety of goods entering Gaza must increase , they said , offering as one possibility a proposal by Quartet Middle East envoy Tony Blair .
Blair has “ suggested a shift from a logic of denial of supplies to Gaza , with some exceptions , to a logic based on general authorization , with the exception of banned products . ”
The ministers also acknowledged Israel ’s security concerns : “ Lifting the blockade , ” they said , “ must not go hand - in - hand with a resurgence in arms trafficking and an influx of terrorist groups in Gaza . ”
On Friday , the foreign ministers from France , Italy and Spain wrote an op - ed in thein which they joined in the call .
They were careful to insist that captive IDF soldier Gilad Schalit , held by Hamas in Gaza since June 2006 , be released .
Zapatero said that at Monday ’s Council meeting , Spain ’s foreign minister , Miguel Angel Moratinos , would propose that the EU deploy “ all its political and diplomatic capability ” to end the Gaza blockade .
Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said at a joint press conference with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas Saturday that his country wants to “ forge a strong common position ” with EU countries in the face of the humanitarian situation in Gaza .
“ Why not adopt this idea ? ” they asked .
“ To guarantee full security of supplies , we propose that inspections supported and funded by the European Union should be put in place [ at land crossings ] in conditions acceptable by all in order to ensure that consignments bound for Gaza contain neither weapons nor explosives , ” they said .
“ A similar regime could in addition be applied to [ sea - bound ] consignments bound for Gaza , for example by deploying EU monitoring teams in Cyprus .
These various arrangements would be implemented only against a backdrop of very substantial relaxation of the restrictions on imports and exports to and from Gaza , ” they said .
The ministers added that they wanted to expand the role of the European Border Assistance Mission ( EUBAM ) , which has been stationed in Ashkelon since the 2007 Hamas coup in Gaza that made it impossible for Fatah to monitor the Rafah crossing , which links Egypt with Gaza .
The Jerusalem Post
They said they wanted to see EUBAM return to Rafah .
Diplomatic sources have toldthat the EU is also considering placing EUBAM at two of the three land crossings linking Israel and Gaza : Karni and Kerem Shalom .
But they did not address many of the technical problems inherent inopening a sea route to Gaza or in fully opening the land crossings –such as the fact that Gaza ’s port is not large enough to accommodatecargo ships .
In addition , the agreement under which EUBAM operates isbetween Fatah and Israel and involves the placement of Fatah on the Palestinian side of the crossings .
Hamas is not interested in having Fatah at the crossings .
Since the Gaza coup , in an attempt to economically cripple Hamas , Israel has closed the land crossings to all but humanitarian goods .
Recently it has relaxed some of those restrictions and , in particular , allowed in building material for 12 projects .
On Friday , Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu met with Blair inJerusalem to drum up support for Israel ’s right to continue its navalblockade of Gaza by which it searches and halts ships heading there soas to prevent weapons from flowing into that area by sea .
According to the Prime Minister ’s Office , Netanyahu told Blair that goods could enter Gaza by other means .
Israel has said it could show flexibility with respect to the quantityand variety of goods heading into Gaza by land .
It has , however , insisted it does not intend to allow a full revival of the Gazaeconomy , because such a move would only strengthen Hamas .

Those whooping cough numbers are stretching ever higher in California .
State health officials reported Thursday that the state has seen a threefold increase over this time last year .
Check out the L.A . Now post here .
Lest you think adults vaccinated as children can't get whooping cough , lest you think they can't pass it on to their infants , lest you think those infants can't die , read Mariah Bianchi 's story .
She was vaccinated as a child against whooping cough .
She passed it to her infant son , Dylan .
He died of the disease , also called pertussis , when he was 17 days old .
Here 's more on whooping cough from KidsHealth .
And here 's information on whooping cough vaccination for infants -- and adults -- from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
As the CDC notes :
" Infants under the age of 12 months have more serious illness from pertussis and they are more likely to have complications and be hospitalized than persons in other age groups .
In the 1990s , about two thirds of infants reported with pertussis were hospitalized .
Infants are more likely to have pneumonia or convulsions .
Infants also are at greatest risk of fatal pertussis .
In recent years , 8 to 40 infant deaths from pertussis are reported to CDC annually . "
In other words , they can't protect themselves ; we have to do it for them .

Maine Politics has the story about how this wackiness is spreading :
An overwhelming majority of delegates to the Maine Republican convention tonight voted to scrap the the proposed party platform and replace it with a document created by a group of Tea Party activists .
The official platform for the Republican Party of Maine is now a mix of right - wing fringe policies , libertarian buzzwords and outright conspiracy theories .
The document calls for the elimination of the Department of Education and the Federal Reserve , demands an investigation of " collusion between government and industry in the global warming myth , " suggests the adoption of " Austrian Economics , " declares that " ' Freedom of Religion ' does not mean ' freedom from religion ' " ( which I guess makes atheism illegal ) , insists that " healthcare is not a right , " calls for the abrogation of the " UN Treaty on Rights of the Child " and the " Law Of The Sea Treaty " and declares that we must resist " efforts to create a one world government . "
It also contains favorable mentions of both the Tea Party and Ron Paul .
You can read the whole thing here .
Dan Billings , who has served as an attorney for the Maine GOP , called the new platform " wack job pablum " and " nutcase stuff . "
Despite the document 's crazy content , Maine Republican Party Chair Charlie Webster insisted to the AP that all of the elements in the platform are things that Republicans support .
He claimed to the Press Herald that these issues reflect the values of working - class Mainers .
The EFF has announced the availability of a new Firefox add - on called HTTPS Everywhere .
As the name implies , it forces the browser to use a secure connection when the user visits a supported Web site .
Although many Web sites support SSL , it is n't always used by default , which means that users are sometimes exposed to the risk of snooping and data interception by unauthorized third parties .
The add - on aims to mitigate that risk by directing users to HTTPS URLs whenever it is possible .
The add - on currently works with several popular destinations on the Internet , including search engines and social networking Web sites .
Users can configure their own sets of rules to enable the feature on additional sites .
The underlying code in the add - on was partially derived from the Strict Transport Security implementation from the well - known NoScript add - on .
The HTTPS Anywhere add - on was designed to be easier to use and configure .
The add - on is available for download from the official EFF blog .

What comes to mind when you hear the word Vegas ?
Elvis ?
Showgirls ?
Marg Helgenberger swabbing semen off the underside of roulette tables ?
Or post - apocalyptic landscapes , warring mercenaries , plasma rifles and robot policemen ?
Welcome to the world of New Vegas , where the house always wins .
In fact , the whole place is run by one Mr House , a mysterious overlord who maintains order with the help of those robot policemen , known as Securitrons .
They patrol the strip , which is just as brightly lit and busily populated as it ever was .
Vegas is n't about to let a bit of war get in the way of fun .
In other words , we 're not in Washington DC any more .
The setting for the follow - up to Fallout 3 is altogether glitzier , trashier and generally less grey .
Vegas was n't as badly hit by nukes , it turns out , so the sky is still blue and the casinos are still open for business , offering all manner of services to those looking for a good time .
I got to try some of these out during a playtest of Fallout : New Vegas at E3 .
The finished game will feature a variety of themed casinos , such as the swank Ultralux and the seedy Gomorrah .
But I only had time to visit The Tops , which seemed to be a pretty traditional place complete with slot machines , roulette wheels and blackjack tables .
Toggle the ' hardcore ' option on and you 'll have to make sure your character gets enough sleep , food and water .
You can play all these games in New Vegas , along with a newly invented card game called Caravan , which is played throughout the world .
You might want to check how many luck skill points you 've earned first , however , as this will directly affect your chances of winning .
If things do go your way , you might want to quit while you 're ahead , as the casino manager is likely to turn up and turf out those who win too often .
This may be Vegas , but that does n't mean anything goes .
There are those Securitrons , for starters , along with human security guards who will insist on searching you for weapons when you enter casinos .
( Good job , then , that there are shady characters outside offering easily concealed items like switchblade knives for sale . )
Wandering past a bottle of whisky left unattended on a bar , I idly selected the option to steal it - only to find myself under fire from several directions and being forced to leg it .
Cut to the Mojave desert wasteland , another location on show during the E3 demo .
It 's about the same size as the DC wasteland and just as desolate , but in a brighter , bolder way .
Straggly bits of scrub poke out from between vividly red rocks .
The sun beats down relentlessly , bleaching the wood and fading the canvas of the tents and huts in the base camps .
They 're inhabited by members of the various factions featured in Fallout : New Vegas .
These include Caesar 's Legion , a bunch of well - organised fighters who are into slavery and generally doing as the Romans did .
Also being introduced today is the New California Republic , one of the largest factions in the game .

Eliminating The 'I '
When A Social MMO Is n't A Social MMO
Next Stop : Solving RTS On Console ?
Eskil Steenberg is a one - man show .
The chatty , perpetually - smiling Swede first made a big splash at GDC 2009 when he unveiled his self - made set of intuitive procedural generation tools , and now he 's just launched LOVE , a multiplayer open - world game he hopes will showcase the fruits of his labor . , with its massive persistent universe and team base - oriented collaborative gameplay , resists definition .
Its distinctive Impressionist painter vibe has roots in Steenberg 's roots as a graphic artist -- although it 's programming with which he fell in love .
" And when I started programming , the first thing I wanted to do was make better tools for myself , " he tells Gamasutra .
" And from there , I got uber - technical , and uber - into graphics programming , so I really wanted to make something using my tools .
I thought that I had some tools that were really cool , that could really speed up the way that games were made , but I wanted to prove it .
" Thuswas born , an enormously ambitious and expansive design for a first project .
" I 've sort of part - time worked for some game companies and helped them with some tech issues , but I 'd never designed a game or made any games myself -- which is kind of weird , " he admits .
" I just am fairly knowledgeable , I guess , when it comes to programming , " he says .
" Really , making any game is about taking all the ideas for the things you need and coming up with a collection of ideas ... people ask me where did I get the idea [ for ] , and I usually say it 's not an idea -- it 's lots and lots and lots of ideas , " he explains .
He spent three years " hacking away " to build the toolset for his own interests , he says .
Working so much on one project " gets kind of boring real easily , so you want to constantly come up with new , cool things , and innovate and feel that you 're pushing the envelope at any stage of the project just so that you stay interested in what you 're doing , " he says .
is billed by many critics as an MMO , but Steenberg , who does n't really play MMOs , says he would n't call it that .
Like many adult gamers , these days he finds himself time - pressed , and prefers games that can offer a rich experience in 20 to 30 minutes .
" Lately i've gotten to this point where i feel that just -- this is very personal , but personally -- I think that my game is much much more interesting than all other games , " he says .
" I think also that I 'm onto something ... when you think you 're onto something ... and I think I 'm more and more putting a lot of space between me and the rest of the industry .
I think I do things very differently , " he reflects .
Adds Steenberg : " That does n't mean that I 'm gonna rule the world and be really good and my game 's gonna be ' better ' it just means that i'm running on a parallel track ... from the rest of the industry right now , " he says .
" That just means that when I play other games , it does n't really apply to what I 'm trying to do .
" So he 's stopped trying to genre - define , he says .
" My ultimate goal with -- I think in parts I 'm there , and in many parts I 'm not really there yet -- is to create a story - based game , but where the story is completely emergent , " he explains .
That means the world evolves depending on what the players do , he says , without scripted pieces , pre-generated characters or other traditional elements of story - based games .
" I 'm trying to build game mechanics that would be similar to dramatic puzzle pieces ... instruments for creating drama .
" To create a story , one needs an " object of desire , " he asserts , and in most cases it does n't even matter what it is .is a first - person game where each player creates a settlement with other players -- together , they build a home base with a shared inventory and shared abilities to which each individual contributes .
"
In order to get more abilities you go out into the world and find tokens and place them in your settlement , and when you bring them back everyone in the settlement gets them , " he says .
" It 's very , very collaborative .
"
The conflict comes in with other , AI - generated and populated settlements .
Players can steal tokens from enemy camps , but then the AI will march on to attack the players ' settlements .
" It becomes almost like playing a RTS but one where you 're playing a peon in an army , and you can decide what to do -- you can stay at home and build , you can explore , you can do all kinds of things , " he says .
"
If you get attacked by an enemy settlement , there wo n't be characters coming from spawn closets -- they will actually walk through the world and find your settlement and start attacking it , " he says .
That real sense of time and distance is important to immersion .
And when a settlement is destroyed , it leaves a ruin on the world -- a permanent part of the story .
" Depending on what players do , they change the history of the world , " explains Steenberg .
It seems initially counter - intuitive to a story - driven game that there are no special accouterments for individual characters , especially in an era where prevailing design wisdom for multiplayer online games holds that personalization and customization is essential to engagement .
" I do n't want you to think about your character at all , " Steenberg says .
" I want you to think about your settlement .
If you build your character in a normal game , you get satisfaction from knowing that you got a level - so - and - so character .
But if you build something that other players take part in , that means whatever you contribute will be appreciated by other players . "
" Nobody 's fighting for their own character , but rather fighting for their friends , and that means that the game has a very different sort of social environment , " Steenberg says .
This is a key element differentiatingfrom traditional competitive or self - glorifying multiplayer games .
Steenberg says that even cooperative multiplayer titles still encourage players to pursue personal glory .
But in an environment where players are encouraged only to better one another , " it means there 's no real point in being a jerk in the game to other players , " says Steenberg .
" You 're all on the same side ; you have common goals . " " Most games are about ' I am better than you ' ; it 's kind of trash talk - inviting , " he continues .
" I do n't really care about game mechanics as mechanics .
I do n't care about what you can do in the game -- I care about other things , like i want the players to feel this particular feeling or I want them to play in this particular way , and then I 'll find the mechanic that will get them to do that .
" And because players share resources , anyone new to a settlement can access the cumulative learnings and items of their team from the moment they jump in .
But paradoxically , Steenberg says the multiplayer component ofis n't terribly important to him .
" Games usually become a lot better when they 're multiplayer , but ... the kind of game that I want to do would be possible to do as a single - player game , " he says .
And the reason he disassociates his work from traditional multiplayer or social gaming is philosophical differences : " I think a lot of games right now in that world , they 're not actually trying to make a fun game .
They 're trying to get players , " he says .
" It 's a slot machine psychological thing they 're using to get people to kill 50 boars ... and in some ways I think those games are kind of immoral because they 're not actually trying to be fun .
They 're trying to be addictive .
" Steenberg concedes he wants to look at ways to makea little more sticky , but overall he 's pleased with the design even while he hopes to evolve it long - term .
" The sales numbers could be better , but I am happy with them , " he says .
" I never considered it to be a launch game , really , it 's a very long - term game and long - term , it looks pretty good .
" As for feedback , it 's been good -- " The mix is ' I do n't get it ' and ' I love it ' , and sometimes ' I do n't get it , but I love it . ' "
The challenge is that according to Steenberg there are no comparison points toand nothing similar players can use as a point of reference , which can be a conundrum in inviting new players .
So even though he 's looking ahead to his undisclosed next project already , " I do n't seeever ending .
In some ways , I feel that I have this amazing world now , and I solved all these boring problems like pathfinding and having a world that can change and is completely buildable ...
I really do n't want to end now because there 's so much cool stuff I can do .
" " And I believe in games as services ... because you really continue to improve them indefinitely , " he adds .
Nonetheless , Steenberg 's personal goal for his next project is just as ambitious asis .
" I am contemplating things -- and I can't tell you what it is exactly , but I can tell you this : I am fairly sure that i have solved how to do realtime strategy on console , " he states .
" I 've had a bunch of people actually try it and they 're pretty sure that I 've solved it .
It 's at the level of speed where you can move around similar to a mouse and keyboard .
I had some game ideas with that , but it 's still early , and I 'm kind of busy right now . "

In what must seem like a case of déjà - vu , Belgium heads to the polls Sunday for a snap general election that again puts its feuding linguistic communities at loggerheads .
Ahead of the vote , Flemish separatists campaigning to split up the country are primed to emerge as the dominant political force .
Advertising Read more
Like many before them , these elections are vital to Belgium 's future , with much hingeing on how the Dutch - speaking majority vote for the independence advocates of the New Flemish Alliance ( NVA ) .
Days ahead of the elections NVA leader Bart de Wever is set to beat outgoing premier Yves Leterme 's Christian Democrats to become the biggest party in the wealthy Flemish north , with some 25 per cent of the vote .
The French public seems willing and ready to welcome the Belgian Francophones .
According to a survey by French national daily France Soir , 66 per cent of French are in favour of adopting Wallonia as part of France if the country ruptured .
In the midst of its political crisis , and the wider - reaching debt crisis , Belgium will
take the European Union presidency on 1 July .
But its political parties are so bitterly at odds that there is little chance of forming a viable coalition in time for the takeover .
It could take months to fashion a new coalition government - especially if , as polls predict , Flemish separatists take the upper hand .
Belgium ’s problems all centre on the question of who should have more power within the federation - the Flemish majority or the Francophone minority , who live in the poorer Wallonia region in the south but who are strongest in Brussels .
Federalism has long been a problem in Belgium , which is so attached to regional rule that the country barely flinched when it lived without a government for 196 days in 2008 .
For his part , De Wever , claims he is not interested in the national top job – and does n't see himself as a revolutionary .
He believes Belgium , formed in 1830 , will " slowly but surely , very gently disappear , " as powers are devolved to the regions and the European Union .
So what happened to the most recent government ?
Leterme 's five - partycoalition government imploded in April after a Flemish liberal party walked out , frustrated at the lack of progress in talks aimed at clipping special rights accorded to Francophone residents in Flanders .
While the proportional representation system makes a coalition government inevitable , no one knows how long it will take to put an administration together .
After the last elections it took Leterme nine months .

Spokeswoman for South Africa National
Parks said the cold was not unusual had combined with rain and windchill to deadly effect
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Around 600 African penguins , already an endangered species , have perished in a sudden cold snap on a South African island .
The birds died in cold and wet weather over the past two days at Algoa Bay in Eastern Cape province , South Africa National Parks ( SanParks ) said today .
A spokeswoman for South Africa National Parks said the cold was not unusual at this time of year but had combined with rain and windchill to deadly effect for the penguins on Bird Island .
" The age of the chicks , between a few weeks and two months , makes them vulnerable , " she said .
" They are only covered with down feathers . "
It was common for a third of a penguin population 's chicks to die in such weather conditions , she added .
The African penguin was only this month declared an endangered species by the The International Union for the Conservation of Nature because of its declining population across South Africa .
Experts warned recently that whereas 150,000 pairs of African penguins were counted in 1956 , by last year the total had plummeted to only 26,000 pairs - a loss of more than 80 % in half a century .
With only 700 breeding pairs of African penguins on the island , the loss of more than half the population 's chicks presents an added threat to their dwindling numbers .
Stuart Buck thinks so , an idea that John McWhorter endorses .
According to them , the phenomenon of socially punishing students who " act white " -- i.e. focus on grades -- is something that happens mostly in mixed - race schools , where black students are trying to maintain a distinct identity .
When all the kids are black , getting good grades is just . . . getting good grades .
Buck does not mean that the notoriously lousy all - black inner-city schools should be our model for success .
But in the increasing numbers of all - black charter schools , as well as public ones turned around by dynamic principals , students calling one another " white " for liking schools is as unheard of as it was in the black schools of yesteryear .
Our visceral recoil today at any conception of an all - black school as reminiscent of shabby one - room schoolhouses in the segregated Deep South must be discontinued .
The idea is plausible : DC's all - black Dunbar school used to routinely trounce all - white schools in academic competition .
And a similar argument has been made in favor of all - girl 's eduction ; as one scientist I know laments , " Sometime around seventh grade , most of the girls decided to be stupid . "
When there are non-girls in the mix , girls define themselves more as girls and less as people .
And when one of the important characteristics of " girl " is supposed to be " more caring than brainy " . . . well , girls maybe do n't want to be caught in physics class .
But even if you support the idea in theory , in practice , the problems are daunting .
I 'm not sure such a school would be legal ; and one worries that even if allowed to operate , it would be starved of resources .
On the other hand , it 's not as if schools like Dunbar were showered with the best of everything .
If you were excited about the sneak peek from three weeks ago these photos could very well blow your mind ( I know my jaw hit the floor on multiple occasions ) .
First let me say that ( as others have noted ) the new opening date for Meridian Pint is looking like it ’ll be June 17th give or take a few days .
But back to the table taps .
Holy freaking cow these things are awesome .
I believe these are the first table taps in any bar / restaurant in DC .
So they are located in the lower level in the Joint Chiefs section .
There are currently two tables set up with table taps ( with a possibility of adding a third ) .
There are two taps per table and the patrons simply swipe their card and have at it .
As this bar celebrates American Craft Beers ( more on that in a second ) you ’re not likely to find Schlitz on these table taps ( no disrespect to Schlitz ) .
They are unbelievable cool :

They heard about Meridian Pint ’s concept through their reps and took the opportunity to check it out in person .
I can tell you since I was there , they were just as impressed with the table taps as I was .
They were also very complimentary to the space in general .
The photos above do n’t even really do justice to how great the space looks .

After record - breaking grosses through April , 2010 hit a wall in May , which turned out to be one of the weakest starts to a summer movie season in recent years .
Overall business came in at $ 905 million , which was down 11 percent from May 2009 and nearly five percent from May 2008 .
May 2010 ranked as the seventh highest - grossing May on record , following the all - time highest - grossing January , March and April as well as the second - highest February earlier this year .
But May 2010 traffic was even slower than the gross suggested .
With an estimated 110 million tickets sold , last month was the least - attended May since 2001 , and ticket sales were off 19 percent from May 2009 and nearly as much from May 2008 and 2007 .
To be fair , though , May 2009 squeezed five complete weekends into the calendar month , giving it a slight advantage over May 2010 .
However , May 2010 was down nearly 24 percent from May 2004 , the last time the dates and days of the week had the same alignment .
Now , not every month is going to be a record breaker nor has to be in order to be bustling or solid , but May 2010 's drop - off was so steep and its estimated attendance so far below the norm of the past eight years that it was alarming .
The upshot is a reaffirmation that the box office is product - driven for the most part .
That 's a positive sign : many people rejected or were indifferent to the current crop of movies , and that can be remedied in the future through the production of more compelling fare .
With lackluster movies and marketing campaigns , it was as if Hollywood rested on its laurels and took the audience for granted in May ( the recent writers ' strike has received some blame for the slate , but that still does n't explain the poor marketing , and there still were big movies ) .
held the most promise from the outset , given how well received the first movie was , but it has behaved like a normal sequel instead of taking off like aor .
It was by far the top draw of the month with $ 279.7 million , but it sputtered out rapidly .
It did n't fly higher because it did n't up the ante , and the advertising lazily just announced thatwas back with more of the same , instead of actually selling the new movie .
The same criticism can be leveled at , which was already at a disadvantage to begin with after the reception to , and , which was also at a disadvantage given how relationship comedy sequels tend to play , while 's advertising lacked clarity and pushed the release date before convincing people to see the movie in the first place .
took a more consistent approach , coming off as the long - awaited follow - up to , and it had the best performance relative to its genre , though it was far from a blockbuster .
May 2010 was essentially a rerun of past Mays : there wasandfrom 2008 , from 2007 , 2004 and 2001 , a historical battle epic ( ) like in 2005 , 2004 and 2000 , and a supernatural adventure ( ) like in 2008 , 2007 , etc .
Hollywood is mostly about sequels , adaptations , remakes and bandwagons , encouraged by audiences frequently lapping those up , but May 's releases rotely repeated things with waning interest or little interest in the first place .
When the movies are so unappealing , grumbles over ticket prices and other moviegoing headaches seem to resonate louder than they normally would .
Recent , significant ticket price hikes ( especially for 3D ) have raised concerns about the movies being too expensive for a lot of people .
It 's too early to tell if that 's an actual epidemic , but the constant upward trajectory of ticket prices has n't stopped records from falling in the past .
Afterwas the second - biggest grosser with $ 146.8 million , followed bywith $ 86.1 million , with $ 51 million and holdover A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 2010 ) with $ 46.2 million .
Holdovers ( movies that opened before May ) accounted for 25 percent of May 's business , compared to a 16.5 percent share in May 2009 .
Through the end of May , 2010 as a whole stood at $ 4.3 billion .
This was still the biggest January - May gross ever ahead of 2009's $ 4.14 billion through the same point .
However , attendance was down more than five percent .
Avatar remains the top - grossing picture of the calendar year with $ 465.4 million , followed by Alice in Wonderland ( 2010 ) with $ 333.2 million and
Relative Addictiveness of Drugs
Is Nicotine Addictive ?
It Depends on Whose Criteria You Use. Experts say the definition of addiction is evolving .
WASHINGTON - When heavily dependent users of cocaine are asked to compare the urge to take cocaine with the urge to smoke cigarettes , about 45 percent say the urge to smoke is as strong or stronger than that for cocaine .
Among heroin ' addicts , about 3 percent rank the urge to smoke as equal to or stronger than the urge to take heroin .
Among those addicted to alcohol , about 50 percent say the urge to smoke is at least as strong as the urge to drink .
Yet seven chief executives of tobacco companies testified under oath before a Congressional subcommittee in April that nicotine was not addictive .
Experts in addiction disagree with that assessment , hut they say that the definition of addiction is evolving , and that they can see how such a statement might be made .
< 3 > Hearings on Smoking
This week , the Food and Drug Administration is holding hearings to consider whether cigarettes fit in the array of addictive drugs and whether the Government should regulate them .
The standard definition of addiction comes from the American Psychiatric Association and the World Health Organization , which list nine criteria for determining addiction .
The two groups , which prefer the term drug dependence , base their definition on research done since the 1960's , which has determined that multiple traits must be considered in determining whether a substance is addictive .
Thus although cigarettes do not offer as intense an effect as drugs like heroin and cocaine , they rank higher in a number of other factors .
They not only create dependence among users but also elicit a high degree of tolerance , the need for more and more of drug to satisfy a craving .
When all the factors are added up , the consensus among scientists is that nicotine is strongly addictive .
In smoking , it is not the nicotine addiction that is most harmful , but other toxic chemicals produced by burning tobacco , which cause most of the 400,000 deaths each year that are attributed to smoking .
Dr. Lynn T. Koslowski , an addiction expert at Pennsylvania State University , said addiction could generally be defined as " the repeated use of a psychoactive drug which is difficult to stop . "
He added that there might be many explanations for why it was hard to stop , including withdrawal that was too disturbing , or a high that was too enticing .
A diagnosis of mild dependence on a psychoactive drug is determined by meeting three of the nine criteria .
Five items show moderate dependence and seven items indicate a strong dependence .
( Not all nine items apply to each drug .
For example , time and effort spent acquiring a drug are a significant feature of heroin addiction , but have no meaning in nicotine addiction . )
< 3 > Criteria of Addiction
Taking the drug more often or in larger amounts than intended .
Unsuccessful attempts to quit ; persistent desire , craving .
Excessive time spent in drug seeking .
Feeling intoxicated at inappropriate times , or feeling withdrawal symptoms from a drug at such times .
Giving up other things for it .
Continued use , despite knowledge of harm to oneself and others .
Marked tolerance in which the amount needed to satisfy increases at first before leveling off .
Characteristic withdrawal symptoms for particular drugs .
Taking the drug to relieve or avoid withdrawal .
Before applying a test of the nine criteria , the expert first determines if the symptoms have persisted for at least a month or have occurred repeatedly over a longer period of time .
Asked about the tobacco executives ' testimony on addiction , Dr. Kozlowski said , " In a way , I can see how they could say that .
It has to do with a mistaken image of what addiction is , and I have many well - educated , intelligent people say something like that to me .
People often think of a person taking one injection of heroin and becoming hopelessly addicted for the rest of their lives .
That is wrong . "
In addition , he said , when people tend to think of the high that heroin produces , one that is about as intense as cocaine and alcohol , they cannot believe cigarettes are in the same category .
And they are not .
Even though in large doses nicotine can cause a strong high and hallucinations , the doses used in cigarettes produce only a very mild high .
But researchers now know , says Dr. Jack Henningfield , chief of clinical pharmacology at the Addiction Research Center of the Government 's National Institute on Drug Abuse , that many qualities are related to a drug 's addictiveness , and the level of intoxication it produces may be one of the least important .
If one merely asks how much pleasure the drugs produce , as researchers used to do and tobacco companies still do , then heroin or cocaine and nicotine do not seem to be in the same category .
Dr. Kozlowki said , " It 's not that cigarettes are without pleasure , but the pleasure is not in the same ball park with heroin . "
But now , he said , there are more questions to ask .
" If the question is How hard is it to stop ?
then nicotine a very impressive drug , " he said .
" Its urges are very similar to heroin . "
Among the properties of a psychoactive drug - how much craving it can cause , how severe is the withdrawal , how intense a high it brings - each addicting drug has its own profile .
Heroin has a painful .
powerful withdrawal , as does alcohol .
But cocaine has little or no withdrawal .
On the other hand , cocaine is more habit - forming in some respects , it is more reinforcing in the scientific terminology , meaning that animals and humans will seek to use it frequently in short periods of time , even over food and water .
Drugs rank differently on the scale of how difficult they are to quit as well , with nicotine rated by most experts as the most difficult to quit .
Moreover , it is not merely the drug that determines addiction , says Dr. john R. Hughes , an addiction expert at the University of Vermont .
It is also the person , and the circumstances in the person 's life .
A user may be able to resist dependence at one time and not at another .
A central property of addiction is the user 's control over the substance .
With all drugs .
including heroin , many are occasional users .
The addictive property of the substance can be measured by how many users maintain a casual habit and how many are persistent , regular users .
According to large Government surveys of alcohol users , only about 15 percent are regular .
dependent drinkers .
Among cocaine users , about 8 percent become dependent .
For cigarettes , the percentage is reversed .
About 90 percent of smokers are persistent daily users , and 55 percent become dependent by official American Psychiatric Association criteria , according to a study by Dr. Naomi Breslau of the Henry Ford Health Sciences Center in Detroit .
Only 10 percent are occasional users .
Surveys also indicate that two - thirds to four - fifths of smokers want to quit but cannot , even after a number of attempts .
Dr. John Robinson , a psychologist who works for the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company , contests the consensus view of nicotine as addictive .
Using the current standard definition of addiction , he said at a recent meeting on nicotine addiction , he could not distinguish " crack smoking from coffee drinking , glue sniffing from jogging .
heroin from carrots and cocaine from colas . "
It is not that Dr. Robinson and other scientists supported by tobacco companies disagree with the main points made by mainstream scientists .
but that they define addiction differently .
Dr. Robinson says intoxication that is psychologically debilitating is the major defining trait of an addicting substance .
It is a feature that was part of standard definitions of the 1950's , and is still linked to popular ideas about addiction , but which experts now say is too simplistic and has been left behind as scientific evidence accumulates .
Experts Rate Problem Substances
Dr. Jack E. Henningfield of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and Dr. Neal L. Benowitz of the University of California at San Francisco ranked six substances based on five problem areas .
Withdrawal : Presence and severity of characteristic withdrawal symptoms .

Six fishermen from Georgia and Tennessee caught plundering Lake Erie 's smallmouth bass on a week - long fishing trip in late April paid a high price for taking 141 bass over the Ohio limit .
The total in fines , restitution and forfeiture of three bass boats cost them $ 48,290 .
Magistrate Lou Wargo of Ottawa County Municipal Court on Wednesday suspended a collective 900 days of jail time , but fined the men the maximum of $ 250 and $ 58 in court costs for each of 30 counts , a total of $ 9,240 .
They were ordered to pay $ 7,050 in restitution to the Ohio Division of Wildlife , $ 50 for each bass .
One boat was valued at $ 16,000 , the other two at $ 8,000 each .
The six men are : Freelan C. Leffew , 66 , of Soddy Daisy , Tenn . ; his son , Michael Todd Leffew , 38 , of Hixson , Tenn . ; Freddie Warren , 63 , of Wildwood , Ga. ; Charles H. Burkhart , 67 , and Samuel J. Carroll , 65 , of Ringgold , Ga. ; and Herbert Samuel Stephens , 58 , of Soddy Daisy , Tenn .
They lost their Ohio fishing privileges for three years .
Ohio is a member of the 34 - state Violators Compact , so the men can't legally buy a license in those states , either , including their home states of Tennessee and Georgia .
" Their attorney argued the men felt they could take a trip limit , " said Lake Erie law enforcement supervisor Gino Barna of the ODOW .
" If that were the case , there would be no need for daily bag limits .
" They said they faced the wrath of bass fishermen from around the country after the story got out , " Barna said .
" One guy was apprehensive about parking his truck at the court house in Port Clinton , worried his tires might be slashed . "
The ODOW received a tip in late April that the men , who were staying on South Bass Island , were making multiple fishing trips each day to catch bass before the season closed on May 1 .
They released the walleye they caught , but kept and filleted the bass , filling two freezers .
They forfeited the bass and freezers .
Boating Fest on weekend :
The 11th annual North Coast Harbor Boating & Fishing Fest drops anchor in Cleveland on Saturday and Sunday , with free power boat and sail boat rides , kids ' perch fishing from the Holiday party fishing boat and free life jackets and fishing gear for youngsters .

Parrott punished :
The five - year - old saga of trophy Ohio white - tailed deer being illegally shipped to South Carolina has finally been wrapped up in federal court .
Danny Parrott , 62 , of Kimbolton , in southeast Ohio's Guernsey County , was sentenced recently for sending 54 deer to a Bamberg County , S.C. hunting preserve owned by James Schaffer , 61 , of Charleston , S.C.
The domestically - raised deer had not been tested , violating a regulation to prevent the spread of diseases , including the brain malady Chronic Wasting Disease .
Ohio and South Carolina have never had a positive test for CWD in either wild or domestic populations of deer or elk .
Parrott was sentenced to 21 months in prison in Ohio federal court in Columbus .
Schaffer was fined $ 235,000 in 2009 .
A week ago , he was sentenced to six months of monitored house arrest and 500 hours of community service in the South Carolina park system .
Foxworthy a Sentry : Comedian Jeff Foxworthy , an avid deer hunter , is the latest celebrity to sign up for the Sentry Program , a volunteer program to promote hunting and the shooting sports developed by the Columbus - based U.S. Sportsmen 's Alliance .
" I am a lifelong sportsman , a hunter and fisherman and have a deep respect for conservation and the outdoors , " said Foxworthy .
" I am glad to be able to help an organization like the USSA defend our rights to be in the field . "

You know the story : Boy calls girl , girl goes to pick up boy , boy and girl go sit on a beautiful beachside deck to enjoy the night breeze and listen to the waves crash as he tells her a bunch of terrible things that are going on at an oil - spill cleanup site .
Yes , I had a date with Elmer , my mole inside BP ’s cleanup operation , and he painted a grim picture of the conditions for both workers and wildlife at Louisiana ’s Elmer ’s Island Wildlife Refuge .
First , the workers :
The men on Elmer ’s Island do n’t wear respirators since BP and OSHA have thrown precaution to the wind and deemed them unnecessary .
But the only type of air - monitoring equipment Elmer ’s ever seen on the island are little multigas meters that are not up to the job :
They ’re designed for indoor use , clog easily , and only measure limited types of pollutants .
And despite the known dangers of dispersants and the toxic chemicals in crude ( I can attest that contact with the stuff washing up on the beach can burn ) , workers are n’t even wearing protective Tyvek suits anymore .
Of course , there are medics on hand to treat anyone who gets hurt or sick .
Unfortunately , any worker who asks for a medic ’s help is automatically drug tested , which , for some , can be a powerful incentive to not report injuries .
( Not that keeping a cleanup job necessarily equals getting paid : Elmer says the contractors continue to lose workers ’ paychecks , a problem he told me about the last time we talked and that has since been confirmed by the local papers . )
Cleanup workers on these South Louisiana beaches are n’t the only ones who could use more protections .
What Elmer told me echoed the reports that BP is n’t exactly doing everything in its power to keep track of the toll the spill is taking on wildlife .
In nearby Port Fourchon , where he has also worked , there are markers to denote wildlife nesting areas , but they are n’t clearly labeled and no one knows what they mean , so workers drive and trample over sensitive habitats .
One day last week , Elmer and his coworkers came upon eight oiled pelicans , but though they called the official number to report their findings , no one had come to collect the birds by the time his shift ended many hours later .
( A representative from the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has yet to respond to my request for comment . )
Workers on Elmer ’s have not been instructed to report dead animals for collection or autopsy .
Elmer said he ’d recently come upon a dead crab and , knowing no one was going to come to examine it , decided to slice it open himself .
Black oil poured out .
I ’ve seen some pathetic excuses for cleanup out here — were the workers on Elmer ’s at least making some progress ?
“ They ’re not being effective out here , ” Elmer said .
“ Two days after your article , they bused in twice as many workers , so they ’re up to 120 guys on Elmer ’s now , but I ca n’t see any considerable difference .
They ’re only working five sites and it ’s eight miles of beach .
No one seems concerned about cleaning it up .
The contractors are getting their money ; they do n’t care .
They ’ve got all these people out there , but they ’re not accomplishing anything . ”
Oh , wait .
Not nothing : “ They ’ve brought in prostitutes . ”
No one knows who the “ they ” that brought in the pack of hookers is , but the gals have definitely arrived , and you can buy time with one for $ 200 .
It only took someone a whole month even to figure out that it would be lucrative to sell sex to guys earning 44 hours of overtime a week and living in camps and converted 18 - wheelers .

Florida Muslim Leader Receives White Powder in the Mail
Created : June 08 , 2010 12:35 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The Council on American - Islamic Relations sent reporters an alert about a Florida Muslim leader named Joshua Evans who received a letter full of white powder .
Evans was taken to the hospital and it turned out the powder was n’t anything toxic .
But this follows an incident where a mosque in which Evans worships was actually firebombed .
Luckily , no one was hurt .
CAIR is calling on the Justice Department to investigate the powder incident as a potential hate crime .
Here ’s a video from a local news station in Florida about the incident that the group sent reporters :
( CNN ) -- Robot submarines steered a new cap to BP 's ruptured undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday in the company 's latest attempt to rein in the largest oil spill in U.S. history .
The cap was placed atop the pipe before 10 p.m. , but oil and gas continued to spew as engineers attempted to adjust it .
BP CEO Tony Hayward announced that the company had crossed a " milestone " earlier in the day by cutting away the remains of the well 's damaged riser pipe .
That cleared the way for the dome to be lowered down to the well , 5,000 feet below the surface of the Gulf , but Hayward said the operation would need several more hours to complete .
" The next 12 to 24 hours will give us an indication of how successful this attempt will be , " Hayward told reporters at the company 's U.S. headquarters in Houston , Texas .
A Coast Guard spokesman predicted the operation would be completed sometime Thursday night , but said it would not be immediately known whether the cap was working .
Thursday 's developments followed days of setbacks for workers trying to cap the well , which has spewed hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil a day into the Gulf of Mexico for six weeks .
An effort to slice off the pipe with a precision diamond - edged cutter failed Wednesday , forcing BP to settle for a rougher cut of the pipe made with shears .
The more primitive cut means that a rubber seal will not be as tight as previously hoped , meaning a dome wo n't completely contain the spill , said U.S. Coast Guard Adm .
Thad Allen , the federal government 's response manager .
Nevertheless , Allen called Thursday 's news " extremely important . "
" I know they 're working hard at it right now , " he told CNN in an interview aboard one of the drilling platforms working on the relief well .
" Even as we 're talking here , it 's happening 5,000 feet below us . "
But the well may not be completely sealed off until at least until August , when BP hopes to complete a relief well .
Hayward , whose company is responsible for containing the spill , said BP will be working to clean up the mess left behind " for a very , very long time . "
" Our task is to contain the oil , ultimately to eliminate the leaking well and , most importantly , to clean up the oil , defend the shoreline and restore the shoreline where the oil comes ashore , so we return it to the original state , " he said .
CNN Live : Underwater video from BP
Hayward 's remarks come on day 45 of the disaster , as oil drifted eastward toward Florida and President Obama announced he will return to Louisiana on Friday to assess the latest efforts to counter the spill .
Obama told CNN's Larry King on Thursday that " BP caused this spill ... [ and ] they 're responsible " for paying cleanup costs .
" My job is to make sure they 're being held accountable , " he said .
The company has the " best equipment " to stop the spill , but he has n't seen enough of a rapid response from BP , he said in an interview with to be broadcast Thursday night .
The president said he is " furious at this entire situation " in the Gulf because " somebody did n't think through the consequences of their actions . "
Obama says his job is to fix things
Meanwhile , BP , under fire from seemingly every angle , launched a national ad campaign to improve its tarnished reputation .
The beleaguered oil giant released television spots featuring Hayward , who apologizes and promises to " make this right . "
Hayward stars in apology ad campaign
Even as the ads began to air , a grass - roots campaign dubbed Seize BP planned to kick off a week of demonstrations in more than 50 cities .
" From Florida to Seattle , Washington , from Hawaii to New York , all over California and many , many states across the country , people will be taking to the streets over the next week to demand that the assets of BP be seized now , " said Richard Becker , a member of the San Francisco chapter of the group .
" We know millions of people are deeply concerned about what 's going on in the Gulf right now , and we expect large numbers of people to come out to the protests . "
Anti-BP sentiment has grown as oil has made its way to or near coastal areas .
And the company has come under increasing fire from state governments and the Obama administration , which announced a criminal investigation into the spill and cut off joint news conferences with the company this week .
Oil has hit barrier islands off Mississippi and Alabama , and was only six miles off the Florida Panhandle on Thursday morning , state emergency management officials have reported .
After touring the area by helicopter , Florida Gov. Charlie Crist said he had seen " some light sheen " three to four miles from shore .
In Louisiana , where oily sludge has been fouling coastal marshes for two weeks , state officials said the White House has given its blessing to a plan to dredge up walls of sand offshore , and BP agreed to fund the $ 360 million construction cost .
But Gov. Bobby Jindal said Thursday that state officials " have n't gotten a dime from them . "
" I 'm calling on BP to step up [ and ] be the responsible party in fact , not just by label , " Jindal said .
He added , " We 're done talking to attorneys . "
BP announced Thursday on its website that it has established a $ 360 million escrow account to fund construction of the six sections of Louisiana barrier islands approved by federal authorities .
" Since the environmental implications of the projects are not fully understood , BP assumes no liability for unexpected or unintended consequences of these projects , " the company said in a posting on its website .
The BP well erupted after an explosion and fire on the leased Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 that killed 11 people .
The rig sank two days later , leaving up to 19,000 barrels ( 798,000 gallons ) of oil pouring into the Gulf , according to federal estimates .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Superstitions are often regarded as irrational and inconsequential , but researchers in Germany have been taking them seriously , trying to identify the benefits of superstitions , if any , and their underlying psychological mechanisms .
Social psychologist Lysann Damisch , who is interested in sports , noticed that many players have lucky charms or engage in superstitious behavior before their events .
She realized the players thought they were gaining some benefit from the superstition , but as a scientist , Damisch wondered what benefits were gained and how the superstitions worked .
Damisch teamed with colleagues Barbara Stoberock and Thomas Mussweiler , also from the University of Cologne , to design four experiments to test the effectiveness of good - luck superstitions based on a common saying ( such as saying “ break a leg ” to an actor before a performance ) , an action ( such as crossing the fingers ) , or a lucky charm .
The superstitions were tested to see whether or not they improved subsequent performance in motor dexterity , memory , solving anagrams , or playing golf .
In the first experiment subjects were given either a “ lucky golf ball ” or an ordinary golf ball , and were then given a golf task to perform .
In the second experiment subjects were given a motor dexterity task to perform , in which they had to tilt a cube to get 36 ball bearings into a grid of 36 holes .
Half the subjects were told to simply start the game , while for the other half the researcher told them “ I press the thumbs for you , ” which is the German equivalent of crossing fingers .
In the third and fourth experiments the subjects brought their own lucky charms , which the researchers took away to be photographed .
Only half the subjects had their lucky charms returned , while the rest were told there were problems with the camera and the charm would have to remain in the other room .
The subjects were then given a questionnaire to gauge their degree of confidence and optimism for the task ahead .
They were then asked to complete a memory task in which they had to match pairs of face - down cards in an array of 18 .
In the fourth experiment the subjects again brought their own lucky charms and only half were allowed to keep them .
They also completed a questionnaire , but this time were given an anagram task to complete , in which they had to make as many words as possible from a group of eight letters .
They also had to set a goal for themselves .
The results of all four experiments showed the superstition did improve performance .
In the golf task those with the “ lucky ball ” performed significantly better than the control , and those doing the motor dexterity test were faster and better if the researcher wished them luck .
The third and fourth experiments showed the improvements were brought about by changes in “ perceived self - efficacy , ” with those keeping their lucky charms reporting they felt confident and competent to carry out the task .
The fourth experiment also indicated performance was improved because the superstitious belief led them to try harder and be more persistent , because those who kept their lucky charms set higher goals for themselves and kept working longer on the puzzle .
The research is the first time superstitions associated with good luck have been demonstrated to affect future performance beneficially .
It also showed the superstition worked even if it was activated by someone else ( as in the first and second experiments ) .
The research also gives some insight into how superstition works .
In each case the superstition was essentially found to boost a participant ’s confidence in their own abilities , and this resulted in enhanced performance .
The increased confidence also encouraged them to work harder at the task and to persist until they succeeded .
Damisch and her colleagues plan to test negative , or bad - luck , superstitions next and see if they also affect performance .
The paper , entitled “ Keep your Fingers Crossed ! How Superstition Improves Performance ” was published in the journal Psychological Science .

There are four identified problem spaces : Simple , Complicated , Complex , and Chaotic .
The identification of the problem space arises from the characteristics of the problem domain .
In software development , these are the technology , the requirements , and the people doing the work .
If these characteristics , or dimensions , of the problem space are simple and well - known , the problem is defined as Simple .
If the characteristics are unstable , frequently changing , and not well - known , the problem is defined as Chaotic .
If the characteristics are not simple , but are more known and well - defined than not , the problem is defined as Complicated .
Lastly , if the characteristics are not simple and are more unknown and undefined than otherwise , the problem is known as Complex .
Throughout the 1980’s , I worked to make projects that used the waterfall process successful .
Despite creating and revising methodologies that delineated waterfall , and even automating the underlying delivery mechanisms , I was not pleased with the results .
Then , in the early 1990 ’s , Jeff Sutherland and I formulated Scrum , an approach to software product management that was radically different from waterfall .
We experienced success after success when we used it .
I needed to know why Scrum was so much more successful than waterfall .
I had friends working on advanced process control at the DuPont Advanced Technology Center in Delaware .
DuPont had mastered the production of simple polymers , like rayon , to the point where they could be produced anywhere in the world .
However , advanced polymers like GoreTex was so complicated that it ’s production could n’t be distributed .
My friends were working this problem .
The head was Babatunde Ogunnaike ( Tunde ) , one of the authors of the bible of the process control industry , “ Process Dynamics , Modeling and Control . ”
I showed Tunde several waterfall processes , methodologies , that I had brought with me .
One was my own , another was the Coopers & Lybrand Summit D methodology .
Upon inspection , Tunde observed that the processes were very prescriptive , where there was a complete plan of how to turn raw materials into finished product .
He also observed that the elements of the plan were n’t well defined .
The input , output , processes , and resources consumed at each point in the plan ( task ) were n’t of adequate detail to ensure correct flow .
Tunde then asked me how successful these types of methodologies were .
I told him that our project success rate was below 50 % despite heroic efforts to improve and enforce the processes .
Tunde told me that defined processes , such as waterfall processes , are the basis of mass production .
Although not the most cost - effective , they are dominant in volume .
Experts lay out all of the workflow to turn raw material into finished products .
They then hire managers to bring in resources to staff the various points in the workflow ( automation is preferred for reliability , otherwise use people ) .
The job of the manager and their supervisors was to teach the resources how to do the defined job .
If they did their work correctly , the flow would be smooth and the predicted product would result .
Sometimes the plan was wrong , and would be corrected .
Most errors came from inadequate execution by the resources .
Tunde told me that the waterfall process aped this model .
He said that this model was preferred , and always used as long as it was successful .
If it were n’t succesful , regardless of attempts to tighten it up and retrain the resources , there were other , more expensive ways to create the products .
He asked me what the success , or yield , was .
I told him that it was less than 50 % .
He was aghast .
He said that in modern industry a yield of less than 99.7 was considered inadequate .
Fifty percent yield would be like GM throwing out every other car it built .
Tunde suggested we look at other models .
First , he suggested Lean , the domain of problems where there is some complexity , but there is more that is known and stable than there is that is unknown and unstable .
Tunde said that this approach was similar to the defined approach , but that it took into account complexities that might lower the yield rate to an unacceptable level .
First , experts lay out the line .
Managers and supervisors hire the resources and train them .
Then , the line is surrounded by metrics so the experts can monitor if perturbances , or unexpected events , are occurring .
Whenever they are detected , the line is stopped , the perturbance smoothed out , and production resumed .
The resources were also trained to spot unexpected complexities and had the authority to stop production until the complexity was resolved .
Lean processes optimized quality and value .
Sources of defects were rapidly detected and removed .
Everything that was n’t geared toward optimizing value was also removed .
Waste was continually detected and removed .
Decisions were delayed until the last moment to remove waste .
Lean processes are the most cost - effective .
Tunde said that this approach fell apart when unexpected events overwhelmed the productivity of the line .
More time was spent detecting and fixing complexities than building product .
More time was spent inventing new metrics to detect complexities than was spent designing new products .
He also pointed out that the Lean realm was still mass product development .
It was hard to justify building production lines with controlling metrics for a run of just one product , or one release of software .
Tunde then took me to the realm of empirical process control , a technique used for small batch production when there is more unknown than known , where the complexity is greater than the predictable .
He felt that this was more relevant to the field of software development .
The churn in our requirements , the complexity of the many technologies , and the use of creative thinking by people made this approach most appropriate .
This approach was set up to expect the unexpected through frequent inspection of progress and subsequent adaptation of next steps to optimize output .
The basis of it was the container .
A container is a closed space where things can get done , regardless of the overall complexity of the problem .
In the case of Scrum , a container is a Sprint , an interation .
We put people with all the skills needed to solve the problem in the container .
We put the highest value problems to be solved into the container .
Then we protect the container from any outside disturbances while the people attempt to bring the problem to a solution .
We control the container by time - boxing the length of time that we allow the problem to be worked on .
We let the people select problems of a size that can be brought to fruition during the time - box .
At the end of the time - box , we open the container and inspect the results .
We then reset the container ( adaptation ) for the next time - box .
By frequently replanning and shifting our work , we are able to optimize value .
There is a radical shift from prescriptive approaches ( waterfall , Lean , Kanban ) to empirical processes ( Scrum ) .
An organizational culture changes if required .
Prescriptive approaches rely on the ultimate ability to effectively plan and control the plan to success .
Experts set up the work , managers staff and manage resources to do the work , and workers ( interchangeable ) do the work .
Command and control optimizes productivity in predictive processes .
Empirical processes rely on containers to control risk and to continually aim the results toward the highest possible value .
Managers work is to pose the highest value problems , and to do anything they can to assist the people who are solving the problems .
Creativity and collaboration are the hallmarks of this process .
All organizations have issues adopting Scrum .
They are shifting from a prescriptive , manufacturing based approach to an agile , empirical approach .
Every discrepancy between their current organizational culture and Scrum ’s value driven approach is highlighted as an impediment to optimizing value .
The organization is then asked to change its current culture to achieve this agility and value .
When the change is too hard , they often change Scrum and keep the impediment .
We call these “ ScrumButs ” because they are said as , “ We use Scrum , BUT we found that it was very hard to have daily Scrums , so we only have them once a week . ”
I was told that Kanban is frequently used when an organization cannot readily adopt Scrum .
Many of Scrum most difficult aspects are then sidestepped .
Managers are still in charge of telling people what to do .
People can be interrupted at any time .
People are still work in functional silos , preserving the jobs of functional managers .
People are not allowed to work in containers , sharing skills and knowledge to bring complexity into solutions – instead they are worked on a pull ( more sophisticated than push ) production line .
Lean is more productive than waterfall .
Its transparencies and metrics allow frequent adjustments to optimize productivity .
However , that optimized productivity is creativity when people are used to solve complex problems .
People are worked like cogs in a machine , and their work is optimized at the bit level , rather than being aggregated into the value level .
God help us .
People found ways to have slack in waterfall , to rest and be creative .
With Lean and Kanban , those hiding places are removed .
We now have a progressive death march without pause .
Scrum is intended to be a place where enthusiastic people can work closely with their customers to derive the most valuable , creative products possible .
Getting to this point is a hard road for organizations transforming from a waterfall , command and control , prescriptive culture .
However the rewards are great and the goal compelling .
Organizations that make this transition will outcompete everyone else and be places where everyone wants to work .
Those who cannot Scrum and slide back into the slickly branded ScrumBan and its like will find themselves becoming coal mines , quickly generating commodity products from a work force that cannot wait to unionize itself so it has more rest breaks .
Video : Sand swimming robot
Just like a sandfish ( Image : Yang Ding and Dan Goldman )
TO ADD to the robots that can crawl over land , fly through air and swim underwater comes one that can swim through sand .
Such robots could help find people trapped in the loose debris resulting from an earthquake .
Navigating through sand is harder than moving through water or air because sand can behave as both a solid and a fluid .
We have no equations to describe how such substances flow , let alone to predict how an object can “ swim ” efficiently through them .
But the sandfish lizard , Scincus scincus , can travel through sand effortlessly , so Daniel Goldman and Ryan Maladen ’s team at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta decided to find out how they do it .
They found that once the sandfish is submerged , it tucks its limbs into its sides and propels itself forward by wiggling from side to side .

Working with Paul Umbanhowar of Northwestern University in Evanston , Illinois , the team plugged their results into a computer model , which they used to show that a snake - like robot with just seven body segments could travel through a granular medium like sand .
Encouraged , the team built a 35 - centimetre - long version of the robot , made from seven aluminium segments linked by six motors , all clothed in spandex to prevent the motors from becoming jammed .
The team then tested their robot by burying it in a container filled with plastic spheres 6 millimetres across .
When the robot undulated its body at a frequency similar to the lizard , they found it could move forward at speeds of up to 0.3 body lengths per wave cycle – just below the 0.4 body lengths per cycle that a submerged lizard can achieve .
The robot could eventually match the lizard for speed , says Goldman , if more jointed segments are added to make its movements smoother .
Howie Choset , a roboticist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania , thinks that the physics and the biology - inspired approaches to robot movement will one day meet and “ at the intersection will be a deeper understanding of how biology works and how to make robots better ” .
The team will present their robot at the 2010 Robotics : Science and Systems Conference in Zaragoza , Spain , next week .

Liverpool are on the verge of naming Roy Hodgson as their new manager .
The 62 - year - old has been the frontrunner to replace Rafael Benítez as Liverpool manager since the Spaniard accepted a £ 6 m severance pay - off to leave the club earlier this month .
The Fulham manager also has admirers within the Football Association and has been touted among the leading candidates to succeed Fabio Capello following England 's dismal failure at the World Cup .
Hodgson has long coveted the England manager 's job but , despite the possibility of the vacancy arising within a fortnight , he looks set to be confirmed as Liverpool 's new manager possibly as early as today .
Negotiations between Anfield officials and the former Internazionale coach have advanced significantly since Hodgson 's return from commentary duties in South Africa , to the extent that only the specifics of his Liverpool contract have now to be resolved .
Liverpool are happy to meet the £ 2.5 m compensation fee payable to Fulham under the terms of Hodgson 's 12 - month rolling contract at Craven Cottage .
Liverpool are confident the uncertainty over the club 's ownership and the future of their leading players has not diminished Hodgson 's desire to remain in club football at Anfield .
Liverpool , who have not qualified for next season 's Champions League due to a seventh - placed finish in the Premier League last term , had ideally wanted Benítez 's successor in place before their players return for pre-season training .
The first batch of Liverpool players report back tomorrow , a second group are scheduled to return on Monday and their World Cup contingent will start pre-season training at staggered times throughout July depending on their nation 's progress in South Africa .
The club 's assistant manager , Sammy Lee , will be at the helm in the event of their managerial search being prolonged .
As well as Hodgson , the former Real Madrid and Villarreal coach , Manuel Pellegrini , and Marseille coach Didier Deschamps have all been linked with the Liverpool vacancy .
Club legend Kenny Dalglish , who has been involved in the managerial search alongside Liverpool 's managing director , Christian Purslow , made it known that he wanted the job in the absence of better qualified candidates .
However , the Liverpool board wanted a manager who has been working in the game .
Deschamps , whose presence on the Liverpool short - list was revealed last week by the Marseille president , Jean - Claude Dassier , today signed a one - year extension to his contract with the French champions .
" After the season that we have experienced there is still work to do , " said Deschamps , who is now under contract at Stade Vélodrome until 2012 .
" A great club asked me .
I am very flattered but if I ask for respect from my players the least I can do is to be comparable in my commitment to the club .
I owe it to the OM . "
It is unknown whether Liverpool have offered Hodgson a short - term contract given the public declaration from Tom Hicks and George Gillett , the club 's deeply unpopular co-owners , to sell the club once their asking price is met .

Richard Page thinks Multaq is an excellent new drug for treating atrial fibrillation , a type of irregular heartbeat that affects more than 2 million Americans .
And Page , chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health , should know .
He co-authored a large , international study that led to the drug 's approval by the Food and Drug Administration last year , a move that could mean hundreds of millions in sales for Sanofi - Aventis , the company that makes the drug .
But in putting his name on the influential paper , Page allowed Sanofi - Aventis to dictate the terms .
He vouched for the accuracy and completeness of the study despite not seeing the raw data .
The company , which paid for the study , collected that information and performed the analysis without an external audit for accuracy or completeness .
Page says it comes down to trusting the drug company .
" These companies , if they were falsifying data , would n't be kept in business if that were found out , " he said .
" I was satisfied and remain satisfied that the study was conducted in an appropriate way . "
But more and more critics say there is something wrong with the way medical research is done in America .
They point to a growing number of scandals in which drug companies have been accused of suppressing or manipulating research and skewing results to make their drugs look better and safer .
In the Multaq case , Page and all six co-authors had financial ties to Sanofi - Aventis at the time of the study .
Two authors worked for the company and owned its stock .
Page and the four other authors moonlighted as consultants or speakers .
Questions are being raised about a finding in the paper that the drug reduced cardiovascular deaths - a claim that was disallowed by an FDA panel .
A spokeswoman for Sanofi - Aventis said the company conducts its clinical trials to the highest scientific standards with rigorous analysis and accurate reporting of clinical data .
That includes the Multaq trial , spokeswoman Carrie Melia said in an e-mail to the Journal Sentinel .
Yet studies paid for by drug companies are much more likely to have positive results than studies paid for by nonprofit organizations with nothing to gain from a drug 's success in the marketplace .
For instance , with cardiovascular treatments , 40 % of trials paid for by nonprofit sources showed favorable results , compared with 66 % among drug industry - funded studies , according to a 2006 study in JAMA , the Journal of the American Medical Association .
When outside authors do n't have complete access and control of data and protocol , manipulation is easier , said Eric Campbell , an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who researches conflicts of interest in medicine .
" If data are cut and shaved and trimmed and manipulated to make a point and that does n't represent truth or the way a drug behaves , science is harmed and , more importantly , patients are harmed , " Campbell said .
Consider the case of the popular painkiller Vioxx , which was pulled from the market in 2004 by its maker , Merck .
A 2008 analysis revealed that while Merck told the FDA in 2001 that the drug did not increase the risk of death , the company 's internal documents showed the death rate of patients using Vioxx was three times higher than that of patients taking a placebo .
Under the microscope
The conduct of the pharmaceutical industry continues to come under the microscope .
This month , a new analysis of illegal pharmaceutical company behavior that was exposed by whistle - blowers identified 18 major cases leading to investigations by the federal government .
The cases , which were brought from 2001 to 2009 , resulted in nearly $ 9 billion in settlements , according to the report in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Many of those cases involved the illegal and potentially dangerous promotion of drugs for purposes for which they were not approved , so - called off - label use .
While it is illegal for drug companies to promote off - label uses for drugs , once a drug is approved , doctors can prescribe it for purposes other than for what it was approved .
Such off - label drug sales can substantially increase pharmaceutical revenues without the typical cost of proving that a drug is safe and effective .
Multaq is an expensive drug .
At the dose used in the study , the drug costs $ 290 a month , or about $ 3,480 a year , at a Milwaukee Walgreens .
Before it went on the market last year , it already was linked to serious problems .
In 2003 , a separate trial of Multaq was stopped because more patients on the drug were dying than those on a placebo .
That study was published in 2008 .
Even so , Multaq was described as an agent that significantly reduced cardiovascular deaths in Page 's study , which was published in February 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine .
Less than a month later , FDA advisory panel members criticized that claim , according to a transcript of their meeting .
Indeed , concerns about off - label use of Multaq were voiced at that FDA advisory panel meeting in March 2009 .
" This is a drug that killed a lot of people in this first trial , and so there is a huge amount of concern , " said panel member Sidney Wolfe , a longtime drug industry critic who became a member of FDA 's Drug Safety and Risk Management Committee in 2008 .
" We know this drug is toxic .
We know this drug , in certain kinds of circumstances , has killed people , and we know , from every marketing experience we 've ever looked at , that off - label use is guaranteed - and it 's guaranteed all over the lot . "
Melia , spokeswoman for Sanofi-Aventis , noted the trial had an independent data monitoring committee to keep tabs of deaths , hospitalizations and adverse events .
The trial was designed by an independent steering committee along with the company .
She acknowledged that the company collected and managed the data but said both the steering committee and the data monitoring committee had access to analyzed data .
They did not , however , have access to the raw data .
Neither Sanofi-Aventis nor Page has been accused of unethical conduct in the Multaq clinical trial .
Questionable methods
But critics are zeroing in on studies in which companies collect and control information from clinical trials , then disseminate it to researchers hired by the firms to write the studies .
Before the 1980s , drug industry money for clinical trial research at academic institutions gave complete control to university researchers , wrote Marcia Angell , a former New England Journal editor , in 2008 .
But now the companies often design the studies and do the analysis , sometimes without giving university researchers access to the original data .
Doctors must be able to trust what they read in published medical articles and know that the findings have not been manipulated , said Catherine DeAngelis , a physician and editor of JAMA , the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Studies in which drug companies control the data without an independent analysis open the door to manipulation , she said .
" Our primary role is to protect patients , " she said .
" If you ca n't trust what you are reading , then where are you ? "
The Multaq trial is a good example of questionable studies , DeAngelis said .
At JAMA , such studies are no longer accepted for publication , she said .
If drug company employees perform the data analysis , there must be an independent analysis by someone with no ties to the company before JAMA will consider it , she said .
DeAngelis instituted the requirement in 2005 after she received a clinical trial manuscript and asked for an independent analysis .
The company refused .
She declined to name the company or the product .
" It told me they were hiding something , " she said .
The study later was published in another journal .
Recently , she said , there have been reports of side effects with the product .
If regulators find that data was manipulated , she said , she will identify the case publicly .
The New England Journal of Medicine , which published the Multaq study , does not have such a policy .
Clinical trial data belong to the drug companies , said Gregory Curfman , executive editor of the publication .
" We are living in the real world here , " he said .
" They own it .
It 's their data . "
He defended his journal 's decision to publish the finding that Multaq reduced cardiovascular deaths 29 % , calling it an exploratory finding , although no such wording is used in the article .
Before such a claim can be made , another clinical trial must be done , he said .
He said doctors understand what the finding means .
But Campbell , of Harvard Medical School , said drug companies use such findings to increase sales of their drugs .
" Everyone has known for a long time that drug companies use publications in academic journals to stimulate off - label use ( of a drug ) , " he said .
Campbell said it is inappropriate for academics to put their names on such studies .
Page said he and the other academic physicians were directly involved in protocol management and data analysis .
" Based on the direct involvement in design , management , analysis and manuscript preparation , it is appropriate for the steering committee to be authors on the report , " he said .
A common practice
At the time of the Multaq study , Page worked at the University of Washington School of Medicine .
He joined the University of Wisconsin in August .
Page said his work as a paid consultant to Sanofi - Aventis and other companies ended in May 2008 because he became president of a medical society that did not allow financial ties to industry .
" This partnership of physicians with industry serves the public by providing expertise and oversight in industry - sponsored trials , " he said .
It is common for academic experts such as Page to sit on steering committees of drug company - funded trials .
In an interview , Page acknowledged that he and the other authors did not get the original raw data from the Multaq trial , which involved 4,628 patients with atrial fibrillation from around the world .
He did get reports of deaths that were provided in a blinded fashion , meaning that he did not know whether the person was getting Multaq or a placebo .
He said he and other members of the study 's steering committee used the blinded data to make judgments .
" Furthermore , the FDA examined the original data and was satisfied with the conduct of the trial , " Page said .
" Any suggestion that the sponsor had any influence on the conduct of the trial interpretation is inaccurate . "
Working on a clinical trial in which the drug - maker controls the data is not a problem if you trust that the company is going to do the right thing , Page said .
" We knew how it was analyzed , " he said .
" We just did n't do the analysis ourselves , and we did n't go out and hire other statisticians to do that .
This was a trial sponsored by Sanofi - Aventis and they paid for the statisticians .
There is a sense of trust that they wo n't falsify data . "
FDA advisory panel members have raised questions , not about falsified data , but about how the study was conducted .
Data differences
Unlike the academic authors in the Multaq trial , published by the New England Journal of Medicine , the FDA got unanalyzed raw data for its later review and did its own analysis .
One FDA panel member questioned differences between the information included in the published February 2009 study and what was submitted to the FDA
The published paper concluded that the drug reduced cardiovascular deaths when in reality that benefit was not significant under the original study design , said advisory panel member Sanjay Kaul , who also serves as director of the vascular physiology and thrombosis research laboratory at Cedars - Sinai Heart Institute .
Determining the rate of cardiovascular death was a secondary measure of the study .
The main measure was a combination of two things : hospitalization for a cardiovascular reason or death .
On that count , there was 24 % benefit with Multaq .
It was on that basis that the drug was approved by the FDA .
Kaul said it worked like this :
The study was supposed to stop at 4,300 patients .
At that number , there was not a significant benefit in reducing cardiovascular deaths .
But the study was extended beyond its planned cutoff date and an additional 328 patients were enrolled .
The expanded version of the study included five deaths among those in the placebo group and one in the Multaq group .
The company and study authors determined that was enough to report a significant cardiovascular death benefit .
That 's what was published in the New England Journal study .
But the FDA did not allow the claim .
" It is not proper to change the rules in the middle of the game , " Kaul said .
Page declined to respond to Journal Sentinel questions about who made the decision to add additional patients .
The lead author of the study , Stefan Hohnloser , a German doctor , also would not respond to those questions .
Some doubts
The claimed benefit of cardiovascular death reduction was not valid for another reason , Kaul said .
Cardiovascular deaths were part of a larger category of death from any cause .
Because there was no significant difference in all - cause mortality on the drug or on the placebo , the claimed reduction in cardiovascular death also was not valid .
" These observations raise questions about the quality of the data and ultimately the reliability of the findings , " Kaul said .
At the time of the FDA hearing , other panel members also questioned the claim .
" The cardiovascular death claim is on shaky ground , " panel member William Calhoun , a physician with the University of Texas in Galveston , said at the March 2009 hearing .
In an interview , Kaul said Multaq was only modestly effective at best and had no clear safety benefit .
Kaul raised the questions after Sanofi - Aventis paid for a controversial lecture this year in which off - label uses for Multaq were touted by another doctor who has worked as a consultant to the company .
The lecture was posted on Afibprofessional.org , a site launched by the American College of Cardiology and the Heart Rhythm Society .
UW 's Page is the president of the society .
In the lecture , the doctor claims a dramatic reduction in cardiovascular deaths with Multaq .
But when the lecture initially was posted , it did not disclose that the doctor received undisclosed consultant fees in excess of $ 10,000 from Sanofi -Aventis , according to the CardioBrief blog by medical writer Larry Husten .
In March , the lecture was taken down and later re-posted , this time with the financial disclosure information .
Page said he supported the creation of the website but was not aware of its content , which was managed by the staffers .
Because of concerns raised about the lecture , his society now will include written disclosures for such activities , including verbal disclosures for audio programs .
Melia , spokeswoman for Sanofi-Aventis , said the doctor 's comments were his independent view .
" Sanofi - Aventis U.S. does not engage in or endorse the off - label promotion of any product , including Multaq , " she said .

People generally tell the truth or lie within certain bounds , and over the course of a lifetime , it goes from childhood learning through youth and into maturity , reflecting on their character , but seldom becoming criminal .
A few , however , turn to wield words and their charisma as larcenous tools to profit off of the loss of others .

Strategies to help honest people
DavidGrundler offered these words of wisdom : " I have found that the easiest way to tell if these people are legit is to offer them the specific help they ask for .
If they say they need money for a train ticket , I offer to buy them a train ticket .
If they say they need money for gas , I offer to pay for their gas .
If they say they need money for food because they are starving , when I am coming out of the grocery store , I offer them a loaf of bread .
They usually get indignant and try to come up with some lame excuse of why that wo n't help them .
One guy who claimed to be starving actually turned down a loaf of bread .
Anyway , in all of the time I have used this approach , I have only come across one person in need of what they were asking for . "
That actually sounds like a great idea .
Amazing how rarely we think of the simplest solutions ...

You would think , but it 's not fool proof .
A friend of mine is a manager at a local fast food restaraunt and there is often a homeless person out front with a cup for change .
According to this friend he will accept food , then promptly throw it away .

It is a great idea .
And I once bought a drink , sandwich , and chips for a guy hanging out at a grocery store , asking for money .
Although he no doubt would have preferred the money , he did seem grateful for the food .
— cp
Absolutely a great idea , when you are able to follow through on the offer .
-ES
Yeah David , that seems like a solid approach , it was the one I came up with using the power of hindsight , but alas you have the same idea ...
Daubert
I gave out shampoos and snacks I got for free at the stores ( easy , they 're stationed right outside ! ) and they appreciated it - LY
This is a good strategy , or another good one is to give to a legitimate charity and then direct them to that charity .
A fun one I learned from a friend is to buy McDonalds gift certificates ( you can get them for $ 1 ) and give them out , or something similar .
Also , I like to carry around dog treats in places where there are lots of homeless dogs .
People seem really surprised when you hand them a dog treat , and the dog is definitely happy .
From living in the middle of an enormous city for years , I make it a rule not to believe the stories that anyone tells me who randomly approaches me on the street , but I 've noticed that in Davis it happens so rarely that people are frequently caught off guard .
Do n't worry about what happens if you do n't help someone whose story you are unsure about — there are PLENTY of community resources and plenty of other people who they will ask after you .

UPDATE : Apple has acknowledged the antenna problem .
Steve Jobs told one iPhone 4 owner to hold it differently .
He told another that " there is no reception issue .
Stay tuned . "
Original : Apple 's iPhone 4 is off to a rough start ( sales numbers , excepted ) .
The phone is barely in the hands of consumers , and there have been widespread gripes from early adopters .
Some of these are n't one - off whines either -- in one case , they involve a legitimate concern that seems to affect every unit .
The biggest complaint to emerge is that the phone 's signal strength drops when a user grips the phone by the metal antenna band .
Gizmodo has over a dozen videos of users showing off this problem .
We 've run the same test on our phone .
When we held the phone in front of us in our left hand with our fingers touching the metal band , the bars representing signal strength dropped from 5 to 1 in less than a minute .
The problem appears to involve finger - contact on certain parts of the metal band .
When we switched the phone to our right hand ( which put our fingers in different positions ) , the signal strength remained the same .
This is a strange error .
Assuming the signal strength actually affects the quality of phone calls , Apple had better be able to fix this problem with a firmware update , or it will likely have millions of irate customers .
Other reported iPhone 4 problems are of the one - off type .
They include screens shipping with discoloration , including yellowing in the bottom right corner and fragility .
The iPhone has already been scratched by at least one user , and another user says s/he dropped an iPhone from a foot up and the glass back of the phone shattered .
Apple will likely sell 1 + million units today , so the scratched , broken , and yellow phones do n't seem much of a concern ( although any other company would be catching hell for them ) .
The reception problem , however , could be a big issue .

Prime Minister David Cameron refused to criticize the United States , however , saying he sympathized with its “ frustration ” in dealing with its worst environmental disaster in memory .
But the chancellor of the Exchequer , George Osborne , signaled careful support for BP , saying that he had spoken to its chief executive , Tony Hayward , and that it was important to remember “ the economic value BP brings to people in Britain and America . ”
BP is the third largest oil company in the world , after ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell , with 80,000 employees worldwide as of last December , sales of $ 239 billion in 2009 and a market value  even after the recent losses  of more than $ 100 billion .
At a time when Britain is desperate to reduce its deficit , BP is a huge contributor to British tax revenue , paying nearly $ 1.4 billion in taxes on its profits last year .
Its reputation for reliability and its generous dividends have long made it a favorite of British pension funds .
The company ’s dividend payments accounted for about 13 percent of the dividends handed out by British companies last year , according to FairPensions , a London - based charity .
Some Britons are irked at President Obama ’s seeming determination to refer to the company as “ British Petroleum ”  even though it jettisoned that name in favor of initials years ago .
In any case , they point out , it is truly a multinational company , traded on both the New York and London stock exchanges , with British and American nationals on its board of directors .
BP also has extensive holdings in the United States .
It merged with Amoco , the former Standard Oil of Indiana , in 1998 , and about 40 percent of its shares are held by American investors .
It owns a refinery in Texas City , Tex. , that is one of the world ’s largest , and a 50 percent interest in the Trans Alaska Pipeline , in addition to a huge gasoline marketing operation .

Paleontologists have discovered the oldest mammalian tooth marks yet on the bones of ancient animals , including several large dinosaurs .
They report their findings in a paper published online June 16 in the journal Paleontology .
Nicholas Longrich of Yale University and Michael J. Ryan of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History came across several of the bones while studying the collections of the University of Alberta Laboratory for Vertebrate Palaeontology and the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .
They also found additional bones displaying tooth marks during fieldwork in Alberta , Canada .
The bones are all from the Late Cretaceous epoch and date back about 75 million years .
The pair discovered tooth marks on a femur bone from a Champsosaurus , an aquatic reptile that grew up to five feet long ; the rib of a dinosaur , most likely a hadrosaurid or ceratopsid ; the femur of another large dinosaur that was likely an ornithischian ; and a lower jaw bone from a small marsupial .
The researchers believe the marks were made by mammals because they were created by opposing pairs of teeth -- a trait seen only in mammals from that time .
They think they were most likely made by multituberculates , an extinct order of archaic mammals that resemble rodents and had paired upper and lower incisors .
Several of the bones display multiple , overlapping bites made along the curve of the bone , revealing a pattern similar to the way people eat corn on the cob .
The animals that made the marks were about the size of a squirrel and were most likely gnawing on the bare bones for minerals rather than for meat , said Longrich .
" The bones were kind of a nutritional supplement for these animals . "
There are likely many other instances of mammalian tooth marks on other bones that have yet to be identified , including older examples , said Longrich .
" The marks stood out for me because I remember seeing the gnaw marks on the antlers of a deer my father brought home when I was young , " he said .
" So when I saw it in the fossils , it was something I paid attention to . "
But he points out that the Late Cretaceous creatures that chewed on these bones were not nearly as adept at gnawing as today 's rodents , which developed that ability long after dinosaurs went extinct .
Sarah Palin says she thinks legalizing pot would ' encourage our young people to think that it was O.K. to go ahead and use it . '
Palin :
Pot is a ' minimal problem '
Former Alaska GOP Gov. Sarah Palin said Wednesday night that law enforcement should not focus its energy on the “ minimal problem ” of marijuana .
Palin made the comment during an appearance on the Fox Business Network with Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) .

The libertarian Paul said enforcing marijuana restrictions specifically and the war on drugs more generally is a “ useless battle , ” a point Palin somewhat agreed with , though she was clear that she does not support legalization .
" If we 're talking about pot , I 'm not for the legalization of pot , ” Palin said .
“ I think that would just encourage our young people to think that it was OK to go ahead and use it . ”
“ However , I think we need to prioritize our law enforcement efforts , ” Palin added .
“ If somebody 's gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody any harm , then perhaps there are other things our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems we have in society . ”
Palin then urged law enforcement to “ not concentrate on such a , relatively speaking , minimal problem we have in the country . ”
I recall with stark clarity the shock of flying over the tanker wreck on March 24 , 1989 , and seeing the black inky stain of some 11 to 33 million gallons of oil on the water .
I made a personal vow that day to work upstream of oil spills to help our nation transition off fossil fuels .
With my PhD in marine toxicology , I figured I knew enough to make a difference .
More importantly , I cared enough .
Certainly , at the time , I did n’t know this would become my life ’s work––or where this path would lead .
During the twenty years before the Exxon Valdez oil spill , as I trained to become a marine toxicologist , laws were passed to protect air and water quality , worker safety , and public health and welfare .
Back then the science focused only on part of crude oil , the “ light ends ” that easily dissolved into water or evaporated into air .
During the twenty years after the Exxon Valdez oil spill , scientists ’ understanding of oil impacts in the natural world changed when they focused on another part of crude oil , the heavy black stuff that persists on beaches– –the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs .
Ah -hah moments in science , like when it was “ discovered ” that the world is round , are “ paradigm shifts . ”
The world was always round : it was peoples ’ understanding of it that changed .
Likewise , crude oil was always toxic : scientists ’ understanding of it changed when they understood that PAHs were 1,000 times more toxic to wildlife than the light ends .
When breathed or absorbed through skin or consumed , PAHs enter cells and jam cell function , causing respiratory problems , central nervous system problems , skin and blood disorders , weakening of the immune system , and chronic problems such as liver and kidney damage and reproductive dysfunction .
In short , crude oil is a systemic poison– – not just in wildlife , but in people , too .
A whole new field of “ environmental medicine ” emerged as medical researchers and doctors began to understand the symptoms and effects of “ chemical illnesses ” on the human body from exposure to oil , synthetic oil - based products , chemicals , and other toxins .
Ideally , science drives public policy and education ; as science changes , so should the science - based laws and lore .
But I had learned , while growing up in Wisconsin and watching my father in his successful battle to ban the systemic poison DDT , that when ordinary people understand the science , the lore changes , then the laws change .
So I spent three years writing my first book on the oil spill , Sound Truth and Corporate Myths , to explain how scientists came to “ discover ” that oil is more toxic than thought in the 1970s and what laws need to be changed to better protect people , wildlife , and our environment .
But no laws changed .
Disappointed , but determined , I began to focus more on “ the lore ” to understand how community experience and teachings change as the collective intelligence adjusts to new information .
I learned from experience and writing my second book on the oil spill , Not One Drop , that the Cordova community began to recover from the social , economic and emotional spill trauma when people learned to put aside their differences and work together on strengthening or creating projects that would benefit everyone .
My personal ah - hah moment occurred when I realized that shifting this nation off fossil fuels would take a social movement of people who understood the need and were just as determined as me .
I left Alaska to help build this movement .
Then the BP Deepwater Horizon well blew in the Gulf of Mexico , creating an oil disaster 10 to 20 times the size of the Exxon Valdez spill .
I realized this disaster would have deadly consequences , because the lessons learned since the Exxon Valdez spill had not changed the lore and laws of the land .
But I did n’t realize how deadly .
The unprecedented use of over 2,000,000 gallons of toxic Corexit dispersants resulted in unprecedented harm to people and wildlife , perhaps forever .
The ah - hah moment has dawned on scientists and people sickened by the exposure : the oil industry ’s cure for oil spills , dispersants , and oil - dispersant combined are far worse than the harm caused by the oil alone .
Yet the EPA and U.S. Coast Guard continue to sanction use of toxic dispersants without consideration of these consequences .
Dispersants are petroleum distillates and industrial solvents .
The oil industry mixes large volumes of solvents as dispersants to break up oil slicks , as diluents to thin tar sands oil for transportation , and as fracking fluids to extract oil from oil - bearing shale .
The same properties that facilitate the movement of solvents through oil also make it easier for them to move through skin and into the human body .
It should not be surprising that people harmed by oil and gas activities , such as the BP DWH disaster ( solvent - crude oil combined ) , tar sands oil spills ( solvent - tar sands oil combined ) , [ link ] and fracking activities ( solvent - light oil combined ) are reporting similar sicknesses and symptoms characteristic of exposure to crude oil and oil - based solvents .
It is my hope that , as people ’s health , livelihoods , and property are harmed by these extreme oil activities , people will understand the need to shift off oil to safer energy options and take action to achieve true energy independence .
This is the movement that I see growing in all regions of our country .
This is the movement that I am committed to building .
See you on the Road .

Whenever a governmental or international agency recommends mandating something that is purportedly in the interest of our health , we have learned to duck for cover .
Even in the best and most innocent cases , they have a tendency of ignoring the true causes of problems , and of treating the symptoms in a manner which creates more harm .
The fellowship with the chemical industry is unmistakable , and apparently force medicating us with bleach and fluoride is not enough anymore .
The latest recommendation from the World Health Organization is to add calcium and magnesium to municipal water supplies .
This new treatment is supposed to help us to resist osteoporosis and brittle bone disease .
Of course , these conditions are caused by the fluoride that they have recommended in our drinking water for the last 60 years .
Prior to that , these conditions were so rare that they were considered oddities .
Best yet is the fact that fluoride has been repeatedly shown by statistics to cause more dental problems than it eliminates .
Those statistics have been made intentionally difficult to find , by the way .
We can only conclude that the whole science thing just gets in the way of their agenda .
As of yet , they have still never recommended removing fluoride , despite it being an industrial toxic waste product .
What fluoride accomplishes is keeping the populations passive , reducing IQ levels , along with causing cancers , thyroid diseases , metabolic diseases , suppressing the immune system , and causing reproductive defects .
Fluoride was a favorite chemical weapon of the NAZIs .
It is also hidden in a large portion of the pharmaceuticals too , without any apparent reason or explanation .
We all know that calcium is vital for good health , but the vast majority of people are already getting too much calcium in their current diets , and not enough of the nutrients that actually prevent harm .
Diseases which are superficially believed to be from calcium deficiencies are more often caused by malnutrition of nutrients that work with calcium , such as vitamin D3 ( sunlight ) and magnesium .
Take for instance , you could eat a bowl of chalk every day , but if lacking enough magnesium and vitamin D3 , you would still find yourself with the same diseases that are attributed to calcium deficiencies , and additionally heart disease , kidney stones , and arthritis : just to name a few .
Now combine this dilemma with fluoride and pharmaceuticals , of which both suppress nutrient absorption , in order to get a clear picture of the situation .
Perhaps we really do not need this kind of " help " .
The public does not get adequate amounts of omega fatty acids and vitamin D , and so additional calcium is going to generate a tremendous rise in incidences of heart disease , which is already the number one killer of Americans .
This is not from new or groundbreaking research .
The link between excess calcium and heart disease has been known for decades , but the W.H.O. ignores this .
It is prudent to examine their history whenever considering what their true agenda might be .
We should remember that the World Health Organization is behind HONCode , Codex Alimentarius , and forced sterilizations with secret vaccine ingredients as a method of global population reduction .
The sterilized women were never warned .
In other words , these people are evil , and this is the type of " help " that they are infamous for .
Magnesium deficiencies really are epidemic in the Western World due to our poor diets which lack the most nutritious nuts and green , leafy vegetables .
However , excessive magnesium from over - supplementation can actually worsen any other deficiencies , because excesses cause minerals to flush out of the body .
The researchers at the World Health Organization should know this , but even well - intentioned doctors are typically ignorant about nutrition .
We must note that even if the W.H.O. was planning on adding truly healthy vitamins into the water supplies , we would still be against it .
Pure water is a basic human right , and forcibly medicating people against their will is inherently wrong regardless of the justifications .
Tap water is currently full of pesticides , birth control medications , anticonvulsants , S.S.R.I. medications , benzene - derivatives , and let 's not forget that bleach and fluoride are intentionally added .
If the quality of our tap water continues to degrade , then perhaps people will eventually be able to use ' Tap Water Intoxication ' as a criminal defense .
Allowing these elitists to apply a one - size - fits - all solution to our water supplies is wrong both medically and morally .
We need to encourage people to drink pure , clean water , eat a good diet , exercise more , and then make their own decisions regarding additional vitamins and nutrients .
While we do actually feel that nutritional supplementation is necessary , due to our soils having been depleted by chemical fertilizers ; we nevertheless feel that forcibly medicating populations is a blatant violation of peoples ' rights .

For days , CNN 's small army of reporters , photographers and producers has been repositioning toward Florida as oil was expected to come ashore in the Sunshine State .
And on Friday morning , tar balls - hundreds of small bits of hardened oil - littered Pensacola 's white beaches .
Our iReporters had been saying they had spotted tar balls nearby and in different areas a few days earlier .
So we set out to check the beaches .
Tourists were the first to begin cleaning it up .
iReporter Marc Sigler said he had been camping in Fort Pickens on Tuesday when he saw tar balls ; they spent the next day swimming , picking it up and cleaning the beach .
iReport : See Sigler 's photos
Further south on the beach on Friday , we saw blobs the size of a Frisbee of reddish - brown oil .
Nobody knew for sure whether the tar was from the Deepwater Horizon disaster .
Local officials said that so much tar had been piling up that they did n't have the resources to test all the balls and blobs of oil locally , so they would be assuming that if they came in such large amounts now , they were probably from the disaster in the Gulf .
Similar tar balls and oil slicks have shown up on beaches along the Gulf since the rig exploded and sank .
i Report : Help us track the oil disaster
Friday afternoon , reporters and residents got the answer they were waiting for : Florida 's Division of Emergency Management issued a statement saying , " tar patties and tar balls have been confirmed in widely scattered areas east of Pensacola . "
Reconnaissance flights are taking place to determine all of the locations nearby that may be affected .
While that goes on , some tourists will keep on cleaning - and worrying .
Tourist Catherine Maloney looked at the blobs of oil with surprise and disgust before taking pictures of them .
" This is going to affect this area for years , " she said .
" It 's already so quiet , it feels like a hurricane came . "

The return of KERS to Formula 1 next year is set to be more of a success than during its last aborted attempt , teams believe , even though the systems will not be any more powerful than they were in 2009 .
F1 technical chiefs agreed at the Canadian Grand Prix that a voluntary agreement not to run KERS this year would be dropped at the end of this season .
It means that all teams are now free to run the energy recovery systems from the start of next year .
And although a bid by Ferrari and Renault to increase the power output of KERS from 400 KJ to 800 KJ to make it more attractive had to be dropped after Mercedes - Benz said it would only support KERS returning under the old rules , a further increase in the minimum weight of cars to 640 kg proposed for next season should still ensure KERS brings a good advantage .
One of the reasons why the system failed last time was because using the heavy systems pushed teams above the - then weight limit of 605 kg , which meant there was minimum benefit from the KERS .
For 2010 , with revised tyres , better for weight distribution , and the higher weight limit proposed by the Technical Working Group ( TWG ) , the weight factor of KERS should not be a handicap at all .
Ferrari team principal Stefano Domenicali said : " One of the important things that was achieved by the teams was to have a higher weight for the car , which will for sure help KERS to be used .
" We would have preferred to have had much more energy , but there was not the consensus to do that .
So the kind of intermediate solution that has been taken is at least enough to go for it and see if that system will perform .
We will go for it , that is for sure . "
Ferrari , Williams and Renault have already confirmed that they will run KERS next year , with other outfits now evaluating it .
Mercedes GP team principal Ross Brawn reckoned all teams will have had to make their minds up in the next month about what their plans would be .
" I think the commitment will be to go with or without - we wo n't try and support both directions , " he said .
" We are still looking very carefully at all the aspects of KERS to make a final decision , and we are in the process of evaluating .
" In about a month to six weeks , certain decisions have to be made on the car that means you will be losing time if you reverse out of them . "
When asked if the increase in minimum weight would mean it effectively being a ' no choice option ' because it could only bring advantage , Brawn said : " It is the same scenario as previous years , in certain areas it is an advantage and certain areas it is not an advantage .
It is not a black and white decision . "
Brawn also believes that KERS would provide an extra benefit beyond the boost that is set to come from the introduction of moveable rear wings - which alone are set to increase straight - line speeds by 15 km / h .
" It can be an accumulative benefit , " he said .
" If you use the wing and KERS , then you will get the benefit of both .
There is no reason why the wing will negate KERS - because you do n't only use KERS to improve straight - line speed , you can also use it to improve downforce . "
AUTOSPORT understands the deal to introduce KERS includes a $ 5 million ( USD ) development cap budget and , in a bid to ensure smaller outfits are not put at a disadvantage , independent teams will be able to buy systems for just $ 1 million ( USD ) .
Brawn reckons that getting such cost restrictions in place was important - because one of the reasons why resistance to KERS last time out was so high was because of the huge development investment needed .
" It is important costs are controlled , " said Brawn .
" It was quite an investment in previous years and perhaps the climate is a bit different now .
We have to be careful about the levels of investment necessary for KERS .
It is a good initiative but we need to make sure it fits with F1 . "
And although Renault says it is delighted that its fight to get KERS back has been a success , team principal Eric Boullier has expressed some frustrations at the fact money now has to be spent optimising the older restricted systems rather than embracing more powerful technology .
" At Renault , we were a strong supporter with Ferrari , " Boullier told AUTOSPORT .
" We offered to raise the level of energy to 800 KJ , to allow more work on KERS for the future , and to have a better show - because you can use twice more the KERS system during a lap .
" It would have been good for performance and good for F1's image , but the biggest concern was that Mercedes - Benz had a different technology and they could not do it [ double the power with their system in the timeframe ] , and they did not want to invest their money on an 800 KJ system .
" So now it will cost money to everybody - as we need to continue to develop the 2009 KERS .
That is stupid , because we will spend more money to make something work better , rather than changing the regulations and making it easy . "
The New Yorker has a lengthy piece all about former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and his faith … because you really can’t have the former without the latter .
A few excerpts are below .
On homosexuality :
Huckabee found the reflexive piety of his community “ very pharisaical in nature ” when he was young .
“ People would say boys and girls should n’t go to R - rated movies , or they should n’t swim together , ” he said .
“ I was the guy that always asked why .
‘ Because we said so . ’
Well , that ’s not an answer !
I do n’t accept ‘ Because we said so . ’
That always made me really angry . ” …
One afternoon in Jerusalem , while Huckabee was eating a chocolate croissant in the lounge of the Crowne Plaza Hotel , I asked him to explain his rationale for opposing gay rights .
“ I do believe that God created male and female and intended for marriage to be the relationship of the two opposite sexes , ” he said .
“ Male and female are biologically compatible to have a relationship .
We can get into the ick factor , but the fact is two men in a relationship , two women in a relationship , biologically , that does n’t work the same . ”
I asked him if he had any arguments that did n’t have to do with God or ickiness .
“ There are some pretty startling studies that show if you want to end poverty it ’s not education and race , it ’s monogamous marriage , ” he said .
“ Many studies show that children who grow up in a healthy environment where they have both a mother and a father figure have both a healthier outlook and a different perspective from kids who do n’t have the presence of both . ”
In fact , a twenty - five - year study recently published by the American Academy of Pediatrics concluded that children brought up by lesbians were better adjusted than their peers .
And , of course , nobody has been able to study how kids fare with married gay parents .
“ You know why ? ” Huckabee said .
“ Because no culture in the history of mankind has ever tried to redefine marriage . ”
But in the Old Testament polygamy was commonplace .
The early Christians considered marriage an arrangement for those without the self - discipline to live in chastity , as Christ did .
Marriage was not deemed a sacrament by the Church until the twelfth century .
And , before 1967 , marriage was defined in much of the United States as a relationship between a man and a woman of the same race .
Regardless of the past , would n’t Huckabee be curious to know whether allowing gay people to marry had a positive or negative effect on children and society ?
“ No , not really .
Why would I be ? ” he said , and laughed .
Because saying that something ought to be a certain way simply because that ’s the way it supposedly has always been is an awful lot like saying “ because we said so . ”
And Huckabee is supposed to be the guy who questions everything .
On evolution :
Huckabee had more executive experience than any other candidate , Republican or Democratic , in the 2008 campaign ( with the exception of Tommy Thompson , who dropped out of the race after the Iowa straw poll ) .
“ And yet you did n’t hear a Chris Mathews saying , ‘ Governor , I want to talk to you about your education policy ; you did some innovative things , ’ ” he said .
“ No .
It was , ‘ O.K. , you were a Baptist preacher .
Let ’s talk about evolution . ’
It ’s , like , ‘ Are you an idiot ?
Is that the only thing you can ask me ? ’ ” When Wolf Blitzer pushed Huckabee to say whether he believed in evolution , at a debate in New Hampshire in June of 2007 , Huckabee expressed exasperation that the question “ would even be asked of somebody running for President — I ’m not planning on writing the curriculum for an eighth - grade science book . ”
He said that the question was unfair , because it “ asked us in a simplistic manner whether or not we believed , in my view , whether there ’s a God or not . ”
As President , though , he would appoint the Secretary of Education .
And it is difficult to comprehend what is unfair about the question when he has written , “ Everything you do and believe in is directed by your answer to the ultimate question :
Is there a God ?
It all comes down to that single issue . ”
According to Huckabee , a person who believes God created man has a world view that is “ absolutely irreconcilable ” with that of someone who believes man created God .
And “ either by numbers or persuasion , one side of this polarized culture will defeat the other in setting public policy . ”
This is the defining paradox of Huckabee : his adamant resistance to being branded a zealot paired with his insistence that faith defines character and , consequently , has an essential place in government .
There ’s also a little bit about his interview with Michael Tracey from a couple months ago .
As governor of Arkansas , Huckabee successfully championed laws that prevented gay people from becoming foster parents and banned gay adoptions .
“ Children are not puppies — this is not a time to see if we can experiment and find out how does this work , ” Huckabee told a student journalist at the College of New Jersey in April .
“ You do n’t go ahead and accommodate every behavioral pattern that is against the ideal .
That would be like saying , ‘ Well , there are a lot of people who like to use drugs , so let ’s go ahead and accommodate those who want to use drugs .
There are some people who believe in incest , so we should accommodate them . ’ ” These comments proved unpopular .
On his Web site , Huckabee accused his interviewer of trying to “ grossly distort ” and “ sensationalize my well known and hardly unusual views ” about homosexuality .
The student publication then posted the audiotape of the interview online .
Huckabee had not been misquoted .
There ’s nothing in the piece you have n’t heard before if you follow politics , but it ’s a terrific reminder of why Huckabee is unfit to hold elected office .
It ’s not that he ’s a Christian — it ’s that he has a habit of making decisions for everyone based on his personal faith , regardless of where the evidence leads .
It ’s been said before , but we need a Commander - in - chief , not a pastor - in - chief .

The Health Ministry would not comment Tuesday on charges that it has refused to allow a 40 - year - old man to use his late wife ’s embryos to produce their genetic children using a surrogate mother .
The man , N. , whose wife died last year , has expressed her wishes that after her passing , the frozen embryos – produced in difficult fertility treatments – be implanted in a surrogate to produce children .
The ministry declined to comment , saying that Attorney - General Yehuda Weinstein is dealing with the issue and that the ministry ’s legal adviser could not express its opinion until Weinstein ’s is released .
Irit Rosenblum , the director of the New Family organization who is also a lawyer , maintained that the government was guilty of “ unjustified delay and infringements of the right to swift legal process .
” The couple tried for years to achieve pregnancy and underwent a series of fertility treatments to fulfill their dream of becoming parents .
Before N. ’s wife contracted cancer , a number of embryos were produced and frozen for later use at Haifa ’s Rambam Medical Center , but she died .
A few months ago , after she had signed the required legal documents ensuring her desire for their embryos to be implanted in the womb of a surrogate – even in the event of her death – New Family asked the hospital for the embryos .
Ministry officials , said Rosenblum , initially replied that the necessary procedure was not available in Israel , although they agreed that there was no law against giving N. custody of the embryos .
So he searched for a foreign surrogate and paid a large sum of money .
But when he returned to the hospital to begin the procedure , the ministry retracted its statement that the embryos belonged to him , Rosenblum added .
This sudden reversal caused N. “ significant emotional and financial damage .
” New Family said this was “ unacceptable discrimination between the right of a man to parenthood and of the right of a woman to parenthood .
It ’s not clear how ministry officials have taken over a person ’s body and his embryos and are keeping from him what belongs to him and in practice , his entire world and dreams , ” Rosenblum said .
She wrote a letter to Weinstein and to the State Attorney ’s Office , but has not yet received a response .
“ Every day that passes will not return N. ’s youth ; he just wants to be a parent .
People do not have the right to deny other people the right to be a parent to their own flesh and blood .
N. has not asked the state to finance the surrogacy arrangement , and it has already been determined that he is the sole owner of his own genetic material , ” Rosenblum wrote .
John Goodman is looking good , and he knows it .
When the 57 - year - old actor stopped by the “ The Late Show with David Letterman ” last night , he acknowledged what many in the industry have already noticed : Goodman has dropped some obvious weight .
The weight loss , he joked , is “ kind of like letting the gas out of the balloons up on 77th street every Thanksgiving . ”
Goodman mused his all - time high was somewhere around 400 pounds .
The weight gain sounded like it was a gradual process .
“ I ’d get off ' Roseanne , ' ” he started to explain before pausing , thinking about what he just said , and started again with “ Every spring , I ’d lose 60 pounds … and then I ’d gain it all back and [ then ] some every year . ”
Goodman was a bit evasive on the reason – it sounded like knee replacement was at the root of it – but whatever lead to his decision to drop the pounds , he said he is feeling better as a result .
“ It ’s like night and day , ” he said of his new size , adding that he has n’t reached his goal weight just yet .
" I 'm going to base it on the fat content of my body – whatever is healthy and right , " he said .
" It ’s going to be an ongoing process for the rest of my life . ”

AMMAN ( Reuters ) - Israeli naval commandos used batons , tear gas , stun grenades , rubber - coated bullets and live ammunition during the storming of aid ships bound for Gaza , activists deported by Israel to Jordan said on Wednesday .
Activists , seized during a raid on an aid convoy sailing to Gaza , are hugged by relatives following their arrival in Jordan , after crossing the Allenby Bridge crossing point between Israel and Jordan , June 2 , 2010 .
REUTERS / Muhammad Hamed
“ The Israelis just attacked us without warning after dawn prayer , ” said Norazma Abdullah , a Malaysian who was among 124 activists who crossed into Jordan at about 7.30 a.m. ( 0430 GMT ) .
“ They fired with some rubber bullets but after some time they used live ammunition .
Five were dead on the spot and after that we surrendered , ” said Abdullah , who was on the Turkish vessel Mavi Marmara where most of the violence took place .
Abdullah , speaking to Reuters near a Jordan river bridge , said the Israeli commandos had then kept the activists tied up for 15 hours until they reached the Israeli port of Ashdod .
Nine people were killed during Monday ’s raid on a six - ship convoy trying to deliver humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip , where 1.5 million Palestinians are under an Israeli blockade .
Israel says activists attacked its commandos as they came aboard the Turkish vessel , forcing them to shoot in self - defense after activists clubbed and stabbed them and snatched some of their weapons .
Abdullah said the Turkish - backed flotilla had been more than 68 miles off the Gaza coast when it was intercepted .
“ Our original plan was to stop there and ask for Israeli permission before we entered and , if they refused , to stay at sea in protest ... but they attacked us before we had a chance to do that , ” Abdullah added .
The activists expelled to Jordan included nationals from Kuwait , Algeria , Lebanon , Malaysia and Indonesia .
They were among 682 detained during the Israeli operation .
Abdul Rahman Failakawee , a Kuwaiti , said the Israelis had used an array of weaponry to subdue those on board the convoy .
“ The attack was totally barbaric , ” he said by telephone from a bus taking the freed activists to Amman .
“ They used legitimate and maybe illegitimate weapons : rubber bullets , live ammunition , sound bombs and tear gas bombs .
They also used batons as they landed to beat those on board to control the ship . ”
Archbishop Hilarian Capucci , a Greek Catholic prelate from Jerusalem who was imprisoned by Israel in 1974 and later deported , said the maritime attack was unwarranted .
“ Our trip to Gaza was a trip of love and God was with us .
Israel by its actions had rightly drawn world outrage over its brutality against unarmed people carrying a message of love to an innocent occupied people under siege , ” Capucci said .
Yesterday Rush Limbaugh married his now - fourth wife , Kathryn Rogers , in Palm Beach .
Among the paid entertainment wowing guests ?
Elton John , who earned a reported $ 1 million to fete the homophobe ’s repeat nuptials .
Should Elton be shamed for accepting the cash ?
Yes .
There are reasonable things the LGBT community can do to disavow support for people who make a career out of gay baiting , and there are unreasonable things .
The latter category could includes boycotting an entire mega- conglomerate corporation for an offensive television ad .
The former category could include refusing to go to an Buju Banton concert , no matter how much you like his beats , because he calls for the murder of our people .
And that ’s where Elton ’s flaw is .
He is directly supporting Mr. Limbaugh and his endeavors — his future happiness ! — by agreeing to perform at the man ’s wedding .
It will be Rush who writes out the check to Elton for the seven - figure sum ; money that , let ’s all face , Elton does n’t really need .
And even if his intention was to donate the cash to a LGBT youth group , it ’s already bloody money , and tainted .
We do n’t need to revisit Rush ’s entire history to remind you how he ’s used his radio show to taunt queer public officials , public citizens , and even families .
For the same reason black NFL players were n’t on board with Rush possibly purchasing ; Rush is a race baiter .
Elton John does n’t have make it his day job avoiding second - handedly contributing to the lifestyles of bigots .
If he accidentally tunes in to Rush ’s radio show , he need n’t be burned at the stake .
But Elton would be better respected if he did n’t go out of his way to directly play a role in bettering the life of a man who ’s working vigorously to deny equality to queer Americans .
Just like you can avoid ExxonMobil or BP gas stations because they ’re anti-gay or anti-environment , while still not bankrupting your soul by buying petrol .
An unusual eradication program , which turns friends into traitors , has almost freed Kangaroo Island of its feral goat population .
The project uses what are called judas goats to betray the whereabouts of other wild goats on the island off the South Australian coast .
The unwitting traitors are shipped over from the mainland , sterilised , fitted with radio tracking collars and released .
Project officer Nick Markopoulos says the program exploits the animal 's sociable nature .
" Generally the goat will have about a week 's sulk and once it gets over its week of sitting down and just adjusting itself to the new environment it 's been released into , it will go off ... and find friends , " he said .
" The feral goats are quite happy to accept them into their mobs and they fit right in . "
Mr Markopoulos says about 1,000 goats have already been removed and estimates there are about 100 left on the northern side of the island .
" It 's probably one of the largest goat eradication attempts in the world in terms of area , " he said .
Goats were originally brought to Australia 's third - largest island by settlers almost two centuries ago , for their meat and milk .
Some residents , like fifth - generation farmer Jim Chapman , say the light - footed ferals have become part of the landscape and do not do much damage .
" I 've loved the goats out here on Kangaroo Island .
It 's been part of my life growing up .
I know these guys have come out here to do a job , but to be quite honest with you I 'm not liking seeing the last goat go , " Mr Chapman said .
But the Kangaroo Island Natural Resources Management Board , which is running the program , says the goats have a major impact on vegetation and threaten an endangered bird species .
" From their gut samples we 've found that they eat over 70 plant species , " said program manager Pip Masters .
" The one that we 're most concerned about is the plant they eat the most which is the drooping sheoak . "
" That 's a very important food source on Kangaroo Island , because it 's the sole food of the glossy black cockatoo . "
The program has been going five years and has cost more than $ 500,000 , with the money coming from the Invasive Animals Cooperative Research Centre and Federal and State Governments .
Mr Markopoulos says it is a worthwhile investment , as it has helped pinpoint the pests across farms , national parks and rugged coastlines .
" The last hunt we removed 40 animals and we only sighted four animals without judas goats , so if we were to hunt without these guys our efforts would be so much greater , " he said .
Mr Markopoulos predicts the island 's feral population will be eradicated in a year .
Once they have done their job , the judas animals will also be destroyed .

This week , Surfin ’ discovers a software defined radio ( SDR ) in an iPhone .
This is so cool , my typing fingers are numb from the cold : a software defined radio ( SDR ) application for the Apple iPhone , iPod touch and iPad called iSDR .
It is a portable software - defined radio receiver designed for experimenters , shortwave listeners and Amateur Radio operators -- and it is free !
A caveat : receiving live on - the - air signals with iSDR requires purchasing or constructing a quadrature sampling detector ( QSD ) RF front - end device that connects between an antenna and the microphone input jack of the iPhone , iPod or iPad .
Without the front - end , iSDR will play an internal audio file recording of actual radio signals recorded off the air during the 2008 CQ World Wide WPX contest .
The iSDR developers list the following features of the app :
Three display modes : Spectrum , Waterfall and Oscilloscope
Frequency display with 100 Hz resolution with a touch to the display screen
Up to 44.1 kHz of available spectrum bandwidth
Monaural microphone input automatically adjusts display to 22 kHz bandwidth
Automatic display rotation
Recorded audio file built in for off - line use without external audio
Automatically detects if external audio is available
Five receive modes : USB , LSB , CW , DSB and Binaural
Reverse I /Q microphone input logic
User -adjustable center frequency setting
Visit the iSDR developer ’s Web site for more information .
Still Got Batteries
Last week ’s Surfin ’ -- Got Batteries -- moved Phil Minch , K6MUG , to write : “ I would like to mention a book I just happened across .
I have n’t got into it yet so I can't critique it , but the subject matter was irresistible .
It ’s titled The Battery , How Portable Power Sparked a Technological Revolution by Henry Schlesinger .
It has a wonderful retro design cover styled after an Eveready battery which made me grab it off the shelf at the book store . ”
Phil ’s missive moved me to check out the book on Amazon .
The book does look interesting and I found “ ham radio ” listed twice in the book ’s index , so I must peruse the book next time I visit a brick - and mortar - book emporium .
Until next time , keep on surfin’ .

Prudhoe Bay , BP's Other Ticking Bomb Nearly 5,000 miles from the oil - spill catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico , BP and its culture of cost - cutting are contributing to another environmental mess in the Prudhoe Bay oil field on Alaska ’s north shore , according to internal BP documents and more than a dozen employees interviewed over the past month .

After two serious oil spills and other mishaps at the remote site , the BP employees fingered a long list of safety issues that have not been adequately addressed , making the Prudhoe Bay oilfield vulnerable to a devastating accident that potentially could rival the havoc in the Gulf .
“ The condition of the [ Prudhoe Bay ] field is a lot worse and in my opinion a lot more dangerous , ” said Marc Kovac , who has worked for BP on Alaska ’s North Slope for more than three decades .
“ We still have hundreds of miles of rotting pipe ready to break that needs to be replaced .
We are totally unprepared for a large spill . ”
Kovac , a mechanic and welder who is the steward of the United Steelworkers union local 4959 , said a lot of employees share his feelings , but “ do n't want to risk their jobs for speaking out . ”
Kovac said he was willing to take the risk because BP has been slow to deal with the Prudhoe Bay problems and that “ many lives are at stake . ”
Some of the employees , speaking anonymously , said BP follows an “ operate to failure ” attitude .
Kovac said that means BP Alaska avoids spending money on “ upkeep ” and instead runs the equipment until it breaks down .
Typical of this problem , the employees said , was an oil spill that was discovered on Nov. 29 , 2009 , when a BP Alaska employee performing a routine check discovered oil pouring out from a two - foot long gash on the bottom of a 25 - year - old pipeline at BP ’s Lisburne facility .
“ The spill was from an 18 - inch three - phase common line carrying a mixture of crude oil , produced water , and natural gas , ” according to an incident report from the Alaska Department of Environment and Conservation ’s ( ADEC ) Division of Spill and Response .
BP Alaska ’s “ preliminary estimate for the total volume of oily material released is 45,828 gallons ( 1,091 barrels ) , ” the report said .
The circumstances behind the spill are now the subject of a criminal and civil investigation by the FBI , the Environmental Protection Agency and Alaska state authorities .
BP blamed the rupture on ice plugs that built up inside the pipeline , which caused increased pressure and finally the rupture .
In a Jan. 27 letter to Sen. Lisa Murkowski , R - Alaska , BP Alaska President John Minge said the “ overpressure rupture ” was the result of looping the 18 - inch pipeline with a 24 - inch one as a way of minimizing “ backpressure in the individual pipelines . ”
“ The two critical factors that led to the overpressure rupture of the pipeline were this looped configuration in combination with inadequate temperature monitoring locations ” that were “ physically located on the pipelines ” inside the production facility “ and not outside , ” according to Minge ’s letter to Murkowski .
Criticism of BP
A person who works closely with BP and reviewed the letter said it “ presents the specific facts of the event , ” but does not contain the necessary context .
“ When he indicates that the temperature sensors were located inside the buildings - obviously this shows a lack of attention to monitoring the pipelines , ” said this person , who requested anonymity .
“ It is not just a mistake in placement of the monitors .
The letter shows that they knew the line had a low flow rate and would go to the path of least resistance .
“ Therefore , knowing that this field is located well above the Arctic Circle - you do n't need a temperature sensor to know that by early November there will be sub -zero temperatures in place .
So , a basic risk assessment should have identified this possibility well before you needed a temperature sensor to tell you what the temperature in the line would be . ”
A top BP Prudhoe Bay official , who has grown “ disillusioned ” with the company ’s management style over the past year , agreed .
“ Someone was clearly not paying attention to the flow , ” said the official , who also requested anonymity because he feared retaliation for discussing internal matters .
“ The temperature dropped and the line froze .
This should n’t have happened .
I equate this with a lack of operating discipline and place the blame squarely on leadership . ”
Two weeks after the spill , a “ red flag ” e-mail was sent by BP ’s Prudhoe Bay Operations Manager to officials and employees on the oilfield , reminding them to adhere “ to established processes that ensure freeze prevention in flow lines , as well as , appropriate responses when freezing occurs . ”
But other evidence suggests that poor management and cutbacks on safety may have contributed to the Lisburne oil spill .
In January , an employee at Lisburne sent an e-mail to BP officials in Alaska saying the facility was “ operating in [ an ] unsafe condition . ”
The employee , whose name was redacted , listed more than a dozen pieces of crucial production equipment that he said were not working or were out of service during the time of the spill , thus “ leaving no back up to running equipment and equipment out of service which should be on - line as per the system requirements to run the plant . ”
The employee warned that “ with minimum manning in maintenance and operations we are basically running a broken plant with too few people to address the problems in a timely and safe manner .
…
“ Operations can not rely on Management to provide them with a safe and reliable plant to work in .
The management of our maintenance at [ Lisburne Production Center ] simply is not working to maintain a safe operation .
This gap in maintenance management causes problems that increase the overall risk of plant integrity and personnel safety . ”
The e-mail claimed that some of the safety problems threatened the lives of workers .
The employee cited “ louvers ” that he said fail to seal , an issue that has allegedly persisted for years .
Louvers are connected to the production facility ’s fire and gas suppression systems and are supposed to remain closed to trap a halon discharge in the event of fire or a gas buildup .
Halon is a chemical that prevents explosions by depleting oxygen in the air .
“ Simply put , ” said one employee who works at Lisburne , “ if those louvers do n’t seal and there is a fire or gas is released people could die . ”
Imminent Danger
According to a top BP official who works on the North Slope and six Prudhoe Bay employees , BP ’s fire and gas technical authorities told them it is likely that if BP were to test all of the louvers at North Slope facilities they would fail to seal , meaning the fire and gas suppression systems would be ineffective .
That could put workers in imminent danger if there were a gas buildup , explosion or a fire .
Moreover , internal BP documents indicated that as of April 11 , the louvers were not operating and would not be fixed for months .
It ’s unclear how the Gulf disaster , which occurred nine days later , will affect the pace of repairs at Prudhoe Bay .
Steve Rinehart , a spokesman for BP Alaska , said the issues the employee addressed in the e-mail were dealt with immediately .
" We will not operate facilities unsafely , " Rinehart said .
" We take this kind of info from employees very seriously .
In this case , line leadership started meeting with the employees who raised these issues at Lisburne as soon as they received the list .
We have made very good progress .
Half the items have been closed out , some of the rest are virtually complete and all are being worked and tracked . "
The Alaska State Fire Marshal , who would be responsible for inspecting the louvers and other fire and gas - related equipment to ensure it works properly , did not return a call for comment .
The employee ’s e-mail , I was told by BP Alaska officials , is now in the hands of criminal investigators and BP ’s probation officer , Mary Frances Barnes , who are scrutinizing the employee ’s claims to determine if it had any bearing on the pipeline rupture last November and whether it would amount to a probation violation for the company .
BP pleaded guilty in October 2007 to a criminal misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act , resulting from two oil spills on the North Slope in 2006 , both of which resulted from severely corroded pipelines that the company failed to upkeep .
The company was placed on probation for three years .
Tyler Amon is the special agent - in - charge at the EPA ’s Criminal Investigation Division probing the circumstances behind last November ’s oil spill .
He did not return calls for comment nor did Barnes or a spokesperson for the FBI .
The e-mail has also been sent to Rep. Henry Waxman , D - California , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
Waxman ’s office did not return several calls for comment .
An earlier congressional investigation found that deferral of maintenance projects contributed to other oil spills .
As of June 5 , Lisburne was shut down for planned maintenance .
It ’s unknown if BP intends to address any of the maintenance and operational issues described in the e-mail .
Two BP management officials , who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters , said budget cuts were largely the reason equipment was not upgraded or repaired and indicated that much of the problem has yet to be addressed .
BP ’s Alaska budget for 2010 is $ 1 billion , compared with $ 1.1 billion in 2009 and $ 1.3 billion in 2008 .
However , a document , which BP sent to the House Energy and Commerce Committee before the Gulf disaster , said budget cuts have not impacted projects that need to be funded at Prudhoe Bay .
The company said the fear by employees that budget cuts would impact “ integrity investment ” was likely due to “ dramatic changes in oil prices and economic uncertainty in late 2008 and continuing into 2009 . ”
“ This perception was likely heightened by [ BP Alaska ’s ] challenge to its contractors in early 2009 to deliver cost efficiencies , ” said the budget document .
“ Our commitment is to activities that reduce risk – we target efficiency improvements to complete these activities at lower cost . ”
The document indicates that BP deferred or “ re- paced ” some projects , but the company said it “ risk - assessed each of the activities and identified mitigative measures to reduce any risk to safe operations . ”
Past Mistakes
The pipeline rupture at Lisburne also may have been an example of BP Alaska failing to learn from its past mistakes .
On Feb. 19 , 2001 , a pipeline ruptured under similar circumstances , with temperature monitors placed on the pipeline inside the building .
BP told the State of Alaska and the ADEC that it would rectify the issue in the future by moving the monitors on all of its pipes outside of the facility so it could accurately check the temperature .
But the company apparently never fulfilled its promise .
Kovac and several other BP employees also raised red flags about a newly constructed – but what they consider a poorly designed – pipeline that feeds directly into pump station 1 , the beginning of the Trans Alaska Pipeline .
Replacing a portion of corroded pipeline that ruptured in 2006 and spilt more than 200,000 gallons of oil across the frozen tundra , the two - mile - long rebuilt pipeline has experienced “ severe hopping up and down on the vertical support members , ” due to wind induced vibration , a phenomenon that was discovered when the oilfield was developed more than 30 years ago .
But it does not appear that BP learned that lesson of the past , either , when it designed the new pipeline .
That “ hopping , ” Kovac said , has caused stress on the “ pipewall ” and weld joints on sections connected to the vertical support members .
“ The harmonics in [ the pipeline ] allowed it to bounce up and down , ” Kovac said .
“ BP rectified the problem by placing timbers under the line between the vertical support members [ which is not unusual ] about two months ago .
As far as I know , there is n’t a plan in place to [ permanently ] fix the problem . ”
Kovac and other employees added that there are other corroded pipelines that should have been replaced three years ago , but have n’t been ; plus , a spill - detection system has n’t been installed .
Another contributing factor to the two most recent oil spills is the overworking of employees who face 16 - 18 - hour work shifts because of a shortage of trained personnel .
Internal company documents described the work situation as an “ imminent safety risk ” because employees who work more than 16 hours during a 24 - hour time period can lack the mental capacity to make sound and timely decisions .
Yet during 2009 , 16 - plus hour work shifts were routine at Prudhoe Bay , with employees working beyond 16 hours about 200- 400 times per month , 75 percent of which represented 18 - hour work shifts , according to internal BP documents .
Another internal BP document , dated Sept. 8 , 2009 , shows that one BP employee worked 36 consecutive days of 16 and 18 hour shifts in 2009 in violation of BP 's own policies .
According to Jeanne Pascal , the EPA ’s former debarment counsel who worked on BP - related matters for more than a decade , BP told her 10 years ago that the company intended to come up with a plan to “ fix ” the 16 - 18 hour work shifts .
BP employees who work at Prudhoe Bay are supposed to work 12 - hour shifts for two weeks and then receive two weeks off .
However , since employees who work beyond 12 hours receive overtime pay , some employees are “ happy ” to stay on the job beyond 12 hours because the pay is so good , Kovac said .
“ It ’s not a good idea , ” Kovac said .
“ Working more than 12 hours during a shift affects decision making and response time and can cause disasters .
People have to take catnaps while operating large volumes of hydrocarbons under high pressure .
We will have accidents as a result of it . ”
BP has addressed the issue by hiring more technicians , but even that has not solved the problem as it takes three to four years , Kovac said , for a trainee to be fully prepared to work on the North Slope .
“ The number of new technicians sent to the operating facilities since 2006 and the slower than expected pace of newly - hired technician training has not kept pace with ‘ leavers , ’ new work activities requiring substantial facility / field production technician support , and support for external commitments made and BP initiatives , ” according to an October 2009 internal BP document explaining why 18 - hour shifts continue despite their impact on the safe operations of Prudhoe Bay .
In 2009 , there were 652 instances in which well - pad and drill - site operators worked in excess of 16 hours .
“ Since well - pad operators are designated professional drivers , the scheduling represents a deliberate non-conformance to BP Group Standard for Driving Safety and [ the BP Exploration Alaska ] Driving Safety Policy , ” said the October 2009 internal BP memo .
“ Allowing the continuation of the 16 - plus hour work shifts would be seen by internal and external stakeholders as putting production ahead of safety , ” the document said .
Kovac and the other BP employees said they doubt that BP has the wherewithal to tackle the issues plaguing Prudhoe Bay .
“ This company seems incapable of managing its assets safely , ” Kovac said – an observation that many Americans living along the Gulf of Mexico might consider an understatement .

A press day chat with director Jean - Pierre Jeunet , of “ Micmacs ”
If you ’re even a halfway serious film fan , you may have noticed that directors like Wes Anderson , Tim Burton , and Quentin Tarantino do not make movies set on Planet Earth , they make movies set on Planets Anderson , Burton , and Tarantino .
I ’m a bit less of an expert on France ’s extremely popular Jean - Pierre Jeunet , but it ’s obvious that , even when his films are set in Paris , they ’re really set on Planet Jeunet .
His films have their own look and exist in their own reality .
As with Tim Burton , Jeunet ’s roots are in animation .
Together with his early collaborator , cartoonist Marc Caro , he made two films that pretty much destroyed the idea of France as a land where all movies were gritty examinations of the lives of depressed intellectuals ( not that there ’s anything wrong with that ) .
Dystopic but decidedly non-realistic , “ Delicatessen ” and , to a much greater extent , 1995 ’s “ The City of Lost Children ” broke through internationally , with the latter becoming a popular midnight selection and attracting a geek audience that might have ordinarily rejected subtitled films .
That was followed by his first solo production and also his first and , so far , only American film .
1997 ’s “ Alien : Resurrection ” was a domestic commercial disappointment that generated mixed reviews and more than a little fan hate in the U.S. — even its screenwriter , fan - master Joss Whedon , has entirely disowned it — but it was nevertheless an international success which is still warmly embraced by its jovial director .
After that , Jeunet broke through even bigger with the worldwide success of “ Amelie ” in 2001 , easily one of the most widely seen French films in the United States of the last couple of decades — so much so that it was simply referenced as “ the French movie ” in last year ’s “ Up in the Air . ”
Now , Jeunet is back with his first film since his worldwide box office and critical hit , 2005 ’s “ A Very Long Engagement , ” with his own take on Chaplinesque / Keatonesque comedy with just a dash of Rube Goldberg not - quite - sci - fi .
“ Micmacs ” stars comic Dany Boon ( “ My Best Friend ” ) as the hapless Bazil , whose father was killed by a landmine and whose health and livelihood was ruined by a bullet — each produced by a ruthless arms manufacturer .
Homeless , he is befriended by a ragtag assortment of seven eccentrics with various unique skills .
Bazil enlists their aid in avenging himself against the two firms .
The film has done reasonably well in its initial New York opening , and will be expanding to more theaters this Friday .
It ’s generally also been a hit with critics , very definitely including PH ’s own Jason Zingale .
Jeunet is not one of those filmmakers he seems to mind meeting the press .
Though he arrived late — how French of him ! — he was both apologetic and in infectious high spirits , joking and introducing an old friend who was there to smooth over rough spots in translations .
( Jeunet had little trouble giving long answers in English , but he seemed to occasionally need help in understanding the more involved questions . )
The first question was about the source of the story of “ Micmacs , ” and Jeunet was off and running .
“ First you have to know something .
Before , I worked two years on ‘ Life of Pi . ’
It ’s a beautiful project for 20th Century Fox and now Ang Lee is supposed to make the film .
I spoke with the producer this morning and it ’s on the way .
But it was so expensive because it was a story about a kid after a shipwreck in a lifeboat fighting against a tiger .
You have the three worst elements for a film : the sea , a wild animal , and a kid .
It was too expensive , that was the only reason I did n’t make this film after two years .
I wrote the script … I spent six months to make the storyboard .
Huge work . ”
“ So , ” Jeunet continued , “ I was starving to shoot — to make something very quickly .
I had some different ideas in my computer and , in fact , I mixed three different feelings .
One of them was a preoccupation with weapons sellers because I had a fascination for these strange people able to invent things to [ create ] suffering . ”
“ Also , I wanted a story of revenge .
I love ‘ Once Upon a Time in the West . ’
And the third thing was to make something with a band of original , weird people like the seven dwarfs from ‘ Snow White . ’
One of them is shy , one of them is always pissed - off … so I mix from different feelings .
I was concerned about mixing serious issues like weapons with a slapstick cartoon , and I thought , ‘ Okay , ‘ The Great Dictator ‘ was a comedy , too . ' ”
That was followed by a question about mixing politics , to whatever extent “ Micmacs ” is political , with Jeunet ’s not - of - this - earth style .
“ I do n’t want to say ‘ politics ’ because it ’s such a cliche to say ‘ it ’s bad to sell weapons . ’
But we made real research .
We made a beautiful interview with a weapons manufacturer in Belgium who made some arrows to go through the tanks .
He ’d get the temperature to go so high in one second everybody burns inside the tanks . ”
“ We met very interesting people .
They have the passion for technology , I would like to have these people in my crew .
Very nice people .
But when you say , ‘ But , then you kill people , ’ they say ‘ Yes , but we work on the right side . ’
I remember this sentence , it ’s in the film , ‘ We work for the Minister of Defense , not the Minister of Attack , ” said Jeunet , noting that , despite the arms merchants ’ claims , their weapons are often resold on the open market to all kinds of evil characters .
Then there was the more or less inevitable question about Jeunet ’s highly distinctive visual approach , particularly his use of rich colors and wide lenses .
“ I like directors with a strong style … .
When you see a film from Tim Burton , you recognize immediately it ’s Tim Burton .
Same thing for Terry Gilliam or …David Lynch .
A long time ago it was Fellini .
I do n’t want to compare myself to these great directors , but I love to shoot with a short lens , to use warm colors — I love to do that .
That ’s it . ”
“ This time , I wanted to make something faster with a lighter camera , but everybody told me , ‘ no , it ’s too early for the digital , we [ need to ] spend some time to fix the defects . ’
Next time , I want to make it all in 3 - D or with a lighter camera . ”
Then , a question about whether a certain amount of innocence , combined with ingenuity and imagination , can be a way to defend oneself from the violence and evil of the world .
“ Absolutely , I believe , about imagination .
Between the ages of 17 and 21 I was a worker at the telephone company and imagination saved my life .
In fact , the character of Dany Boon is a little bit of a metaphor of my work because , to accomplish his revenge , he needs a crew of specific characters like I need a crew to accomplish my films . ”
Working at something of a disadvantage since I had n’t yet seen “ Micmacs , ” I asked Jeunet about his obvious love for onscreen mechanical devices , which always puts me in mind of Orson Welles ’ famous remark that having a film studio to work in was “ the biggest electric train set a boy ever had . ”
Jeunet was of a similar mind , comparing filmmaking to French - manufactured Meccano construction sets .
“ Inside the box you have the costumes , the dialogue , the music — and I want to use everything inside the box to build the most beautiful toy I can and do n’t lose anything inside the box .
This is my conception . ”
“ Another one is I am like a chef .
I prepare a good meal and I want to share .
‘ You think it ’s good , no ? ’ and sometimes they say , ‘ no , it ’s not good , and I am disappointed . ”
But Jeunet is different from other directors in that he ’s obviously fond of actually putting odd , sometimes Rube Goldberg - like , mechanical constructions up on the screen .
“ Yes .
For this one , I hired a guy , because I discovered this guy who ’s a naive artist .
He was in a museum in Paris with a beautiful animated sculpture .
It was so beautiful we did n’t build them ourselves , but I hired the guy to lend [ them . ] ”
Then the conversation turned to the great silent comedy filmmakers and their influence on “ Micmacs . ”
“ Especially for the ‘ Cannon Men ’ scene , I thought about Buster Keaton .
And when Dany Boon makes you think about [ Charlie ] Chaplin , it was n’t on purpose .
During the shooting I saw him and said , ‘ Ooh , you make me think of Chaplin . ’
He said ‘ You think so ? ’
And after , I think , he continued to think , and it was on purpose after that . ”
And exactly how was the very talented actor - stand - up - performer Dany Boon , a huge star in France , cast ?
“ I followed him since 15 years ago .
Just after I hired him , he got a huge success with ‘ Welcome to the Land of Shtis ’ [ which Boon co-wrote and directed ] .
But when I say huge I mean it was almost like ‘ Titanic ’ — 21 million admissions .
‘ Amelie ’ was a huge success , it was nine million admissions .
Can you believe it ?
I ’m very jealous , ” Jeunet said , getting some laughs at the table .
“ He ’s a very good actor .
Every take is perfect .
You never had a bad take .
And he ’s a nice guy , very simple , very funny . ”
And what is Jeunet ’s style of working with actors in general ?
“ They have to be precise .
That ’s the reason I love Audrey Tautou or Dany Boon .
You have to have the head here or here , not to move a little bit .
Because when you use a short lens , if they are too close to the lens they could be like a monster .
I am very precise .
On the other hand , if they want to surprise me , if they want to propose to me something different , I am very open .
I make a storyboard but ‘ okay , new idea , no problem . ’
But I love technician - actors . ”
Then there was a question ( which I was hoping to ask myself ) about the use of the music of Hollywood classic - era composer Max Steiner , which follows on a scene early in the film where Dany Boon ’s character is watching a classic detective movie directed by Howard Hawks .
“ At the beginning it was ‘ The Big Sleep . ’
We used maybe six or seven pieces of different [ film scores ] from Max Steiner .
In fact , I wanted to just use the ‘ The Big Sleep ’ to make the gag with the end starting the film .
It was on my notes .
Of course , we had the music and the music worked so well , later we thought maybe we could use Max Steiner music for the whole film , the action scenes .
“ It worked so well sometimes it was like a miracle .
I remember one scene , during 40 seconds — not a cut .
Every sync point worked perfect .
I imagined Max Steiner in Paradise … [ rubs his hands , laughing maniacally as if the angelic Steiner was gleefully observing “ Micmacs ” post- production ] .
No , it was a great moment .
By luck we found some good recordings from the seventies .
It was in stereo .
Good quality , not amazing quality , but good quality . ”
Then there was a question following up on Jeunet ’s earlier comparison of being a director to being a chef .
Does Jeunet try mainly to please himself or does he think specifically about the audience ’s reaction while working on the film ?
“ You work for yourself .
If you are a chef , you are the first taster .
‘ Hmm . I love that !
Do you want to share ? ’
But you have to love [ it ] before …’
You are the first spectator of your film .
If you think about the other people , you ’re dead .
It ’s very selfish to make a film . ”
Next was a question about the strongly Gaelic flavor of Jeunet ’s films , at least from an American point of view .
Has it been a help in differentiating his films and competing in the world market with U.S. productions ?
“ I do n’t know .
I love Paris .
I try to show a different Paris each time .
I do n’t know if it ’s French .
Of course , if I use music with accordions , it sounds French .
But , in France , you have to know , I am not French .
They think I am international because my films are sold everywhere , and I do n’t feel especially French . ”
That led to a discussion about how sometimes a country ’s most internationally successful living filmmaker is less beloved at home .
Jeunet mentioned how Spain ’s Pedro Almodovar has quit his nation ’s film academy after his films were ignored at awards time .
I did n’t get the chance to bring it up , but a similar phenomenon happened with the elder Akira Kurosawa in Japan , who endured a great deal of criticism during the seventies and eighties from younger filmmakers and writers .
No one is a prophet in their own home , as the saying goes .
Of course , that ’s not all , there ’s the tendency of all nations ’ press to build people up and then rip them apart .
“ At first , I ca n’t complain .
But now it ’s getting difficult because I had three huge success .
‘ Alien ’ [ as alluded to before , “ Alien : Resurrection ” was a hit in France ] , ‘ Amelie ’ and ‘ A Very Long Engagement . ’
Now , ” Jeunet intoned , his voice getting comically melodramatic , “ it ’s time to pay ! , ” he said , getting a big laugh from the table .
Next there was a question about whether future projects might be more commercial than past films .
The director alluded to an intimate “ small French book ” which he thought might not be commercial , but that there was also a presumably more broadly appealing , and apparently really excellent , American book .
“ Oh my God , it ’s a masterpiece .
But I do n’t want to tell anything because I ’m going to meet next week with the author in New York . ”
Jeunet likes the book , whatever it is , so much he was having a hard time containing himself .
“ Ah , it ’s such a good book .
Oh my God , it ’s a fucking masterpiece but I heard he [ presumably , the author ] would like to direct the film himself .
Big mistake ! ” Jeunet said with his French talent for exaggeration , getting another laugh from the table .
He also said that the story is actually set in Russia “ during the war ” and that it would neither be a French or American film in terms of feeling , though American actors would star because using Russian actors would probably “ scare people . ”
Another question : Does Jeunet think his imagination is “ dark ” ?
“ I can [ be dark ] if I want .
I try to make something more brighter .
It ’s more interesting and more difficult to make something positive than negative .
To be negative is very easy . ”
What does he think of the current vogue for more film science fiction and works of “ extreme imagination . ”
“ I love science fiction and I do n’t like the fantastic .
For example , if you have a magical ring and you can explode the world , for me — it ’s not interesting .
I do n’t like ‘ Lord of the Rings ’ or even ‘ Star Wars . ’
For me , I do n’t understand this kind of story .
But [ I love ] ‘ Alien , ’ because the rules of the game are very precise .
It could happen … I have an idea about robots in the future … ”
Then came some questions that really did n’t go very far .
Having not seen the film , I wondered if , in addition to the hero ’s helpers being an allusion to the seven dwarfs , if they were perhaps somewhat influenced by the highly specialized abilities of the teams that helped pulp heroes like Doc Savage pull off their daring - do .
I also could n’t help thinking of the Doc Savage - inspired science fiction satire , “ The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the Eighth Dimension , ” a movie that might have been improved if Jeunet had been able to direct it in 1984 .
Since he did n’t seem to know anything about either , I have to take that as a “ no ” even if his two - word answer was “ Yeah , maybe . ”
Moving on to another questioner , how did Jeunet feel about the relative size of his audience , overall ?
“ You can have a dinner with one [ person ] or with ten people and it ’s the same pleasure .
If you can get the money back for the film , it ’s not a problem .
If I would have wanted to have a huge audience , I would make American movies , not French movies , because there is a limit , of course , with the French language .
“ … I prefer to shoot in my own language , to play with my language , to play in Paris .
And , I have the freedom , complete freedom in France .
It ’s amazing .
If American directors could imagine how I am free they would have asked to have … ”
And then Jeunet had to ask his aid for the words he was seeking .
They were “ political asylum . ”
Another big laugh .
And that led to the question , which Jeunet said he was waiting for , about the general impression that he was n’t allowed very much freedom by the American producers of the controversial “ Alien : Resurrection . ”
“ No , it was a great experience .
I read so many times ‘ it was a nightmare for Jean - Pierre Jeunet . ' ”
That impression apparently extended to “ Up in the Air ” co-writer / director Jason Reitman who , according to Jeunet , mentioned in an interview the director ’s alleged ordeal in connection with his film ’s offhand reference to “ Amelie ” and her traveling garden gnome .
“ No , it was n’t a nightmare .
I ’m sorry .
It was tough .
It was difficult because you have to convince people to have your way in editing .
You have to speak with a lot of people , but it was n’t a nightmare .
It was just tough .
And , in France , it ’s not tough .
You have the freedom by law . ”
Then Jeunet did something very refreshing in response to questions , which is to admit to some creative weaknesses .
First , in a passing reference to “ City of Lost Children , ” he confessed that he and Marc Caro had come up with the kind of setting and mood they wanted to create before coming up with the story and that was , perhaps , the wrong order .
The story , he said , should come first .
Another question asked about what he thought of the love story in “ Micmacs ” between Dany Boon ’s character and a contortionist played by Julie Ferrier .
“ I think it ’s not enough .
Some people told me , ‘ It ’s not enough .
We need some stronger emotion . ’
And they ’re right , I think . ”
That led to an anecdote about an American studio he greatly admires .
“ I had the great privilege to make a master class at Pixar in San Francisco with 1,000 people .
It was amazing .
They are so good to alternate … they say ‘ one laugh for one tear . ’
Auggh . ”
That led to a bit more discussion of Julie Ferrier , a character comedian in her own right who Jeunet thinks is a kind of genius and instructed us all to look her up on YouTube .
( I did .
Being reasonably fluent in French would probably be a help . )
And though she is quite flexible thanks to her background as a dancer , she ’s not quite a contortionist .
A body double was needed as well .
“ We found a Russian girl , and she does an erotic show in Germany , and its very interesting , ” Jeunet said , showing some good comic timing and getting a big laugh and generating questions whether her performances could be found on YouTube as well .
He added .
“ My Japanese director of photography [ Tetsuo Nagata ] , he was very moved . ”
More laughter .
And , apparently wanting to leave the journos laughing , the end of the interview was declared .

A top European Central Bank official said Wednesday efforts to buy government bonds have helped calm financial markets , and he did n’t rule out buying private securities , too .
“ We have seen some results .
Markets are slowly improving ” because of the purchases , European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said .
When it comes to the potential purchase of private paper such as corporate bonds , he said “ it would just be in certain markets . ”
In May , the European Union created a $ 720 billion rescue fund for euro - zone members facing problems selling debt in the public markets .
As part of that effort , the European Central Bank in a surprise U - turn said it would purchase euro - zone government debt to help support the smooth functioning of debt markets .
But in contrast to the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England , the ECB did n’t provide an overall amount for the purchases , and it also said the liquidity pumped into the market in this way would be withdrawn–or “ sterilized ” –to prevent fueling inflation .
The purchases have been controversial , particularly with German central bank officials .
Amounts purchased have been moderate –in the week to June 11 , the ECB purchased EUR6.7 billion in government debt .
Bini Smaghi said that not providing an overall amount for the purchases gave the ECB “ more flexibility . ”
Multivitamins / Antioxidants :
The supposed benefit is overall health .
Every time I hear these come up in science literature , it 's to say how supplementing them provides no measurable benefits at all .
A better solution ; eat fruits and vegetables .
Eating actual vegetation does show a significant improvement versus multivitamin or antioxidant pills .
Fruits and veggies have added fiber you wo n't get with pills too , and it's also thought there might be other beneficial substances in greens that we just do n't know about yet .

Fish / Flax Oil : Omega - 3 fatty acids are supposed to improve your brain ( fish ) and heart ( flax ) .
These claims actually hold true .
It 's not a bad idea to get these in your diet through actual fish like salmon , and sprinkling ground flax seed over whatever you please .

Weight Loss Formulas :
These are the primarily made up of energy boosters like ephedrine , caffeine , green teen extract , and guarana .
While they do give your heart rate a jump - start , it 's not going to magically make you lose 5 lbs a week .
You get an energy boost and that 's it .
Some people mistakenly " see " themselves getting leaner because caffeine / ephedrine strongly dehydrate your body .
While dropping water makes you appear leaner temporarily , it 's not the same as real results .
A better alternative to weight loss pills are coffee or tea , as these will give you many other health benefits on top of the energy boost .

Glutamine / BCAAs :
These weight lifting supplements are supposed to improve your muscle recovery .
They 're simply individual amino acids ; the stuff that makes up protein .
Glutamine has been shown to do absolutely nothing , making it one of the worst perpetuated fitness myths .
BCAAs have been shown to help with muscle recovery , but the effects are marginal .
A better alternative is to rely on food ; anyone eating a well rounded diet should get enough of these amino acids from the protein they normally eat .

Creatine : Creatine is sort of a backup store of energy in your muscles .
Supplementing creatine provides a boost in your anaerobic performance .
That is , if you were lifting weights you can get an extra one or two reps before giving up .
If there 's any tried and true supplement out there , it 's creatine .
You can get creatine from red meat and certain types of fish , but the supplement is actually going to be cheaper .
There are different kinds ; monohydrate , ethyl - ester , citrate , magnesium - phosphate , kre - alkalyn ..
All claim to be " better " in some way , but that 's all garbage ; creatine is creatine .
Go with monohydrate as it's the cheapest .

Nitric Oxide ( NO ) :
This is a vasodilator , which means your blood vessels open up to bring oxygen and nutrients to your muscles quicker .
This stuff does what it says , increasing blood flow to muscle , and will increase performance in ways similar to creatine .
However , NO is relatively new on the supplement scene and not surprisingly , more expensive .
I do n't know of any foods that give significant increases in NO production .
Just as well eat your money
Multivitamins
Antioxidant pills
Glutamine
Marginal effects / you can get through diet
Ephedrine
Caffeine
BCAAs
Worth the cheese
Creatine
Nitric Oxide
This one is easy : none .
Our culture has an obsession with taking some pill that will turn us into Superman with no effort at all .
Supplements will not do the work for you .
In some cases , supplements provide a marginal benefit at best .
In other cases , they do nothing what - so - ever aside from making your wallet lighter .
Here are a few popular supplements and whether or not they actually do anything :
Always keep in mind though , that you should talk to a professional if you think these supplements might agitate some pre-existing condition of yours .
And , supplements are just that ; meant toa well rounded diet and solid exercise .
While some provide a little benefit , they wo n't do the work for you .
In short , we can summarize and say :
AUSTRALIA'S network news war has escalated with a Nine security guard allegedly Tasered by a Seven security guard before the Socceroos first World Cup match .
Rival camera crews filmed the Fanatics ' procession to Durban 's Kings Park Stadium when an arm wrestle for access turned violent .
The dispute ended with Taser burns to the former British military officer hired by Channel 9 to protect staff from South African street crime .
After the crews exchanged verbal threats , Channel 7 reporter Mike Amor stepped in a bid to end the childishness .
But witnesses claim that prompted Nine 's bodyguard to step in to separate the pair , only to be Tasered by Seven 's guard , confirmed as an off - duty South African policeman .
While the taser strike failed to fell " Russ " ( Nine 's security man , who once protected one - time UN boss Kofi Annan ) , he sustained bruising and minor burns to his stomach .
Allison Langdon brought a working police officer to break up the crews and check the Seven security man 's credentials .
No charges have been laid as yet .
Nine 's national news director Mark Calvert said the Tasering turned the ratings rivalry ugly .
" When I hired security for the World Cup , we had been warned about the country 's crime rate and possible terrorist threats .
Who would have thought we 'd need protection from a Channel 7 crew ? "
Mr Calvert said yesterday .
With a nod to comments by Seven news boss Peter Meakin last week , when he threatened to " shoot " rivals for his job , his opposite number at Nine added : " This is a classic case of taking the boss too literally . "
But Mr Amor said : " Our guard pulled out his Taser gun , but we do n't believe the other guy was actually Tasered .
It calmed down and we actually had a beer at the bar with them [ Nine ] after the game " .
" It was a silly thing and it 's been sorted . "
MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Prime Minister Vladimir Putin climbed into the cockpit of Russia ’s newest fighter jet on Thursday and said it would trump a U.S. - built rival , the F - 22 Raptor .
Putin watched a test flight of a “ fifth - generation ” stealth fighter , dubbed the T - 50 and billed as Russia ’s first all - new warplane since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
“ This machine will be superior to our main competitor , the F - 22 , in terms of maneuverability , weaponry and range , ” Putin told the pilot after the flight , according to an account on the government website .
Putin said the plane would cost up to three times less than similar aircraft in the West and could remain in service for 30 to 35 years with upgrades , according to the report .
Successful development of the fighter , built by Sukhoi , is crucial to showing Russia can challenge U.S. technology and modernize its military after a period of post - Soviet decay .
Russia also plans to manufacture T - 50s jointly with India .
The F - 22 raptor stealth fighter first flew in 1997 and is the only fifth - generation fighter in service .
Fifth - generation aircraft have advanced flight and weapons control systems and can cruise at supersonic speeds .
According to the government website , the test pilot told Putin the controls of the T - 50 allowed the pilot to operate most of the plane ’s systems without taking his hands off the joystick , which he said would be very useful under high forces of gravity .
“ I know , I ’ve flown , ” Putin replied .
Sukhoi has said the plane should be ready for use in 2015 .
Tesco has quietly returned to a multimillion - pound Channel Islands tax dodge four years after the authorities in Jersey banished the supermarket group 's VAT - free CD and DVD website from the island , accusing Britain 's largest retailer of operating a " sham " selling structure that brought the Channel Islands into disrepute .
The Tesco Entertainment website is now offering online VAT - free sales of CDs and DVDs from Guernsey , the Guardian has learned .
The tax avoidance involved may be unclear to many customers , however , as the site 's small print simply states : " All prices are expressed inclusive of any VAT payable unless otherwise stated . "
The move is likely to prove embarrassing for the British government which has sought to dismiss suggestions this VAT loophole trade is ballooning out of control .
In February the Treasury issued a statement attacking Guardian claims that intense price competition had led to online VAT dodging had become the industry norm .
" The implication that businesses are simply setting up on the Channel Islands to take advantage of this relief is not true , " officials said .
Told of Tesco 's low - key return to Channel Islands VAT avoidance , Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vincent Cable said : " It seems to me absolutely extraordinary and seriously unwise for a leading British plc to be caught out dodging tax at a time when the country has a very serious fiscal crisis on its hands .
I am sure if they are sufficiently aware of the importance of their reputation in this area that they will stop it immediately . "
Treasury minister Stephen Timms has estimated the cost in lost VAT revenues from all companies involved in this trade for 2008 was £ 110 m and rising , implying annual VAT - free sales of £ 625 m .
To qualify for tax exemption under EU rules , goods must be imported from outside the EU at a price of less than £ 18 .
As well as Tesco , other big name retailers to exploit the loophole include Amazon , HMV , WH Smith , Play.com and Asda .
In its earlier guise , Tesco's Channel Islands website was candid about its activities .
The site was branded " Tesco Jersey " and customers were clearly told : " It is cheaper to buy this product from Tesco Jersey because no VAT is included . "
This frank approach made Tesco a target for campaigners , led by small independent music stores who were unable to compete with VAT - free prices .
Four years ago , Tesco and a small number of competitors were driven out of Jersey by the island 's then economic development minister Philip Ozouf , who imposed a new licensing regime designed to curb VAT - dodging activities .
" We do n't want the economy dominated by online retailing , " he said , promising businesses would be stopped from " simply using Jersey as a postbox " .
In a 2006 letter to those being pushed off the island , Jersey officials wrote : " The minister [ Ozouf ] is concerned that Jersey is being used as part of a selling structure which is a complete sham , inasmuch as the purchaser and the parent company of vendor are both located in the UK , and even the goods , or some of them , are transferred to Jersey from the UK for the sole purpose of being the subject of a token sale in Jersey before being shipped back to the UK and delivered to the purchaser . "
In a Commons debate in January last year , Treasury minister Stephen Timms said : " Guernsey has made it clear to a number of UK companies involved in music retailing , including those that have been forced to close their Jersey operations , that it does not wish to see them establish activities on the island . "
Despite pressure on public finances , the drive to close the VAT loophole has all but disappeared .
In his 2006 budget , Gordon Brown said : " The government is aware that [ EU VAT relief rules on imports ] is currently being exploited and the relief now costs the exchequer around £ 85 m per year .
If the relief continues to be exploited by businesses using offshore locations , the government will consider changes to prevent this type of behaviour . "
Customers using Tesco's website today will be told that they may be buying from Tesco ( Jersey ) Ltd , a company registered to an address in St Helier , the island 's capital .
Until recently , Tesco had recruited a third - party company , TheHut.com , which has operations in Jersey and Guernsey , to enter into VAT - free transactions on its behalf through the Tesco Entertainment website .
Tesco ( Jersey )
Ltd is now entering into these transactions directly .
Asked if the company had a Jersey licence for such trades , Tesco said : " We are trading from Guernsey so do not need a Jersey licence . "
It added : " Like a number of other online retailers , Tesco Entertainment operates from Guernsey .
We have to remain very focused on price in this fiercely competitive market .
The benefits from the VAT savings are passed straight to customers in the form of a lower price . "
I thought of a stock trading strategy : buy 5/10 of what you want , then set good - until - cancelled orders to buy 1/10 more if it goes down 5 % or sell 1/10 if it goes up 5 % .
If the stock oscillates you make money .
If it goes down , when it has dropped 21.6 % you 've bought all you intended to , or if it goes up 27 % you 've sold your original half at a 16 % gain ( an 8 % gain for your total money ) .
But is 5 % the right amount ?
Going up 5 % then going down 5 % would gain you 0.5 % of your investment , or 0.25 % of your total , it 's a 0.125 % gain per trade .
If you did 10 % instead of 5 % , up and down is 1 % of your investment , 0.5 % of your total , so 0.25 % gain per trade .
So 10 % is better per trade than 5 % .
But wait , there 's at least twice as many 5 % trades as 10 % trades .
In fact , there 's usually about 3 x as many 5 % trades as 10 % trades ( from surveying various stocks this year and last ) .
So 5 % is better than 10 % , and 2 % is better than 5 % , and 1 % is better than 2 % ...
But wait , 10 % buys all you intended at 37.9 % down instead of 21.6 % , and sells everything by 61 % up instead of 27 % up .
In order for 5 % to have the same trading range , you 'd have to trade in increments of 1/20th instead of 1/10th .
Then 5 % earns 1/4th as much per trade as 10 % , and there are only 3 x as many 5 % trades as 10 % strades , so 10 % is better .
And 20 % is better than 10 % , and 50 % is better than 20 % , and 100 % is better than 50 % ...
But wait , ...
Certainly , few will forget this in a hurry – probably never .
Remember , Mahut – who only came through qualifying after beating Alex Bogdanovic 24 - 22 in the third set of their second round encounter – had to haul himself from his chair 55 times knowing that he had to serve to stay in the match .
He saved three match points .

I ’ve been playing with different ways of representing data ( see my previous night lights example ) and I decided to venture into 3D representations .
I ’ve used a full year of crime data for San Francisco from 2009 to create these maps .
The full dataset can be download from the city ’s DataSF website .
A view from above
This view shows different types of crime in San Francisco viewed directly from above .
The sun is shining from the east , as it would during sunrise .
I love how some of the features in these maps are pretty consistent across all the crime types , like the mountain ridge along Mission St. , and how some of the features only crop up in one or two of the maps .
The most unique map by far is the one for prostitution ( more on that further down ) .
An alternate view
Here ’s the same data but from a different angle , which helps show some of the differences .
UPDATE : Whoops , I screwed up originally and had a duplicate image .
The original graphic showed the same map for Vandalism and Assault ( both were the Vandalism map ) .
This updated graphic has the correct map for Assault .
Many of the maps have peaks in the Tenderloin , which is that high area sort of in the north - east center area of the city .
Some are extremely concentrated ( narcotics ) and some are far more spread out ( vehicle theft ) .
My favorite map is the one for prostitution ( maybe “ favorite ” is the wrong choice of words there ) .
Nearly all the arrests for prostitution in San Francisco occur along what I ’m calling the “ Mission Mountain Ridge ” , which runs up Mission St between 24th and 16th .
EDIT : I ’ve been corrected .
Upon closer inspection the prostitution arrests are peaking on Shotwell St. at the intersections of 19th and 17th .
I ’m sure the number of colorful euphemisms you can come up with that include the words “ shot ” and “ well ” are endless .
I love the way the mountain range casts a shadow over much of the city .
There ’s also a second peak in the Tenderloin ( which I ’m dubbing Mt. Loin ) .
Drug crimes are also interesting to look at , since so much of the drug activity in San Francisco is centered in a few distinct areas .
We can see Mt. Loin rising high above all the other small peaks .
The second highest peak is the 16th St. BART peak .
There are other consistent features in these maps , in addition to Mt. Loin and the Mission Range .
There ’s a valley that separates the peaks in the Mission and the peaks in the Tenderloin , which is where the freeway runs ( Valley 101 ) .
You ’ll also notice a division in many of the maps that separates the southeast corner .
That ’s the Hunter ’s Point Riverbed ( aka the 280 freeway ) .
Disclaimer
These maps were generated from real data , but please do n’t take them as being accurate .
The data was aggregated geographically and artistically rendered .
This is meant more as an art piece than an informative visualization .

Victorious Senate candidate demands Obama stop attending climate summits as new leaked report details shocking economic impact of Spain ’s “ green economy ”
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Wednesday , May 19 , 2010
After trouncing his neo-con opponent comprehensively in the Kentucky Senate primary , Rand Paul savaged the man -made global warming scam for what it truly represents – an attack on the middle class and the industrialized world , as he warned President Obama and his sycophants , “ we ’ve come to take our government back ” .
“ I have a message , a message from the Tea Party – a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words – we ’ve come to take our government back , ” stated Paul to rapturous applause , adding that he would take on the special interests in Washington who treat the federal government as their own personal ATM .
“ What you have done and what we can do can transform America , ” said Paul , candidly warning that America ’s greatness hinges on saving the country .
Paul added that America could be saved from its debt crisis “ that is devouring our country and I think could lead to chaos . ”
The victorious candidate then savaged President Obama for apologizing to Robert Mugabe , Hugo Chavez and Evo Morales for the industrial revolution .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Watch the clip below .
“ These petty dictators say that to stop climate change it ’s about ending capitalism , they are explicit , and the President by attending Copenhagen gives credibility and credence to these folks and he should not go , ” said Paul .
After Paul had started attacking Obama ’s “ green ” agenda , CNN quickly cut away from his victory speech and began to talk over him .
Perhaps that ’s because Paul is perhaps the first person to address the fundamental threat that the global warming scam poses to the free world during such a major victory speech .
This marks a new watershed in how much the credibility of climate change alarmism has collapsed in the last six months alone .
Paul is right in citing Mugabe , Morales and Chavez as acolytes to the climate cause , but similar sentiments have been expressed far closer to home .
The agenda to use global warming fear mongering as a pretext to lower living standards in the west has openly been declared by top globalists over and over again – people like EU Commission chief Jose Manuel Barroso , who has called for a “ post - industrial revolution ” in which CO2 emissions are capped .
At the 2005 Bilderberg meeting sources inside the group told reporters Daniel Estulin and Jim Tucker , who have built up a credible reputation for accurately forecasting future events based on leaks from Bilderberg conferences , that the elite wanted to consolidate by bringing down the standard of living in the US and Europe , fearing that the middle class is out of control and has been granted too much credit which must be offset by a phase of consolidation .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Two years later we witnessed the beginning of the “ credit crunch ” which led to the massive economic turmoil of 2008 and 2009 which is now threatening to get even worse in 2010 .
The move towards a “ green economy ” is integral to this agenda of a “ post - industrial revolution ” in which living standards in the west are drastically cut .
Its impact is already being severely felt in Spain , where the unemployment rate is around 18 per cent as a result of 2.2 jobs being lost for every “ green ” job created .
A newly leaked internal document from Spain ’s Zapatero administration outlines how Spain ’s “ green economy initiatives ” have been a financial disaster .
The report suggests that the real rate of job losses as a result of “ green ” policies is in actual fact worse than 2.2 jobs lost for every one gained .
“ Today ’s leaked document reveals that even the socialist Spanish government now acknowledges the ruinous effects of green economic policy , ” reports Christopher Horner .
“ Despite the soft - pedaling , the document reveals exactly why electricity rates “ necessarily skyrocketed ” in Spain , as did the public debt needed to underwrite the disaster .
This internal assessment preceded the Zapatero administration ’s recent acknowledgement that the “ green economy ” stunt must be abandoned , lest the experiment risk Spain becoming Greece . ”
President Obama has made it a foundation of his economic and environmental policy that America moves towards a similar “ green economy , ” which would spell disaster for the fragile U.S. economy and potentially trigger a new great depression .
The fact that Rand Paul has rightly highlighted this issue as a major concern , allied with the leaked Spanish report , should act as a crushing blow to efforts on behalf of internationalists to impose such tyranny on every western nation in the form of a carbon tax on the very substance humans exhale .

Russia 's top energy official said he expected BP chief executive Tony Hayward to step down soon , ahead of a meeting with him in Moscow later today .
" We know that Tony Hayward is leaving his position and he will introduce his successor , " Igor Sechin told reporters ahead of his meeting with the embattled BP boss .
Sechin , Russia 's deputy prime minister and the chairman of the country 's biggest oil company Rosneft , was responding to a question about what would be discussed at the meeting .
BP denied that Hayward was close to resigning .
" Tony Hayward remains the chief executive of BP .
There are no plans for him to resign , " a spokeswoman said .
Sechin is a close ally of Russia 's prime minister Vladimir Putin , and the leader – at least unofficially – of the Kremlin 's hardline siloviki faction made up of former KGB officers .
A one - time Soviet military intelligence agent , Sechin presides over an impeccable network of sources , both formal and clandestine , all across the oil industry .
His comments about Tony Hayward 's imminent departure from BP are unlikely to have been made by accident .
The reports further boosted BP 's shares , already up this morning on hopes that the oil giant will be able to plug the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico earlier than thought , to 311.9 p , a gain of 7.3 p or 2.4 % .
On Friday the shares crashed to a 14 - year low of 304 p , down over 6 % .
More than £ 60bn has been wiped off the company 's market value since the rig explosion on 20 April .
Hayward 's visit to Moscow is the first since the oil spill , and comes amid Kremlin worries over BP 's future .
Its Russian venture TNK - BP is responsible for a quarter of BP 's global oil output .
The Russian ambassador to Britain has said his government wants guarantees from BP that the venture would not be affected by its growing bill for the oil spill .
BP said this morning it was now spending $ 100 m ( £ 66 m ) a day on efforts to contain and clean up the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , bringing its total bill to $ 2.65 bn so far .
The oil giant spent $ 300 m on containing the oil spill in the past three days .
Its total bill is up from Friday 's figure of $ 2.35 bn .
That includes the cost of trying to cap the well , clean up the environmental damage caused by the leak and pay compensation to those affected .
BP has paid out more than $ 128 m to fishermen and others .
BP said today it remained on track to complete its relief well , which is designed to kill the leaking well , within the three months envisaged in May .
But according to reports , the company is now hoping to seal the well by mid-July , rather than early August .
There was more good news as the US National Hurricane Centre in Miami said that tropical storm Alex , which has pounded parts of Central America and is heading towards Mexico 's Caribbean coast , was likely to strike well away from the area where BP is trying to stop the oil leak .
Barack Obama and David Cameron said that the oil giant should " remain a strong and stable company " after meeting to discuss the environmental disaster on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Toronto .
A war tells a people terrible truths about itself .
That is why it is so difficult to listen .
We were determined to avoid an honest look at the first Gaza war .
Now , in international waters and having opened fire on an international group of humanitarian aid workers and activists , we are fighting and losing the second .
For Israel , in the end , this Second Gaza War could be far more costly and painful than the first .

In going to war in Gaza in late 2008 , Israeli military and political leaders hoped to teach Hamas a lesson .
They succeeded .
Hamas learned that the best way to fight Israel is to let Israel do what it has begun to do naturally : bluster , blunder , stonewall , and fume .
Hamas , and no less , Iran and Hezbollah , learned early on that Israel 's own embargo against Hamas - ruled Gaza was the most sophisticated and powerful weapon they could have deployed against the Jewish state .
Here in Israel , we have still yet to learn the lesson :
We are no longer defending Israel .
We are now defending the siege .
The siege itself is becoming Israel 's Vietnam .
Of course , we knew this could happen .
On Sunday , when the army spokesman began speaking of a Gaza - bound aid flotilla in terms of an attack on Israel , MK Nahman Shai , the IDF chief spokesman during the 1991 Gulf war , spoke publicly of his worst nightmare , an operation in which Israeli troops , raiding the flotilla , might open fire on peace activists , aid workers and Nobel laureates .
Likud MK Miri Regev , who also once headed the IDF Spokesman 's Office , said early Monday that the most important thing now was to deal with the negative media reports quickly , so they would go away .
But they are not going to go away .
One of the ships is named for Rachel Corrie , killed while trying to bar the way of an IDF bulldozer in Gaza seven years ago .
Her name , and her story , have since become a lightning rod for pro-Palestinian activism .
Perhaps most ominously , in a stepwise , lemming - like march of folly in our relations with Ankara , a regional power of crucial importance and one which , if heeded , could have helped head off the First Gaza War , we have come dangerously close to effectively declaring a state of war with Turkey .
" This is going to be a very large incident , certainly with the Turks , " said Benjamin Ben-Eliezer , the cabinet minister with the most sensitive sense of Israel 's ties with the Muslim world .
We explain , time and again , that we are not at war with the people of Gaza .
We say it time and again because we ourselves need to believe it , and because , deep down , we do not .
There was a time , when it could be said that we knew ourselves only in wartime .
No longer .
Now we know nothing .
Yet another problem with refraining from talks with Hamas and Iran :
They know us so much better than we know ourselves .
They know , as the song about the Lebanon War suggested ( " Lo Yachol La'atzor Et Zeh " ) that we , unable to see ourselves in any clarity , are no longer capable of stopping ourselves .
Hamas , as well as Iran , have come to know and benefit from the toxicity of Israeli domestic politics , which is all too ready to mortgage the future for the sake of a momentary apparent calm .
They know that in our desperation to protect our own image of ourselves , we will avoid modifying policies which have literally brought aid and comfort to our enemies , in particular Hamas , which the siege on Gaza has enriched through tunnel taxes and entrenched through anger toward Israel .
For many on the right , it must be said , there will be a quiet joy in all of what is about to hit the fan .
" We told you so , " the crowing will begin .
" The world hates us , no matter what we do .
So we may as well go on building [ Read : ' Settling the West Bank and East Jerusalem ' ] and defending our borders [ Read : ' Bolster Hamas and ultimately harm ourselves by refusing to lift the Gaza embargo ' ] . "
Hamas , Iran and the Israeli and Diaspora hard right know , as one , that this is a test of enormous importance for Benjamin Netanyahu .
Keen to have the world focus on Iran and the threat it poses to the people of Israel , Netanyahu must recognize that the world is now focused on Israel and the threat it poses to the people of Gaza .
What can you do with only food and plastic boxes ?
Probably not much unless you ’re one of these Bento box meal artist .
So cool I almost do n’t want to eat them .
The war money could be used for schools , bridges , or paying everyone 's mortgage payments for a whole year .
It could be used to end federal income taxes on every American 's first $ 35,000 of income , as my bill , the War Is Making You Poor Act , does .
It could be used to close the yawning deficit , supply health care to the unemployed , or for any other human and humane purpose .
Instead , it will be used for war .
Because , as Orwell predicted in 1984 , we 've reached the point where everyone thinks that we 've always been at war with Eastasia .
Why ?
Not because Al Qaeda was sheltered in Iraq .
It was n't .
And not because Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan .
It is n't .
Bush could never explain why we went to war in Iraq , and Obama can't explain why we are ‘ escalating ' in Afghanistan .
So , why ?
Why spend $ 1 trillion on a long , bloody nine - year campaign with no justifiable purpose ?
Remember 9/11 , the day that changed everything ?
That was almost a decade ago .
Bush 's response was to mire us in two bloody wars , wars in which we are still stuck today .
Why ?
I can't answer that question .
But I do have an alternative vision of how the last 10 years could have played out .
Imagine if we had decided after 9/11 to wean ourselves off oil and other carbon - based fuels .
We 'd be almost ten years into that project by now .
Imagine if George W. Bush had somehow been able to summon the moral strength of Mahatma Gandhi , Helen Keller , or Martin Luther King Jr , and committed the American people to the pursuit of a common goal of a transformed society , a society which meets our own human needs rather than declaring " war " on an emotion , or , as John Quincy Adams put it , going " abroad , in search of monsters to destroy " .
Imagine .
Imagine that we chose not to enslave ourselves to a massive military state whose stated goal is " stability " in countries that never have been " stable " , and never will be .
Imagine .
" Imagine all the people , living life in peace . "
Sign up to end these wars .

Does California gubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman 's violent temper and bullying behavior run in the family ?
The billionaire ex-eBay CEO 's son was charged with felony battery for breaking a woman 's ankle after her friend said " Fuck you " and " Fuck your fraternity . "
A 22 - year - old woman named Valerie Sanchez was riding a bus to Palo Alto's Blue Chalk Cafe on the night of May 26 , 2006 when she crossed paths with Griffith Rutherford Harsh V , Meg 's eldest son and a notoriously delinquent sophomore at Princeton at the time .
According to a police report filed later that night , Sanchez and her friends had mocked his fraternity and said " fuck you " and " fuck your fraternity " to him before Sanchez swiped Griff 's baseball cap off his head .
The altercation escalated when both parties arrived at Blue Chalk Cafe .
According to Valerie 's statement to the police , they were inside the bar when Griff " pushed " her " with two open hands on her chest and shoulder area . "
She fell down and felt her right ankle " snap . "
A nearby security guard witnessed the event and corroborated Valerie 's version of the events .
In Griff 's version , Valerie pushed him with two open hands , then stumbled and fell .
But after being rushed to Stanford Hospital 's emergency room , Valerie told police she had " absolutely not " attacked Griff physically , beyond the portentous baseball cap snatch .
She was certain that 6 ' 1 " , 195 - lb .
Griff had shoved her " deliberately . "
Griff was charged with felony battery .
The paperwork from his arrest identify him as " clean shaven " white man with a " hair style " of " punk . "
The next morning , Meg Whitman , Griff 's mother and then the CEO of eBay , posted Griff 's $ 25,000 bail with a cashier 's check and brought her son home .
Nine court dates followed over the next year , but the charges were ultimately dismissed , although it 's unclear why .
We attempted to speak with Griff by phone , but he hung up on us .
Meg Whitman 's campaign did n't respond to our messages .
The lawyer who handled Griff 's case said he was not authorized to respond to our questions .
A call to the alleged victim , Valerie Sanchez , was not returned .
This was n't Griff 's only brush with trouble .
The Blue Chalk Cafe brawl occurred after his sophomore year at Princeton .
Though he originally member of the class of 2008 , he ended up graduating in 2009 after a year - long disciplinary probation , classmates say .
Griff 's disciplinary problems allegedly resulted in the university banning him from living on campus — an ironic punishment given that , at the same time , Princeton was using a $ 30 million donation from Meg Whitman to build splashy residential living complex Whitman College .
And both Griff and his younger brother William earned reputations on campus for using their " billionaire " status to act inappropriately as they navigated Princeton 's boozy eating club scene .
A political newcomer , Meg Whitman did n't register to vote until seven years ago because , she says , she " was focused on raising a family , on my husband 's career , and we moved many , many times . "
Her husband 's career went well — he 's currently a neurosurgeon at Stanford — as did hers , clearly :
Thanks to her stint running eBay , she earned a spot on Forbes ' 2008 list of " World Billionaires , " which listed her net worth as $ 1.3 billion .
It 's a fortune she 's now using to finance her political career , having set aside $ 90 million of her own money to line her campaign 's coffers .
As for " raising a family , " Meg 's sons are now grown : After graduating from Princeton in 2009 , Griff now works for Romney family - operated financial firm Solamere Capital , which worked as " campaign consultants " for Whitman 's campaign .
Little brother Will Harsh will be a Princeton senior next year and appears poised to follow in his older brother 's delinquent footsteps : Rumor has it Griff 's elite eating club banned Will for using the N - word at a party .
The police report and court documents are below :

In response to the BP's Deepwater Horizon disaster , President Obama has launched a 6 month moratorium on new deepwater exploration contracts and other oil drilling restrictions .
But China is n't stopping .
Just this month , state - owned Chinese companies have signed contracts worth over $ 50 billion in Canada , Brazil , Argentina , Iraq , Venezuela , and Nigeria .
Most deal include an export clause , locking down energy supplies for the growing Chinese economy .
If America 's demand ever increases , these deals would present a serious problem .
And Beijing has no qualms about offshore drilling .

BMW has pulled the sheet off the Jeff Koons art car and we have to say we like it .
A lot .
Our own Tony Borroz , who knows quite a lot about art , mercilessly beat up on Koons when BMW announced he'd be joining the likes of Ernst Fuchs , Roy Lichtenstein and Frank Stella in designing one of the company 's famed art cars .
Borroz called Koons a " talent - bereft hack " and quoted Mark Stevens of The New Republic , who once called Koons “ another of those who serve the tacky rich . ”
Turns out Koons did a very nice job .
First , a little history .
Bayerische Motoren Werke has since 1975 occasionally invited artists to use its cars as canvases .
The result has been some striking vehicles , like the M1 Group 4 racer Andy Warhol painted in 1979 , by some immensely talented people .
The collection had grown to 17 BMW Art Cars before BMW tapped Koons to paint a BMW M3 GTS that will compete in the 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 12 .
Koons collected and studied pictures of race cars and explosions and joined the BMW Rahal Letterman Racing team for a few laps at Sebring .
He then drew from a palette of bright colors .
The bold streaks make the car look fast even when sitting still .
" These race cars are lifelike , they are powerful and there is a lot of energy , " Koons said in a statement .
" You can participate with it , add to it and let yourself transcend with its energy .
There is a lot of power under that hood and I want to let my ideas transcend with the car – it's really to connect with that power . "
That theme continues out back , where blasting debris surrounded by two circles evoke supersonic acceleration .
The design is n't actually painted on the car ; it 's a vinyl wrap covered with two layers of clear coat .
BMW says the wrap was lighter than paint and it could be applied much more quickly .
That was a key consideration because Koons had just two months to complete the project .
Designing the vinyl wrap required translating the car 's CAD designs from 3 - D to 2 - D for printing , then applying the vinyl to the bodywork and various spare parts .
We 've got a friend who has an E30 M3 that would look great done up like this .
Koons has wanted to design an art car since 2003 , when he first approached BMW about the idea .
BMW gave him the nod earlier this year , and the car was unveiled Tuesday at Centre Pompidou in Paris , the same place where Lichtenstein unveiled his art car in 1977 .

Apple CEO Steve Jobs Live at D8 : All We Want to Do is Make Better Products
Much has happened since Apple CEO Steve Jobs last appeared on the D stage .
At that time , in May 2007 , the iPhone had not yet arrived at market , the app ecosystem it would usher in was still gestating and the iPad was simply a long - running rumor .
So the conversation onstage focused largely on the iPod , iTunes and Apple ’s ( AAPL ) relationship with the music industry , and the forthcoming launch of the iPhone .
A few months earlier , Jobs had penned a widely read open letter , “ Thoughts on Music , ” calling on the “ big four ” music companies to sell their music without digital rights management .
iTunes was already the world ’s largest online music distribution system , so his thoughts generated quite a bit of discussion–and a fair bit of controversy .
Today , the iPhone is nearly three years old .
It has sold 50 million units worldwide , and the multitouch interface and app ecosystem it pioneered have arguably revolutionized the smartphone industry .
Today , the iPad is no longer a rumor .
Launched just two months ago , it has already sold two million units and seems poised to revolutionize an industry or two of its own .
And today , Jobs is once again shaking up an industry with another open letter , “ Thoughts on Flash , ” a withering rumination on Adobe ’s ( ADBE )
Flash platform and the future of online video .
Much has changed in three years .
But one thing has remained constant : Apple , under Jobs , continues to drive innovation in every industry it touches .

5:54 pm : In a few moments , Steve Jobs will once again take the D stage for the opening session of D8 .
6:21 pm : Following a welcome from News Corp. ( NWS ) CEO Rupert Murdoch and a few introductory remarks from Walt and Kara , the pair welcome Jobs to the stage .
6:22 pm : The first question is about Apple surpassing Microsoft in market valuation .
Jobs says
“ It ’s surreal , but it does n’t really mean anything . ”
6:23 pm Walt references Jobs ’s recent “ Thoughts on Flash ” essay .
Even if everything you say is true , is it really fair to consumers to be so abrupt and cut them off , he asks ?
Jobs does n’t seem to think it ’s unfair .
“ Apple is a company that does n’t have the most resources in the world , and they way we ’ve succeeded is to bet the right technological horse , to look at technologies that have a future .
We try to pick things that are in their springs .
And if you choose wisely , you can be quite successful . ”
Apple has a history of doing that , Jobs says , noting that Apple was the first company to dump the floppy and later , to adopt USB .
“ Sometimes when we get rid of things , people call us crazy … .
But sometimes you just have to pick the things that are going to be the right horse to ride forward … .
And Flash has had it ’s day … but HTML5 is starting emerge … .
The video looks better and it works better and you do n’t need a plug - in to run it .
And while 75 percent of the video on the Web may be available in Flash , a lot of it is available in HTML5 as well . ”
6:29 pm : What about developers , asks Walt .
How are they impacted ?
Jobs draws a quick parallel to Apple ’s HyperCard .
“ HyperCard was huge in its day , ” he says , going on to note that the thousands of apps on the iPhone OS platform are testament to developer involvement .
6:31 pm : Jobs : “ We did n’t set out to have a war over Flash .
We made a technical decision .
And it was n’t until the iPad that Adobe raised a stink .
They came after us … .
That ’s why I wrote “ Thoughts on Flash . ” … We were getting tired of being trashed by Adobe in the press . ”
6:32 pm : Walt :
What if people demand Flash .
What if they say the iPad is crippled without Flash .
“ We ’re just trying to make great products , ” says Jobs again .
“ We do n’t think Flash makes a great product , so we ’re leaving it out .
Instead , we ’re going to focus on technologies that are in ascendancy .
If we succeed , people will buy them and if we do n’t they wo n’t … .
And , so far , I have to say , people seem to be liking the iPad .
We are selling an iPad every 3 seconds . ”
6:35 pm : Ah !
The inevitable lost - iPhone question .
Walt quickly recounts the history of the discovery of the iPhone prototype , its revelation on Gizmodo and the subsequent police investigation that involved the seizure of a blogger ’s computers .
Where do you come down on this , asks Walt .
“ To make a wireless product work well , you have to test it .
And one of our employees was carrying one and there ’s a debate about whether it was left in a bar or stolen … .
And the person who found it decided to sell it …and it turned out this person plugged it into his roommate ’s computer and that roommate called the police . ”
6:40 pm : Jobs continues , “ And the police showed up and took this guy ’s computers … and the DA is investigating it … and I do n’t know where it will end up . ”
In other words , it ’s a police matter .
That said , Jobs is very clearly irked by the whole debacle .
6:40 pm : Any comments on the Foxconn suicides which we ’ve been hearing so much about , asks Kara .
Apple is extraordinarily diligent and rigorous about vetting its manufacturing partners , Jobs answers .
“ Foxconn is not a sweatshop , ” he adds .
“ They ’ve got restaurants and swimming pools … .
For a factory , it ’s a pretty nice factory . ”
6:42 pm : Jobs notes that the recent suicides at Foxconn , which number 13 at last count , I think , are still below the national average in the U.S.
“ But this is very troubling to us , ” he says .
“ So we send over our own people and some outside folks as well , to look into the issue . ”
6:44 pm : Walt :
You spent a significant portion of your career involved in a platform war with Microsoft ( MSFT ) .
And you lost .
But now there are new platforms out there and you ’re doing quite well on them , as are others –Google ( GOOG ) and Facebook .
So there ’s a new platform war going on .
Do you see it like that ?
No , we do n’t see ourselves in a platform war says Jobs .
“ We never saw ourselves in a platform war with Microsoft , either … Maybe that ’s why we lost . …
But we never thought of ourselves in a platform war ; we just wanted to make good products . ”
And what about Google , asks Walt .
The relationship has clearly changed there , has n’t it ?
“ Well , they ’re competing with us , ” says Jobs , referring to the mobile space .
“ We did n’t go into search . ”
6:47 pm : Kara :
How do you look at Google as a competitor ?
Eric [ Schmidt , Google CEO ] was on your board .
Jobs : “ They decided to compete with us and got more and more serious . ”
Walt circles back , asking if Jobs does n’t feel betrayed by Google .
Jobs , clearly not buying in to this line of questioning , parries : “ My sex life is great , how ’s yours ” he says trying to end it .
6:50 pm : Kara asks if Apple might remove Google from the iPhone and iPad .
Jobs says no .
Again , he notes that Apple is simply trying to make the best products it can and that the market will decide whose is better .
“ Right now , we have the better product . ”
6:52 pm : Walt wonders why Apple bought Siri , a search company .
“ I do n’t know if I would describe Siri as a search company , ” Jobs says .
“ They ’re not in the search area … they ’re in the AI area . ”
Then he adds , a bit vehemently : “ We ’re not going into search . ”
6:53 pm : Walt asks about AT&T ( T ) , whose network continues to face criticism .
Jobs :
They ’re doing pretty good in some ways and in others they could do better .
We meet with them once a quarter .
Remember , they deal with way more data traffic than anyone else .
And they ’re having trouble .
But they have the fastest 3G network and they ’re improving .
I wish they were improving faster ….
I ’m convinced that any other network , had you put the iPhone on it , would have had the same problems .
6:56 pm : Jobs continues :
We found a way to sell the phone that we wanted to sell and to define it the way we wanted to define it .
We were able to change the rules of the game , and that ’s what got us excited about the phone business … .
AT&T took a big leap on us and decided they were going to trust us to do the right thing with the phone .
And that ’s worked out quite well for both of us .
6:59 pm : The conversation moves to talk of tablets .
Walt asks if Apple knew it would build a tablet before it built the iPhone .
Jobs : “ I ’ll tell you a secret .
It began with the tablet .
I had this idea about having a glass display , a multitouch display you could type on with your fingers .
I asked our people about it .
And six months later , they came back with this amazing display .
And I gave it to one of our really brilliant UI guys .
He got [ rubber band ] scrolling working and some other things , and I thought , ‘ my God , we can build a phone with this !’
So we put the tablet aside , and we went to work on the iPhone . ”
7:01 pm : What does the iPad mean for the publishing industry , Kara asks .
Is it the savior that some are touting it as ?
“ One of my beliefs very strongly is that any democracy depends on a free , healthy press , and so when I think of the most important journalistic endeavors in this country , I think of things like the Washington Post , the New York Times , The Wall Street Journal and publications like that , ” Jobs replies .
“ And we all know what ’s happened to the economics of those businesses .
I do n’t want to see us descend into a nation of bloggers .
Anything that we can do to help the news - gathering organizations find new ways of expression so that they can afford to keep their news - gathering and editorial operations intact , I ’m all for . ”
7:03 pm : Jobs adds that he believes people are willing to pay for content and that content providers are not pricing their offerings as aggressively as they should .
7:05 pm : When you did your presentation on the iPad , you described it as a new category of device , says Walt .
But in order for it to succeed , people have to feel that it ’s worth carrying around .
Do you think the tablet will succeed the laptop , he asks .
Jobs : “ When we were an agrarian nation , all cars were trucks , because that ’s what you needed on the farm .
But as vehicles started to be used in the urban centers , cars got more popular .
Innovations like automatic transmission and power steering and things that you did n’t care about in a truck as much started to become paramount in cars . …
PCs are going to be like trucks .
They ’re still going to be around , they ’re still going to have a lot of value , but they ’re going to be used by one out of X people . …
I think that we ’re embarked on that .
Is the next step the iPad ?
Who knows ?
Will it happen next year or five years from now or seven years from now ?
Who knows ?
But I think we ’re headed in that direction . ”
7:10 pm : What are your thoughts on content creation on the iPad , Walt asks , noting that some people believe tablets are n’t good devices for content creation .
“ Well , why would n’t they be good for content creation , ” asks Jobs .
“ It ca n’t be that the software is n’t powerful enough , because the software is improving … .
These devices over time are going to grow to do new things .
…
You know , people laugh at me because I use the phrase “ magical ” to describe the iPad .
But it ’s what I really think .
You have a much more direct and intimate relationship with the Internet and media , your apps , your content .
It ’s like some intermediate thing has been removed and stripped away . ….
I think we ’re just scratching the surface on the kind of apps we can build for it .
I think one can create a lot of content on the tablet . ”
What sorts of apps , asks Kara .
Productivity apps …video - editing software , says Jobs .
7:12 pm : Now a question about App Store rejections :
Is n’t there a downside to Apple ’s efforts to protect its customers from porn , malware , etc .
In reply , Jobs first notes that Apple , by supporting HTML5 , supports a completely open platform .
But it also supports a curated platform–iPhone OS .
And that platform has rules .
“ We approve 95 percent of the apps that are submitted to the App Store every week and we approve them within in seven days . ”
So what happened with that political - cartoon app you declined to approve a few weeks ago , asks Walt .
“ We have a rule that says you ca n’t defame people , ” says Jobs , noting that political cartoonists by virtue of their profession sometimes defame people .
The cartoon app was rejected on those grounds , he adds .
“ Then we changed the rules …and in the meantime , the cartoonist won a Pulitzer … .
But he never resubmitted his app .
And then someone asked him , ‘ Hey why do n’t you have an iPhone app ? ’
He says we rejected it and suddenly , it ’s a story in the press … .
Bottom line is , yes , we sometimes make mistakes … but we correct them … .
We are doing the best we can , changing the rules when it makes sense .
What happens sometimes is that some people lie , we find it , and reject it , and they run to the press , and get their 15 minutes of fame and hope it will get us to change our minds .
We take it on the chin , and we move on . ”
7:20 pm : Kara : “ What do you do all day ? ”
Jobs : “ I have one of the best jobs in the world .
I get to hang out with some of the most talented , committed people around and together we get to play in this sandbox and build these cool products ….
Apple is an incredibly collaborative company .
You know how many committees we have at Apple ?
Zero .
We ’re structured like a start - up .
We ’re the biggest start - up on the planet .
And we all meet once a week to discuss our business … and there ’s tremendous teamwork at the top and that filters down to the other employees … and so what I do all day is meet with teams of people and work on ideas and new problems to come up with new products . ”
7:24 pm : Are people willing to tell you that you ’re wrong , asks Walt .
Of course , Jobs answers .
The best ideas have to win , no matter who has them .
7:25 pm : What do you imagine the next 10 years of your life is going to be about ?
Oddly Jobs replies with a comment about Gizmodo and the lost iPhone prototype .
“ When this whole thing with Gizmodo happened , I got a lot of advice from people who said you ’ve got to just let it slide … you should n’t go after a journalist because they bought stolen property and tried to extort you … .
And I thought about that and I decided that Apple ca n’t afford to change its core values and simply let it slide … .
We have the same core values as when we started , and we come into work wanting to do the same thing today that we wanted to do five years ago . ”
7:27 pm : But you are going into new businesses , says Walt , trying to redirect Jobs back to the question at hand or at least get him to comment on any new markets that the company is eyeing .
Advertising , for example , with its new iAds initiative .
Jobs concedes that Apple is pursuing new businesses like iAds .
But he suggests the main reason it ’s doing that is to make its developers more money .
“ We want to help our developers make some money so that they can keep providing free or really low - cost apps to customers , ” he says .
“ That ’s why we ’re doing it .
We ’re not going to make much money in the ad business . ”
7:29 pm : Jobs continues on the mobile advertising theme .
“ Something really interesting is happening on mobile phones , ” he says .
“ They ’re not mirroring desktops or laptop PCs .
If people want to find out what restaurant to go to , they ’re not going to their search engine typing in “ Japanese ” and “ Palo Alto , ” they ’re going to Yelp or whatever app they want .
Ads in mobile apps today , you touch them , and what is the first thing they do ?
They rip you out of your app , send you to the browser and then you ’ve got to figure out a way back to your app .
So , would n’t it be great if mobile ads did n’t take you out of the app , but rather took over the screen , gave you this great experience of an interactive ad , but anytime you wanted you could hit a little button that takes you right back to where you left off in your app ?
We figured out we could build something like this into the operating system so the apps do n’t have to do it .
We can make it so that an app developer can add these interactive ads in their apps with 30 minutes ’ worth of work versus working with every advertiser to do some custom thing in their app , which is crazy . ”
7:31 pm : A question about privacy .
Is privacy looked at differently in Silicon Valley than in the rest of the world ?
“ We ’ve always had a very different view of privacy than some of our colleagues in the Valley , ” Jobs says .
“ We take privacy extremely seriously .
That ’s one of the reasons we have the curated apps store .
We have rejected a lot of apps that want to take a lot of your personal data and suck it up into the cloud .
Privacy means people know what they ’re signing up for .
In plain English , and repeatedly , that ’s what it means .
Ask them .
Ask them every time .
Make them tell you to stop asking if they get tired of your asking them .
Let them know precisely what you ’re going to do with their data . ”
Q&A
Q : Given the events of the past few years , what would you add to the Stanford graduation speech you gave a few years ago ?
A : I ’ve no idea .
I ’d probably just turn up the volume a little bit because the past few years have reminded me how precious life is .
Q : I ’d like you to put your Disney hat on for a moment … .
How do you preserve the value of content ?
A : The way that we market movies is undergoing a radical shift .
It used to be that you spent a fortune on advertising on TV running your trailers .
But now you can advertise on the Web … .
When we went to the music companies , we said “ who is your customer ? ”
And they said , “ Best Buy , Tower ” … their distribution partners .
But that was n’t their customer .
They needed to recognize who their true customer was … .
So what changed in the music business was not the back end , but the front end .
The way that you market to the consumer … .
The film industry needs to embrace that .
And it needs to let people watch the content they want to watch , when they want to watch it and where they want to watch it . ”
Q : A complaint about dropped calls on AT&T ’s networks .
Is someone from Apple working on that ?
A : You can bet we ’re doing everything we can do ….
I can tell you what I ’m told by reliable people :
To make things better , people reallocate spectrum and they do things like increasing backhaul and they put in more robust switches …and things in general , when they start to fix them , get worse before they get better …and if you believe that , things should be getting a lot better real soon .
Q : How is HDCP helping the antipiracy effort ?
A : We did n’t invent the stuff .
The problem is that Hollywood does n’t want what happened to the music industry to happen to them .
You ca n’t blame them .
But content protection is n’t their business and they ’re grasping at straws here .
But we ’ve got to deal with their restrictions ….
I feel your pain .
Q : What ’s your vision of social gaming ?
A : Clearly , iPhone and iPod touch have created a new class of gaming and it ’s a subset of casual gaming , but it ’s surprising how good the games are .
Typical console games cost $ 40 , but on the iPhone , they cost somewhere between free and $ 10 , and gaming on the platform is taking off .
We ’re trying to do the right things to enable more gaming and social gaming .
Q : Is it time to throw out the interface for TV ?
Does television need a new human interface .
A : The problem with innovation in the TV industry is the go - to - market strategy .
The TV industry has a subsidized model that gives everyone a set top box for free .
So no one wants to buy a box .
Ask TiVo , ask Roku , ask us… ask Google in a few months .
The television industry fundamentally has a subsidized business model that gives everyone a set - top box , and that pretty much undermines innovation in the sector .
The only way this is going to change is if you start from scratch , tear up the box , redesign and get it to the consumer in a way that they want to buy it .
But right now , there ’s no way to do that ….
The TV is going to lose until there ’s a viable go - to - market strategy .
That ’s the fundamental problem with the industry .
It ’s not a problem with the technology , it ’s a problem with the go - to - market strategy … .
I ’m sure smarter people than us will figure this out , but that ’s why we say Apple TV is a hobby .

Ahead of elections in the Palestinian Authority , Fatah appears split in two as its central committee mulled presenting the public with two different sets of rosters Sunday .
Less than a year after calling for younger blood in the movement , today 's Fatah seems more concerned with keeping the party from shattering into various movements .
On Saturday its central committee attempted to contain the anarchy that many believe will erupt in Nablus .
Following the dismantlement of Nablus 's city council , which was previously presided over by Hamas , Fatah plans to present the leader of its Revolutionary Council , Amin Makboul , as a candidate .
But his adversary is also a member of Fatah , Ghassan Shakaa , who served as Nablus mayor two terms ago , before Hamas took control .
In addition to the inter - party split , some Fatah members are now claiming that the movement 's central committee was formed illegally and its decisions void , because a number of its members were elected fraudulently .
The members making this claim say that aside from the election of President Mahmoud Abbas to the movement 's chair , all other decisions made by the council are tainted with serious corruption that could end up leaving the movement vulnerable to hostile influences .
On the surface , this sounds like great news ... well , as great as news can be in the face of an environmental catastrophe :
BP PLC said Monday that it will pay for all the cleanup costs from a massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico that could continue spewing crude for at least another week .
But what does that really mean ?
Energy giant BP vowed Monday to pay " all necessary and appropriate clean - up costs " from the US oil pollution disaster in the Gulf of Mexico .
And what is necessary and appropriate ?
According to BP CEO Tony Hayward :
This was n’t our accident .
This was a drilling rig operated by another company .
It was their people .
Their systems .
Their processes .
We are responsible not for the accident , but we are responsible for the oil , and for dealing with it and cleaning the situation up ...
We ’re responsible for the oil and cleaning it .
We are responsible to deal with the oil , contain it on the surface , and clean it up .
Does this mean that necessary and appropriate responsibility starts and stops with what 's on the surface ?
Is BP trying to limit their liability from the real environmental and economic impact ... that which happens below the surface and on the shore ?
Old news in the world of surveillance and spookery today , as the original 1946 secret treaty between the UK and US which set up the famous " Echelon " listening system is finally published .
The UKUSA agreement , drafted to formalise intel - sharing arrangements which had developed during World War II , formed the basis for the US - British ( and later , other nations ) partnership against the Warsaw Pact through the Cold War .
The treaty dealt primarily with communications intercept information , known as signals intelligence or " sigint " .
Back in the early days of UKUSA cooperation , many long - distance or international phone calls were carried by longhaul HF radio , and were comparatively easily intercepted by a worldwide network of listening posts .
Later on , it is widely believed , the allied Echelon capabilities - by now mostly being provided by the US , with useful access being supplied by Britain and other nations - became able to monitor huge numbers of calls automatically , with chosen key words or phrases flagging up a given conversation for investigation by human operators .
Now released along with the Treaty itself are some intercept products garnered up to the year 1949 .
The cooperative publication of British files from GCHQ and other organisations has already occurred courtesy of the National Archives , here .
The American end of the publications will go live on the NSA website at 3 pm UK time today . ®
History
Issues concerning rifles , stopping power , compact design and firepower have been discussed within the armed community for decades .
Recently , concerns have been expressed concerning the stopping ability of the 5.56X45 mm round .
Some in the line of fire have opted for the 7.62X51 round as an answer to increase the chances of stopping an opponent .
Until now , the 7.62X51 round has only been available in larger and heavier battle weapons .
The usual choices are M14 ( or commercial M1A equivalent ) , FN / FAL , and the H&K G3 ( HK91 commercial equivalent ) .
Recently , some manufacturers have worked on Shorties of these designs , including the DSA OSW and HK G3K .
Obvious issues include reliable cycling as well as controllability in full automatic mode .
One entry which is just now becoming available is the M14K .
The Rifle
The m14 K is essentially a standard M14 with an extensively modified gas system permitting the use of a barrel as short as 13 inches .
In the K configuration , the weapon is reliable accurate , and easily controllable in semiautomatic of full automatic fire .
Functionally , it is a small box magazine fed M60GPMG .
Initial development efforts centered on utilizing the gas system from the M60 GPMG .
Smith soon discovered that much better solution was to fabricate the gas system from scratch .
The M14K has been around since the mid 1980s .
Ron Smith ( Smith Enterprise , Inc. ) built the systems originally sold by Tim LaFrance .
In Smith built several thousand of these rifles in the 1980s for the Colombian government to use in drug interdiction .
Smith has also been involved in building and shooting M14 type rifles for years .
In addition to his military experience and duty on several army marksmanship units , Smith is a 4th generation armorer who learned his trade in his father ’s shop at the hands of old Hungarian and German master machinists .
Smith was also invited to the Israeli Sniper School ( where ) in ( 1986 ) based on his ability to build the M14 sniper systems .
Development of the M14 K system evolved into a custom designed system which is extremely reliable , accurate and easy to shoot in full automatic mode .
Finally , because the gas system bleeds off the burned gasses quickly , the gun generates less head under the handguard .
This means that it is much cooler to shoot , especially in full automatic mode .
Other changes from the standard M14 configuration include a Douglas medium weight air gauge barrel with a 1:10 four groove twist .
This faster twist fully stabilizes 168 gr.
Match ammo while still permitting F./A fire .
In the hands of a capable shooter , it is not unusual to hit rams on 500 meters silhouette range .
The 16 " version produces a bullet with 2460 fps muzzle velocity using M80 ball ammunition .
Technical notes :
The Douglas medium heavy air - gauge barrel has an M852 chamber and 1 in 10 four groove twist which fully stabilizes 168 gr bullets while still working fine with the 147 gr. M80 ball ammunition .
This shifts the balance slightly towards the muzzle which every high - power shooter know is preferable .
The rifle weights 9.5 - 10.0 lbs without magazine .
Standard sights are USGI , however , Smith recommends NM rear sights because the ½ MOA adjustment works better with the shortened sighting radius inherent on this weapon .
Of course , full NM sights are available .
Available with all match options including trigger and action improvements , full bedding , rear or double lugged and improved sights , including M1913 compliant rails for telescopic sights or supplementary lighting and / or laser designators .
Currently working on a synthetic stock and for qualified agencies , a folding stock version .
Disassembly
Cleaning is the same as for the standard M14 family of weapons .
Special instructions for M14 K will be detailed in the future .
If you know how to take down and clean an M14 , you already know most of what is necessary for the cleaning of the M14K .
The only difference is the gas system .
Because the piston is larger that the standard M!4 , cleaning of the gas system is easier .
Price for conversion of existing M1A or M14 is $ 3000 .
Everything except the receiver , bolt , trigger and op rod are replaced .
If you desire a complete gun , the price is increased accordingly .
The conversion comes with a lifetime warranty on all of the Smith parts and workmanship .
Because conversions are being made to existing rifles , no warranty is extended to the customer supplied parts .
In addition , not all M14 clones are the same .
Smith recommends rifles built up from Smith , Enterprise or LRB receivers .
Other receivers may require additional work .
Shooting impressions
Cyclic rate ~550 - 600 RPM
Controllable under full automatic fire is simply great .
The gun very stiff so accuracy is enhanced .
The gas system has a sleeve which stiffens everything .
This means it also shoots cool , even under FA .
We 've mentioned Glenn Beck 's upcoming book The Overton Window a little bit previously .
It appears to be a dumbed - down ( in an Ayn Randian way ) version of The Turner Diaries , as Will Bunch found :
Bunch reported that Beck told the gathering the story depicts the rise of a citizen ’s organization called the Founders Keepers , “ a group of people that just wo n’t give up . ”
What follows , Beck said , is “ a battle and a civil war , and life is upside - down planetwide . "
Yep .
Pretty much the identical plot as the novel that inspired The Order and the Oklahoma City bombing -- as well as a number of other violent far - right extremists .
Why , we can hardly await the results of Beck 's novel .
Already , we get to see the trailer his crack head team over Glenn Beck Inc. came up with .
Try not to break out in guffaws .
I dare you .
No , this is not the Stephen Colbert parody .
In fact , he does n't need to make one .
This is self - parody .
FWIW , this is n't Beck - written text .
These are lines taken from Rudyard Kipling 's poem , " The Gods of the Copybook Headings . "
( It 's a favorite of The Derb 's , too . )
Today on his radio show , after the folks at HuffPo observed that this was gobbledygook , Beck noted the early reaction to the trailer .
He said the book " will drive the left insane " .
Really ?
Or will it just establish yours , Glenn ?
Beck went on to explain that it's " art , " and the ad gives him a chance to teach us Philistines all about artistic endeavor .
Hooookay .
In 2000 , the Library of Congress started a pilot web archiving project focused on the presidential election .
After the Sept. 11 , terrorist attacks in 2001 , the pilot project expanded and eventually became a permanent fixture of our national archives .
Five full - time staff members orchestrate an open - source web crawler called Heretix to capture the Internet ’s content for future generations .
“ Part of it is the election question : What do we want to archive ? " says Abbie Grotke , a digital media project specialist on the Library of Congress ’s web archiving team .
“ We ca n’t easily identify what is the ‘ U.S. web . ’
We ca n’t just say we want to get everything that ’s ‘.com ’ or ‘.gov . ’
So we do have to do this selective process . ”
So what does the Library of Congress think is worth saving ?
Here are the portions of today ’s web your grandchildren will be able to access through the Library of Congress :
1. Twitter feeds — all of them
The Library of Congress announced in April that it would begin archiving Twitter feeds .
Some Twitter feeds had already been archived in the past as part of special projects — for instance , some tweets regarding the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor were included in the collection about Supreme Court changes .
But now Twitter has plans to donate their entire archive of public content .
Which means your tweets , my tweets , and Britney Spears ’s tweets will all become a part of the archives .
What is not yet clear , is exactly how all of these tweets will be used .
“ The point is not to provide a Twitter interface at the library that you can go in and use like they do on the current website , ” Grotke says .
“ There ’s talk of more of a researcher , data mining –type access to it .
We ’re still trying to figure out what that is exactly , but people probably wo n’t be able to go in and look for you specifically . ”
2. National Election Candidates ’ Internet Presences
The Library ’s web archive started with a project that documented an election , and much of its work continues to revolve around this topic .
The archive collects about 2,500 snapshots of websites during every election cycle .
“ A lot of what we do , particularly with the elections , goes away rather quickly , ” Grotke says .
“ If the candidate loses the election , their website disappears . ”
The archives include presidential , congressional , and even overseas elections .
The Library ’s foreign operations offices document elections in those regions .
Researchers of the future , for instance , will be able to see the web that surrounded the 2009 general elections in India and Indonesia .
3. Facebook Pages — A Selective Few
The web crawler often follows candidates ’ or congress people ’s websites to their public Facebook Pages .
While Facebook has made no Twitter - like deal to donate archives to the Library , sites on the social media platform inevitably come up while documenting major events .
Thus far , the Library has left it up to the author of the Page — not Facebook — to give permission to archive relevant pages .
“ The position that we ’ve taken so far is that the content we ’re archiving is actually owned by the site owner who put it up there , ” Grotke says .
“ We ’ve been asking permission of the original site owner . ”
So unless you ’re a national election candidate who has given permission , you probably do n’t have to worry about your grandchild stumbling across an embarrassing Facebook photo while doing archival research for his or her college thesis .
4. Notable Historical Events
The Library has also been archiving Congressional websites since 2002 .
The web archive team has collected websites regarding Supreme Court changes , the Sept. 11 , attacks , the 2005 papal transition , Hurricane Katrina , the Iraq war and the crisis in Darfur .
A full list of current projects is available here .
5. News Sites That Give Permission
Unlike libraries in some other countries , the Library of Congress has no legal mandate to preserve the web .
Therefore , the web archive team can’t collect everything they would like to without asking permission .
Because news sites and blogs earn money on their content , the Library needs to get consent before it includes their pages in the archives .
Grotke says that few news organizations that the web archive team contacts for permission ever respond , which means that not much of the content in the web archives comes from news sites .

THE past couple of years have not been private enterprise 's finest hour .
From the collapse of Lehman Brothers to the implosion of General Motors and Chrysler to BP 's oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico , one great firm after another that had boasted of making society richer has turned into an expensive liability for taxpayers at best or , at worst , a menace to the general prosperity or the environment .
You might expect this sequence of calamities to have made people sourer towards capitalism and friendlier to the state .
But in America , at least , you would be wrong .
Americans remain deeply wedded to the free - enterprise system .
Even after the collapse of Wall Street and all that has followed , an overwhelming majority of Americans say in opinion polls that they prefer capitalism to socialism .
Gallup found in January that 61 % had a positive view of capitalism and about the same percentage had a negative view of socialism .
In March last year the Pew Research Centre asked Americans whether they were better off in a free - market economy “ even though there may be severe ups and downs from time to time ” .
Seventy percent answered in the affirmative .
Most Americans also say their federal income taxes are too high .
Even those who favour higher taxes on the rich think the top rate should be 20 % or less .
If Americans will stand behind the free - enterprise system come what may , it makes sense for Barack Obama 's opponents to portray the president as a danger to it .
“ We are facing a ruthless secular - socialist machine that is alien to America 's history and traditions , ” bellows Newt Gingrich , the hero of the Republican victory of 1994 , as he flogs his latest book ( “ To Save America ” ) .
The Republicans are sure to do well in November 's mid-terms .
And yet Arthur Brooks , the president of the American Enterprise Institute , thinks defenders of capitalism need to do more .
They need , even in America , to remake the moral case for it .
Mr Brooks considers entrepreneurship central to American culture , maybe literally a part of its DNA ( thanks to all of those immigrants importing the gene that makes you get up and go ) .
His guess is that the country is divided about 70 % to 30 % in favour of free enterprise .
But he poses an intriguing question .
If that is true , how did a politician with as “ little regard for free enterprise ” as Mr Obama become president in the first place ?
The answer in his own book ( “ The Battle ” ) is that although America is a 70 - 30 nation in favour of free enterprise , the 30 % are firmly in charge .
How could that possibly be ?
Mr Brooks offers two explanations .
The first is that the 30 % coalition is led by people with undue influence : rich intellectuals , Hollywood types , media folk and university teachers .
Also in the mix that elected Mr Obama are blacks and Hispanics , who trust government more than white Americans do .
Second , for all America 's faith in capitalism , the economic calamity of 2008 helped the minority fool the majority into thinking that the crisis was caused by the private sector and that the state knew how to solve it .
In Mr Brooks 's opinion it was the other way round : the state 's social engineering ( in particular , government support for dodgy mortgages ) caused the crisis , and its “ remedies ” will only make matters worse .
To save capitalism in the years to come Mr Brooks wants to persuade Americans all over again that a free - enterprise system is not only more efficient than socialism but morally superior as well .
He has an elegant theory about this .
Neither state - engineered equality of income , nor money itself , makes people as happy as their own “ earned success in life ” , which people are much freer to earn in a system of free enterprise .
But both Mr Brooks 's subtle approach and Mr Gingrich 's unsubtle one suffer from a shared weakness .
Where in fact is the evidence that Mr Obama is even remotely a “ socialist ” ?
To stand up this straw man the president 's critics recycle the same small crop of incriminating quotations time and again .
Mr Obama told Samuel “ Joe the Plumber ” Wurzelbacher on the campaign trail in 2008 that “ when you spread the wealth around , it 's good for everybody . ”
Gotcha !
In recent speeches to graduating students he has counselled against materialism and extolled the virtues of public service .
More evidence !
“ That strikes me as exactly the wrong message to send to young people , ” huffs Mitch Daniels , the governor of Indiana and a Republican presidential might - wannabe .
Please .
Platitudes like these have been the stuff of commencement speeches from time immemorial .
There is no master plan
Government has expanded on Mr Obama 's watch .
His administration is spending $ 1 trillion on economic stimulus , has propped up two of the big three car firms instead of letting them implode and introduced a far - reaching reform of health care .
Whatever you think of the merits of the first two decisions it takes a peculiar mixture of amnesia and paranoia to see them as a master plan to turn America socialist , rather than as a series of ad hoc responses to the exigencies of the crisis Mr Obama inherited .
As for the third , it is a funny socialism that gives private , for - profit insurance firms the main responsibility for delivering health care .
The American right misses Mr Obama 's real flaw .
He is not a “ socialist ” ; but he does not understand business .
As even Democrat - leaning CEOs complain , he neither expresses enough appreciation of capitalism nor shares the wavelength of those who practise it .
Bosses are ushered in for photo - calls and then ignored .
It is one thing to seek redress from BP , another to vilify it as an alien invader .
He is interested in economics and technology ; but not in how you make money .
That coolness is a weakness ; but it takes a lot more than indifference to destroy America 's spirit of capitalism .
Big government and free enterprise have co-existed productively in America since the second world war .
Most Americans expect that to continue , and it almost certainly will .

The Obama administration has big plans to “ reshape ” the way news is delivered in the United States .
The truth is that whenever the far left takes control in a nation , they simply cannot resist trying to manipulate and control the media .
Whether it is socialists ( the Nazis for example ) or whether it is communists ( the old USSR for example ) , history has taught us that freedom of the press is always endangered whenever leftist radicals gain power .
Unfortunately , the far left has control of the White House and the U.S. Congress today , and they are getting ready to make their move .
Well , so what are their plans ?
First of all , they want to prop up the liberal - dominated mainstream media and newspapers .
The Los Angeles Times is reporting that the Obama administration is conducting “ a major internal study ” intended to design a major government rescue plan for America ’s newspapers .
So why not let newspapers that nobody wants to read anymore simply die ?
Well , that is just not the “ liberal ” way .
After all , most of those newspapers constantly spew liberal propaganda .
So what are some of the proposals in this major internal study ?
Well , according to the Los Angeles Times , the following proposals are being considered ….
* Major changes to the copyright law , including government licensing provisions
* Government pilot programs to investigate potential new media business models
* Antitrust changes to allow media companies to unite on imposing online pay walls
* Establishing a journalism division of AmeriCorps with government underwriting the training of young journalists
* Tax incentives per news employee
* Increased funding of public broadcasting
* A 5 % tax on consumer electronics and assessments on users of public airwaves
* Allowing taxpayers to direct a portion of their taxes to a specific media institution as payment for media services rendered
Perhaps you read those proposals and you think that they are utter insanity .
Well , the truth is that we live in insane times .
Secondly , the Obama administration is looking for ways that they can get away with shutting down conservative and libertarian news outlets .
There have been a number of suggestions from officials in the Obama administration that the “ Fairness Doctrine ” should be resurrected in one form or another .
Implementing the “ Fairness Doctrine ” would mean that conservative radio shows , television broadcasts and Internet sites would have to give “ equal time ” to liberal points of view .
Of course liberal sites and broadcasts would likely not see much enforcement against them since they would be considered to be so “ balanced ” and “ reasonable ” already .
But even if the “ Fairness Doctrine ” is not brought back to life , liberals are looking for many other ways to “ regulate ” what we see and hear .
In fact , a coalition of more than 30 far left organizations recently sent a letter to the FCC arguing that the Internet has made it harder for the public to separate “ the facts ” from “ bigotry masquerading as news ” .
Of course they define “ bigotry ” as anything that disagrees with Barack Obama .
The truth is that the liberals working for the Obama administration are evaluating what they can legally get away with in terms of media censorship .
The temptation is far too great for them to resist .
They simply cannot leave well enough alone .
So we are likely to see an increasing number of attempts to “ regulate ” speech on the radio , television and Internet for the “ good ” of the American people .
Enjoy your freedom of speech while it lasts .
I ’m often asked about monoids , monads , and what the difference is between the two .
Seeing that there ’s not a lot of material that explains these things in terms of Scala , I ’m going to try to remedy that presently .
Even if you already know what these things are , I hope to provide a little deeper insight .
In this post I ’m going to talk about monoids in some depth .
First , here is a definition for Monoid , in Scala :
trait Monoid [ T ] { def append ( m1 : T , m2 : T ) : T val identity : T }
To state that in English , a monoid is given by a type T together with a function append : ( T , T ) => T , and a value identity : T .
The rules for a monoid are that append must be associative ( meaning that append ( x , append(y , z ) ) == append ( append ( x , y ) , z ) ) , and identity must be an identity for that function ( such that append ( identity , x ) == x , and append( x , identity ) == x .
For example , String with concatenation and the empty string form a monoid .
Boolean with true and && , or Boolean with false and || , also are monoids .
As are Int with addition and 0 , multiplication and 1 , etc .
As an example , here is the String monoid :
val stringMonoid = new Monoid [ String ] { def append ( s1 : String , s2 : String ) = s1 + s2 val identity = " " }
Monoids are List - Algebras
Everyone is familiar with the singly - linked list ( a.k.a. cons-list ) .
A List [ T ] is constructed as either the empty list ( Nil ) , or from an element of type T and another List [ T ] .
Nil is an irreducible unit ( it takes no arguments and has no structure ) , and is in fact totally equivalent to the ( ) value of type Unit .
The :: ( cons ) constructor takes two arguments , and indeed a non-empty List [ T ] is equivalent to a pair ( T , List [ T ] ) ( the head and the tail ) .
Note that a Monoid consists of two functions , one that takes no arguments , and one that takes two arguments , just like the constructors of List .
This is not a coincidence .
If you have a List [ T ] and a Monoid [ T ] , you can reduce the list using the Monoid , to a single value of type T .
def reduce [ A ] ( ts : List [ A ] , m : Monoid [ A ] ) :
A = ts match { case Nil => m.identity case x :: xs => m.append(x , reduce ( xs ) ) }
If you expand out the Monoid argument , you get :
def reduce [ A ] ( ts : List [ A ] , identity : A , append : ( A , A ) => A ) : A
This looks suspicously similar to foldRight and foldLeft .
Again , not a coincidence .
Here ’s the signature for foldRight :
def foldRight [ A , B ] ( ts : List [ A ] , identity : B , append : ( A , B ) => B ) : B
In fact , the implementation of these last two is exactly identical .
So , monoids are just an abstraction that represents the arguments you give to folds .
The associativity rule simply models the fact that you should get the same answer for a given monoid whether you foldLeft or foldRight .
The identity rule ( in loose terms ) models the fact that the empty list “ does n’t count ” .
Monoids are one - object categories
Those readers further along might be wondering where this notion of monoids comes from , and why the concept is even warranted in the first place .
Well , it comes from Category Theory .
So let me give you a crash course .
A category consists of objects ( A , B , C , etc. ) and arrows between objects , ( A => B , A => C , B => C , etc ) .
You can think of it as a diagram or graph , with objects as the nodes , and arrows as directed edges between the nodes .
Given any pair of arrows f : B => C and g : A => B , there exists a composite arrow ( f * g ) : A => C .
Here ’s an encoding of the concept in Scala :
trait Category [ F[ _ , _ ] ] { def compose [ A , B , C ] ( f : F[ B , C ] , g : F [ A , B ] ) : F[ A , C ] def identity [ A ] : F [ A , A ] }
For example , there ’s a category where the objects are Scala types , the arrows are Scala functions , and the composition of arrows is simply function composition .
val catScala = new Category [ Function1 ] { def compose [ A , B , C ] ( f : B => C , g : A => B ) : A => C = f compose g def identity [ A ] : A => A = ( a : A ) => a }
A category must have an identity arrow for each object , which points from the object to itself .
In the Scala category , these arrows are represented by the identity function .
Furthermore , a category must satisfy associativity ( ( f * g ) * h == f * ( g * h ) ) , and identity ( f * identity == f and identity * f == f ) , for all arrows f , g , and h .
Note that the laws that a category must satisfy are exactly the laws that a monoid must satisfy .
You can think of the append function of the monoid as the arrow composition , and the identity value as the identity arrow .
For a Monoid [ T ] , the arrows are precisely all the values of type T , and T itself is the only object in the category .
We can give this category in Scala :
//
The category for a given monoid .
def monoidCategory [ M ] ( m : Monoid [ M ] ) = new Category [ ( {type λ[α , β] = M} ) #λ ] { def identity [ A ] = m.identity def compose [ X , Y , Z ] ( f : M , g : M ) = m.append (f , g ) }
With each day that passes , the rate at which BP is spending money on the Gulf of Mexico oil spill grows .
The company said Monday it has now spent $ 2.65 billion on its operations in the Gulf , a rate of $ 100 million per day over the last three days .
[ Read the press statement here . ]
This figure has grown steadily since the spill began .

It is hard to believe that these fanatics would address this issue ( Women 's ' Choice ) at a time when Congress needs to come together to fix the ills of our economy .
Instead of addressing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , to bring our troops home , or addressing the horrific " No Child Left Behind " and the unfunded mandate that has our educators and children thinking that they are inadequate and failing ; instead of addressing the BP
Oil spill and banning offshore oil drilling what do they do ????
Attack women .
Women we are under seige !
The ' so - called ' " right " feels that it is better to attack us -- whom they consider the " Weaker Sex " , than to address the real issues .
This is a News Flash !!!
Gentlemen -- we can take care of ourselves -- we can make our own decisions and choices -- we do not need your interference .
I have a few suggestions if you do not have anything else to do : 1 ) Repeal the tax cuts that were given to so many BIG Industries ; 2 ) Put the public option back in the Health Care Bill ; 3 ) Take care of our environment with clean energy solutions and not delusional attempts ;
4 ) Make Social Security Solvent again and stop borrowing from it ;
5 ) Help Homeowners keep their homes by passing real restrictions on Financial Institutions and stop the extraordinary high interest rates ;
6 ) Take care of our Military men , women and their families and bring our troops home ; 7 ) Stop campaigning on DADT because it is an election year and do what is right ;
8 ) Pass a Hate Crimes bill that has some teeth in it .
Good news for anyone who'd like to see women pushed back into the servile social position Bronze Age patriarchs created for them through their brutal , self - serving mythology .
Ohio Congressman John Boehner , having just led House conservatives in denying unemployment benefits to millions of Americans -- and probably to a politically expedient economic slowdown -- now plans an assault on women 's right to Choice .
And , as he noted , because the DCCC has been so spectacularly successful in destroying primary candidacies of pro-Choice progressives while pushing forward hopelessly conservative anti-Choice fanatics , Boehner may have the numbers he needs to deal the crippling blow to women the right has been attempting for years .
Saturday Boehner , whose aim is to replace Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House , delivered a fanatic rant at an annual anti-Choice convention in Pittsburgh and promised new legislation that would ban all federal funding for abortion .
" The American people -- and a bipartisan majority in the House -- supported the Stupak amendment , " brayed Boehner , " which would have prohibited taxpayer funding of abortion through the health care bill .
[ But ] instead of heeding the will of the people and a bipartisan majority , [ President Obama and Democratic leaders ] crafted a disingenuous , last - minute executive order that they claimed eliminated the need for pro-life protections ...
I believe this must be the next objective for pro-life America .
It ’s clear from the health care debate that the American people do n’t want their tax dollars paying for abortion , and a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives agrees .
It ’s the will of the people , and it ought to be the law of the land -- right now . "
Last week Hoyer , the DNC , OFA , the DCCC and the whole Democratic Inside - the - Beltway Establishment stood firmly behind Jim Matheson ( Blue Dog -UT ) as he struggled to retain the Democratic Party nomination for the November election .
Last November , he was one of 64 Democrats voting with Boehner to pass the Stupak Amendment to the healthcare reform bill .
No one talked about Mathson 's vote because his default position on virtuallycontentious issue is to follow Boehner 's lead .
He ran against a progressive pro-Choice woman with no funding whatsoever .
No pro-choice congressional leaders came to her assistance ; they were all on Matheson 's side .
This is something that has been playing itself out -- and continues to play itself out -- everywhere in the country .
The DCCC and the Democratic Establishment just spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to elect conservative , anti-Choice , anti-gay fanatic Mark Critz in Pennsylvania .
He may be wearing the right color jersey but he 's already proven himself a devoted Boehner Boy , crossing the aisle on every important vote since being sworn in on May 20 .
His first vote in Congress , to congratulate the University of Texas mens swimming and diving team for winning the NCAA Division I national championship , was a vote with his own party -- and it passed 405 - 0 .
And the Democrats have been able to count on Critz on votes like that .
The important ones ... not so much .
His first vote on a contentious proposal was Patrick Murphy 's amendment to the Defense Authorization
Act which will lead to the repeal of DADT .
Making clear to anyone who had n't been paying attention that the DCCC had just wasted a fortune on electing another vicious bigot to Congress , Critz joined Boehner , all but 5 of the Republicans and a couple dozen homophobic Blue Dogs to oppose Murphy 's legislation .
He 's also been voting with the GOP to recommit ( kill ) major legislation , like the Small Business Jobs Tax Relief Act and voted outright against the DISCLOSE
Act last week , one of 36 Democrats who nearly tanked the bill that is meant to take some of the corrupt practices Critz - watchers knew he is so eager to immerse himself in out of politics .
As Boehner talked yesterday about taking away Choice from American women , you could almost see Mark Critz 's image dancing in the orange glow around his forehead .
Like I mentioned above , even before the DCCC managed to slide Critz into the western Pennsylvania House seat , there were 64 hardcore anti-Choice Democratic votes ( the miscreants who voted to pass Stupak ) .
And , like in the case of Matheson , the DCCC and Obama are supporting each one of them who is getting a challenge from a grassroots progressive back home .
( Well , the DCCC and Obama are n't supporting Parker Griffith ; right after voting against Choice , he jumped the fence and changed into a red jersey . )
Right now Blue America is trying to help raise money for three primary challengers running against the anti-Choicers Boehner is counting on to help him put another nail in the coffin of women 's Choice .
These are the races : Each of the Blue America candidates is a staunch supporter of Choice and each incumbent is an anti-Choice voter who John Boehner will be calling on to help the GOP bring back the bad old days of back - alley abortions .
I wish this issue was as important to the progressive " movement " at large as it is to Digby , John and I .
Is it important to you ?
Today ( for the next 24 hours ) everyone who donates to one of these 3 candidates at the page linked above gets entered in a drawing to win an autographed copy of the 2 - disc deluxe concert film , .
Just contribute to one of the campaigns through the ActBlue pages in the links and you 'll have a chance to win the DVD set .
There 's no minimum ; any amount is fine and any amount will help put a progressive Democrat in the House instead of an anti-Choice Boehner - boy .
Regina
Thomas , a former state legislator , first a House member then a Senator , representing Savannah , was sickened by Boehner 's divisive call for anti-Choice legislation .
This morning she told us it's " cowardly to pick on women and our choices .
Do something meaningful and let the voters see that you are there for America and not just to get re-elected on non-issues . "
And , of course , she 's running against someone who is one of the original Boehner - boys and who votes with Boehner against Democratic ideals and values every chance he gets -- especially against women .

The Mainz quantum interface .
Using laser light which travels through a tapered glass fiber , cesium atoms are trapped along its ultra - thin waist .
The central part of the fiber is thinner than the wavelength of the light itself .
As a consequence , the latter protrudes into the space surrounding the fiber and couples to the trapped atoms .
© QUANTUM , JGU Mainz
German hysicists at the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz have developed a quantum interface which connects light particles and atoms .
The interface is based on an ultra - thin glass fiber and is suitable for the transmission of quantum information .
This is an essential prerequisite for quantum communication which shall be used for secure data transmission via quantum cryptography .
" Our quantum interface might also prove useful for the realization of a quantum computer , " adds Professor Dr Arno Rauschenbeutel from the Institute of Physics at Mainz University .
Today , telephone and internet primarily rely on the optical transmission of data using glass fiber cables .
In that sense , glass fiber networks can be considered as the backbone of the modern communication society .
The light that travels through them is not a continuous flow of energy .
It rather consists , as was discovered by Albert Einstein , of indivisible energy quanta , or photons .
Each photon can then transmit one bit of information , corresponding to a zero or one .
In addition to being very efficient , this also opens the route towards entirely new ways of communication because , being quantum objects , photons can exist simultaneously in both states , zero and one .
As an example , this property is what makes quantum cryptography possible and thereby enables absolute protection against eavesdropping .
In order to fully exploit the potential of quantum communication , however , one additionally needs the possibility to store the quantum information that is encoded on each photon .
Photons themselves are not well suited for this purpose because one cannot hold them at a given position .
Therefore , it would be much more advantageous to transfer the quantum information to atoms .
For this purpose one thus requires a quantum interface between photons and atoms which should ideally be easily integrated into glass fiber networks .
A group of physicists led by Professor Arno Rauschenbeutel has now realized such a glass fiber - based quantum interface .
As reported by the research team in the current issue of the scientific journal Physical Review Letters , the central part of the work in Mainz is a glass fiber which has been heated and stretched until it measures only one hundredth of the diameter of a human hair .
Remarkably , this nanofiber is thinner than the wavelength of the light it guides .
As a consequence , the light is no longer restricted to the inside of the nanofiber but laterally protrudes into the space surrounding the fiber .
Using this so - called evanescent field , the scientists trapped cesium atoms after they have been cooled to a few millionth of a degree above absolute zero by irradiation with suitably chosen laser light .
When trapped , the atoms are arranged in a regular pattern and are levitated 200 nm above the surface of the nanofiber .
This distance might seem very small but it indeed is big enough to protect the atoms from the spurious influences of the fiber surface .
At the same time , the atoms reside in the evanescent field and thus interact with the photons propagating through the nanofiber .
As was demonstrated by the researchers , this process is so efficient that only a couple of thousand atoms should suffice for a close to lossless transfer of quantum information between photons and atoms .
Further possible applications of the Mainz quantum interface include the connection of different quantum systems .
As an example , the trapped atoms could be brought into close vicinity of a superconducting quantum circuit in order to combine the advantageous properties of both systems .
This would then be an important step towards the realization of a quantum computer .

JERUSALEM — Archaeologists have unearthed a cache of rare , 35 - century - old religious artifacts once used in pagan rituals , Israeli officials said Monday .
The items were found during an excavation ordered by the Israel Antiquities Authority along the route of a new gas line in the country 's north .
Excavating a rock hollow , archeologists found more than 100 intact artifacts , including a vessel for burning incense and the sculpted face of a woman that was part of a cup used in a pagan religious ceremony .
" This is my 42nd excavation in 15 years and the first time I 've found more than shards , " said Edwin van den Brink , the archaeologist who directed the excavation .
He said he expected to find artifacts , but not the amount or quality they uncovered .
Some of the small vessels were used to carry precious liquids from Cyprus and Mycenae , Greece , 3,500 years ago .
These vessels were replicated by people in those areas , illustrating a link between the regions , van den Brink said .
Van den Brink said they might have been used in a nearby temple .
They were deposited in the hole either to be preserved from a fire that swept through the region at the end of the Late Bronze Age , or they were buried because they were no longer in use .
Yossi Garfinkel , a professor of archaeology at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem who was not involved in the dig , said holy articles could not be thrown out and were buried instead .
" It is quite possible that these artifacts were used in the cultic area and in the temple and they accumulated , and when they ran out of space or they became old , a pit was made to bury them , " Garfinkel said .
The Antiquities Authority plans to exhibit the artifacts in the coming year .

The launch of BBC News and BBC Sport smartphone applications is to be delayed , after the BBC Trust heeded industry calls for it to review the corporation 's apps proposals .
Today the BBC Trust has informed the corporation 's management that it plans to assess the plans for a series of apps for smartphones including the iPhone and BlackBerry .
The trust said it had also asked for the launch of the first apps to be delayed .
The BBC had been planning to launch its BBC News app next month and a BBC Sport app in May .
There are also plans for an iPlayer app .
When it unveiled the app proposals in February , BBC management argued that the new mobile content offerings were an extension of existing services and are " plainly not a new content service and therefore does n't need to tbe regulated as such " .
However , earlier this month the Newspapers Publishers Association , which represents UK national newspaper groups , appealed to the BBC Trust arguing that the corporation 's apps plans would undermine commercial organisations ' ability to establish economic models on smartphones .
" There remains some uncertainty about the potential significance of whether it [ the BBC 's plans ] constitutes a change of service , " said a spokeswoman for the BBC Trust today .
The BBC Trust added it had moved to look into the plans " following representations from the industry " .
The trust will now look at four areas : the financial implications , the impact on " users and others " ; how long the activity will last ; and the extent to which the change would " involve the BBC in a new area of untested activity " .
However , the BBC Trust is not , at this stage , looking to launch a full public value test into the proposed smartphone services .
" We are focused on making BBC Online 's core web propositions more user - friendly , convenient and accessible , and using existing content to create truly distinctive products around our core public service areas , " said a spokeswoman for the BBC .
" We look forward to helping the trust with any further information they require about our plans . "
" It is vital that these proposals are scrutinised properly to avoid any adverse impact on commercial media organisations , " said David Newell , director of the NPA .
" We are pleased that the BBC Trust has listened to the industry 's concerns and acted to delay the planned April launch .
We hope this will enable a thorough assessment to be undertaken . "

Scientists from Japan were given the go - ahead to retrieve the sample return capsule from the Hayabusa spacecraft , which is hoped to contain the first piece of asteroid ever brought to Earth , perhaps providing insight into the origins of asteroids – and our universe .
The capsule was ejected three hours before reaching Earth , and the sample canister descended through Earth ’s atmosphere , preceding the spacecraft which broke up in spectacular fashion ( click here to see the video ) over the Australian Outback .
The capsule lay in the Woomera Prohibited Area until morning when Aboriginal elders deemed it had not landed in any indigenous sacred sites , giving the OK for the scientists to retrieve it .
The insulated and cushioned re-entry capsule , 40 cm in diameter and 25 cm deep has a mass of about 20 kg .
The capsule had a convex nose covered with a 3 cm thick ablative heat shield to protect the samples from the high velocity ( ~13 km / s ) re-entry .
Apparently , it landed right on target .
The director of the Woomera test range , Doug Gerrie , said the probe had completed a textbook landing in the South Australian desert .
“ They landed it exactly where they nominated they would .
The capsule will remain sealed until it arrives at the JAXA facility near Tokyo , and may remain unopened for weeks as it undergoes testing .
The mission launched in 2003 , and endured a series of technical glitches over its five - billion - kilometer ( three - billion - mile ) journey to the asteroid Itokawa and back .
A large solar flare in late 2003 “ injured ” the solar panels , providing less power to Hayabusa ’s ion engines , delaying the rendezvous with the asteroid .
Then , as the spacecraft approached Itokawa , Hayabusa lost the use of its Y - axis reaction wheel .
While it flew near the asteroid and sent back data , scientists and engineers are n’t sure if the spacecraft was successful in obtaining samples , as while it appears Hayabusa landed briefly , it is not certain the “ bullets ” fired to stir up dust for the container to capture .
The return to Earth was delayed by three years from more thruster and navigational failures , but the JAXA team nursed and coaxed the spacecraft back home to a spectacular return .
There was concern that the parachute batteries may be been depleted due to the extra time it took to get back to Earth , but obviously they worked quite well .

Former McLaren chief engineer Pat Fry is set to join Ferrari 's technical strength according to reports in the Italian media .
The 46 - year - old , who quit McLaren in May after working for the team for 18 years , has signed for the Italian squad according to Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport .
It remains unclear when he will take up his position or what his role will be .
When asked to confirm the story , a Ferrari spokesperson refused to comment .
McLaren 's managing director Jonathan Neale recently spoke of Fry 's decision to leave the team in a media phone - in last month : " Whenever somebody of Pat 's calibre leaves the team it is sad , and we like Pat very much and he is a fine engineer but people have their lives to lead and want to do other things .
" It does n't give me any concern for the performance of the team or what we do for next year 's car at all because we are still a team that has strength in depth and we are committed to maintaining that , " he added .
" Yes it 's regrettable but Pat has to move on and do other things with his life and we have carried on as you would expect . "
China will gradually make the yuan ’s exchange rate more flexible , the central bank said on Saturday a week before a G20 summit , strongly suggesting that it was ready to break the currency ’s 23 - month - old dollar peg .
[ ID :nSGE65I02M ]
A central bank statement was released following mounting pressure on Beijing to allow the yuan to appreciate in line with its economic strength since the global economy began to recover .
In July 2005 , China had bowed to market and political pressure by revaluing the yuan by 2.1 percent and abandoning a decade - old peg against the dollar .
In the three years following the revaluation , the central bank allowed the yuan to appreciate a further 19 percent against the dollar .
The yuan ’s traded peak since the revaluation was 6.8099 on Sept. 23 , 2008 .
However , since July 2008 , the Chinese central bank effectively pegged the yuan against the dollar close to 6.83 to protect China ’s economy as it confronted a slowdown due to the global financial crisis .
Here is a timetable of yuan reforms .
1988 -- China sets up semi-official currency swap centres around the country to allow enterprises to trade the yuan at a rate that more closely reflects market demand .
1994 , Jan. 1 - China unifies its dual exchange rates by bringing the official and swap centre rates into line , officially devaluing the yuan by 33 percent overnight to 8.7 to the dollar as part of reforms to embrace a “ socialist market economy ” .
April - China sets up its first interbank currency market -- the China Foreign Exchange Trade System -- in Shanghai .
The central bank intervenes in the market to keep the yuan stable .
1996 , Dec. 1 - China allows the yuan to be fully convertible under the current account .
1994 -1996 --
The yuan strengthens steadily from 8.7 to the dollar to around 8.28 .
1997 -1999 -- China wins wide praise for keeping the yuan stable during the Asian financial crisis despite pressure to devalue .
The yuan was boxed between 8.2770 and 8.2800 for about three years through frequent central bank intervention .
2000 --
The yuan is allowed to close slightly outside the firm end of its 30 - basis point band , which is later widened by another 10 points to 8.2760 - 8.2800 against the dollar .
2001 , December -- China joins the World Trade Organisation and pledges to adjust its currency regime gradually .
2003 -- International pressure begins mounting for the yuan to appreciate to help balance global trade , including China ’s huge trade surplus with the United States and the rest of the world .
2004 , Dec. 8 -- Premier Wen Jiabao says that China would move gradually to a flexible currency regime .
2005 , July 21 -- China revalues the yuan by 2.1 percent and revises the rules governing its currency system , saying it had shifted to “ a managed floating exchange rate based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies ” .
2008 , July -- China ’s central bank effectively pegs the yuan against the dollar close to 6.83 to protect China ’s economy as it confronted a slowdown due to the global financial crisis .
2009 , June -- China said it was going to resume reforming the yuan exchange rate and increase currency flexibility after keeping the yuan tightly linked to the U.S. dollar for nearly two years during and after the global financial crisis .
Image caption Sergio Vega 's lyrics often featured the drugs trade
Mexican singer Sergio Vega has been shot dead only hours after he had denied reports he had been murdered .
The 40 - year - old singer , known as El Shaka , told a website he had increased security measures after a number of Mexican musicians were killed .
Musicians performing narcocorridos , songs celebrating the lives of drug barons , often become the targets of rival drug gangs .
Gunmen opened fire on Mr Vega on his way to a concert in Sinaloa state .
Mexican media reported Mr Vega was driving his red Cadillac on Saturday night when a truck started following him .
Shortly afterwards , shots were fired at the car , injuring Mr Vega and making him lose control of the vehicle and crashing it , his passenger told El Debate newspaper .
Deadly rumours
The gunmen then " finished Mr Vega off " with shots to the head and chest , El Debate reported the passenger as saying .
SERGIO VEGA , EL SHAKA Born 12 September 1969 in Sonora , Mexico
Emigrates to the US
Founds the band Los Hermanos Vega with his brothers
Band returns to Mexico under new name Los Reyes del Norte
Killed on 26 June 2010
Police confirmed they found spent bullet shells next to the driver 's door .
The BBC's Julian Miglierini in Mexico City said rumours had been circulating among fans of the Grupero genre of music that Mr Vega had been killed .
Only hours before the shooting , he told the entertainment website La Oreja that reports of his murder had been mistaken .
" It 's happened to me for years now , someone tells a radio station or a newspaper I 've been killed , or suffered an accident , " Mr Vega said .
" And then I have to call my dear mum , who has heart trouble , to reassure her , " he explained .
He told the site that musicians performing Grupero music were worried , but that he had entrusted himself to God .
Mr Vega said he had increased his security measures after the killing in 2007 of Sergio Gomez , the singer of Grupero band K - Paz de la Sierra .
NARCOCORRIDO EL SHAKA
I 'm going to ask you a favour ...
Shaka told his people ...
I want to have some coca paste processed ...
Because that 's what the customer wants ...
At the end if it rains and I get wet ...
You will get wet as well Translated extract from El Shaka
Mr Gomez was kidnapped after a concert in Michoacan , at which Mr Vega had also performed .
He was found strangled days later .
At least seven Grupero musicians have been killed over the past three years .
Police have blamed drug gangs for the killings .
They say musicians who celebrate the lives of drug barons in their lyrics often become targets for rival drug gangs .

Even brooding female birds are sensitive to visual stimulation
Missour / Leipzig .
In a breeding experiment with Houbara Bustards ‒ a North African bird species with a very distinctive courtship behaviour , scientists have concluded that visual stimulation from attractive males of the same species positively affects brooding females , improving offspring growth .
Females that observed highly displaying male birds in the experiment were more fertile and had a greater breeding success due to an increased allocation of testosterone into their eggs , leading to an increase in the growth rate in chicks .
The results showed that using artificial insemination without appropriate stimulation of breeding females probably has negative impacts on their breeding performance and can therefore even affect the survival of a species , according to Adeline Loyau and Frederic Lacroix in the online edition of Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
The Houbara Bustard is a sandy - coloured resident of deserts , with its distribution ranging from North Africa to Mongolia

For the experiment , Loyau of the Helmholtz Center for Environmental Research ( UFZ ) and the French CNRS station for experimental ecology and her colleague Lacroix ( ECWP ) confronted 90 brooding Houbara Bustard females ( Chlamydotis undulata undulata ) with various individuals of the same species .
In the Emirates Center for Wildlife Propagation ( ECWP ) in Moroccan Missour , 30 female birds were visually confronted with either highly displaying male birds , poorly displaying male birds , or females .
During the experiment the female birds under investigation were artificially inseminated and kept isolated in aviaries five meters apart from birds of the same species in other aviaries .
That way the scientists were able to exclude any other factors from playing a role in the experiment other than that of visual stimulation .
" To my knowledge our study is the first example in species conservation of a successful manipulation of maternal allocation of resources through sensory stimulation " , explains behavioural biologist Adeline Loyau from the UFZ , " Our results show that it is possible to control maternal allocation of resources independent of the quality of male genes . "
Male display courtship constitutes an effective signal thereby providing conservationists with a simple and inexpensive means .
The results could therefore be very significant for the improvement of captive breeding programs of other threatened bird species .
The Houbara bustard is a sandy - coloured resident of deserts , with its distribution ranging from North Africa to Mongolia .
In the Arab world it is common prey for falcon hunting .
Both hunting and a loss of habitat have diminished Houbara bustard populations and in the meantime the species is classified as vulnerable .
It is bred in captive breeding programs to support the conservation of in - situ populations .
It was for this purpose that the Emirates Center for Wildlife Propagation ( ECWP ) was founded in Moroccan Missour by the emir of Abu Dhabi , sheikh Zayid bin Sultan Al Nahyan .
Already in 2007 , Adeline Loyau and colleagues found that females of the Blue Peacock ( Pavo cristatus ) that had mated with attractive males increased the allocation of resources into their eggs compared to females that had mated with unattractive males .
With attractive partners they laid larger eggs and increased the yolk testosterone levels , which has a direct influence on the growth rate of offspring .
Generally , it is known that various factors can have an effect on female birds and their offspring such as the quality of male genes or food availability .
Under unfavourable conditions it can be more effective to invest less in the current offspring but to put more effort into the following season .
With their most recent experiment Loyau and Lacroix were finally able to show that visual stimulation can also influence chick growth .
The data were analysed by Loyau in the laboratories of the UFZ in Leipzig during her time there as a visiting researcher .
In the meantime the French biologist is working at the station for experimental ecology ( SEEM ) of the French Research Center CNRS in Moulis in the Pyrenees .

The United Nations have declared 2010 as the ‘ International Year of Biodiversity ’ .
The goal of this is to bring the issue of biodiversity with its many facets to the collective conscience of the public .
With its expertise the UFZ contributes to investigating the consequences and causes of the loss of biodiversity as well as developing mitigation options .
Biodiversity research in Germany is conducted at numerous institutions ranging from universities , non-university research institutes and departmental research to nature conservation organisations and companies .
The Network Forum on Biodiversity Research is a project in the context of DIVERSITAS Germany that intends to offer the research community a common institution - independent communication structure and culture .

WHERE literacy meets numeracy , enthusiasm meets scepticism and philosophy meets fun , there you find Martin Gardner .
He earned his crust by writing , but his abiding interest was in maths , and his gift , or rather one of them , was to explain mathematical concepts in ways that made sense to non-mathematicians .
Many of them not only understood what he wrote but also became infected with his love of maths , of its beauty and of its capacity to give satisfaction , if not delight , when its riddles were solved and its paradoxes explained .
For 25 years he provided both the puzzlement and the demystification in a column in Scientific American .
Mr Gardner did not come to this task from MIT or Caltech .
Indeed , he had no formal maths training after high school in Tulsa , Oklahoma .
But he did come from a job in journalism , to be precise , from a post at Humpty Dumpty 's Magazine for Little Children , where among other tasks he helped with the designs , including all the cutouts .
Cutouts also came his way when a conjuror introduced him to the hexaflexagon , a piece of paper folded into an almost flat six - sided shape that could be manipulated to reveal a series of different interiors one after another .
This inspired him to write the article that launched his column , “ Mathematical Games ” , and with it a pastime now known as recreational maths .
Since this is a more benign , though almost equally addictive , version of its close relation , recreational drugs , it soon had a large following .
Many were no doubt obsessive male teenagers and their fathers , epitomised perhaps by the followers of GeekDad , a blog that celebrates Geek Pride Day , nerdcore music and geek - chic fashion , as well as Mr Gardner .
Some may have been sudoku , tredoku or futoshiki freaks , who buy daily newspapers , extract the puzzle pages and throw away the rest .
Others , however , were quite respectable .
It is notable that Mr Gardner was one of the few popularisers of difficult subjects who earned the respect of serious thinkers , W.H. Auden , Noam Chomsky , Stephen Jay Gould and Douglas Hofstadter among them .
Some , such as Roger Penrose ( an Oxford mathematical physicist ) and John Conway ( a Princeton mathematician ) , owe some of their own celebrity to his writings about their work .
No wonder it is sometimes said that Mr Gardner made mathematicians out of children and children out of mathematicians .
Maths , however , was far from being Mr Gardner 's only interest , even though it inevitably played a part in his most popular book , “ The Annotated Alice ” .
This went through Lewis Carroll 's two Alice books , explaining the umpteen puns , jokes and allusions .
He did the same for other works , including Coleridge 's “ The Rime of the Ancient Mariner ” , Chesterton 's “ The Innocence of Father Brown ” , Joyce 's “ Ulysses ” , Moore 's “ The Night Before Christmas ” and Baum 's “ The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ” .
This was micro stuff , but Mr Gardner did the big picture too .
He could defend realism in the face of quantum physics , tackle infinity and nothing , venture into the realms beyond cultural relativism , test proofs of God and wonder whether Isaiah Berlin was a hedgehog or a fox .
He wrote with lucidity about the works of computer scientists , philosophers and playwrights , always giving credit where it was due .
Logic conquers ( almost ) all
Yet he was far more than a synthesiser .
Indeed , all his non-fiction — he also wrote novels , short stories and poetry — was rigorously analytical .
And though he was shy , usually shunning his fans ' two - yearly “ Gatherings for Gardner ” , he was not afraid to speak his mind .
Any beliefs he thought pseudoscientific , such as homeopathy , Scientology , creationism , anthroposophy , spoon - bending , astrology and flying saucers , he would dismiss with cool efficiency .
Other ideas , such as Ronald Reagan 's beloved Laffer curve , were derided in spoof articles : Mr Gardner had a sense of humour , and used it to effect .
But he was not malicious .
Though he enjoyed hoaxes , he would sometimes turn them on himself , once writing , under a pseudonym , a withering review of one of his own works in the New York Review of Books .
Did he spread himself too thin ?
It is hard not to think that anyone who writes more books ( 70 - plus ) than many people have read , as well as numberless articles and essays , must be at the controls of a sausage machine , yet the sausages were usually good .
The harder question is where it all came from , to which the only answer is himself — and reading .
Studying philosophy at the University of Chicago , and reading voraciously from Plato to Kant to H.G. Wells , he abandoned the Christian fundamentalism of his teenage years and acquired an enduring respect for rationalism and science .
Along the way , he also came to love magic — not spells and sorcery , but the tricks and illusions of puzzlers and prestidigitators .
Perhaps this helps explain the belief in God that he came to in later life .
His declaration of this belief caused , he admitted , profound shock to those who knew him only as a sceptic .
But there was too much playfulness in Mr Gardner to make him yield entirely to reason .
His faith , he said , was based on an “ emotional turning of the will ” , unsupported by logic or science .
It was his way , perhaps , of recognising that mind and man are not synonyms .
What happens when you ’re a small government , pro-business conservative and your state gets pummeled by one of the worst man made disasters ever – not five years after getting pummeled by one of the worst natural disasters ( Hurricane Katrina ) ?
If you ’re Louisiana Senator David Vitter , you double down on offshore drilling and push for a liability cap for BP .
Doubling down on drilling is not particularly surprising .
Much of Louisiana ’s much - needed revenue comes from off - shore drilling leases .
“ By the same token , after every plane crash , you and I should both oppose plane travel , ” Vitter quipped on Sunday to CNN ’s Candy Crowley .
“ I do n’t think that is rational . ”
Even Vitter ’s Democratic challenger , Rep. Charlie Melancon , reiterated his support for expanded drilling in the wake of the disaster .
But it ’s Vitter ’s early support of a liability cap – he introduced legislation that he promoted in last weekend ’s weekly GOP radio address – that ’s landing the son of a Chevron petroleum engineer in trouble .
Local and national Democrats have been pounding Vitter for seeking to limit the amount of legal damages BP would be responsible for to the last four quarters of profit .
“ Unlike Republicans , Democrats are not going to protect BP – and given their track record , we are certainly not going to rely on BP ’s word as the only thing ensuring that taxpayers are not left on the hook to pay for the disaster they caused , ” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a statement .
Vitter ’s been courting his conservative base since July 2007 when it was revealed that he had been a client of “ DC Madam ” Deborah Jeane Palfrey .
Vitter held a press conference , his wife by his side , where he admitted to “ a very serious sin , ” though he did n’t detail the sin .
In the years since he ’s slowly and steadily rebuilt his conservative credentials .
He passed an amendment to bar funding for organizations that advocate international gun control policies .
He attempted to deny family planning funds to organizations that perform abortions but that failed the Senate 52 - 41 .
And he sponsored legislation to require all states to collect DNA samples from convicted felons .
Vitter ’s also been a strong advocate for President Bush ’s tax cuts and , when he ran in 2004 he tied himself closely to Bush – images that are sure to come back to haunt him .
But he ’s also practical : Louisiana is not Oklahoma ( Coburn ) or South Carolina ( DeMint ) .
There ’s an expectation that every politician – even the first Republican in 121 years to represent The Bayou State in the Senate – bring home the bacon .
In fact , when Vitter first ran for his congressional seat , replacing Bob Livingston , he argued that a younger man should be elected – one that can build up Livingston ’s seniority over the years .
And Vitter has worked hard to bring the state Katrina recovery funds , even sending Bush a hostile letter co-signed by 22 other GOP senators when the President threatened to veto a water resources bill with nearly $ 3 billion in wetlands and levy funds earmarked for Louisiana .
Vitter leads Melancon comfortably in polls and he ’s nearly quadrupled Melcancon ’s $ 2.5 million fundraising haul .
But he must now find a way to explain to angry constituents why he wants to limit the damages they might claim from the oil giant in the wake of the growing disaster – a political crack Democrats in Louisiana are looking to force open .
After all , in this climate the only thing worse than being on the side of Washington is being on the side of big oil .
Predators : Trailer #
1
A group of elite warriors are hunted by members of a merciless alien race known as Predators .
On the one hand — and actually on several hands — I find it almost preposterous to think that Rep. Joe Barton ( R - TX ) would be forced to give up his committee post over his apology / tragedy comments this morning — notwithstanding one GOP Rep . ’s call for him to do just that .
That ’s just not how the GOP caucus functions .
But I actually think there ’s some reason to wonder whether he ’ll be able to hold on to his seat as ranking member ( senior Republican and Chairman - in - waiting ) of the Energy Committee through the Fall .
The big enchilada this Fall is the House .
And a big part of the equation will be the degree to which Democrats are able to raise fears of a return to Republican rule that are strong enough to blunt the strong anti-incumbent tide .
And in this case , the ads just write themselves :
“ If “ candidate X ” wins the man in charge of Energy policy in Washington will be Joe Barton , the guy who actually ( incredulous and contemptuously inflection on ‘ actually ’ ) apologized to BP for making them pay to clean up the Gulf Coast . ”
It ’s not something the election is going to turn on .
But it ’s a nice tag line for a lot of Democratic incumbents ’ commercials this fall .
Late Update : Maybe sooner than I realized ?
From Greg Sargent …
June 16th is n’t a particularly important day in the lives of many NHL fans .
But for Devils fans , it should ring a bell and hold a special place in our hearts .
Because , 20 years ago today , the team drafted their biggest star ever – Martin Brodeur .
On June 16 , 1990 , the Devils pulled off one of the greatest draft day trades of all time .
The teams exchanged five draft picks , including first - round selections , which moved the Devils from the 11th slot down to the 20th .
The Flames went on to use the 11th pick to draft Trevor Kidd .
The Devils , eyeing Brodeur throughout the draft , got their goalie at # 20 .
After drafting the future Hall of Famer , the Devils began to build the core of their three Stanley Cup championships .
The previous October the team acquired a first - round draft selection , which brought in Scott Niedermayer .
Scott Stevens came to the team from St. Louis as compensation , giving the team two of the best defenders to ever suit up for the franchise .
Brodeur took over the number one role during the 1994 season , leading the Devils to the conference finals .
The next year , the team won the Stanley Cup .
And the rest has been history .
Since Brodeur became the Devils number one goalie , the team has only missed the playoffs once .
They ’ve won three Stanley Cup titles , four Eastern Conference championships , and nine Atlantic Division titles .
During this time , Brodeur has also achieved several individual milestones .
He tops the goaltending record book in wins ( 602 ) , games played ( 1 , 076 ) , shutouts ( 110 ) and minutes played ( 63,521 ) .
He enters the 2010 - 2011 season 1,013 saves shy of Patrick Roy ’s all - time saves record ( 25,803 ) .
When he was drafted , Brodeur could never imagine the impact he ’d have on his position .
“ You do n’t realize it when you get drafted what path you ’re going to take , ” Brodeur said in an NHL.com interview .
“ This is the first step into doing something .
I think you have to get drafted , to a certain extent .
That ’s the easiest way to get to the NHL .
Definitely , when you do get drafted in the first round , usually teams will do everything they can to give you a chance to make it or be part of the organization , so I was really excited about that . ”
Growing up in the 1990s , I began to embrace the Devils .
One of the biggest reasons for choosing the Devils over my family ’s team , the Rangers , was because of Brodeur .
Whether it was the incredible saves or his steely confidence in net , he always seemed to be the team ’s rock .
No matter the situation , “ Marty ” always stood tall .
Those qualities drew me in , and they continue to astound me today .
Whenever he makes an incredible glove save or flares out his pad to deny a goal , I get that childhood giddiness and jump out my seat .
So Devils fans everywhere should celebrate today and remember today as a turning point in the history of the New Jersey Devils .
" Yet the European Union has decided that the solution to the debt crisis is even more debt and confidence in the recovery package has now evaporated .
When people abandon bonds and Western currencies they will look for real assets , which can't be created at the touch of a button .
The gold market really does have the bit between its teeth at the moment . "

Paul Goble reports :
Most Russian businessmen prefer to keep their money in offshore banks and their children at foreign schools lest the businessmen be charged with corruption and lose everything , a Moscow specialist on Russian elites says , just one of the ways in which Russian government policies are promoting short - term thinking and undermining development .
Olga Kryshtanovskaya , the head of the Center for the Study of Elites at the Academy of Sciences Institute of Sociology , drew those and other conclusions during an interview with Svobodnaya Press on the basis of a survey of 25 leading Russian businessmen conducted by UBS and Camden Research .
Those two firms , which conducted the study for Vedomosti which published the results in its edition today , queried 25 Russians who own privately held businesses with annual turnover of 100 to 500 million US dollars in a broad range of fields .
Among the more interesting results were the following : “ 72 percent are not considering the possibility of expansion abroad in the near future .
But all except two are ready to sell their business for a good price and a little more than half are ready to do this in the next two to four years . ”
Moreover , “ 84 percent of them keep their money abroad , ” with “ the most popular countries being Cyprus , Switzerland , and the Virgin Islands . ”
And most seek to live modestly – “ only two have yachts ” – “ in order not to attract heightened attention to themselves and their money ” by the powers that be .
In addition to keeping their money abroad , “ Vedomosti ” reports , most also prefer to “ educate their children ” there “ but they try to ensure that their offspring will not lose their national identity , ” although most of them do not expect their children to continue the businesses their parents have founded .
“ I do n’t want to hand over to my children the difficulties and uncertainties which accompany the management of a big business in Russia , ” one of those polled said .
“ In this country , it is n’t necessary to be an entrepreneur in order to become rich ; it is simply necessary to get into the ruling circles : the bureaucrats make money . ”
Marko Naumann , the co-director of the UBS - Camden survey , said that “ Russians often operate as serial businessmen , building one company after another , very much like the situation in the United States ” but very different than the one in Europe where “ family businesses ” often passed down “ from generation to generation ” predominate .
Moreover , he continued , “ wealthy Russians often do not want to hand over their businesses to children because they are not certain that the latter will be able to run them successfully in unstable times ” or be able to cope with corruption and bureaucracy .
Consequently , these owners themselves seldom plan “ more than two years ahead . ”
Commenting on these findings , Kryshtanovskaya , who has written widely on Russia ’s new elites , said that they show the fear most Russian businessmen have that “ something will happen with their money and that someone will grab onto and take away that which they have up until now managed to keep . ”
Asked about the political ambitions of a group that has such short - term views , the Moscow sociologist says that their collective views are “ very , very weakly expressed , ” a reflection of their relative youth as a social group and their lack of a sense that “ we are a force in the country and we can unite and put pressure ” on the government .
“ This does n’t exist . ”
“ There is , ” she says , “ a desire to strive toward that but there is also an absolute lack of faith in their own forces and a fear , a fear of the powers that be .
[ These business owners ] understand that this is a danger zone .
Therefore , in considering the relative weight of this ambition and the fear of losing everything , fear still wins out . ”
Until and unless the Kremlin can change that , not only encouraging Russian business owners to take a longer view about their own operations and to begin to feel their strength as a political group , all the talk about modernization is likely to remain just that , and both the money of Russian business owners and their children will continue to go abroad .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet ) : Mullah Krekar holdt i kveld en internasjonal pressekonferanse i Vika i Oslo .
Der kom han med sterke utfall og trusler mot norske myndigheter .
TV2 forsøkte å komme inn på pressekonferansen , men ble nektet adgang .
Krekar advarer mot å kaste ham ut av Norge .
Hvis han skulle bli drept etter en utkastelse , vil det samme skje med de ansvarlige i Norge .
- Vil koste Norge - Min død vil koste det norske samfunnet .
Om for eksempel Erna Solberg kaster meg ut av landet og er årsak til at jeg dør , så vil hun lide samme skjebne , sa Krekar ifølge TV2 .
Krekar vet ikke hvem som skal ta hånd om hevnen .
- Jeg vet ikke av hvem .
Ansar
Al islam , Al - Qaida , jeg vet ikke .
Hvem som helst .
Vurdert Cuba Ifølge nettsida newsinenglish .no har Krekar vurdert å flytte til Cuba .
- Jeg har vurdert å flytte til Castro .
Jeg flyktet fra et muslimsk land , nå vil jeg flykte fra et demokratisk land som Norge .
Jeg tenkte jeg kunne prøve kommunisme , sa Krekar .
Han avviser også at han er en terrorist , og at hans positive uttalelser om Osama bin Laden ikke kan tolkes i en slik retning .
- Jeg snakker bare om Osama bin Laden « fordi han er bin Laden » .
Jeg snakker om Ronaldo også , men det gjør meg ikke til noen fotballspiller .
Solberg ikke skremt Erna Solberg sier at truslene ikke var behagelige å få .
Hun sier hun regner med at norsk politi går gjennom den type uttalelser og ser om de rammes av norsk straffelovgivning .
I 2005 ble vedtaket om å kaste Krekar ut av Norge endelig , men det er ennå ikke gjennomført siden sikkerheten hans i Irak ikke kan garanteres .
Solberg mener man på nytt bør se på om vedtaket kan gjennomføres .
- Ingen kan true seg til opphold i Norge .
Jeg mener han bør sendes ut ved første mulighet , sier Erna Solberg til Dagbladet .
Selv om hun ikke synes truslene fra Krekar var behagelige , tar hun de ikke innover seg .
- Krekar har kommet med lignende og indirekte trusler mot andre tidligere .
Jeg kan ikke følge med på disse showene hans , sier Solberg til Dagbladet .

While speaking at Hampton University today , President Barack Obama did something subtle .
He took Thomas Jefferson and the actions of the Revolutionary War patriots away from the Tea Party and applied them to all America , “ What Jefferson recognized , like the rest of that gifted generation , was that in the long run , their improbable experiment , America , would n’t work if its citizens were uninformed . ”
Here is the full video of Obama ’s remarks from C - SPAN :
Within his remarks , Obama took a jab at the right wing media , and their struggles with facts , “ You ’re accepting your degrees as America wages two wars – wars that many in your generation have been fighting .
Meanwhile , you ’re coming of age in a 24/7 media environment that bombards us with all kinds of content and exposes us to all kinds of arguments , some of which do n’t rank all that high on the truth meter .
With iPods and iPads ; Xboxes and PlayStations ; information becomes a distraction , a diversion , a form of entertainment , rather than a tool of empowerment .
All of this is not only putting new pressures on you ; it is putting new pressures on our country and on our democracy . ”

The theme of Obama ’s address was education , and he used Tea Party heroThomas Jefferson to make his point , “ Years after he left office , decades after he penned the Declaration , Thomas Jefferson sat down , a few hours ’ drive from here , in Monticello , to write a letter to a longtime legislator , urging him to do more on education .
Jefferson gave one principal reason – the one , perhaps , he found most compelling .
“ If a nation expects to be ignorant and free , ” he wrote , “ it expects what never was and never will be . ” ”
The President continued , “ What Jefferson recognized , like the rest of that gifted generation , was that in the long run , their improbable experiment – America – would n’t work if its citizens were uninformed , if its citizens were apathetic , if its citizens checked out , and left democracy to those who did n’t have their best interests at heart .
It could only work if each of us stayed informed and engaged ; if we held our government accountable ; if we fulfilled the obligations of citizenship . ”
Later he put the Colonists of the Revolutionary War in a different context for Hampton grads , “ So , yes , an education can fortify us to meet the tests of our economy , the tests of citizenship , and the tests of our time .
But what makes us American is something that ca n’t be taught – a stubborn insistence on pursuing a dream .
The same insistence that led a band of patriots to overthrow an empire .
That fired the passions of union troops to free the slaves and union veterans to found schools like Hampton . ”
Obama is a student of history , so it is no accident that a quote from noted slave owner Thomas Jefferson was included in his address to historically black Hampton University , but there was also something else going on here .
The Tea Party movement has redefined the Revolutionary War period and Thomas Jefferson in a very narrow way .
To the Tea Party movement , the revolution was strictly about a tax protest and the battle against tyranny .
If a person only got their information from the Tea Party , or Fox News , they would believe that the only thing Jefferson ever said of value was , “ God forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion .
The people cannot be all , and always , well informed .
The part which is wrong will be discontented , in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive .
If they remain quiet under such misconceptions , it is lethargy , the forerunner of death to the public liberty .
… And what country can preserve its liberties , if its rulers are not warned from time to time , that this people preserve the spirit of resistance ?
Let them take arms .
The remedy is to set them right as to the facts , pardon and pacify them .
What signify a few lives lost in a century or two ?
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time , with the blood of patriots and tyrants .
It is its natural manure . ”
Jefferson would likely be mortified to know that his quote was being misused to undermine the legitimacy of a constitutionally elected president .
President Obama was able to point out today that there is more to Jefferson and the Patriots than the Tea Party presents .
Obama used the language of the Tea Party in a progressive way to reinforce his message about the importance of education and dreams .
In short , Obama took Jefferson and the Patriots back from the Tea Party and restored them to their rightful place as important figures in history for all Americans .
This weekend i made a schooling about game programming for 20 people of Bupp , Austria ’s state - run Game rating agency .
Using The PythonGameBook and a remastered version of Ubuntu Linux 10.4 , the schooling took place at Area 52 in Vienna , a location specialized to host lan - partys and gaming presentations .
I found out that some computers were not able to boot from USB stick and some were not able to boot from DVD .
And i completely messed up my remixing tool UCK after remastering the first version .
Finally only one PC needed to boot using a prepared USB stick and i provided all participants with a live - DVD ( Ubuntu 10.4 with pygame and some other tools installed ) and a non-bootable USB stick with examples from ThePythonGamebook and other tutorials like the excellent A byte of Python from Swaroop HC .
It was the first major field test for ThePythonGameBook using an adult audience .
After a 4 - hour crash - course into python - programming ( more than the half of the audience had no programming experience at all ) the participants were able to create simple point - and - click adventures using the ingenious easygui module from Steve Ferg .
After the crash - course into Python programming i let the audience practically read ThePythonGameBook at their own pace and only helped out at demand .
The participants of the schooling formed 2 - person teams and had the task to produce one playable game at the schoolings end .
It was their choice to use only python ( text ) , easygui , pygame or a combination of those .
Sadly i forgot to point out to only use creative - commons licensed graphics and sound , so participants of the schooling used good - looking pictures found at google from questionable origin .
This inhibits me from using the created games on my homepage or in The PythonGameBook .
However i will re-program some of the game ideas using free graphics and sounds .
At the end of the schooling , all participants presented their own game and voted for the other games ( the winning teams got small prices ) .
I was very curious how ThePythonGameBook would work as a learning book .
Some flaws in the concept become apparent – like too late introduction of pygame sprites and too complicated sprite classes .
I generally like the approach of using pygame surfaces first and introducing the more complex ( classes , object - oriented programming ) pygame sprites later .
But now i think of adding a “ the same example done with sprites ” section to each surface - only example .
Maybe even before introducing the sprite class at all .
My newest addition to ThePythonGameBook , an example game of penguins shooting homing rockets at each other was not mature enough to be used meaningful in the schooling .
However one team had a very creative idea of combining a classic pong game with a pinball mechanic ..
i will try to make this concept into a working example game .
Another insight i got from the schooling was that i need to write my pygame examples as generic functions ( like for displaying text or playing sound ) so that users with minimal python knowledge can use them from other programs without caring about pygame ’s complexity .
This worked to same level , a team wrote a game using easygui and the Flytext function of ThePythonGameBook to display “ Game Over ” or status messages .
It was a very nice and productive weekend .
Most laughs got a “ South - park ” inspired game were poor Kenny has to avoid ( at first ) one bouncing ball or he explode , with the number of balls increasing insanely .
Other teams concentrated on modding existing examples of ThePythonGameBook – it is incredible how much far better the “ same ” game looks after some work with graphics and sound effects .
Some participants took existing pygame games found in the internet and merged them with their own ideas , like a combination of Hangman with the Snake game … really cool .
Result :
Thanks to the participants of the schooling , i’m full of cool fresh ideas for The PythonGameBook and highly motivated to write more .
Thanks , guys !
James Cameron offered to help BP find a solution to their leaking well in the Gulf of Mexico but the company turned him down .
Now the Academy Award - winning director is taking his suggestions directly to the media .
“ You had a brainstorming session that I understand lasted more than ten hours .
Did you come up with concrete ideas in terms of things that can be done right now that can make this situation not worse , but better ? ” NBC ’s Matt Lauer asked Cameron Monday .

“ We looked at it in sort of three stages .
What can we do right now to either slow down or stop the flow of oil and to capture what ’s escaping ?
Those were the first two .
The third section was what can this group do in terms of having ongoing value in studying the environmental impact to the underwater community and in possibly forming the basis of the framework for a national rapid response team , which we do n’t seem to have , ” Cameron explained .
“ We think , you know , we need to have a permanent group that can come in on day one of a crisis and assist . ”
“ Does the government want to rely on BP or another oil company for all of its intel coming out of the site or do they want their own independent capability to go in and see what ’s happening ?
We have that ability , submersibles , ROVs , all kinds of vehicles that could get down there .
Why does n’t the federal government have that independent capability aside from the oil company ? ” wondered Cameron .
Cameron offered one idea for plugging the well .
“ Our group ’s recommendation is to go back to the ‘ top kill ’ type of process where you get heavy oil drilling mud down the well , build up some hydrostatic pressure .
And the way we think you do this is you throttle the well at the surface , you create enough back pressure , which they did n’t have before , ” said Cameron .
The Avatar director told Lauer that he was taken out of context when he reportedly called the people in charge of the spill “ morons . ”
The New York Post suggested Cameron was calling the Obama administration morons .
He did n’t say who in particular — BP executives or Obama - administration officials — he was calling “ morons ” in a speech Wednesday at the All Things Digital conference in Palos Verdes , Calif .

“ I was talking about the BP people , who were out at the scene , trying to control the leak .
What I was doing — it ’s a classic out - of - context kind of quote , ” said Cameron .
This video is from NBC ’s Today Show , broadcast June 7 , 2010 .
A few years ago , THQ announced that they would be making an MMO game based on Games Workshop ’s Warhammer 40 K franchise , well , the wait is over as the game was announced at this year ’s E3 .
The new title under development at Austin - based Vigil Games will be called “ Dark Millennium Online “ .
THQ revealed that the game will allow players to “ select their race and enter a beautifully crafted world of intrigue , adventure and all - out war . ”
According to THQ , the game is also set to feature a “ strong graphics engine ” with claims that it is “ one of the best looking MMORPGs ever seen . ”
THQ games VP Danny Bilson also made a bold statement during an analyst meeting at E3 yesterday that Vigil ’s WH40K MMO , Dark Millennium Online , is meant to “ shake up Blizzard “ .
After showing the industry analysts a video demonstration of the game , Bilson said he wanted to show that Vigil is doing a lot of stuff that WoW currently is n’t , in THQ ’s eyes .

Information wants to flow and it wants to flow freely and torrentially .
Twitter , SMS , email , and RSS offer unprecedented access to information .
With all these channels of communication comes a deluge of overwhelming retweets , cross-chatter , spam , and inaccuracies .
How do you distinguish signal from noise without getting overwhelmed ?
Can we somewhat automate the process of filtering content into more manageable portions without sacrificing accuracy and relevance ?
These are the exact questions I attempted to answer during the recent earthquakes in Haiti and Chile .
As the Director and System Architect of SwiftRiver at Ushahidi , we 're working on an open - source software platform that helps journalists and emergency response organizations sift through real - time information quickly , without sacrificing accuracy .
These earthquakes , however unfortunate , offered extreme use - cases for testing ideas internally , as small nonprofits and organizations as large as the U.S. State Department were relying on us for verified information .
The approach SwiftRiver takes is to combine crowdsourced interaction with algorithms that weight , parse , and sort incoming content .
But before we get to that , let 's explore how real - time content is currently delivered and consumed .
User Experience and Real - Time Content
As we move into the future of the Web , it 's clear that real - time content is going to remain an increasingly important part of our online experience .
This makes it important to think about the implications these new ways of delivering information have for UI design .
We 've learned from design for Web 2.0 that less is more .
The buzzword simplexity was tossed around for a while to describe applications that did a lot under the hood , while managing to look simple on the frontend .
The layout of google.com is often cited as a good example of simplexity .
When you navigate to Google you 're presented , front and center , with a box that essentially asks you one question : what are you looking for ?
You type a phrase , and the application returns the results .
That seems like a very simple exchange , but software professionals can tell you there 's an incredible amount of work that goes into making such a simple task appear so…ordinary .
Likewise , other websites like mint.com and flickr.com , while not real - time apps , are great examples of making complex sets of processes seem easy .
Many other websites have taken completely different approaches to both tasks ( Web - based finance tracking and photo sharing , respectively ) , but I 'd propose that these two sites have succeeded because of ease of use and accesibiity as much as because of the services they offer .
Arguably , they 're more successful in comparison to their former competitors as a result .
So the simplicity of user interactions is important ; and can have a direct return in increased user engagement .
With real - time apps , the need for simplexity is compounded by the fact that simple needs to be fast , and easy to read .
In short , they need to answer the user question , " What am I supposed to pay attention to and when ? "
At this year 's CHIRP Conference , Twitter revealed that it 's attempting to address some of these very issues .
They previously only offered a few tools for the curation of user streams .
Search is one such mechanism ; to find something that 's already been said , we can search the backlog of tweets at search.twitter.com .
The lists feature is another ; to set up filters that continually organize what 's being said by people we trust on a given subject , we create lists of people knowledgeable on that subject .
It 's a list curated by repuation , but it still needs to be created .
And , finally , the act of following or unfollowing users is another mechanism of curation .
Who 's saying the things that we care about enough to listen to at all ?
Even still , the information available through Twitter is ephemeral .
If we go away from our Twitter accounts for a week , a day , an hour — hell , sometimes even a few seconds — we 'll receive content that 's very different than the content delivered at any other period of time .
This is a relatively new problem , a by - product of technology as we to speed up the means for communication .
But are these mechanisms for curation more useful or are they just more tools ?
More access to conversations from people whom we may or may not care about in all scenarios is both a gift and a curse .
When I do care , the information is there .
When I do n't , I still have to try to sift through it all to find what I 'm looking for .
The developers at Twitter recognize this and are now experimenting with algorithmic and manual approaches to drawing user attention to information that they deem relevant with sponsored tweets , popular tweets , and resonance .
The Existing Workflow
Right now emergency response organizations and journalists monitoring real - time news have workflows that involve several independent tools : a Twitter desktop client ( like Seesmic , Twhirl , TweetDeck , Tweetie , etc. ) , email , phone , feed readers , Google Alerts , and so on .
The tools are there but they 're scattered , offering little ( if any ) cohesion .
Curating Reputation
If there 's a unsolved problem here , I propose it 's this : there 's no easy way to aggregate the trust that a user has for specific content sources —
In other words , a way to carry the reputation I may have for various individuals across the Web with me .
You can make the decision that Blogger X is more reliable than Blogger Y , but just because Blogger X is authoratative most of the time on most subjects does n't mean he will be all the time .
On Wikipedia , for instance , changes to articles need to be approved by a group of peers .
Some users ( editors ) are given the rights to approve , disapprove , and edit the changes of other users , and they only answer to an even smaller group of peers and they hold more authority within that ecosystem than others .
However , you 'll also notice on Wikipedia that authoratative editors for entries on Steve Jobs are n't the same editors for Rush Limbaugh 's profile .
Editors at Wikipedia have to demonstrate they are both knowledgable on a subject and reliable enough that they wo n't sacrifice accepted truth for personal bias .
That 's one example .
Ranking by influnce or popularity is another .
An example of this is Twitter 's new feature , Resonance .
By measuring retweets , click –throughs , and other interactions , it determines the influence of a tweet .
So that 's reputation at its most basic level .
Distributed reputation , then , is the aggregate reputation accrued by a person 's contributions across the Web .
This is hugely important for changing the way we consume content because it helps users focus their attention on other users that have proven to offer the most value .
When I 'm reading the New York Times online and I look to the comment section of an article , might there one day be a way to see who among the commnetors has previously demonstrated they know what they 're talking about within the article 's specific context ?
If so , we could then filter the conversation by reputation rather than popularity .
With a distributed reputation system , the decisions of whether a source is trustworthy can be passed back to applications in ways that adds context to future decisions .
Reputation can be applied to users as well as content sources .
It can then be used as the basis for a number of filters : authority by subject , authority within an organization , on a social network , or in my feed reader .
It becomes a baseline we can use in a lot of ways .
The location of the source of content should also influence reputation .
Where an event occurs tells a user as much about why he should care about as when it occurred .
Was the person actually in Iran when he tweeted that media in Tehran was shutdown ?
If so , then we 'll probably be more interested in the following messages from that user than the guy in Australia recounting the events as they unfold from BBC World News coverage or even the BBC itself .
Why ?
If trust can be earned , then it can also be lost , so it needs to be continually maintained .
After all , because a source was right once , twice , or even a thousand times , does n't make it always right — and certainly not on every subject .
Even big news organizations are limited in what they cover and how well or quickly they can cover it .
This past year in Kampala , Uganda , there were a series of deadly riots that occured under the radar of international mainstream news for days .
Yet it was a situation that affected millions of lives here .
My peers and I relied upon Twitter and SMS for information .
Later , when the mainstream news picked up on what was going on , they were often wrong or misleading in what they reported .
In such a scenario , the news outlets were either clueless , or useless to people like myself .
Conversely , friends of mine who were chased down by military police as they tweeted absolutely earned my trust .
In that situation , I followed the information sources that it made sense to monitor for that situation .
Every scenario will be different , which is why a good distributed reputation system should be equally nuanced .
Speed of Delivery and Consumption
Another focus is the speed of delivery , as well as how quickly content can be presented or consumed .
The real - time workflow is all about speed — staying as close to moments of occurrence as possible .
After all , " breaking news " is n't breaking because it 's being reported a week after everyone else reported it .
It 's breaking because it 's happening right now .
A volcano in Iceland was recently shooting plumes of ash and rock 35,000 feet into the air and causing historic disruptions of air travel .
At one point in time that was breaking news .
It might very well still be news , but the real - time coverage of that event is no longer important .
It has already happened .
Time is the enemy when dealing with real - time content .
How long does it take someone to receive the report of a shooting at Fort Hood on Twitter ?
It could easily be seconds , providing that they have a good Internet connection and Twitter 's servers are n't down .
However , it could take far longer .
If information is only important now , or most important now , there wo n't ever be a better time to get that content to whomever might be looking for it .
A real - time application that 's slow in delivering information is obviously self - defeating .
Tools like pubsubhubbub , Ajax , and jQuery are are possible parts of the solution here , as is the optimization of databases and other background processes .
Managing Real - Time Information Channels
The newest version of NetVibes offers a unified dashboard that allows users to manage their email , text messages , RSS feeds and other content from around the Web in place .
But how can we allow this to happen autonomously without a central server or organization acting as the gatekeeper ?
With our platform , SwiftRiver , we are attempting to answer these questions .
SwiftRiver is an open source project being developed for aggregating and managing multiple channels of real - time news from the Web , including crowdsourced content from Twitter , SMS , and email .
It attempts to streamline the mining fo data in real - time in a number of ways .
Structuring Unstructured Data
The only reason we as content consumers tend to treat data differently is because of the different tools we normally use to receive them .
In a scenario like the Haiti earthquakes , we needed to find information that was urgent across many differnt types of media quickly .
We quickly realized that it was exceedingly inefficient to monitor hundreds of different information sources from different applications ( Twitter , RSS , SMS , and email ) so we developed SwiftRiver to centralize similar flows of information .
The flow of data within our application begins with aggregating unstructured ( rather , differently structured ) datasets , reformatting them through various processes , centralizing them in our database , and then returning one unified feed .
Once the data is aggregated , SwiftRiver does three things to optimize it .
We filter out duplicate content , structure data into a unified object model , and then use our natural language processing program , SiLCC , to extract keywords and apply them as tags .
When users launch their SwiftRiver instances , they 're already dealing with structured data .
This allows them to worry about more important things like what the information is telling them and ( in the case of emergency response organizations ) how they might need to respond .
Persistent Tagging
The automation of the tagging process saves a great deal of time .
Many social news sites rely solely upon their users to tag content to varying degrees of success .
This approach places this feature at the mercy of user engagement .
If user engagement is high , tags are created as desired .
If user engagement is less than average , then some content wo n't get tagged at all .
I'm of the opinion that tags are grossly unappreciated as they add the first layer of semantic taxonomy to content on the Web .
We 've attempted to solve the problem of lackluster tagging by users with auto - tagging algorithms performed by our SiLCC app , which ensures that all aggregated content ( tweets , emails , text messages ) are tagged and sorted .
This means that there is at least some level of taxonomy available to all aggregated content , regardless of the source .
Since user engagement is a variable that we cannot predetermine , we instead use active learning techniques to apply those interactions ( where they exist ) to the improvement of the algorithm .
Text is parsed , entities are extracted , semantic meaning is deduced , and the program learns from its mistakes through user feedback .
SiLCC was specifically built to address the auto - tagging of tweets and text messages , tasks that groups like Open Calais , TagThe .
Net , and other semantic Web applications do n't currently offer .
Veracity
We represent trust of sources with what we refer to as the veracity score .
This score is the acculmulated authority of a content item 's source .
For an email , the source would be the sender 's email address ; for a Tweet , it would be the user 's Twitter account name ; for blogs and news , it 's the website or feed URL ; and for an SMS , it 's the sender 's phone number .
As users rate individual items , the source accumulates a score that weights other content from that same source .
The allows content producers whom users repeatedly deem authoritative to rise to the top .
This speeds up the process of filtering through larger datasets — say , hundreds of feeds — that one might be monitoring .
The user can then deal with trusted content prior to dealing with unknown or less reliable sources .
A veracity filter control sets a bracket range ( high and low ) for the type of content sources aggregated .
In crisis situations , it 's critical that the user be able to sweep through all the sources deemed to be authoritative ( those with high scores ) first , before dealing with anything else .
This does n't imply that the rest of the aggregated content does n't need to be dealt with ; it simply prioritizes information from sources that have been reliable in the past .
The score itself is also dynamic — because trust is earned , it can also be lost .
This goes back to the idea of an aggregate distributed reptuation .
In the case of the earthquakes in Haiti , the people emailing or texting with information about missing friends or people trapped under rubble would be prioritized over the thousands of people talking about sending money to the victims .
Both types of conversation will turn up in a search for the hashtag # Haiti but we call the latter cross- chatter — information that 's related to the event , but not to the current conversation about that event .
Thus , a SwiftRiver instance set up to track earthquakes would calculate different veracity scores than one set up to monitor donations to Haiti .
The context is different so the scores are different .
Learning on the Fly
In developing SwiftRiver , we 've learned a great deal about mining real - time content .
The things we 're doing with reputation ( our system is called RiverID ) were conceived from a scenario exactly like the one described above about inaccurate media sources .
We extended the ideas to user interaction because the system is even more powerful when the reputation of a user affects his or her authority to rate sources or other users .
Persistent Tagging came about to help users sort aggregated information on the fly .
The scoring of content helps users prioritize where they focus their attention .
Each feature was rooted in a desired user interaction .
Before I conclude , I 'd also like to add that there 's an inherent bias in Western nations ( where bandwidth and Internet access is plentiful ) to assume that the real - time ( or near real - time ) conversation begins and ends on the Web .
This is simply not the case worldwide .
The majority of the connected planet still relies on text messages ( SMS ) , phone calls , and radio for news .
So , perhaps as a discussion for another day , I 'd like to explore the importance of developing systems with multiple points of access .
We developed SwiftRiver with this in mind so people in the most remote village without smartphones , without access to the Internet , and without computers can at the very least still act as nodes of information for our Swift .
While SwiftRiver is being developed with a particular use - case in mind ( monitoring emergencies ) it obviously has a number of other possible applications .
A system like this could be used to monitor anything : celebrity scandal , environmental news , political news .
The software and ideas behind it are subject - agnostic .
The contstant is how we process information to help surface the items that may be more relevant in a given scenario to our users .
BOSTON --
The central dogma of molecular biology , as proposed in 1970 by Francis Crick and James Watson , holds that genetic information is transferred from DNA to functional proteins by way of messenger RNA ( mRNA ) .
This suggests that mRNA has but a single role , that being to encode for proteins .
Now , a cancer genetics team at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ( BIDMC ) suggests there is much more to RNA than meets the eye .
In a study appearing in the June 24 , 2010 issue of Nature , the authors describe a new regulatory role for RNA -- independent of their protein - coding function - that relies on their ability to communicate with one another .
Of potentially even greater significance , because this new function also holds true for thousands of noncoding RNAs , the discovery dramatically increases the known pool of functional genetic information .
The new findings suggest that nature has crafted a clever tale of espionage such that thousands upon thousands of mRNAs and noncoding RNAs , together with a mysterious group of genetic relics known as pseudogenes , take part in undercover reconnaissance of cellular microRNAs , resulting in a new category of genetic elements which , when mutated , can have consequences for cancer and human disease at large .
" Because this new function does not depend on the blueprint that RNAs harbor in their protein - encoding nucleotide sequence , the discovery additionally holds true for the thousands of noncoding RNA molecules in the cell , " explains senior author Pier Paolo Pandolfi , MD , PhD , Director of Research at the BIDMC Cancer Center and George C. Reisman Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School .
" This means that not only have we discovered a new language for mRNA , but we have also translated the previously unknown language of up to 17,000 pseudogenes and at least 10,000 long non-coding ( lnc ) RNAs .
Consequently , we now know the function of an estimated 30,000 new entities , offering a novel dimension by which cellular and tumor biology can be regulated , and effectively doubling the size of the functional genome . "
MicroRNAs are small RNA molecules that repress the expression levels of numerous genes by binding to mRNA , thereby preventing it from delivering its protein coding message .
As a result , microRNAs are known to have a hand in human diseases , including cancer .
But , the Pandolfi team thought that RNA might be taking a different tactic .
" Although it is conventional knowledge that microRNA can block mRNA function , we suspected that the roles of microRNA and mRNA were actually flipped , " explains Pandolfi .
" In other words , instead of microRNA binding to mRNA , we thought that RNAs were actually sequestering the microRNAs , thereby protecting mRNA and rendering the microRNAs ineffective on their other targets . "
And , indeed this proved to be the case .
The authors coined the term " competitive endogenous RNAs " or " ceRNAs " to describe this new RNA activity .
To further test their hypothesis , the scientists turned to pseudogenes , a group of " genetic relics " that do not encode for proteins .
Since pseudogenes are more or less identical to their ancestral genes , the authors knew they would be the perfect " combatants " because they would both recognize and compete for the same group of microRNAs as their ancestral genes .
The scientists studied the interaction between the RNA encoding for the PTEN tumor suppressor gene and its closely related pseudogene , PTENP1 .
Through this new mechanism , they were able to demonstrate that PTENP1 also acts as a tumor suppressor .
They also proved this to be true for the KRAS oncogene and its pseudogene KRAS1P ; in this case the pseudogene was acting as a new oncogene .
" We now understand how these RNA units talk with one another , " says Pandolfi .
" Because all RNA molecules are competing to be heard , it had been difficult to tease out the messages amid the noise .
But now that we know what to listen for , we can computationally predict which RNA can act as a ceRNA and what that ceRNA can do .
And we can apply these findings to any RNA molecule .
" We have identified PTENP1 and KRAS1P as well as several thousand other uncharacterized RNA molecules as potential new factors contributing to human disease , " he adds .
" These findings help define a new fundamental biological dimension that we hope will allow for the rapid identification and functional characterizations of new disease - related genes including cancer , thereby improving diagnosis and effective therapy . "

Leave the Lights On or Turn them Off ?
In 1988 and 1989 , there was an interesting and humorous sequence of papers in Interfaces considering whether or not lights should be turned off when leaving a room .
The primary trade - off is that while energy is saved with the bulbs off , the bulb life span is diminished each time it is turned on .
The first article , Should We Turn off the Lights When Leaving ? by Charles Mosier , George Sheldon and Glen Avery ( full citation below ) proposes a simple decision rule for turning off lights when leaving a room that depends on :
arrival rate of individuals into the room
amount of time an individual is in a room
power usage per bulb ( in watts )
electricity cost ( $ per kilowatt hour )
purchase price of a bulb
labor cost of replacing a bulb
A few months later , the article Turn off the Lights by Paul Randolph appeared in Interfaces .
Randolph questions extrapolations of a linear regression used in the Mosier et al. paper to relate bulb life span to maximum starts per hour .
He also points out that determination of arrival rate and time spent in a room would require “ considerable data collection ” , suggesting this would be more work than is justified .
But essentially , he argues that bulb life reductions due to start - ups are minimal with the technology of that day ( late 1980s ) and are more than compensated by the power savings .
Along the way he cites his academic vice president , Ann Landers , and a Navy Civil Engineering Laboratory .
And this left Mosier and Sheldon with a huge opening .
In Leave the D*** Lights
On , they start by picking apart these sources :
… it is common knowledge among experienced faculty that academic vice - presidents and their ilk are simply not to be cited in cases where truth and accuracy are considered important .
Ann Landers is taken to task for her “ lack of skill in applying scientific thought to a problem ” as illustrated in another column of hers on weight loss product advertisements .
And the Navy , while credited for being good at what they do , is questioned as a model for least cost operation .
Mosier and Sheldon get serious later on in the paper , addressing the issues raised by Randolph .
See the papers for more information .
The technology has changed even more since the time the papers were written and light sensors have become far more wide - spread .
But the debate continues .
The US Dept. of Energy has a web page about the topic .
It says :
the operating life of all types of light bulbs is affected by how many times they are turned on and off .
The more often they are switched on and off , the lower their operating life .
The exact number of hours that switching lights on and off reduces the total operating life depends on the type of light and how many times it is switched on and off .
And about fluorescent bulbs :
For most areas of the United States , a general rule - of - thumb for when to turn off a fluorescent light is if you leave a room for more than 15 minutes , it is probably more cost effective to turn the light off .
Or in other words , if you leave the room for only up to 15 minutes , it will generally be more cost effective to leave the light ( s ) on .
In areas where electric rates are high and / or during peak demand periods , this period may be as low as 5 minutes .

As The Lede points out , the more Mavi Marmara passengers who talk to the press , the more the Israeli official narrative about their landing on the deck of the ship is challenged .
Accounts of Israeli troops shooting passengers between the eyes are particularly chilling .
Aljazeera English broadcast an interview with Jamal ElShayyal , a journalist aboard the Mavi Marmara .
In it , he asserted that the Israelis opened fire as they were boarding the vessel , and that one passenger took a bullet through the top of his head .
Many passengers have now confirmed that they were fired on even before the commandos had boots on the deck .
Presumably it is this suppressive fire that killed or wounded some passengers and which provoked an angry reaction and an attack on the commandos .
The Independent in the UK constructs a timeline for the Israeli attack that has twenty or so passengers attempting to stop the Israeli commandos from boarding their vessel , with some success .
With four commandos captured by the aid activists and with boarding the ship now difficult , Israeli commanders appear to have authorized the use brute force .
Cenk Uygur of the Young Turks discusses the controversy around the Israeli killing of an American citizen of Turkish extraction :
He argues that this killing was an execution .
As for the victim having lived most his life in Turkey , Cenk wonders if he would have been discounted as a citizen if he had lived most of his life in Israel .

In case you were tempted to buy the faux Washington outrage at BP and its gulf oil spill in recent days , here 's a story that reveals a little - known corporate political connection and the quiet way the inner political circles intersect , protect and care for one another in the nation 's capital .
And Chicago .
We already knew that BP and its folks were significant contributors to the record $ 750 - million war chest of Barack Obama 's 2007 - 08 campaign .
Now , we learn the details of a connection of Rahm Emanuel , the Chicago mayoral wannabe , current Obama chief of staff , ex-representative , ex-Clinton money man and ex-Windy City political machine go - fer .
Shortly after Obama 's happy inaugural , eyebrows rose slightly upon word that , as a House member , Emanuel had lived the last five years rent - free in a D.C. apartment of Democratic colleague Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and her husband , Stanley Greenberg .
For an ordinary American , that would likely raise some obvious tax liability questions .
But like Emanuel , the guy overseeing the Internal Revenue Service now is another Obama insider , Tim Geithner , who had his own outstanding tax problems but skated through confirmation anyway by the Democratic - controlled Congress .
Remember this was all before the letters BP stood for Huge Mess .
Even before the Obama administration gave BP a safety award .
Now follow these standard Washington links if you can :
Greenberg 's consulting firm was a prime architect of BP 's recent rebranding drive as a green petroleum company , down to green signs and the slogan " Beyond Petroleum . "
Greenberg 's company is also closely tied to a sister Democratic outfit -- GCS , named for the last initials of Greenberg , James Carville , another Clinton advisor , and Bob Shrum , John Kerry 's 2004 campaign manager .
According to published reports , GCS received hundreds of thousands of dollars in political polling contracts in recent years from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee .
Probably just a crazy coincidence .
But you 'll never guess who was the chairman of that Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee dispensing those huge polling contracts to his kindly rent - free landlord .

Tens of thousands of Uzbeks are fleeing ethnic violence in southern Kyrgyzstan amid what one aid official described Sunday as a " humanitarian catastrophe , " according to the International Committee of the Red Cross .
At least 114 people have been killed in the clashes and another 1,458 have been wounded , Kyrgyzstan 's national news agency AKI press reported .
Earlier Sunday , the government put the figures at nearly 100 people dead and more than 700 hospitalized since fighting broke out Thursday night .
According to one report , the death toll is much higher .
Officials in Osh , the city most affected by the violence , said at least 500 ethnic Uzbeks have been killed , according to Ferghana .
Ru , an independent news agency .
An estimated 80,000 refugees have fled across the Kyrgyz border into neighboring Uzbekistan , according to ICRC spokeswoman Anna Nelson .
Are you there ?
Send videos , photos
Nelson told CNN that ICRC representatives visited refugee camps Sunday in Uzbekistan , where 30,000 adults , mostly women , have registered .
Each woman , Nelson said , has two or three children with her .
Uzbek authorities are providing refugees with food and shelter , but camps are already inundated by the flood of people crossing the border , Nelson said .
ICRC officials said they saw 250 injured people in the camps , including about 40 Uzbek men with gunshot wounds , according to Nelson .
" We do not yet fully understand the true scale of the humanitarian catastrophe that is unfolding in southern Kyrgyzstan , " said Francois Blancy , deputy head of the ICRC regional office in Tashkent , Uzbekistan .
Meanwhile , armed groups were fighting each other for control of the main hospital in the Kyrgyz city of Jalal - Abad , Russia Today reported , as the clashes continue in the strategically important central Asian country .
Severine Chappaz , the deputy head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kyrgyzstan , said Sunday that officials are concerned for the security of the civilian population as well as medical staff treating the injured .
" The situation is still volatile , " Chappaz told CNN .
" We are now in Osh , and we 're hearing some shootings .
There were a lot of shootings during the day near the provincial hospital . "
Chappaz said the Red Cross was sending medical personnel to remote villages where civilians were unable to reach hospitals , but " there 's no security really guaranteed . "
Kyrgyzstan hosts a U.S. military transport base that is vital for supplying its troops in Afghanistan .
It also has a Russian military base and strategically important natural gas pipelines .
Russia dispatched additional paratroopers to its base in Kyrgyzstan on Sunday in support of service members already there , Russian news agency Interfax reported , citing a military source .
" The task of the battalion is to guard Russian military facilities and guarantee the security of Russian servicemen and their families " amid the ongoing clashes , he told Interfax .
The violence pits ethnic Kyrgyz against Uzbeks , and comes in the wake of the overthrow of the country 's government in April .
An interim government is in place in the capital Bishkek .
The Kyrgyz interim leader , Roza Otunbayeva , has asked for Russian peacekeepers to help end the unrest , the result of interethnic tensions that have been brewing for weeks .
But so far Russia has declined to send more than humanitarian aid .
" This is an internal conflict , and Russia does not yet see the conditions for its participating in resolving it , " said Natalya Timakhova , spokeswoman for Russian President Dmitry Medvedev .
Uzbeks , which make up about 15 percent of the population , " are severely under - represented " in Kyrgyzstan 's central and local governments , according to Peter Zalmayev , director of the Eurasia Democracy Initiative .
" The Uzbek language is still to attain the level or the status of the official language , " Zalmayev told CNN .
" Scores of Uzbek language publications and schools have been closed down so there is that resentment . "
On the other side , Kyrgyz citizens are wary of Uzbeks living in the southern part of the country , according to Zalmayev .
" The fear is that Uzbekistan will eventually invade [ Kyrgyzstan ] ... to secure water resources since it lacks sufficient resources of its own , " Zalmayev said .
The interim government on Saturday worked to quell the upsurge of violence , imposing states of emergency in Osh , where fighting between ethnic Uzbek and Kyrgyz youths led to mass rioting , and in Jalal - Abad in order to keep the unrest from spreading there , it said .
But the measures did little to calm the situation Sunday , and Russia Today reported that the interim government has given police permission to shoot to kill rioters on the streets .
Members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization ( CSTO ) -- comprised of Kyrgyzstan , Russia , Armenia , Belarus , Kazakhstan , Uzbekistan and Tajikistan -- are set to meet Monday to discuss the crisis , official Russian news agency RIA - Novosti reported .
Amateur video obtained by CNN appears to show dozens of bloodied bodies lined up along a street in Osh as bystanders rush to cover them .
The corpses all appear to be men , and one appears to be charred .
Extra army and police units have been dispatched to try to maintain order , and a 6 p.m. - to - 6 a.m. curfew has been imposed in several districts of southern Kyrgyzstan until June 20 , the government said .
The United States is monitoring developments and is calling for a " rapid restoration of peace and public order in the city of Osh and elsewhere where it appears ethnic violence is occurring , " according to a statement released Saturday by the State Department .
A small group of expatriates from Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan demonstrated outside the White House on Sunday , calling for President Obama 's help in ending the crisis .
About 50 people from the Uzbek Indicative Group carried signs reading " Stop the killing " and chanted " Bring peace to Kyrgyzstan . "
The group had earlier sent a letter to Obama " urging the United States and the United Nations to assist in bringing a halt to the current ethnic unrest in southern Kyrgyzstan , " describing the clashes as " the worst ethnic violence in the region since 1990 when hundreds were killed before the quick intervention of Soviet troops . "
CNN 's Matthew Chance , Eve Bower and Brian Walker contributed to this report .
Agents with the U.S. Customs and Border Protection service are coming under scrutiny for killing two individuals near the border with Mexico in recent weeks .
In San Diego , CA , an illegal immigrant who lived in the United States for 27 years was killed after a border guard shot him with a Taser gun .
Anastacio Hernández Rojas , a 42 - year - old construction worker and father of five children , was deported to Mexico last week after a run-in with local police .
He was trying to re-enter the country when border agents arrested him and prepared to send Hernández back to Mexico .
Media accounts say Rojas struggled with border guards , prompting one of them to use a Taser to subdue him .
The electric shock allegedly caused Hernández to suffer a fatal heart attack
Following the Hernández controversy , a border patrol officer shot and killed a 15 - year - old boy standing on a bridge in El Paso , TX , that straddles the border between the two countries .
Authorities claim the boy , Sergio Adrian Hernández Guereca , may have been throwing rocks at officers who were detaining illegal immigrants nearby .
He was on the Mexican side of the border when he was shot .

What ’s The Score Officer ?
With many of the world ’s leading politicians set to touch down in Toronto this week for the G20 Summit , police in the downtown area were out on their horses looking for any suspicious activity .
But that was n’t all they were looking out for .
Not even the task of maintaining a safe and secure area for the likes of Barack Obama and Tony Blair , amongst others , was enough to pull these officers away from the big screen during an intense World Cup match between Mexico and Uruguay .
Safety is always an issue at the G20 Summit .
As a result , Toronto is expected to spend close to $ 1 billion of taxpayers money on security .
Is n’t it nice to see where our paychecks are really going ?
Hope you officers enjoy the game while we are stuck at work earning money to pay your wages .

Watch out Dina Lohan — the cake police are on the hunt for you !
Lindsay Lohan ’s mom was out and about in East Meadow , New York , on Wednesday when she stopped by a Carvel Ice Cream store , to buy a cake for her youngest son Cody ‘s 14th birthday celebrations .
While at the counter , the high - profile mom said she produced a special Carvel promotional ‘ Black ’ card — essentially a VIP card for Carvel ice cream lovers .
That ’s when Dina tells RadarOnline.com exclusively that the store employee went ballistic .
“ The shop assistant said , ‘ Do you have I.D. ? ’ ” Dina said .
“ Next minute he he grabbed my arm and took my card and held it hostage and would n’t give me the cake !
“ This guy was crazy ! ”
PHOTO : Lindsay Rocks A White Bikini
The Carvel ‘ Black ’ card is the ultimate status symbol of ice - cream .
Dina explained she and all the Lohans have ‘ Black ’ cards , gifting them free ice cream for 75 years .
However , her mistake was : she picked up 16 - year - old daughter Ali ’s card .
“ I did n’t think it be a problem , ” Dina said .
“ I could n’t believe this guy … it ’s a family card , it just did n’t have my name on it .
“ Next minute , four cop cars showed up , there ’s a police helicopter over head and this guy makes it seem to the cops that I ’m trying to use a stolen credit card — and for what ?
Over a free ice cream ? ! ”
A humiliated Dina said she explained the situation to the cops .
But when the men in black asked the Carvel employee to return Dina ’s card , he would n’t budge .
“ He would n’t give it back … not even to the cops ! ” Dina joked .
“ Finally he gave up and gave me my card back .
But he told me , ‘ You can have the card , but you ca n’t have the cake ! ’
“ It just shows how we get treated so much worse than regular people . ”

In Manhattan
It would seem that the big loser in the fiasco was the birthday boy , who was denied his favorite ice cream cake .
Now Dina is going to make Carvel pay .
“ Just wait until Lindsay and Ali hear about this , ” she said .
“ When Ali gets back , I ’m going to bring her in everyday to this store — and you can print that ! ”
Sani Kaita sees red for a foul on Vassillis Torosidis
Nigeria midfielder Sani Kaita has had more than 1,000 death threats since being sent off during Thursday 's 2 - 1 loss to Greece at the World Cup .
" Kaita has received more than 1,000 threats to his e-mail from Nigeria , " said team spokesman Peterside Idah .
" We are taking these threats very seriously .
We 've spoken to the Nigerian government and also written to Fifa . "
Nigeria were leading 1 - 0 when Kaita saw red for kicking out at Greece 's Vassillis Torosidis in the 33rd minute .
The Super Eagles went on to concede two goals , seriously damaging their chances of reaching the knockout stages in South Africa .
" We consider it a very serious matter because this is a young man who is putting his best at the service of his country and football , " stated Idah .
" That is why the team received the news of the threat to his life with shock and disappointment and is urging the authorities in Nigeria to take measures to protect him . "
Idah added that the 24 - year - old midfielder was " terribly shaken , but , fortunately , he is receiving great support from his team - mates and team officials " .
Nigeria take on South Korea at the Moses Mabhida stadium in Durban on Tuesday and must win to stand any chance of qualifying for the last 16 .
A WELLINGTON funeral home has stepped in and stopped a fake mourner who was gatecrashing funerals , eating the food on offer , and even taking home leftovers .
The " grim eater " attended up to four funerals a week during March and April before the Harbour City Funeral Home stopped him , the Dominion Post reported .
Director Danny Langstraat said the company eventually grew concerned enough to take a photograph of the man and distribute it to its branches .
" He was showing up to funeral after funeral , and he did n't know the deceased , " Mr Langstraat said .
The man , thought to be aged in his 40s , went to different churches and venues around the city 's eastern suburbs .
" We saw him three or four times in a week .
And certainly he had a backpack with some Tupperware containers , so when people were n't looking , he was stocking up . "
The man was " quiet and polite , and did as the rest of the mourners in paying respects " .
Mr Langstraat also said he was respectably dressed .
But he did suggest the man could have had mental health issues , because he was not discreet about taking the food .
He stopped coming after a staff member took him aside , telling him he could still come to funerals but could not take food home with him .

In reply to a email asking his thoughts on Google 's announcement of the royalty - free WebM video codec , Steve Jobs reportedly simply forwarded back the critical expose profiled yesterday by AppleInsider .
Jobs ' terse reply to the question " What did you make of the recent VP8 announcement ? " left little doubt about Apple 's views on the matter , because the linked report Jobs returned , written by x264 developer Jason Garrett - Glaser , castigated the new specification for video compression as being weak , incomplete , and undoubtedly encumbered by patent issues .
Note that x264 is an open source project for encoding H.264 compliant video .
It has no inherent bias in promoting the H.264 specification over VP8 .
Garrett - Glaser has been a vocal critic of elements of the MPEG standards process , the x264 project itself is an effort to get around commercial licensing of MPEG 's technologies , and the similarities between VP8 and H.264 mean that x264 could likely be adapted to encode VP8 as well .
Jobs ' problem with VP8 is not ideological
Critics of Apple have settled on condemning the company for not rushing to embrace the free new video codec , which Google acquired as part of the technology portfolio of On2 and has published as an open source , royalty free specification .
However , the only real value of VP8 over H.264 is that it is royalty free ; it 's not as sophisticated as the latest MPEG - 4 specification in terms of compression quality or efficiency , nor does it offer a comparable technical range of use .
VP8 can't currently support Apple 's needs as a mobile - optimized codec for its iPods , iPads and iPhones , nor is it suitable for high definition video encoding .
VP8 is targeted directly at the web , where Google , Mozilla and other partners hope to use it to deliver video without the royalties required by H.264 .
Apple has no issue paying royalties to license MPEG's H.264 technologies because the royalties are not very expensive .
The H.264 licensing fees are really only a relevant cost issue for groups like Mozilla wanting to give their software away for free .
The problem is that video experts such as Garrett - Glaser are reporting that VP8 is not only unfinished and incomplete , but will also run afoul of the broad range of patents covering the latest video compression and decoding technologies .
Those patents are held by a wide consortium of vendors who have pooled their technology together under the direction of the ISO 's Motion Picture Experts Group .
Apple is not the patent holder to worry about
Most reports on the issue have focused on Apple 's membership in the MPEG coalition in order to write up a fashionably dramatic tale of conflict between Apple and Google on the issue of the VP8 codec .
However , the reality is that the patents related to H.264 are held by a large number of companies scaling from embedded chip makers to video software developers to university research groups to Blu - Ray hardware vendors .
Apple has a minority stake in the MPEG - 4 patent pool related to video codec technology , and would actually benefit from a sophisticated yet free video codec , were one to exist .
Rather than Apple , it is the actual codec patent holders that will come after VP8 looking for royalties , and unless Google subsidizes the world 's use of VP8 ( and it will not ) , it appears certain that anyone who uses the " royalty - free " codec will end up having to pay royalties for its use anyway .
Because it is not immune to patent royalties , all VP8 really offers in comparison to H.264 is less sophistication and a more incomplete and immature specification .
A strangely ideological puzzle
The apoplectic fit surrounding H.264 and its patented technology is quite bizarre in that the MPEG - 4 working group that developed it did n't invent some new patent problem that has n't existed before and desperately needs to be solved .
Those insisting on calling H.264 " proprietary " because it is not completely free have never referred to other open , but not free standards ( including the MP3 audio format ) , as " proprietary . "
Additionally , it was Apple 's iTunes that spearheaded the move from MP3 toward the more modern and efficient AAC audio format in order to shift the world 's technology from the more expensive to license MP3 format to the cheaper and / or free to use AAC .
If there were a cheaper , suitable option to paying for H.264 , Apple would similarly jump on it .
Back in the early 2000s , both Microsoft and Sony were pushing to replace MP3 with completely proprietary formats : Microsoft 's Windows Media Audio and Sony's ATRAC .
None of the current critics of H.264 in the mainstream tech media had any issue with that potential shift toward completely proprietary and closed standards back then .
It was only the success of the iPod that drove the world toward AAC as an open standard and preserved MP3 as a compatible fallback .
The web wants to be free
The web presents a slightly different set of circumstances because open source projects like Mozilla 's Firefox can't legally bundle support for H.264 without paying royalties on the technology .
It would be ideal if the world had video playback technology that was competitive , efficient for use on mobile devices , and completely free .
Unfortunately , this simply does not exist in the world of video where massive amounts of research and development go into developing new technology to encode , transmit and decode video efficiently .
That results in researchers and scientists needing to get paid for their efforts .
The last time the web 's media was significantly encumbered by a patent issue was with the GIF image file format , which was not itself patented , but which used a compression technology that Unisys claimed to own in the mid 90s , long after GIF had entered wide use on the Internet .
The company vilified itself by demanding significant royalties from all companies that used or created GIF images commercially .
An effort to replace the patent - encumbered GIF with the new PNG format was initiated , but despite the creation of PNG as a technically superior , royalty free , and patent free new format , it was nearly impossible for the world to switch away from using GIF .
While work on PNG started in 1995 , it was not officially recognized as an ISO standard until 2003 , when the patents on GIF finally began to expire ( making the GIF problem a non-issue ) .
Microsoft 's Internet Explorer did n't effectively support PNG until 2005 .
PNG is a relatively simple image format , dramatically less complex than the technology needed to encode , deliver and decode high quality video over an unreliable transport network like the Internet .
That makes PNG 's decade long march toward replacing GIF a cautionary tale for those expecting VP8 to serve as an immediate drop - in replacement for H.264 , which has become the established video format on the web , for mobiles , and for a wide range of other uses ranging from video games to Blu - Ray .
Is VP8 patent encumbered ?
Like GIF and its encumbrance with a compression - related patent , VP8 is said to be based closely enough upon H.264 so that the MPEG Licensing Authority will demand patent royalties for it .
MPEG LA is already investigating and expects to set up a licensing program for collecting VP8 royalties , according to a report by All Things Digital 's John Paczkowski .
Unlike PNG , VP8 is not technically superior to H.264 , making it that much more difficult to propagate across the Internet as a new video standard , even if it were not patent encumbered at all .
And unlike the GIF patents , the patents on H.264's brand new technologies wo n't expire for a long time .
Google maintains that it has reviewed the VP8 technology it acquired and is sure that nobody will have to pay patent royalties for the technologies it uses .
However , Google 's acquisition of On2 was rushed through in January , and barely six months later the firm 's existing VP8 code implementation is being pushed out as a " specification , " much the same way Microsoft rushed its
Office file formats through a standards process to avoid having to support the already formally standardized OpenOffice formats .
Google was demonstrably in a hurry to quickly deliver a fix for the issue Mozilla raised about the use of H.264 on the web just last summer .
In contrast , Apple , Netscape and Sun all spent several years working through the code for projects they planned to release as open source ( including Darwin , Mozilla , and OpenSolaris ) in an effort to avoid any patent - related surprises .
No project has ever raced code from fully proprietary to open source in six months , casting serious questions on the quality of Google 's supposed vetting process for VP8 .
Local Mormon Temple Featured On MTV Cribs
LA JOLLA — Yesterday ’s episode of MTV Cribs included San Diego ’s own Church of Latter - Day Saints on their annual “ High and Mighty ” special , which features the most luxurious places of worship across the U.S .
The temple , which is hard to miss when driving along the I5 through La Jolla , has been a local landmark since its 1993 inception .
Many San Diegans are familiar with the temple ’s castle - like structure , but the interior has long been a mystery to most , since non-Mormons are n’t allowed to enter .
MTV ’s film crew was the first in history allowed to pass through the marble gates of the 72,000 square foot facility .
It turns out , as expected , the temple is just as glamorous on the inside as it is on the outside .
For starters , the lobby has its own Starbucks which serves decaffeinated beverages exclusively .
“ Unlike other religions , we do n’t need to be hopped - up on caffeine to have enough energy to praise the lord , ” said 23 - year - old Phillip Hinckley , a Mormon priest - in - training who gave MTV a tour of the temple .
The second floor of the temple features a holy water slide , which aims to take baptisms into the 21st century .
Mounted on the walls of the temple are various bible verses which are carved out of solid gold and encrusted in diamonds .
Verses like , “ For the love of money is a root of all sorts of evil ” ( Timothy 6:10 ) and “ The righteous is concerned for the rights of the poor ” ( Prov. 29:7 ) .
Critics of the church argue that the funds spent on expensive , over - the - top decor could be put to better use by going to charity .
Hinckley defended the church ’s position by saying , “ Look , when Jesus returns for his second coming , he ’s going to have a choice to make .
He can choose to stay at a 2 - star temple like the Lutheran Church in Clairemont , which does n’t even have an indoor pool for Christ ’s sake , or he can stay at a 5 - star temple resort overlooking the ocean .
There ’s no denying , we ’d all like the publicity . ”
Hinckley added , “ Our only major competition is the Vatican , but hell , even they do n’t have a bowling alley . ”
For the category of list articles in Lostpedia , see Category : Lists
Lists have appeared numerous times in Lost , most notably those made by the Others concerning survivors who , presumably in the eyes of Jacob , are either " good people " or " candidates " .
Contents show ]
Tail section list
Seconds after the mid-air break - up of Oceanic 815 , Ben ordered Goodwin to infiltrate the tail section survivors and make a list within three days .
( " A Tale of Two Cities " )
On the twelfth night after the crash , a group of Others came and took nine of the survivors .
Ana Lucia found a list on one of the Others , whom she had killed with a stone .
She realized that the list had the names of the nine people who had been taken , as well as what they looked like and what they were wearing .
Goodwin later told Ana Lucia that Nathan was not on the list because he " was not a good person . "
( " The Other 48 Days " )
Some of the people on the list were :
Eli
Jim
Emma
Zach
Nancy
Four unnamed tail section survivors
Middle section list
Ethan Rom was ordered by Ben to make a list of the Middle Section survivors " in three days [ after the crash ] " but it is unknown if he did before he was shot .
In " Maternity Leave " , Tom rebukes Ethan for failing to make a list before abducting Claire .
Jacob 's lists
The Others had a list of people to recruit from the survivors , which they called " Jacob 's list " .
According to Danny Pickett , this list excluded Jack , and Mikhail said it excluded Kate , Sayid and Locke because they were " flawed " , " weak and frightened " and " angry " .
( " I Do " ) ( " Par Avion " ) Ethan and Goodwin originally compiled the names , but Ben later alluded to a higher authority behind them , implying approval or revisions by Jacob .
( " The Other Woman " ) Right before killing Jacob , Ben bitterly recalled the many lists and instructions he passed down to the leader .
( " The Incident , Part 2 " )
Jacob had a separate list of candidates .
No candidates appeared on the recruitment list , and Jacob chose candidates for some of the very reasons that allegedly kept people off " Jacob 's list " of recruits .
Bea Klugh 's list
On November 9 , 2004 , Ben discussed with Juliet a plan to abduct Jack , Kate , and Sawyer , using Michael .
The plan was to convince Jack to perform medical treatment on Ben , using Kate and Sawyer to get him to do it .
( " Exposé " )
Thirteen days later , on November 22 , 2004 , Bea Klugh gave a list of four survivors to Michael .
She threatened that if he did n't return with those specific survivors ( and no others ) , he would never see Walt again .
( " Three Minutes " )
The people on the list were :
The group was ambushed at the capsule dump by the Others before reaching their settlement , and then taken by force to the Pala Ferry pier .
Walt was released to Michael , and the two were given a boat and compass heading to leave the Island .
Hurley was released and sent back to the survivors ' camp to tell them never to come back there .
( " Live Together , Die Alone , Part 1 " )
The other three were taken to the Hydra .
( " A Tale of Two Cities " )
In the Official Lost Podcast following the second season finale , the producers confirmed that Hurley was on the list because the Others thought he was the best candidate to deliver the message .
This list seems to have been created for a specific purpose and seems to be unrelated to the other lists mentioned .
Interestingly , the people on this list were the same that sat with Jacob around the fire three years later while a candidate was being selected for inheriting the position of protector of Island .
( " What They Died For " )
Other lists
Charlie 's list
In " Greatest Hits " , Charlie writes a list of the top five moments of his life , with the intent that Desmond deliver it to Claire after his predicted death .
As Charlie writes each memory down , he remembers them through flashbacks .
Juliet 's list
In " Something Nice Back Home " , Juliet writes a list of the medical supplies she needs for the appendectomy she is to perform on Jack .
She hands the list to Sun and sends her together with Jin , Charlotte and Daniel to the Staff to retrieve the items .
Ben 's list
Ben created a list for Sayid of people to kill who allegedly work for Charles Widmore .
Sayid reveals this to Elsa , a woman he is dating whose employer is on Ben 's list , in " The Economist " .
The list includes Peter Avellino , who is murdered by Sayid , along with Elsa 's employer and group of " others " that Sayid tells Ben will anticipate him coming after them .
Sayid suggests that there is more than one person left to kill when speaking with Ben .
This means that there are at least four people on the list including Avellino and Elsa 's employer .
Sayid is seen killing Ivan Andropov in " He 's Our You " .
Andropov is said by Ben to be the last of Widmore 's people that was a danger to the Oceanic 6 .
Michael 's list
When confronted by Charlotte Lewis in " Confirmed Dead " , Ben was able to give the names of everyone recruited for the island expedition in considerable detail , revealing that he gleaned it by having a spy on the boat .
In " Meet Kevin Johnson " , Ben tells Michael to compile a list for him with the name of everyone on the boat .
Widmore 's list
Charles Widmore informs
Sawyer that he has a list of names including " Ford , the Kwons , and Reyes , but not Kate Austen " so he says it does n't matter to him whether she lives or dies .

New government maintains it is for islanders to decide on sovereignty after Argentinian president 's overture
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Britain today batted away an Argentinian request to hold talks on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands , which has been a British territory since 1833 .
The rebuff from the Foreign Office followed an overture from Argentina 's president , Cristina Fernández de Kirchner , who was attending an EU - Latin America summit in Madrid .
Despite a changeover in government , Britain is sticking to its position that it is up the islanders to decide on sovereignty .
" We have no doubt about our sovereignty over the Falkland Islands .
The principle of self - determination as set out in the UN charter applies , " the Foreign Office minister of state , Jeremy Browne , said in a statement .
Ladies !
They can work the Internet just like men !
But they are better than men :
These “ hacktivists ” only use their computer powers - powers one would typically associate with bepenised members of the species - for good , tracking down pedophiles , pornographers , and people who have put mean things up on the web .
The psychic toll on the computer - using women is , of course , terrible - after such knowledge , what forgiveness , etc. - but I think we should all feel a little safer knowing that avenging angels are on our side .
And they have vaginas !
DETROIT -- Armando Galarraga squeezed the ball in his mitt , stepped on first base with his right foot and was ready to celebrate .
What happened next will be the talk of baseball for the rest of this season and likely a lot longer : the perfect game that was n't .
Umpire Jim Joyce emphatically called Cleveland 's Jason Donald safe , the Detroit Tigers argued and a chorus of groans and boos echoed in Comerica Park .
Then Joyce emphatically said he was wrong and later , in tears , hugged Galarraga and apologized .
" It was the biggest call of my career , and I kicked the [ stuff ] out of it , " Joyce said , looking and sounding distraught as he paced in the umpires ' locker room .
" I just cost that kid a perfect game . "
" I thought he beat the throw .
I was convinced he beat the throw , until I saw the replay , " he said after the Tigers ' 3 - 0 win .
Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski said Joyce asked to speak with Galarraga .
Denied the first perfect game in Tigers history , Galarraga appreciated the gesture .
" You do n't see an umpire after the game come out and say , ' Hey , let me tell you I 'm sorry , ' " Galarraga said .
" He felt really bad .
He did n't even shower . "
It 's rare for an umpire to acknowledge a mistake and , in one of the few sports that relies heavily on the human eye , it 's certain to prompt a push for Major League Baseball to use increased replays .
MLB declined comment on Joyce 's call .
" I feel sad , " Galarraga said .
" I just watched the replay 20 times and there 's no way you can call him safe . "
New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi said he thinks it 's worth another look .
" I think it 's something that baseball should look at possibly because if they do change it , it does n't affect the game .
It does n't affect the outcome . " he said after a 9 - 1 win over Baltimore .
" I know it will be the first time that it 's ever happened but you 're talking about a very unusual circumstance . "

Image caption Fashionable shoes can be worn occasionally
Pregnant women are risking their feet in the name of fashion by wearing the wrong types of shoes , experts warn .
A poll of 1,000 pregnant women for the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists found many regularly wore ballet pumps , flip flops , high heels and Ugg boots .
But Lorraine Jones from the society says none of these shoes are suitable because they offer little support .
The survey also suggests half feel under pressure to keep up with the latest celebrity trends .
Yet seven out of 10 women admitted to suffering from foot problems including swollen ankles ( 37 % ) , swollen feet ( 45 % ) and arch and heel pain ( 16 % ) while pregnant .
High heels alter your posture , shorten your calf muscles and place increased pressure on your back and knees Lorraine Jones , Podiatrist
The society is urging women to wear supportive , wide fitting shoes to minimise discomfort and avoid long - term damage .
Podiatrist Lorraine Jones said : " Weight gain and hormonal changes in pregnancy have a huge impact on the body .
" Muscles and ligaments soften and stretch because of an increase in the ovarian hormone relaxin , which makes your feet more prone to ankle and ligament strains on a daily basis .
" High heels alter your posture , shorten your calf muscles and place increased pressure on your back and knees .
" In pregnancy this places extra pressure on your joints when they are already under strain - which can result in a host of foot , leg and back problems and could increase the likelihood of falls . "
Suffering for fashion
Among those surveyed , 66 % regularly wore flip flops , 32 % wore high heels , 53 % wore ballet pumps and 30 % wore Ugg boots .
But all of these are unsuitable for daily wear in pregnancy because they do not provide the feet with the necessary support , according to Ms Jones .
As a rule , she says women should opt for 1.2in ( 3 cm ) heels as they shift weight a little further forward on to the feet , which can help alleviate discomfort .
If women must wear high heels , they should only do so very occasionally and at events where they will not be on their feet for too long , she adds .
" Many of the pregnant celebrities you see wearing high heels in magazines are attending events so , like them , try to keep your high - heeled , high - fashion shoes for a special occasion and stick to a more supportive shoe on a daily basis . "

Yesterday , we learned that the terms Apple set for the new iAd platform to be introduced with iOS4 were designed in such a way that many of Apple ’s competitors – including Google – are excluded from eligibility .
Specifically , the terms say that you cannot serve ads that would collect usage data unless you ’re a third - party ad agency .
That would now exclude Google ’s newly - acquired AdMob , among other potential servers such as Microsoft and RIM who – by chance – just happen to be some of Apple ’s competitors on more fronts than one .
Federal regulators are wary of this being unfair , however , and they ’re set to investigate whether or not Apple has the right to do such a thing .
Whether or not they do remains to be seen , but at least Google ’s being given a fair chance after the loopholes they had to get through to acquire AdMob in the first place .

If you are just starting out or still planning to do homesteading , then you most probably have begun indulging yourself with information and advice from your family , friends , or even the Internet !
Although not all can benefit your process , some may be helpful , some may be confusing , or worse , some information or advice may be incorrect .
It can be overwhelming when you finally come to know that there is a lot to learn about homesteading but you just have to relax .

Image caption Marcela and Felipe say they have no wish to discover their birth families
Scientists in Argentina have begun DNA tests on the adopted heirs to a media empire to see who their natural parents are .
A judge ordered the tests to see if Marcela and Felipe Noble Herrera were taken from people killed during military rule in the 1970s and 80s .
Human rights groups say the children were then given up for adoption .
The siblings say their privacy is being violated and there is no evidence against their adoptive mother .
Marcela and Felipe surrendered clothes so that samples of their DNA could be taken after a court order last week .
The DNA will be compared to samples given by hundreds of families whose relatives were tortured and murdered during military rule from 1976 to 1983 , a period known as Argentina 's Dirty War .
It may take weeks for the results to be known .
Victim support groups first said in 2001 that they believed the biological mothers of Marcela and Felipe were among the hundreds of women who gave birth in clandestine torture centres and were then murdered .
The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo group alleges that Ernestina Herrera de Noble , who owns the Clarin media conglomerate , illegally adopted them 34 years ago .
Marcela and Felipe say the demand for DNA tests is part of a politically motivated campaign against their adoptive mother , who has clashed with the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner .
Identity
They have said there is no evidence that they were born in jail and seized from their biological parents , and that they have no desire to know more about their birth families .
" Our identity is ours .
It 's a private thing and I do n't think it 's up to the state or the Grandmothers to come and tell us what is ours , " Marcela said .
They say that if the tests show they are the offspring of murdered political prisoners , they do not want to become the physical evidence against their mother .
Ernestina Herrera de Noble 's lawyer has said that the prosecution would still have to prove she knowingly adopted stolen children .
Under military rule , babies were often given to families considered loyal to the regime .
The Grandmothers have identified dozens of children of people who disappeared during this time .
But some adopted children have said they would rather not know their origins , especially if the information implicates their adoptive parents in illegal acts .
Australia 's bid to take Japan to the International Court of Justice over its so - called scientific whaling program may be about to get a boost .
Two former Japanese whalers have told the ABC's Foreign Correspondent program of systemic embezzlement by crewmen onboard the country 's whaling ships .
Speaking for the first time , they say that crew members are taking what amounts to hundreds of kilograms of prime cuts of whale meat , either for personal consumption or to sell on to restaurants .
One whistleblower , who asks to be called Kujira San - Japanese for " Mr Whale " - says this practice even extends to the body in charge of the scientific whaling program .
Kujira San , a former crewman on Japan 's whaling fleet flagship the Nisshin Maru , says what he is revealing could get him killed because his former shipmates do not tolerate those who break the code of silence .
" First , when the ship returns to Japan and arrives in the port , a transport truck is waiting .
The crewmen will then pack the whale meat they stole into a cardboard box .
One person carried off 500 to 600 kilograms , " he said .
He claimed some crewmen made a fortune from reselling the meat .
These are explosive allegations which , if true , undermine much of Japan 's claim that its whaling program is centred on scientific research .
Kujira
San 's claims are backed by another man , T San , who has more than 30 years of experience on whaling ships .
" It happened on the container on the bridge .
I had to check the temperature every day and when I went in there , there was a staff member from the Institute of Cetacean Research packing something , " he said .
" When I yelled , ' What are you doing ? ' he then tried to hide the package by spreading his arms out .
" It was red meat from the tail .
That is the highest quality whale meat . "
The Institute for Cetacean Research is the body in charge of Japan 's scientific research program , and both whaling whistleblowers allege serious corruption inside the program .
Junichi Sato works for Greenpeace Japan .
He and a colleague , Toru Suzuki , tracked the smuggled whale meat , intercepting one box containing 23 kilograms of prime cuts .
" We started following the boxes offloaded from the Nisshin Maru to the house of the crew members , " Mr Sato said .
They showed the Japanese media , then took the meat to prosecutors , who promised to investigate the alleged theft by crew members .
But a month later the two Greenpeace activists were arrested and charged with stealing .
Today Junichi Sato and Toru Suzuki , who are known as the Tokyo Two , are appearing at the final day of their trial .
They face up to 10 years in jail as well as the rage of many of their compatriots .
In Japan blowing the whistle on suspect practices inside the so - called scientific whaling program can mean being branded a traitor as well as possibly going to jail .
BODO , Nigeria 
Big oil spills are no longer news in this vast , tropical land .
The Niger Delta , where the wealth underground is out of all proportion with the poverty on the surface , has endured the equivalent of the Exxon Valdez spill every year for 50 years by some estimates .
The oil pours out nearly every week , and some swamps are long since lifeless .
Perhaps no place on earth has been as battered by oil , experts say , leaving residents here astonished at the nonstop attention paid to the gusher half a world away in the Gulf of Mexico .
It was only a few weeks ago , they say , that a burst pipe belonging to Royal Dutch Shell in the mangroves was finally shut after flowing for two months : now nothing living moves in a black - and - brown world once teeming with shrimp and crab .
Not far away , there is still black crude on Gio Creek from an April spill , and just across the state line in Akwa Ibom the fishermen curse their oil - blackened nets , doubly useless in a barren sea buffeted by a spill from an offshore Exxon Mobil pipe in May that lasted for weeks .
The oil spews from rusted and aging pipes , unchecked by what analysts say is ineffectual or collusive regulation , and abetted by deficient maintenance and sabotage .
In the face of this black tide is an infrequent protest  soldiers guarding an Exxon Mobil site beat women who were demonstrating last month , according to witnesses  but mostly resentful resignation .

They still do n't have an AP - consuming sprint feature ?
Or an NPC - weight - based physical charge / tackle feature ?
Or a quick melee function ?
Or binoculars ?
Or new ways of setting environmental traps ?
Or a bait feature to attract critters ?
Or Original Fallout 1 - 2 - Tactics weapons ?
Or weapons that only work during the day ( i.e. solar - powered ) ?
Or the ability to domesticate / train certain critters to be beasts of war ?
Or real x-rated material ?
Or BoS cybernetic implants that fundamentally alter core mobility / combat gameplay ?

" So combat consists of holding down the fire button and running backwards "
I prefer to hold it down and run forward , but the end result is still the same .
Tactical thinking in these games is limited severly by the lack of tact in th game .

ACTUALLY
There are Bos cybernetic implants that superficially alter a list of numbers that do n't affect mobility or combat gameplay at all , and you can buy them for 3000 bottle caps and if you cry because you do n't like how it changed how your character 's clothes look on him / her , you can talk to the guy and change them back for free !
Yay everyone wins .

Fallout 3 as much as a 3rd person shooter as all the johnny come lately fallout fans likely did .
But this video ... my god .
Way to prepare us for the ADVENTURE of Fallout guys .... remember when Fallout was an adventure game and not Halo ?
Here 's a reminder that governments , in addition to the U.S. , have really pushed the limits of stimulus .
Developed nations ( The OECD ) collectively have slashed their interest rates pretty close to zero as shown in the chart below , on the left .
They 've also let loose the spigot of government - provided liquidity as show on the right - hand side , below .
They 've exhausted the majority of their recession - fighting ammo .
Goldman :
Policy options limited if more stimulus is needed .
Policy is much easier than it was in 2008 / 2009 , inflation constraints are smaller and we have not seen a meaningful tightening cycle in most places .
But the flipside is that the options for fresh stimulus if the cycle slows again are severely constrained .
Fiscal policy is already being used to its limits in many places and conventional monetary policy is already fully employed in much of the G10 , and so only unconventional measures ( QE ) are left in the event of a renewed downturn .
This is why many policymakers have been so reticent to withdraw stimulus quickly , but it means that a renewed slowing in growth , either as a consequence of more pressure for fiscal adjustment or otherwise , could be much more dangerous .
( Via Goldman Sachs , Comparing the Sovereign Crisis and the Mortgage Crisis , Jim O'Neill , 9 June 2010 )
Retails sales fell unexpectedly and consumers cut back on spending , in yet another indication that May was rough month for the feeble recovery .
Retail sales tumbled by 1.2 % , making it the worst ( and first ) decline in eight months .
On top of last month 's poor private sector job creation , this is rotten news .
What 's happening ?
One acute cause is that sales of building materials took a 9 % hit last month , following the expiration of the housing credit .
More broadly , consumers are borrowing less , and saving more ( consumer credit has fallen 17 months in the last year ) .
In the long term , families with good credit is good news .
In the short term , the historic deleveraging of the last year and a half hurts aggregate demand .
As the stimulus winds down -- and more gets stuck in the Congressional pipeline -- it 's worth noting its impact on American income .
We talk about the Recovery Act as a job - creator , a state - saver , and a road - builder , but it was also a wallet - fattener .
Without the stimulus , personal income would have fallen by 8 percent in the recession .
Instead , disposable income tread water due to billions of dollars of transfer payments and tax credits . *
Here 's the graph showing " the difference in year - over - year growth in personal income minus transfers versus disposable personal incomes " :
In short , consumer spending -- which makes up nearly 70 percent of the economy -- has held up because government spending offset the drop in private payrolls .
If we start to cut back now by blocking unemployment benefits , there 's no reason to expect anything less than a recovery that feels like treading water .
For more , see the article , How the Stimulus Fattened Our Wallets .
To get a brief rundown on the state of the economy , read these 5 Reasons Why the Recovery Is ( And Isn't ) In Trouble
One of the wonderful skills I have learned from Thich Nhat Hanh is how to use a bell , or ringing bowl , as an aid to coming back to myself and achieving mindfulness .
I almost always start and end my meditations by “ inviting ” the bell to sound .
Here is a very beautiful teaching by Thây on skillful use of the ringing bowl , or bell , and how it can be a friend to our meditation practice .
A the end of the teaching , I ’ve included a beautiful gatha , sung by Thây , called “ Inviting the Bell ” from the album Drops of Emptiness .
May this teaching and this music be an inspiration to you and your practice .

The tranquility in us , the peace in us , we have to call them .
There ’s tranquility and calmness and peace and joy in us , but we have to call them so that they can manifest themselves .
This tranquility , that love , that joy , that stability , sometimes we call them Buddhahood , or the nature of Buddha in us .
The Buddha is someone who is very calm , very tranquil .
The Buddha is somebody who has joy , compassion and calmness , and the Buddha is not somebody made of materials like wood or gold .
When we invite the bell , it ’s one of the means to call the joy in us , the tranquility in us , so that we can awaken the Buddha in us .
There is a baby Buddha in each of us , and we have to be aware of it .
In a practice center like Plum Village , when we invite the bell to sound , we have a chance to touch the Buddha in us , we have a chance to call the nature of Buddha in us , so it can manifest itself .
If we do it correctly , peace will be there in our hearts , and we will immediately become calm water , and we will reflect reality as it is .
If we are not calm , the image we reflect will be a distorted image , and when the image is distorted by our minds , the image is not the reality , and it causes lots of suffering .
So we have to call tranquility , to invite it to manifest itself .
When I invite the bell to sound , it is because the bell is considered as a friend , someone who helps us to come back to ourselves , become calm .
That is why , when I start inviting the bell to sound , I have to pay respect to the bell like this ( Thay bows ) , exactly as we do to our friend .
We pay our respect and love to our friend , so I pay respect to the bell : I join my palms , I make a lotus flower or a tulip , and I offer this flower to my bell , to my friend .
Then I take my bell and put it on the palm of my hand , lift it to the level of my eyes , and look at it , and I breathe .
We have to practice to do it .
When I hold the bell in my hand , like this , I start breathing in and breathing out .
Breathing in , I calm myself , and breathing out I smile .
My hand becomes a flower , like a lotus , and the bell becomes a diamond , a jewel in the heart of the lotus .
Have you heard the mantra “ Om mani padme hum ? ”
It is in Sanskrit , and it means , “ Oh , the jewel in the lotus flower ! ”
When you breathe like that , very deeply in mindfulness , with calmness , you become the lotus flower , because there is mindfulness in you that gleams like a jewel .
It is a practice , it is not a prayer .
Look at my hand , it looks like a lotus flower with five petals , and in its heart there is a jewel .
I breathe in with that image , and then I become a lotus flower with a jewel in me .
There ’s a short poem that you should learn by heart , if you want to invite the bell to sound :
Body , speech and mind in perfect oneness ,
I send my heart along with the sound of this bell .
May all the hearers awaken from forgetfulness ,
And transcend the path of anxiety and sorrow .

Australian scientists have developed a way to test soil for disease agents before potato crops are planted .
Using a DNA technology , scientists can quickly identify a range of problems that could threaten the quality of the vegetable .
Dr Kathy Ophel Keller from the South Australian Research and Development Institute says the method will now be taken to paddocks with a hope of a test being commercially available within a few years .
" Soil - borne pathogens of potatoes are a major problem for the industry , " she said .
" The losses just in Australia are about $ 80 million a year , so it 's an industry that can really use this technology ... to help them manage the risk from these diseases . "
Using a microscope designed to image the arrangement and interactions of electrons in crystals , scientists have captured the first images of electrons that appear to take on extraordinary mass under certain extreme conditions .
The technique reveals the origin of an unusual electronic phase transition in one particular material , and opens the door to further explorations of the properties and functions of so - called heavy fermions .
Scientists from the U.S. Department of Energy's ( DOE ) Brookhaven National Laboratory , McMaster University , and Los Alamos National Laboratory describe the results in the June 3 , 2010 , issue of Nature .
" Physicists have been interested in the ' problem ' of heavy fermions -- why these electrons act as if they are hundreds or thousands of times more massive under certain conditions -- for thirty or forty years , " said study leader Séamus Davis , a physicist at Brookhaven and the J.D. White Distinguished Professor of Physical Sciences at Cornell University .
Understanding heavy fermion behavior could lead to the design of new materials for high - temperature superconductors .
Superconductivity allows materials to carry current with no energy loss .
In the current study , the scientists were imaging electronic properties in a material composed of uranium , ruthenium , and silicon that itself has been the subject of a 25 - year scientific mystery .
In this material -- synthesized by Graeme Luke 's group at McMaster -- the effects of heavy fermions begin to appear as the material is cooled below 55 kelvin ( - 218 °C ) .
Then , an even more unusual electronic phase transition occurs below 17.5K .
Scientists had attributed this lower - temperature phase transition to some form of " hidden order . "
They could not distinguish whether it was related to the collective behavior of electrons acting as a wave , or interactions of individual electrons with the uranium atoms .
Alexander Balatsky , a Los Alamos theoretical physicist at the Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies , provided guidance on how to examine this problem .
With that guidance , Davis ' group used a technique they 'd designed to visualize the behavior of electrons to " see " what the electrons were doing as they passed through the mysterious phase transition .
The technique , spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy ( SI - STM ) , measures the wavelength of electrons on the surface of the material in relation to their energy .

" Imagine flying over a body of water where standing waves are moving up and down , but not propagating toward the shore , " said Davis .
" When you pass over high points , you can touch the water ; over low points , you can't .
This is similar to what our microscope does .
It images how many electrons can jump to the tip of our probe at every point on the surface . "
From the wavelength and energy measurements , the scientists can calculate the effective electron mass .
" This technique reveals that we are dealing with very heavy electrons -- or electrons that act as if they are extremely heavy because they are somehow being slowed down , " Davis said .
The detection of " heavy electron " characteristics below the second transition temperature provides direct experimental evidence that the electrons are interacting with the uranium atoms rather than acting as a wave .
To visualize this , imagine a team of football players running up the field after a kickoff .
If each player were free to run unimpeded , the whole team would appear to operate as a wave of relatively independent " electrons . "
But imagine instead that the field is strewn with an array of chairs , and each player has to sit for an instant every time he encounters a chair before continuing up the field .
In this case the chairs are analogous to the uranium atoms .
Those interactions between players and chairs ( or electrons and uranium atoms ) clearly slow the progress .
advertisement
In the case of the uranium material , the electron slowdown lasts only a tiny fraction of a second at each uranium atom .
But because kinetic energy and mass are mathematically related , the slowdown makes it appear as if the electrons are more massive than a free electron .
Besides revealing these interactions as the source of " hidden order " in the uranium compound , Davis ' study shows that the SI - STM technique can be used to visualize heavy electrons .
That in turn opens the door to more ways to investigate and visualize this phenomenon .
The research team is continuing to probe a variety of related compounds with this new approach to further their understanding of heavy fermion systems .
" Heavy fermions remain mysterious in many ways , and it's our job as scientists to solve the problem , " Davis said .
This research was funded in the United States by the DOE Office of Science and in Canada by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research .
At Brookhaven , this research was supported as part of the Center for Emergent Superconductivity , an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy , Office of Science .
The US senators pushing a controversial new bill that some fear would give President Barack Obama the powers to seize control of and even shut down the internet have rejected claims it would give Obama a net " kill switch " .
The bill , titled Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act , has been unanimously approved by the US Homeland Security committee and will be put to a vote on the Senate floor shortly .
The architect of the bill ... US Senator Joe Lieberman .
Lobby groups and academics quickly rounded on the bill , which seeks to grant the President broad emergency powers over the internet in times of national emergency .
Any internet firms and providers must " immediately comply with any emergency measure or action developed " by a new section of the US Department of Homeland Security , dubbed the " National Centre for Cybersecurity and Communications " .
Mashable ’s Spark of Genius series highlights a unique feature of startups .
If you would like to have your startup considered for inclusion , see details here .
The series is made possible by Microsoft BizSpark .
Name : ShortForm.TV
[ Warning : Videos are set to autoplay ]
Quick Pitch : Snack on an endless stream of short - form video .
Genius Idea :
With more than 24 hours of video uploaded every minute to YouTube alone , it can be hard to find something to watch when you 're after a quick hit of humor or whimsy .
That 's where Shortform .
TV comes in .
Shortform.tv is a website and iPad app [ iTunes link ] that launched today .
It allows viewers to surf through a variety of channels housing a selection of short videos , which have been sorted and collected by both real - live human curators and aggregation software .
Said software aggregates videos from sources such as Facebook , YouTube and Vimeo , and it categorizes videos based on criteria defined by the curators .
The playlist generator then organizes the videos based on trending data and user feedback — you can nix vids by clicking on the " thumbs - down " button next to the player , and you can save videos to " My Channel " by clicking " thumbs - up . "
To formulate your channel , you 'll have to sign in to the site via Facebook Connect .
After doing so , you can share videos with your friends by posting them to your Facebook profile , and you can add videos you 've viewed on Facebook and YouTube to your channel on Shortform.tv .
You can also choose to share your channel with other users and friends .
As more and more users makes their way to the site , the founder says you will be able to compete to have your channel featured on the main page , which should be an incentive for hardcore viral - video fans to join .
Shortform.tv is a great little time - waster in the tradition of sites like Redux and yeahyeahyeahyeahyeah , but it 's exclusively for video content — which makes it perfect for anyone who enjoys watching or sharing the latest viral flick .
Right now , the site has around six categories — Facebook Hits , HaHa Funny , Super Cute , Totally Weird , Feel Good and So Hollywood — which seems a little sparse .
We would love to see them add more specialized channels , i.e. music videos , parodies , commercials and the like .
Still , this platform is meant to entertain , and it has achieved that goal .

Online slot machines are a great way to not only pass the time .
There are many machines for you to choose from , so you wo n’t be starved for choices when it comes to these online slots .
People who play these machines for the first time often have a few questions when they begin , and here are some of the questions that people frequently ask before they try their luck on any of the slot machines and casinos online .
Is it Legal to Play Online Slots Games in the UK ?
Playing online slots games in the UK on your PC , tablet , or smartphone is legal in the UK as long as the site you are playing from or the app you are using is licensed by the UK Gambling Commission in the area that they have white - listed .
If you are playing for real money online with these free slots in the UK , you will need to first find out if the site you are accessing slot machine games from is regulated by an authority with the same requirements as the UKGC or is accepted by this same organization .
The online casinos you are allowed to play legally for real money in the UK under these rules are those that are licensed in Alderney , Antigua , Barbuda , Gibraltar , Isle of Man , Malta , and the UK .
Also , you need to be above 18 to legally play for real money on these slot machine sites and apps in the UK .
If you play slots on a site that is not licensed in any of these areas , you are playing illegally and are at risk of losing your money to a site that is not regulated for your benefit .
If you are playing simply for fun and there is no real money involved , you have nothing to worry about .
You can play for as long as you want and on any machine that you find online as long as it is not for real money .
These do n’t need to be regulated since you are not gambling when you are using fun slot machines and not real money ones .
Are online slots random ?
There has always been controversy behind how slot machines work , and one question that usually plays on the minds of those who enjoy this game is whether or not winning from these machines is random .
Nobody likes to be gamed , so to speak , and the thought that machines , whether online or in real life , being rigged has played on the minds of many gamblers worldwide .
You should rest assured that sites that are licensed and regulated by the UKGC do n’t cheat on these games , which means you have a huge chance of winning big on the machines found on these sites .
You should also be happy to know that yes , the slots on online machines are random .
This is due to RNG technology , or Random Number Generator technology .
This is software that ensures each spin you make on these online or app slots are not controlled by any entity , giving you as much of a chance of winning as you would in real - life casino slot machines .
These online slot machines are also tested regularly and at random to check for possible tampering .
Do you have a chance of winning on online slot machines ?
Your chances of winning at online slot machines are the same as when you play on real machines in real life .
This means that the randomness of the spinning of the reels may make you win real money , and at times even very huge sums of money , if luck is on your side .
In short , yes , you do have a change of winning when you play online slot machines .
To help increase your chances at winning on online slots , there are some tips and tricks that you can employ to do this .
While there is no guarantee that you can win , your chances at winning are increased when you play smart .
For example , some players state that winning is easier and more frequent when you play on games with the smaller jackpots rather than those with progressive ones .
Some players also state that playing on a machine with a fixed maximum payout increases your chances of winning with each play .
How can I find a good slot machine to play ?
This is a question online casino and slot players everywhere ask , and the answer is not as simple as it should be .
For starters , there are hundreds , if not thousands , of machines for you to choose from .
So , finding the best machine to play and win from can seem like a daunting task .
Your best option would be to do your research before you hit any of the machines that you find online .
This means you will need to find machines that are guaranteed to give you a bigger chance of winning than others that you can find online .
Not all machines , after all , can give you the same chances of winning .
So , finding out what kinds of machine give you bigger odds of winning will help you enjoy your online slot machine gaming more .
The best option you have for finding the right machine to play on and win money from is to choose one that has a high RTP or return to player percentage .
Look for a machine that has a high RTP , usually with 90 to 97 percent .
You can find this out by checking the help section of the slot you are thinking of using or by reading about that particular slot machine from review sites online .
If you are simply playing for fun on free machines , you do n’t have to worry about RTP since you can simply wait for your tokens to refresh and reload .
This is depending on whether or not there are daily bonuses and regular token refills on the machines that you choose to play on .
Today I have for you a really great guest post provided by J of Imagine Today , a blog which discusses feminism and politics as well as body acceptance .
She ’s written about society ’s perceived ownership of women ’s bodies , and how we pretty much need to tell the world to fuck off so we can be happy with ourselves . 🙂
If you liked this post , I encourage you to visit Imagine Today , as there ’s more where this came from !
At the core of the ingrained insecurity that so many women feel in regards to their bodies , lies the idea of ownership .
From a young age women are taught that our bodies are not really our own .
We ’re told this by legitimate news sources , when they feel that it is acceptable to print pictures of a young woman ’s vulva for ratings , or devote broadcast hours to the plague of “ cankles . ”
We ’re screamed this message by anti-choice activists and the lawmakers that help them to push forward restriction after restriction all set to remind women that our bodies belong to them once a fetus enters the picture ( or even before , when you consider those who fight to hard to restrict the pill . )
We see this when strangers , family , and friends turn a blind eye and rapists are allowed to invade our bodies , without consequence , as the crowd of public opinion quickly jumps in to decipher just what we did to deserve this invasion .
We ’re sold this message by companies that push and push to sell us diet pills , spanx , diet plans , diet books , clothing , makeup , lotions … anything , really , to cut us down to size and paint away our uniqueness .
We ’re reminded by magazines that tell women who are small to eat a sandwich preferably , I gather , one stolen from a woman deemed too big .
Magazines that say eat this , not that and wear this , not that and do this , not that ; never content until we ’re all eating , wearing , and doing what they ’re getting paid to tell us to do .
We ’re reminded in whispers by friendly voices sharing secrets .
Would you look at her ?
Who told her that skirt was flattering ?
Poor girl … she ’d be pretty if she just lost / gained a few pounds .
We may whisper back but all the while we ’re wondering : what do they whisper about me ?
We ’re reminded even when we ’re using our bodies to care for another – as person after person harasses us for breastfeeding in public .
Every day each one of us takes this all in , and yet , we do n’t even seem to notice .
We wonder why are women do damn obsessed with their bodies ?
Are they just shallow ?
Is it genetic ?
Have they evolved to care more about their bodies ?
Why does n’t this happen to men nearly as much ?
The answer to all of these would be so obvious if we could just take a moment to open our ears and listen to the ever - growing chorus of voices joining together to lay claim and control over other women ’s bodies .
Do n’t get me wrong : plenty of men have body image issues … but , it ’s different .
These men are the minority , it ’s seen as weird when it happens to them , as a problem that needs fixing rather than simply the way things are .
Men are encouraged to own their bodies and care for them , strengthen them , use them to fix and protect and live .
They ’re not expected to shave and pluck and diet and primp and paint , to cover and reveal just enough to please the endless sea of ever watching eyes .
They just have to be and do .
They are granted ownership of their bodies and when they lose that ownership it is a problem that no one quite knows how to fix just yet .
Women , on the other hand , have their ownership stripped away earlier and earlier in this modern society and if they try to take it back ?
That ’s when we have a “ problem . ”
That ’s when we ’re called names , when we ’re raped or assaulted , when we ’re sneered at and avoided .
When we stop dieting and we ’re looked at like alien creatures , shamed back into counting calories as quickly as possible … unless , of course , we ’re naturally small .
Then we are envied , tortured in whispers and jealous glares .
Or worse , made invisible , ignored because our bodies do n’t seem to fit the mold .
No. fucking .
more .
Its time we learn about nutrition – not to lose weight , but to feed our bodies what they need to grow strong .
It ’s time we learn the rights that come with our bodies – and fight for a uterus free to decide what will dwell within it .
It ’s time we own the pleasure that comes with sex , and make our own decisions about when , where , and who we will share that pleasure .
It ’s time we put an end to “ figure flattering ” fashion and wear whatever the fuck we want .
Time we paint our faces in a rainbow of colors , or none at all … depending only on how we feel any particular day .
Time we stop judging other bodies , and start loving the unique magic each figure contains .
Time we tell the magazines , the TV pundits , politicians , protesters , neighbors , friends , parents … everyone that this body is mine to love , not yours to criticize .
Then , we will be free .
Flavorpill ’s Earplug is a regular e-newsletter focusing on a variety of music news which link through to their website .
One particular article caught my attention recently which I thought would be good to mention here on Hard Format : ‘ Smashing Pumpkins ’ Teargarden and 10 Other Over - the - Top Special Editions ’ .
There ’s the venerable – Pixies ’s Minotaur – and the ludicrous – the special edition of Hole ’s Nobody ’s Daughter which includes “ the CD ; a digital download ; a bright blue , Miss America - style Nobody ’s Daughter sash ; signed LP ; “ cassette USB w/ album and unreleased photo collection ” ; messenger bag ; thermal shirt ; and makeup . ”
And then there ’s Rammstein ’s Liebe Ist Für Alle Da …
Here ’s what Flavorpill have to say about this set :
It includes the album itself , five bonus songs the band admits is n’t as good as what did make the final tracklist , a hard metal case , handcuffs , lube , and ( get ready for it ) six pink dildos modeled after the , uh , band members themselves .
How ’s that for a pleasurable listening experience ?
An amusing detail is the way that Amazon displays the box :
Now that I ’ve set eyes on this visual feast , I ’m wondering whether there ’s any point in continuing with Hard Format ?

This DRAFT statement reflects the conclusions reached at a meeting of over 90 academics , practitioners and public interest organizations from five continents gathered at American University Washington College of Law , June 16 - 18 , 2010 .
In the days following the meeting , the statement received the individual and organizational endorsements listed below , and is still open for further endorsements at www.pijip.org
We find that the terms of the agreement threaten numerous public interests , including nearly every concern specifically disclaimed by the negotiators in their announcement .
- Extends the powers of custom officials to search and seize a wide range of goods , including computers and other electronic devices , without adequate safeguards against unwarranted confiscations and privacy invasions ;
- Extends 'ex officio ' border search and seizures from willful , commercial scale trademark counterfeiting to a broad range of intellectual property infringements , including " confusingly similar " trademark violations , copyright infringement standards that require interpretation of " fair use " or similar user rights , and even to patent cases which frequently involve complex questions of law and fact that are difficult to adjudicate even by specialist courts after full adjudicative processes ;
introducing very specific rights and remedies for rights holders without correlative requirements to provide exceptions , limitations , and due process safeguards for users ;
shifting enforcement from private civil mechanisms to public authorities and third parties , including to customs officials , criminal prosecutors and internet service providers -- in ways that are likely to be more sensitive to proprietary concerns and less sensitive to user concerns ;
omitting liability and disincentives for abuses of enforcement processes by right holders ; and
requiring the adoption of automatic damages assessments unrelated to any proven harm ;
locking in and exporting controversial aspects of US and EU enforcement practices which have already proven problematic , foreclosing future legislative improvements in response to changes in technology or policy ;
requiring substantive changes to intellectual property laws of a large number of negotiating countries .
The current process for considering public input into ACTA is fundamentally flawed in numerous respects .
In many countries , the only consultations taking place are with select members of the public , off - the - record and without benefit of sharing the latest version of the rapidly changing text .
There is little possibility that a fair and balanced agreement that protects and promotes public interests can evolve from such a distorted policy making process .
Governments , right holders and civil society should have an open and evidence - based discussion on the right strategy to confront willful commercial scale trademark counterfeiting and commercial scale copyright piracy .
This discussion should take place in multilateral and national open and on - the - record forums with access to current negotiating text so that all interested stakeholders can participate .
EDF
Energy will announce today that it has received sufficient reassurances from the energy and climate change secretary , Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne , to continue planning for a new generation of nuclear plants in Britain .
There were fears that the Lib Dems ' manifesto commitment to halt the construction of any more nuclear reactors , and recent sceptical signals from Huhne , could derail its £ 20 bn building programme .
But Vincent de Rivaz , the chief executive of EDF in Britain , will tell a conference he is convinced that both sides are committed to the same goal : new reactors without subsidies and at a viable cost .
" What has emerged very quickly from the coalition government is clarity over its commitment to deliver a low carbon future , together with a commitment that new nuclear will play a part in the new administration 's plans , " de Rivaz will say .
" Chris Huhne … has already provided important reassurances that he will take a pragmatic approach to new nuclear power as long as it can be built without subsidy .
" The commitments from the coalition government envisage a proper role for nuclear and have reassured us at EDF , as we contemplate the very serious investment we are proposing to make in nuclear power in the UK , " he will add in a speech to the Global Energy Capital Market Conference in London .
EDF says it has been particularly pleased by comments about the introduction of a floor to the carbon price plus a commitment to speed up the planning regime for new energy infrastructure through a clear national policy statement .
The company , an arm of the huge , largely state - owned , French utility EDF , insists that it is happy to build new reactors without otherwise relying on any handouts from the Treasury , even for waste or decommissioning .
EDF wants to build four new reactors at Hinkley Point in Somerset and Sizewell in Suffolk that would generate enough power to light 40 % of Britain 's homes or the equivalent of 13 % of all UK electricity , but the final decision on whether to proceed is not due to be taken until 2011 .
" We 've made it clear to the prime minister and the secretary of state for energy and climate change that EDF Energy will spearhead the nuclear renaissance in the UK without the need for public subsidy .
That is important to the government .
It is important for us , " de Rivaz will say .
" We operate in a market where the costs for waste and decommissioning are met by nuclear operators through an independently assessed , ring - fenced fund , a requirement further underpinned in this year 's Energy Act …
Together with other operators we will continue to make regular payments into those funds , to protect ordinary creditors against any associated prospective costs . "
De Rivaz says that latest public opinion polls show growing support for nuclear power even from Lib Dem supporters , who have traditionally been among the most negative towards it .
And he will quote from a new report published by Parsons Brinckerhoff
Power that suggests power can be generated much more cheaply by nuclear than by competing technologies .
" Their data shows that with typical generation costs in the range of £ 55 - £ 86 per megawatt hour [ MWh ] , new nuclear is well placed in helping keep low carbon energy affordable in the long term , " he will say .
" That compares particularly favourably to other low carbon technologies .
Offshore wind represents a generating cost of up to £ 204 per MWh and carbon capture and storage technology up to £ 154 per MWh . "
The motorcyclesâ€ ” three 4 - cylinder and two 2 - cylinder models with engines ranging in size from .8 to 1.5 litresâ€ ” produced an average of ten times as much carbon monoxide as the other gasoline - powered vehicles , and more than 80 times as much as one of the gas - electric hybrids on a per-kilometre basis .
For nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons , the bikes emitted an average of three and 14 times as much pollution , respectively , as the other gas - powered vehicles .
The one major area where the bikes outperformed some of the larger vehicles was in reduced emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide .
Such emissions are directly related to fuel consumption , so more fuel - efficient vehicles , such as motorcycles , produce less carbon dioxide .

( Newser ) – A white police sergeant in Philadelphia has admitted that he made up a story about being shot by a black assailant and instead purposely shot himself in the shoulder , reports the Philadelphia Inquirer .
" There 's some speculation he did it to get attention , or to get transferred , " said the city 's police chief , who called it a " terrible and embarrassing chapter in our history . "
Sgt. Robert Ralston originally said that after he stopped two men for questioning , one pulled a gun and aimed at his head .
He said when he knocked the gun away , it went off and grazed him .
That set off a huge manhunt before the details of Ralston 's story fell apart , notes AP .
Ralston has been suspended and is expected to be fired .
The 21 - year veteran wo n't face criminal charges , but he must reimburse the city for the cost of the manhunt .

The Intercontinental Rally Challenge has been boosted by speculation that Sebastien Ogier and Mikko Hirvonen will return to the series in the next two events .
Ogier has been tipped to drive a Peugeot 207 S2000 on Rally d'Italia - Sardegna and on the Ypres Rally , while Ford 's Hirvonen has been linked to a Fiesta S2000 run on the Belgian event .
Ogier and Hirvonen , both of whom compete in the World Rally Championship for Citroen and Ford respectively , starred on the opening round of this year 's IRC - the Monte Carlo Rally .
Hirvonen won the event , while Ogier set fastest times but retired with mechanical problems .
Both said at the time they would like to return to IRC later in the year .
Next month 's Ypres Rally is rapidly building into one of the most competitive rounds of the series to date , with Proton committing its two - car team to the Belgian classic .
The British - based team , which runs Alister McRae and Chris Atkinson , had been expected to start its campaign in Sardinia , but will focus on asphalt development of the car instead .
" It 's no secret that we had looked at starting our IRC programme in Sardinia , " said team boss Chris Mellors , " but we 've decided to go for Ypres instead .
If we had gone to Sardinia with the car , it would have seriously restricted the amount of asphalt testing we'd have been able to do with the car before Belgium .
" Having seen the way we 've been able to develop the car on the gravel with the extra loose - surface testing over the winter , we felt it made more sense to focus on preparing the cars and drivers for Ypres , which is undoubtedly one of the classic European events . "
Group : ‘ People will die because of this decision ’
Gun owners upset about states “ trampling on their rights ” have reason to cheer Monday .
“ In another dramatic victory for firearm owners , the Supreme Court has ruled unconstitutional Chicago , Illinois ’ 28 - year - old strict ban on handgun ownership , a potentially far - reaching case over the ability of state and local governments to enforce limits on weapons , ” CNN reports .

The Associated Press adds , “ The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Constitution ’s “ right to keep and bear arms ” applies nationwide as a restraint on the ability of the federal , state and local governments to substantially limit its reach . ”
“ The justices on Monday cast doubt on a Chicago area handgun ban , but also signaled in their 5 - 4 decision that less severe restrictions could survive legal challenges , ” the AP article continues .
The ruling , written by Justice Samuel Alito , decided that the 2nd Amendment “ applies equally to the federal government and the states . ”
The AP adds , “ The court was split along familiar ideological lines , with five conservative - moderate justices in favor of gun rights and the four liberals , opposed . ”
Liberal anti-gun groups are already fuming .
Washington , DC ’s Violence Policy Center Legislative Director Kristen Rand issued the following statement to RAW STORY :

“ People will die because of this decision .
It is a victory only for the gun lobby and America ’s fading firearms industry .
The inevitable tide of frivolous pro-gun litigation destined to follow will force cities , counties , and states to expend scarce resources to defend longstanding , effective public safety laws .
The gun lobby and gunmakers are seeking nothing less than the complete dismantling of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s gun laws in a cynical effort to try and stem the long - term drop in gun ownership and save the dwindling gun industry .
The 30,000 lives claimed annually by gun violence and the families destroyed in the wake of mass shootings and murder - suicides mean little to the gun lobby and the firearm manufacturers it protects .
“ It is our hope that ChicagoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s citizens will follow the lead of the residents of the District of Columbia–who were stripped of their handgun ban in the wake of the Supreme CourtÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s June 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller .
In the two years since that decision , only 900 firearms have been registered in the District that otherwise could not have been registered before the Heller ruling .
The citizens of DC reject the wrong - headed notion that more guns make us safer .
We know the facts prove the opposite and that areas of the country with the highest concentration of gun ownership also have the highest rates of gun death .
We urge Chicago residents to consider these indisputable facts before considering bringing a handgun into their homes–an act that could well prove fatal to themselves or a loved one .
Ã¢â‚¬Â
Nevada Senator Harry Reid , the Democratic majority leader , issued the following statement supporting the court ’s decision :
Ã¢â‚ ¬Å“ With todayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s ruling , the U.S. Supreme Court has helped ensure that the 2nd Amendment rights of Americans will be protected in all corners of our country .
The right to bear arms is one of the essential freedoms on which our country was founded .
I am pleased that the high court has taken steps in both the Heller and McDonald cases to guarantee this fundamental right .
I supported individual gun rights in a bipartisan congressional amicus brief to the court , and I am glad they agreed with my position .

Americans continue to warm up to soccer ’s biggest event , with ratings for the World Cup coverage on ABC and ESPN up 60 % from the 2006 tournament ( 1.9 verage rating through Friday vs. 1.2 four years ago , despite the fact that most of the matches this year air in the morning ) .
The Friday match between U.S. and Slovenia on ESPN was the most watched soccer game in the history of the ESPN networks among households , 3.9 million .
In total viewers , it was the third most watched ever with 5.2 million .
Not bad for a game that started at 10 AM EDT / 7PDT .
The match featured an epic comeback by the Americans , who earned a 2 - 2 draw after trailing 0 - 2 at halftime , and a big controversy over the U.S. team ’s disallowed third goal .
Most patriotic ( or best in coming up with a good excuse to be late for work ) were viewers in San Diego where the U.S. / Slovenia match averaged an 8.5 rating .
Meanwhile , Mexico ’s Thursday match against France , which the Mexicans won 2 - 0 , averaged 5.8 million viewers on Univision , the largest audience on the Spanish - language network so far this World Cup .
MEXICO CITY , June 28 ( Reuter ) - Mexican singer Sergio Vega was murdered while on a national tour at the weekend , just hours after denying reports of his death , local media reported .
The 40 - year - old singer , known as El Shaka , was driving his red Cadillac to a concert in the northern Mexican state of Sinaloa on Saturday when his car was intercepted by unidentified shooters in a truck , reports said .
His murder came just hours after he told entertainment website La Oreja that online reports of his death were wrong .
“ It ’s happened to me for years now , someone tells a radio station or a newspaper I ’ve been killed , or suffered an accident , ” said Vega .
“ And then I have to call my dear mum , who has heart trouble , to reassure her . ”
Fans posted condolences on Twitter after they learned of the death of the singer , who recently boosted his security following the killing of several Mexican musicians .
Musicians performing narcocorridos , or songs celebrating the lives of drug barons , have become the targets of rival drug gangs in Mexico with Mexican media reporting several such deaths in recent years .
Arsenal have confirmed they have made an approach to sign Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer .
Arsenal want Fulham ace to switch to Emirates
Arsenal have confirmed they have made an approach to sign Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer .
Wenger wants a new No.1 and this has been confirmed by his pursuit of the Australian custodian .
Despite being 37 , the former Middlesbrough shot - stopper , is still considered one of the Premier League 's best and he played a huge part in Fulham 's resurgence in the past couple of seasons .
Now Wenger is hoping he can strike a deal with Fulham , although they have rebuffed Arsenal 's opening advances .
" We have made an enquiry for him and they are not prepared to sell him so we have gone away , " Arsenal chairman Peter Hill - Wood told the " We can only hope they will change their minds , but at the moment it does n't look like it . "
Meanwhile , Hill - Wood has also confirmed that Arsenal will not be meeting the demands of William Gallas - who is out - of - contract at the end of this month .
The French international wants at least a two - year deal , which goes against Arsenal policy as they generally do not offer more than 12 - month contracts to players over 30 .
At 32 , Gallas has only been offered a one - year extension - which he has thus far refused to sign .
" He is asking for too much for too long , " he said .
" Players are going to have to learn some time that money does n't grow on trees . "
This stand - alone fan - project caught my eye because an Ex of mine was vaguely into the cartoon and she never got around to actually showing it me .
Hell , I totally forgot they made it into a film a few years ago .
So Aeon Flux Episodes is the closest I ’ll get .
Anyway – this is very much in the line of Prince of Persia / Another World / Flashpoint and in its adult - if - stilted platforming .
Lots of points for style though , with the foreground and background elements moving around and a low - leaning difficulty to let you mow down masses of the opposition with dual - wielded guns .
Pointing in both directions .
That ’s the way to do it .
My main reservation is that the checkpoints are a long , long way apart and when extreme falls are insta-deaths , it can lead to a disconcerting level of back - tracking – especially when the game , generally speaking , is an easy ride .
The site lists various places you can get its 60 Mb form from but ModDB is probably the easiest .
And the trailer follows which shows lots of nifty stuff I did n’t get to …
BOSTON -- Boston Bruins forward Marc Savard took a bite out of Philadelphia 's Stanley Cup hopes in Game 1 when he scored the winning goal in overtime .
And in Game 2 , he actually bit Daniel Carcillo 's finger , the Flyers forward said .
Carcillo complained to Canadian broadcaster TSN during the game that Savard bit him after a whistle at the 5:55 mark of the second period .
Savard slashed at goalie Brian Boucher 's glove , drawing a penalty and the ire of several Flyers who descended upon him .
Carcillo said after the game that he has n't been bitten since grade school .
He called Savard " pretty cowardly . "
" Last time I have been bit was in grade school .
It 's not a good feeling .
...
Guys do n't bite .
Men do n't bite , " Carcillo said .
But Savard asked what Carcillo 's finger was doing in his mouth anyway .
" I think he tried to pull my teeth out , " Savard said .
" If that 's biting , I do n't know what to say . "
Flyers coach Peter Laviolette said he was n't sure what happened .
" I heard something about it , " Laviolette said . " ...
Those things usually sort themselves out .
If he was [ biting Carcillo ] , I 'm sure it 'll get looked into . "
Savard was suspended one game in 2003 for biting Darcy Tucker .
Information from ESPNBoston.com 's Joe McDonald and The Associated Press contributed to this report .
BOSTON – Overly protective parents might be leaving a lasting impact on their child 's personality , and not in a good way , a new study finds .
The results show having so - called " helicopter parents " was associated with being dependent , neurotic and less open , a slew of personality traits that are generally thought of as undesirable .
The study , which surveyed college freshman , is one of the first to try to define exactly what helicopter parenting is , and measure it .
The term was originally coined by college admissions personnel when they started to notice a change in parents of prospective students — parents would call the admissions office and try to intervene in a process that had previously just been between the student and the college , said study researcher Neil Montgomery , a psychologist at Keene State College in N.H .
While the findings are only preliminary , and more studies are needed to back up the results , they suggest this type of over - parenting might lead to children who are ultimately not ready to leave the nest .
" I think what the helicopter parents did is they decided , ' OK we know what good parenting looks like , we 're just going to ratchet it up to a new level , and our kids are going to be even better , ' " Montgomery said .
" The problem is , when they ratcheted it up , they went too far , and in fact , caused an expansion of childhood or adolescence . "
Hovering parents , neurotic children
Montgomery and his colleagues surveyed about 300 freshmen with a questionnaire the researchers specifically designed to assess helicopter parenting .
They focused was on college students , because college is a " crisis point " in the relationship between the helicopter parent and the child , Montgomery said .
At this stage , the parents no longer have control over their child 's life and can't keep track of them like in the past .
Participants had to rate their level of agreement with statements such as , " My parents have contacted a school official on my behalf to solve problems for me , " " On my college move - in day , my parents stayed the night in town to make sure I was adjusted , " and " If two days go by without contact my parents would contact me . "
About 10 percent of the participants had helicopter parents .
The rate was higher in girls than in boys , with 13 percent of the females being helicoptered compared with just 5 percent of males .
And it was mainly mothers doing the hovering , Montgomery said .
Students with helicopter parents tended to be less open to new ideas and actions , as well as more vulnerable , anxious and self - consciousness , among other factors , compared with their counterparts with more distant parents .
" We have a person who is dependent , who is vulnerable , who is self - conscious , who is anxious , who is impulsive , not open to new actions or ideas ; is that going to make a successful college student ? "
Montgomery said .
" No not exactly , it 's really a horrible story at the end of the day . "
On the other hand , in non-helicoptered students who were given responsibility and not constantly monitored by their parents , so - called " free rangers " the effects were reversed , Montgomery said .
Future outlook
Montgomery notes that the findings only show an association , and not a direct cause - effect link , meaning all children with helicopter parents do n't necessarily turn out this way .
However , he thinks the research should encourage parents to think about what they are doing as they raise their children , and be aware that there is such a thing as over - parenting .
He hopes the work leads to more research in the area , including large studies on different populations of children , such as high - school and middle - school students .
Future studies will hopefully bring about a clearer picture of helicopter parenting , Montgomery said .
" People keep talking about it like everyone knows what it is , " Montgomery said .
" And it 's not clear that anyone really knows what it is , other than the people they know personally who are doing these things . "
The results were presented May 29 at the Association of Psychological Science Convention in Boston .
A guest editorial by Iamaddj
The coming of the 8th edition of Wahammer Fantasy Battles this summer , marks a major change in the gaming scene , one that will either make of break WFB , turning it into one of the greatest game franchises ever or a husk of a game .
While local conditions may vary for players overall reports from across the U.S. agree that the popularity of WFB is down , and the game is being played less right now .
This has not yet really effected the big events , Lonewolf , Adepticon , and the like are still going strong , though the death of both the Big Waaagh and the Necronomicon should be a warning .
Mostly however this recent trend has affected local play at FLGS and the smaller local tournaments .
A number of factors have caused this trend , Fantasy has always been less popular in the U.S. then 40 k , many players are fed up with the current meta - game , and some players have even grown tired of the 7th edition .
Looming over all of this like a giant wargaming spectre is 8th Edition .
8th edition will decided the fate of Warhammer for years to come , possibly forever , making or breaking the venerable juggernaut .
Not that Juggernaut .
8th edition is what everyone is waiting for , it is holding the Warhammer playerbase in stasis , unable to change or adapt until we have cracked the shinny goodness of a brand new rule book .
But 8th edition represents something that all wargamers , all humans fear , change .
And what a change it represents .
If you believe half the rumors out there 8th is going to be the biggest change to a GW system in over a decade , since at least the change from 2nd to 3rd edition 40 k and from 5th to 6th edition WFB .
The fundamental shifts to the rules ( the turn structure is going to change ? ! ) means that it might well be the greatest change to ever happen to a GW game .
In many ways the arrival of 8th mean that we will be playing a totally new game .
All the tactics , tricks and exploited loopholes that have been tired and true staples of the game for the past decade will have to be rethought and reevaluated .
The lessons learned by an entire generation of players that have grown up playing 6th and 7th edition will have to be unlearn and relearned .
Overall I do n’t think most players really understand how much the coming edition will change the game , just how widespread the effects of it will be .
This is no small change , no slight rules adjustment , no minor tweaks this is shaping up to be a major rules revision , these are the end times ( methphorically speaking ) .
Not an exaggeration .
All this is ultimately good , maybe even totally awesome .
We need change , the game has stagnated and just about everyone would agree some change is needed to get the blood pumping again .
Game Workshop now has a chance to make the best edition , the best game , they have ever made .
They already have an audience , a large player base , they have 25 + years of experience making WFB , they know this game , and if they have listened they know what the players want .
More then that they are finally allowing major change , some of them much needed , to take place – they are allowing a real difference to be made .
On top of this they have a hidden advantage , War of the Rings .
For those players who never bothered to read the WoTR rules , 8th Fantasy seems like it is taking a lot of great ideas from that game .
Many sources say Jeremy Vetock ’s WotR ruleset was a broad testbed , with many ideas meant for the next edition of Fantasy .
If true , this means that some of the major changes coming to 8th edition from WoTR have the advantage of widespread play - testing for over a year now .
This is a huge advantage and something that many players feel has been lacking from some GW products over the years .
.
One Ring to play - test them all ?
On the other hand GW has a lot to lose with this edition .
The player base has a angry mob feel to it , and many have been driven to taking a break from the game .
In many locales WFB is a nearly dead game .
On top of that GW has some real competition for the first time in … ever .
Warmachine is growing in popularity in the first year it ’s widely acclaimed 2nd Edition .
An edition change for Warhammer is the perfect time for Warmachine to gain marketshare with a quality product .
GW has also lost some goodwill from it ’s players , price hikes have hurt , slow or iffy FAQs have hurt , and Daemons have made everyone mad .
A lot of old veteran Design Studio rules writers have also left since the last Fantasy edition meaning a lot of star talent and solid institutional memory goes with them .
Now this could be a good thing , it could allow for some fresh ideas , but it is yet another layer of uncertainty .
All this means that WFB is at a major crossroads .
Either it can be a great game and usher in a new golden age of Warhammer , or it could well cripple Fantasy reducing it an secondary tier status game forever in the backseat to 40 k .
Or I could be blowing smoke , it could be mediocre and just continue to putter along unchanged , or see some slight rise or dip in popularity .
Ultimately though I think one thing is pretty : the coming months are bringing major change , and that nothing will ever be the same .
Everthing I ’ve been seeing points to 8th edition being totally amazing and making the game much better , I for one egarly await it ’s coming .
What about you guys though , are you liking what you are seeing and hearing so far ?
And how do you think it will realistically effect both how and how often you play the game .
Iamaddj out .
From A Path With Heart : A Guide Through the Perils and Promises of Spiritual Life by Jack Kornfield :
As you reflect on your spiritual life you can ask yourself :
What do you know in your heart about the truth of life ?
Do you actually need more knowledge than this , or is this simple fundamental wisdom enough ?
What keeps you from living the simple truths you know ?
What would you need to let go of to do so ?
What confusion and fear interfere with your compassion ?
What strength and trust would be needed to live wisely and well ?
How would you change your life so that your body , heart , and mind might become more unknowing , more transparent to this light within ?
Can you imagine knowing less and become wiser ?
Let yourself sense a simple loving presence you can bring into each moment .
Be aware of how your spiritual life can guide you toward this .
Editor 's note : Bruce Schneier is a security technologist , and author of " Beyond Fear : Thinking Sensibly About Security in an Uncertain World . "
You can read more of his writing at http://www.schneier.com//
( CNN ) --
At a security conference recently , the moderator asked the panel of distinguished cybersecurity leaders what their nightmare scenario was .
The answers were the predictable array of large - scale attacks : against our communications infrastructure , against the power grid , against the financial system , in combination with a physical attack .
I did n't get to give my answer until the afternoon , which was : " My nightmare scenario is that people keep talking about their nightmare scenarios . "
There 's a certain blindness that comes from worst - case thinking .
An extension of the precautionary principle , it involves imagining the worst possible outcome and then acting as if it were a certainty .
It substitutes imagination for thinking , speculation for risk analysis and fear for reason .
It fosters powerlessness and vulnerability and magnifies social paralysis .
And it makes us more vulnerable to the effects of terrorism .
Worst - case thinking means generally bad decision making for several reasons .
First , it 's only half of the cost - benefit equation .
Every decision has costs and benefits , risks and rewards .
By speculating about what can possibly go wrong , and then acting as if that is likely to happen , worst - case thinking focuses only on the extreme but improbable risks and does a poor job at assessing outcomes .
Second , it 's based on flawed logic .
It begs the question by assuming that a proponent of an action must prove that the nightmare scenario is impossible .
Third , it can be used to support any position or its opposite .
If we build a nuclear power plant , it could melt down .
If we do n't build it , we will run short of power and society will collapse into anarchy .
If we allow flights near Iceland 's volcanic ash , planes will crash and people will die .
If we do n't , organs wo n't arrive in time for transplant operations and people will die .
If we do n't invade Iraq , Saddam Hussein might use the nuclear weapons he might have .
If we do , we might destabilize the Middle East , leading to widespread violence and death .
Of course , not all fears are equal .
Those that we tend to exaggerate are more easily justified by worst - case thinking .
So terrorism fears trump privacy fears , and almost everything else ; technology is hard to understand and therefore scary ; nuclear weapons are worse than conventional weapons ; our children need to be protected at all costs ; and annihilating the planet is bad .
Basically , any fear that would make a good movie plot is amenable to worst - case thinking .
Fourth and finally , worst - case thinking validates ignorance .
Instead of focusing on what we know , it focuses on what we do n't know -- and what we can imagine .
Remember Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld 's quote ?
" Reports that say that something has n't happened are always interesting to me , because as we know , there are known knowns ; there are things we know we know .
We also know there are known unknowns ; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know .
But there are also unknown unknowns -- the ones we do n't know we do n't know . "
And this : " the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence . "
Ignorance is n't a cause for doubt ; when you can fill that ignorance with imagination , it can be a call to action .
Even worse , it can lead to hasty and dangerous acts .
You can't wait for a smoking gun , so you act as if the gun is about to go off .
Rather than making us safer , worst - case thinking has the potential to cause dangerous escalation .
The new undercurrent in this is that our society no longer has the ability to calculate probabilities .
Risk assessment is devalued .
Probabilistic thinking is repudiated in favor of " possibilistic thinking " :
Since we can't know what 's likely to go wrong , let 's speculate about what can possibly go wrong .
Worst - case thinking leads to bad decisions , bad systems design , and bad security .
And we all have direct experience with its effects : airline security and the TSA , which we make fun of when we 're not appalled that they 're harassing 93 - year - old women or keeping first - graders off airplanes .
You can't be too careful !
Actually , you can .
You can refuse to fly because of the possibility of plane crashes .
You can lock your children in the house because of the possibility of child predators .
You can eschew all contact with people because of the possibility of hurt .
Steven
Hawking wants to avoid trying to communicate with aliens because they might be hostile ; does he want to turn off all the planet 's television broadcasts because they 're radiating into space ?
It is n't hard to parody worst - case thinking , and at its extreme it 's a psychological condition .
Frank Furedi , a sociology professor at the University of Kent , writes : " Worst - case thinking encourages society to adopt fear as one of the dominant principles around which the public , the government and institutions should organize their life .
It institutionalizes insecurity and fosters a mood of confusion and powerlessness .
Through popularizing the belief that worst cases are normal , it incites people to feel defenseless and vulnerable to a wide range of future threats . "
Even worse , it plays directly into the hands of terrorists , creating a population that is easily terrorized -- even by failed terrorist attacks like the Christmas Day underwear bomber and the Times Square SUV bomber .
When someone is proposing a change , the onus should be on them to justify it over the status quo .
But worst case thinking is a way of looking at the world that exaggerates the rare and unusual and gives the rare much more credence than it deserves .
It is n't really a principle ; it 's a cheap trick to justify what you already believe .
It lets lazy or biased people make what seem to be cogent arguments without understanding the whole issue .
And when people do n't need to refute counterarguments , there 's no point in listening to them .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bruce Schneier .
The Washington Post reported Sunday that the Palestinian Authority was considering coining its own currency rather than continuing trade with the Israeli shekel .
The Palestinians , who have been using the shekel since 1967 , are considering coining a Palestinian lire as part of the creation of an independent state .
Behind the move is Jihad al - Wazir , whom the Post called " the closest thing to a Palestinian Federal Reserve board chairman " , and who is a close friend of the governor of the Bank of Israel , Stanley Fischer .
Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad believes the reform will allow the authority to function independently of Israel if and when a state is established .
Other Palestinian officials are working on creating additional government institutions , such as a statistics bureau .
In the meantime , al - Wazir is battling money laundering and attempting to increase inspection in the federal reserve .
As to the coin , he claims " all possibilities are open " .
OAKLAND , Calif . -- Dallas Braden definitely owns the mound now .
Braden pitched the 19th perfect game in major league history on Sunday , shutting down the majors ' hottest team and leading the Oakland Athletics to a 4 - 0 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays .
Braden threw his arms in the air after Gabe Kapler grounded out to shortstop for the final out , his simmering feud with Yankees star Alex Rodriguez merely a footnote to the first perfect game for Oakland in 42 years .
The closest the Rays got to a hit was Jason Bartlett 's liner to third leading off the game .
Evan Longoria tried to bunt leading off the fifth , drawing boos from the small crowd .
" Pretty cool , " Braden said .
" I do n't know what to think about it just yet .
There 's definitely a select group .
I 'd like to have a career more than today . "
Before this gem , Braden was best known for his enraged reaction to Rodriguez walking across the mound on April 22 .
Still angry after the game , he told the slugger " to go do laps in the bullpen " if he wanted to traipse across a mound .
The squabble was still simmering last week .
On Friday in Boston , Rodriguez said he did n't want to extend Braden 's " extra 15 minutes of fame . "

The Israeli government is hoping YouTube and Twitter can help restore its reputation after a botched raid on a Gaza - bound flotilla killed nine people .
Do n't get your hopes up , Bibi .
There 's only so much a technological tactic can do after such a big strategic blunder .
Besides , the folks on those ships had camera phones , too .
Every few hours , the Israeli Defense Forces are uploading to YouTube a new video meant to demonstrate that their troops acted responsibly – and that the people in the " Free Gaza " flotilla were the hostile ones .
At around 10 p.m. local time Monday night , it was footage taken by IDF naval boat showing the passengers beating up Israeli troops .
An hour later , it was a clip of the " knives , slingshots , rocks , smoke bombs , metal rods , improvised sharp metal objects , sticks and clubs " found on board the Mavi Marmara .
About two hours ago , the IDF showed how it was unloading " humanitarian cargo " from the ships and into Gaza .
In between , the IDF is providing a stream of Twitter updates and blog posts to reinforce its position .
But no one – not even the Israeli military – seems to think it 'll make much of a difference in the international tide of ill will following the raid .
" We know one thing for sure , in the media we are going to lose the war anyhow , '' Shlomo Dror , a spokesman for Israel 's Defense Ministry , told the Christian Science Monitor .
" It does n't matter what we do . ''
Dror made those comments on May 28 – days before those commandos stormed the Free Gaza flotilla .
Israel gave up on the information war before it even started .
The IDF has been practicing a willful indifference to global opinion for years .
After the Hezbollah war of 2006 , it decided that sensitivity to outside perception made its forces too hesitant , and put lives on both sides at risk .
So in its 2009 Gaza campaign , the IDF decided to do the exact opposite :
Shut out the international press , and fight without restraint and without a care about what anyone else thought .
The IDF did ( https://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2009/01/israeli-combat/), but they were there to defend troops against accusations of war crimes .
Meanwhile , a young Israeli soldier – born in a small town in Hawaii , and converted to Judaism at Yale – got together with another American Israeli who thought it'd be cool to share some of those videos online .
That became the IDF 's official YouTube channel , unexpectedly generating millions and millions of views .
But social media ( and information operations , generally ) remained on the periphery of Israeli planning .
Just look at the heavy - handed , tone - deaf response to the " Free Gaza " ships .
" The IDF had hoped to obtain a complete media blackout and planned to jam the signals from the Mavi Marmara , " the Jerusalem Post reports .
" This did not work and the cameras on the boat successfully transmitted images throughout most of the takeover and enabled the activists to get their message out about the Israeli ' aggression . ' "
" If I am in charge of doing that for the Israeli Navy , I am going to assume these people are smart and are deliberately trying to provoke a crazy response from my sailors and soldiers that will produce ready - for - television images that both isolate Israel within the international community and further raise the ire of the Arabic - speaking and Islamic worlds ....
The last thing you want to do is return fire with 7.62 mm , killing a bunch of civilians and giving the enemy exactly the effect he was looking for , " Center for a New American Security fellow Andrew Exum blogs .
" What happened today is the Israelis got their butts handed to them . "
Pro-Palestinian activist Hussein Ibish agrees .
" The whole point of the ' Gaza flotilla ' was to get a reaction out of Israel , " notes Ibish .
" Israeli officials described it as ' a provocation ' and I 'm not sure that was entirely incorrect :
Like all other acts of civil disobedience , it was designed to provoke a response .
I 'm shocked but not surprised that the Israeli military , which was determined to prevent those ships from reaching the Gaza port , managed to mishandle the situation so badly . "
Maybe there 's an argument to be made that certain countries – the United States , for example – are strong enough to ignore the rest of the planet .
" With roughly the population of Houston , Texas , Israel is just not large enough to withstand extended isolation , meaning this event has profound geopolitical implications , " Stratfor observes .
The U.N. Security Council has condemned the raid .
Israel 's strongest ally in the Muslim world , Turkey , is speaking out against its one - time friend .
Public opinion matters where issues are not of fundamental interest to a nation .
Israel is not a fundamental interest to other nations .
The ability to generate public antipathy to Israel can therefore reshape Israeli relations with countries critical to Israel .
For example , a redefinition of U.S. - Israeli relations will have much less effect on the United States than on Israel .
The Obama administration , already irritated by the Israelis , might now see a shift in U.S. public opinion that will open the way to a new U.S. - Israeli relationship disadvantageous to Israel .
The Israelis will argue that this is all unfair , as they were provoked .
Like the British [ in the 1940s ] , they seem to think that the issue is whose logic is correct .
But the issue actually is , whose logic will be heard ?
As with a tank battle or an airstrike , this sort of warfare has nothing to do with fairness .
It has to do with controlling public perception and using that public perception to shape foreign policy around the world .
The next battle in that information war will come soon .
Two more ships are headed towards Gaza .
" Next time we 'll use more force , " one officer said .

WHO credibility destroyed
Yet more criticism for WHO
How the scam really worked
The criminality of the vaccine industry
( NaturalNews )
A stunning new report reveals that top scientists who convinced the World Health Organization ( WHO ) to declare H1N1 a global pandemic held close financial ties to the drug companies that profited from the sale of those vaccines .
This report , published in the , exposes the hidden ties that drove WHO to declare a pandemic , resulting in billions of dollars in profits for vaccine manufacturers .
Several key advisors who urged WHO to declare a pandemic received direct financial compensation from the very same vaccine manufacturers who received a windfall of profits from the pandemic announcement .
During all this , WHO refused to disclose any conflicts of interests between its top advisors and the drug companies who would financially benefit from its decisions .
All the kickbacks , in other words , were swept under the table and kept silent , and WHO somehow did n't think it was important to let the world know that it was receiving policy advice from individuals who stood to make millions of dollars when a pandemic was declared .
The report was authored by Deborah Cohen ( BMJ features editor ) , and Philip Carter , a journalist who works for .
In their report , Cohen states , " ... our investigation has revealed damaging issues .
If these are not addressed , H1N1 may yet claim its biggest victim -- the credibility of the WHO and the trust in the global public health system .
"
In response to the report , WHO secretary - general Dr Margaret Chan defended the secrecy , saying that WHO intentionally kept the financial ties a secret in order to " ... protect the integrity and independence of the members while doing this critical work ... [ and ] also to ensure transparency .
" Dr Chan apparently does not understand the meaning of the word " transparency . "
Then again , WHO has always twisted reality in order to serve its corporate masters , the pharmaceutical giants who profit from disease .
To say that they are keeping the financial ties a secret in order to " protect the integrity " of the members is like saying we 're all serving alcohol at tonight 's AA meeting in order to keep everybody off the bottle .
It just flat out makes no sense .
But since when did making sense have anything to do with WHO 's decision process anyway ?
Even Fiona Godlee , editor of the BMJ , had harsh words for the WHO , saying , " ...its credibility has been badly damaged .
WHO must act now to restore its credibility .
" The BMJ is n't the only medical publication criticizing WHO for its poor handling of conflicts of interest .
Another report from thealso criticized WHO , saying : " Parliamentary Assembly is alarmed about the way in which the H1N1 influenza pandemic has been handled , not only by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) , but also by the competent health authorities at the level of the European Union and at national level . "
It went on to explain that WHO 's actions led to " a waste of large sums of public money , and also unjustified scares and fears about health risks faced by the European public at large .
"
The funny thing is , NaturalNews and other natural health advocates told you all the same thing a year ago , and we did n't have to spend millions of dollars on a study to arrive at this conclusion .
to anyone who knows just how corrupt the sick - care industry really is .
They 'll do practically anything to make more money , including bribing WHO scientific advisors and paying them kickbacks once the vaccine sales surge .
The vaccine industry and all its drug pushers are , of course , criticizing this investigative report .
They say WHO " had no choice " but to declare a pandemic and recommend vaccines , since vaccines are the only treatment option for influenza .
That 's a lie , of course : Vitamin D has been scientifically proven to be five times more effective than vaccines at preventing influenza infections , but The entire focus was on pushing more high - profit vaccines , not recommending the things that would actually help people the most .
And now we know why :
The more vulnerable people were to the pandemic , , thereby " proving " the importance of vaccination programs .
People were kept ignorant of natural remedies , in other words , to make sure more people died and a more urgent call for mass vaccination programs could be carried out .
( A few lives never gets in the way of Big Pharma profits , does it ? )
Here 's a summary of how the WHO vaccine scam worked :
WHO hypes up the pandemic risk by declaring a phase 6 pandemic even when the mortality rate of the virus was so low that it could be halted with simple vitamin D supplements .
WHO urged nations around the world to stockpile H1N1 vaccines , calling it a " public health emergency .
" Countries spend billions of dollars buying and stockpiling H1N1 vaccines while Big Pharma pockets the cash .
WHO advisors , meanwhile , collected their kickbacks from the vaccine manufacturers .
Those kickbacks were intentionally kept secret .
In order to keep demand for the vaccines as high as possible , WHO continued to flame the fears by warning that H1N1 was extremely dangerous and everybody should continue to get vaccinated .
( The CDC echoed the same message in the USA . ) This is how WHO pulled off one of the greatest vaccine pandemic scams in the last century , and it worked like gangbusters .
WHO advisors walked away with loads of cash , the drug companies stockpiled huge profits , and the taxpayers of nations around the world were left saddled with useless vaccines rotting on the shelves that will soon have to be destroyed ( at additional taxpayer cost , no doubt ) or dumped down the drain ( where they will contaminate the waterways ) .
Meanwhile , , thereby ensuring that the next pandemic will give them another opportunity to repeat the exact same scam ( for yet more profit ) .
The bottom line is all this is a frightening picture of justthe vaccine industry has become and the WHO and the CDC really are .
What took place here is called , folks .
Kickbacks were paid , lies were told and governments were swindled out of billions of dollars .
These are felony crimes being committed by our global health leaders .
The real question is :
Why do governments continue to allow public health organizations to be so easily corrupted by the vaccine industry ?
And who will stand up to this profit conspiracy that exploits members of the public as if they were profit - generating guinea pigs ?
The next time you hear the WHO say anything , just remember :
Their advisors are on the take from the drug companies , and just about anything you 're likely to hear from the World Health Organization originates with a profit motive rather than a commitment to public health .
Oh , and by the way ... for the record , there has never been a single scientific study ever published showing that H1N1 vaccines worked .
Not only was the H1N1 pandemic a fraud to begin with , but the medicine they claimed treated it was also based on fraud .
And now we know the rest of the story of why it was all done : Kickbacks from Big Pharma , paid to advisors who told WHO to declare a pandemic .
A senior Kyrgyz official today warned that the interim government would consider shutting a strategic US airbase if Britain refused to hand over the son of the country 's ousted president .
The Kyrgyz government believes Maxim Bakiyev , arrested at Farnborough airport on Sunday , helped organise the violence ravaging the country 's south .
Kyrgyzstan 's deputy leader of the provisional government , Azimbek Beknazarov , said : " England never gives up people who arrive on its territory .
But since England and the US fight terrorism and the arrangement with the airbase is one of the elements of that fight , then they must give over Maxim Bakiyev . "
Bakiyev , son of the deposed Kyrgyz president Kurmanbek Bakiyev , was arrested by immigration officials on Sunday after flying into Britain on a private jet .
An arrest warrant had been issued by Interpol on charges of money laundering .
He has reportedly sought asylum .
The interim Kyrgyz government believes Bakiyev Jr , one of Kyrgyzstan 's wealthiest men , financed the unrest that led to the slaughter of hundreds of ethnic Uzbeks and the displacement of some 400,000 .
In an unverified telephone recording released in May , a month after his father 's government was overthrown , Bakiyev Jr is allegedly heard plotting to stir unrest to bring his family back to power .
The elder Bakiyev , who has fled to Belarus , has denied any role in the violence .
The US is concerned the new government could seek to shut the airbase it rents at Manas , its main transit hub for troops and equipment destined for Afghanistan .
Resupply flights have not been stopped despite the violence in the south , and Washington has distributed millions of pounds in humanitarian aid through the base since the unrest began .
Analysts have dismissed Beknazorov 's threat to shut the base .
" It seems like his personal initiative , " said Fyodor Lukyanov , editor - in - chief of Russia in Global Affairs .
" It 's total stupidity . "
Moscow hopes to see the base shut , eager to maintain a hold over what it sees as its backyard .
At the same time , it has denied repeated requests to send peacekeepers to Kyrgyzstan .
She also suffered stab wounds in the attack .
Inspector Terry Kane said it appeared the man made his way to the church 100 metres away from the service station where he remained until the siege ended about two - and - a - half hours later .
He defended the time police took to end the dramatic stand - off .
“ Our aim is to resolve these things as peacefully as possible , and we have got that result , ” Inspector Kane said .
Witnesses said the woman ’s partner allegedly stopped bystanders from extinguishing the flames , telling them to ‘‘ let her burn ’ ’ .
A bystander , Darren , drove his Jeep at the man in a desperate bid to get him away from the woman , who was rolling around on the ground in flames .
Darren told Radio 3 AW the man had a knife or screwdriver and was waving it about erratically , preventing onlookers from rescuing the woman .
‘‘ The first thing I thought of was , maybe if I used the car , I might be able to knock him over or scare him off , ’’ he said .
‘‘ The flames were getting big and it was starting to get pretty black and by the time I headed into the petrol station he was hard to see , but I obviously scared him a bit and he ran off .
‘‘ By the time I parked the car a few guys had managed to get in there with a towel and get actually the towel onto the lady and get her out to safety .
‘‘ It was by then that the car was pretty much starting to bang and pop and it pretty much went up in flames . ’’
Darren said even though he knew the petrol bowser might explode , he wanted to help the injured woman .
‘ ‘( It ’s ) always in your mind , but there ’s somebody burning on the ground .
The fact that there was a few people there that were willing to do something , you just want to do what you can to save that person . ’’
Truck driver Beau Flemming said he was driving down the Mountain Highway when he heard an explosion and saw the car alight .
He said bystanders grabbed fire extinguishers and tried to help the woman , who was completely engulfed in flames , however the man prevented anyone from approaching her .
" The male was running around waving knives and everyone was trying to help the female and it went pear - shaped real quick , " he told Radio 3AW .
" [ She was ] engulfed , completely .
All her hair , everything .
There was not one bit of white skin left . "
He said a bystander jumped in his Hummer and drove at the man in a bid to " run him over so we could have access to her " .
" He was waving knives around at us , a very scary situation for everyone , " Mr Flemming said .
" [ He was ] telling her to burn , yeah , just not a very pleasant sight .
" The car was completely engulfed , she was completely engulfed , there was just black smoke pouring out from underneath the servo .
We were just trying to get her away because we did n’t know if they had shut the valves off to the pumps or anything . "
Another witness , Derek McLaughlin , said he heard an explosion about 8.30 am and made his way to the service station from his nearby office .
He said he saw the woman rolling around on the ground trying to extinguish herself next to a 90s - model Toyota Camry .
‘‘ The car was a fireball , ’’ he said .
‘‘ The interior was completely on fire .
The flames were hitting the canopy and going above the roof .
‘‘ She was screaming .
The other guy was carrying on saying ‘‘ F **k you , let her burn .
‘‘ There were people in the carpark trying to help .
He was telling them to f**k off . ’’
Ambulance Victoria spokeswoman Susannah Wilson said the woman suffered burns to nearly 100 per cent of her body .
The woman was conscious when paramedics arrived and was flown to The Alfred hospital in a critical condition .
Loading Victoria Police has offered to organise counselling for anyone who witnessed today ’s fire , while homicide squad detectives have appealed for anyone with footage of the incident to come forward .
Witnesses and affected members of the public should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 .
While many people define polyamory as the practice of having more than one intimate relationship at a time with everyone 's full knowledge and consent , I see it differently .
To me polyamory is a of loving that asks us to surrender to love .
Polyamory leads us to ask , " What is the most loving and authentic way I can be present with these people and with myself at this time ? "
The answer to this question may not always be obvious , and it may change over time , but the asking of it , and the willingness to consider answers we may not want to hear , is the whole point of polyamory .
Most of us would rather surrender to our cultural conditioning , to our emotional discomfort , , social censure , lust , convenience , or a partner 's demands than to the unvarnished truth about what would contribute the most to the well being of everyone involved .
In my forthcoming book , Polyamory in the 21st Century ( Rowman & Littlefield , June 2010 ) I give many examples of people who give different reasons for why they are choosing polyamory .
They are surprisingly varied and range from a desire for personal or growth , an effort to overcome wounds , coping with issues , stabilizing or spicing up a relationship , religious or political beliefs , sexual variety , sexual , or simply falling in love .
Many of these same reasons are given by other people to explain why they are choosing monogamy .
Perhaps , we only come up with these reasons afterwards to explain the behaviors we notice ourselves engaging in .
One thing is certain .
Love is a force of nature , and sooner or later , nature will have her way with us .
Fighting , rather than surrendering to love , is ultimately a losing battle .
Passengers on board the Gaza - bound aid flotilla give their accounts of what happened when Israeli commandos boarded the ships , killing nine .
The activists , speaking on their return home , said as well as firing live and plastic rounds , commandos had administered electric shocks and beaten passengers during the assault .
Israeli soldiers have said the troops acted in self - defence after they were attacked while boarding the Turkish ship , the Mavi Marmara , the largest of the six ships in the convoy .
BULENT YILDRIM , TURKEY
Bulent Yildrim is head of the Istanbul - based Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief ( IHH ) , which organised the flotilla .
Upon his arrival back in Turkey , he admitted some of the activists had grabbed the guns off soldiers in self - defence .
" Yes , we took their guns .
It would be self - defence even if we fired their guns .
We told our friends on board : ' We will die , become martyrs , but never let us be shown ... as the ones who used guns ' .
By this decision , our friends accepted death , and we threw all the guns we took from them into the sea . "
He described how a doctor and a journalist were both shot at close range , and said another activist was shot as he was surrendering .
" I took off my shirt and waved it , as a white flag .
We thought they would stop after seeing the white flag , but they continued killing people , " he said .

Norman Paech , a former member of Germany 's Left Party , was aboard the Mavi Marmara .
Speaking at a news conference in Berlin , he said the ship was surrounded by small Israeli assault boats on Monday morning at about 0430 local time .
" Moments later , we heard detonations and then soldiers from helicopters above us dropped down on board .
" The soldiers were all masked , carrying big guns and were extremely brutal . "
Mr Paech said he only saw three activists resisting .
" They had no knives , no axes , only sticks that they used to defend themselves , " he told reporters .
But he said he could " not rule out " that others used weapons somewhere else on the boat .
NILUFER CETIN , TURKEY
Turkish activist Nilufer Cetin told reporters she hid with her baby in the bathroom of her cabin aboard the Mavi Marmara .
" When the Mavi Marmara continued on its course , the harassment [ from Israeli ships ] turned into an attack , " she said .
" They used smoke bombs followed by gas canisters .
They started to descend on to the ship with helicopters .
" It [ the violence ] was extremely bad and brutal .
The ship turned into a lake of blood .
" I was one of the first victims to be released because I had a child .
They confiscated everything , our telephones , laptops are all gone .
" We were aware of the possible danger [ in joining the trip ] but there are thousands of babies in Gaza .
If we had reached Gaza we would have played with them and taken them food . "
DIMITRIS GIELALIS , GREECE
Activist Dimitris Gielalis , who had been aboard the Sfendoni , was among six Greeks who returned home on Tuesday .
" Suddenly from everywhere we saw inflatables coming at us , and within seconds fully equipped commandos came up on the boat , " he said .
" They came up and used plastic bullets , we had beatings , we had electric shocks , any method we can think of , they used . "
Mr Gielalis said the boat 's captain was beaten for refusing to leave the wheel , and had sustained non-life - threatening injuries , while a cameraman filming the raid was hit with a rifle butt in the eye .
" Of course we were n't prepared for a situation of war , " he said .
ARIS PAPADOKOSTOPOULOS , GREECE
Aris Papadokostopoulos was aboard the Free Mediterranean , travelling behind the Mavi Marmara and carrying mainly Greek and Swedish activists .
" The Turkish ship [ the Mavi Marmara ] was in front of us ... on which there was a terrible raid from the air and from the sea and from everywhere , with shooting , " he said .
Mr Papadokostopoulos said aboard the other boats , commandos beat activists but nobody was gravely injured .
He said no - one put up resistance on the Free Mediterranean , which was carrying a cargo of wheelchairs , building material and medical and pharmaceutical aid .
" Some people were hit by clubs and electric shocks .
During their interrogation , many of them were badly beaten in front of us , " he said .
Israeli Navy commandos prevented a terror attack on Monday morning , when a unit of heavily armed Palestinian frogmen was intercepted in the Nahal Aza area .
The troops opened fire after calls to stop were ignored , and five terrorists were killed in the ensuing gunfight .
No IDF commandos were wounded in the incident .
RELATED :
Wearing diving gear and apparently trying to swim from Gaza to an Israeli city along the Mediterranean coast , the terrorists were detected by the commandos and a firefight erupted .
According to IDF , the size of the unit and equipment it was carrying proved that a large scale attack had been planned , and only the commandos ' quick , effective response prevented a disaster .
The latest Palestinian attack followed the recent efforts to break the Gaza blockade and bring equipment into Gaza , including construction equipment that could be used for military purposes .
The Self as a Center of Narrative Gravity
What is a self ?
I will try to answer this question by developing an analogy with something much simpler , something which is nowhere near as puzzling as a self , but has some properties in common with selves .
What I have in mind is the center of gravity of an object .
This is a well - behaved concept in Newtonian physics .
But a center of gravity is not an atom or a subatomic particle or any other physical item in the world .
It has no mass ; it has no color ; it has no physical properties at all , except for spatio - temporal location .
It is a fine example of what Hans Reichenbach would call an abstractum .
It is a purely abstract object .
It is , if you like , a theorist 's fiction .
It is not one of the real things in the universe in addition to the atoms .
But it is a fiction that has nicely defined , well delineated and well behaved role within physics .
Let me remind you how robust and familiar the idea of a center of gravity is .
Consider a chair .
Like all other physical objects , it has a center of gravity .
If you start tipping it , you can tell more or less accurately whether it would start to fall over or fall back in place if you let go of it .
We 're all quite good at making predictions involving centers of gravity and devising explanations about when and why things fall over .
Place a book on the chair .
It , too , has a center of gravity .
If you start to push it over the edge , we know that at some point will fall .
It will fall when its center of gravity is no longer directly over a point of its supporting base ( the chair seat ) .
Notice that that statement is itself virtually tautological .
The key terms in it are all interdefinable .
And yet it can also figure in explanations that appear to be causal explanations of some sort .
We ask " Why does n't that lamp tip over ? "
We reply " Because its center of gravity is so low . "
Is this a causal explanation ?
It can compete with explanations that are clearly causal , such as : " Because it 's nailed to the table , " and " Because it 's supported by wires . "
We can manipulate centers of gravity .
For instance , I change the center of gravity of a water pitcher easily , by pouring some of the water out .
So , although a center of gravity is a purely abstract object , it has a spatio - temporal career , which I can affect by my actions .
It has a history , but its history can include some rather strange episodes .
Although it moves around in space and time , its motion can be discontinuous .
For instance , if I were to take a piece of bubble gum and suddenly stick it on the pitcher 's handle , that would shift the pitcher 's center of gravity from point A to point B .
But the center of gravity would not have to move through all the intervening positions .
As an abstractum , it is not bound by all the constraints of physical travel .
Consider the center of gravity of a slightly more complicated object .
Suppose we wanted to keep track of the career of the center of gravity of some complex machine with lots of turning gears and camshafts and reciprocating rods -- the engine of a steam - powered unicycle , perhaps .
And suppose our theory of the machine 's operation permitted us to plot the complicated trajectory of the center of gravity precisely .
And suppose -- most improbably -- that we discovered that in this particular machine the trajectory of the center of gravity was precisely the same as the trajectory of a particular iron atom in the crankshaft .
Even if this were discovered , we would be wrong even to entertain the hypothesis that the machine 's center of gravity was ( identical with ) that iron atom .
That would be a category mistake .
A center of gravity is just an abstractum .
It 's just a fictional object .
But when I say it 's a fictional object , I do not mean to disparage it ; it 's a wonderful fictional object , and it has a perfectly legitimate place within serious , sober , echt physical science .
A self is also an abstract object , a theorist 's fiction .
The theory is not particle physics but what we might call a branch of people - physics ; it is more soberly known as a phenomenology or hermeneutics , or soul - science ( Geisteswissenschaft ) .
The physicist does an interpretation , if you like , of the chair and its behavior , and comes up with the theoretical abstraction of a center of gravity , which is then very useful in characterizing the behaviour of the chair in the future , under a wide variety of conditions .
The hermeneuticist or phenomenologist -- or anthropologist -- sees some rather more complicated things moving about in the world - - human beings and animals -- and is faced with a similar problem of interpretation .
It turns out to be theoretically perspicuous to organize the interpretation around a central abstraction : each person has a self ( in addition to a center of gravity ) .
In fact we have to posit selves for ourselves as well .
The theoretical problem of self - interpretation is at least as difficult and important as the problem of other - interpretation .
Now how does a self differ from a center of gravity ?
It is a much more complicated concept .
I will try to elucidate it via an analogy with another sort of fictional object : fictional characters in literature .
Pick up Moby Dick and open it up to page one .
It says , " Call me Ishmael . "
Call whom Ishmael ?
Call Melville Ishmael ?
No. Call Ishmael Ishmael .
Melville has created a fictional character named Ishmael .
As you read the book you learn about Ishmael , about his life , about his beliefs and desires , his acts and attitudes .
You learn a lot more about Ishmael then Melville ever explicitly tells you .
Some of it you can read in by implication .
Some of it you can read in by extrapolation .
But beyond the limits of such extrapolation fictional worlds are simply indeterminate .
Thus , consider the following question ( borrowed from David Lewis 's " Truth and Fiction , " American Philosophical Quarterly , 1978 , 15 , pp.37 - 46 ) .
Did Sherlock
Holmes have three nostrils ?
The answer of course is no , but not because Conan Doyle ever says that he does n't , or that he has two , but because we 're entitled to make that extrapolation .
In the absence of evidence to the contrary , Sherlock Holmes ' nose can be supposed to be normal .
Another question : Did Sherlock
Holmes have a mole on his left shoulder blade ?
The answer to this question is neither yes nor no .
Nothing about the text or about the principles of extrapolation from the text permit an answer to that question .
There is simply no fact of the matter .
Why ?
Because Sherlock Holmes is a merely fictional character , created by , or constituted out of , the text and the culture in which that text resides .
This indeterminacy is a fundamental property of fictional objects which strongly distinguishes them from another sort of object scientists talk about : theoretical entities , oor what Reichenbach called illata -- inferred entities , such as atoms , molecules and neutrinos .
A logician might say that the " rpinciple of bivalence " does not hold for fictional objects .
That is to say , with regard to any actual man , living or dead , the question of whether or not he has or had a mole on his left shoulder blade has an anwer , yes or no .
Did Aristotle has such a mole ?
There is a fact of the matter even if we can never discover it .
But with regard to a fictional character , that question may have no answer at all .
We can imagine someone , a benighted literary critic , perhaps , who does n't understand that fiction is fiction .
This critic has a strange theory about how fiction works .
He thinks that something literally magical happens when a novelist writes a novel .
When a novelist sets down words on paper , this critic says ( one often hears claims like this , but not meant to be taken completely literally ) , the novelist actually creates a world .
A litmus test for this bizarre view is the principle of bivalence : when our imagined critic speaks of a fictional world he means a strange sort of real world , a world in which the principle of bivalence holds .
Such a critic might seriously wonder whether Dr Watson was really Moriarty 's second cousin , or whether the conductor of the train that took Holmes and Watson to Aldershot was also the conductor of the train that brought them back to London .
That sort of question can't properly arise if you understand fiction correctly , of course .
Whereas analogous questions about historical personages have to have yes or no answers , even if we may never be able to dredge them up .
Centers of gravity , as a fictional objects , exhibit the same feature .
They have only the properties that the theory that constitutes them endowed them with .
If you scratch your head and say , " I wonder if maybe centers of gravity are really neutrinos ! " you have misunderstood the theoretical status of a center of gravity .
Now how can I make the claim that a self -- your own real self , for instance -- is rather like a fictional character ?
Are n't all fictional selves dependent for their very creation on the existence of real selves ?
It may seem so , but I will argue that this is an illusion .
Let 's go back to Ishmael .
Ishmael is a fictional character , although we can certainly learn all about him .
One might find him in many regards more real than many of one 's friencds .
But , one thinks , Ishmael was created by Melville , and Melville is a real character -- was a real character .
A real self .
Does n't this show that it takes a real self to create a fictional self ?
I think not , but If I am to convince you , I must push you through an exercise of the imagination .
First of all , I want to imagine something some of you may think incredible : a novel - writing machine .
We can suppose it is a product of artificial intelligence research , a computer that has been designed or programmed to write novels .
But it has not been designed to write any particular novel .
We can suppose ( if it helps ) that it has been given a great stock of whatever information it might need , ans some partially random and hence unpredictable ways of starting the seed of a story going , and building upon it .
Now imagine that the designers are sitting back , wondering what kind of novel their creation is going to write .
They turn the thing on and after a while the high speed printer begins to go clickety - clack and out comes the first sentence .
" Call me Gilbert , " it says .
What follows is the apparent autobiography of some fictional Gilbert .
Now Gilbert is a fictional , created self but its creator is no self .
Of course there were human designers who designed the machine , but they did n't design Gilbert .
Gilbert is a product of a design or invention process in which there are n't any selves at all .
That is , I am stipulating that this is not a conscious machine , not a " thinker . "
It is a dumb machine , but it does have the power to write a passable novel .
( IF you think this is striclty impossible I can only challenge you to show why you think this must be so , and invite you read on ; in the end you may not have an interest in defending such a precarious impossibilility - claim . )
So we are to imagine that a passable story is emitted from the machine .
Notice that we can perform the same sort of literary exegesis with regard to this novel as we can with any other .
In fact if you were to pick up a novel at random out of a library , you could not tell with certainty that it was n't written by something like this machine .
( And if you 're a New Critic you should n't care . )
You 've got a text and you can interpret it , and so you can learn the story , the life and adventures of Gilbert .
Your expectations and predictions , as you read , and your interpretive reconstruction of what you have already read , will congeal around the central node of the fictional character , Gilbert .
But now I want to twiddle the knobs on this thought experiment .
So far we 've imagined the novel , The Life and Times of Gilbert , clanking out of a computer that is just a box , sitting in the corner of some lab .
But now I want to change the story a little bit and suppose that the computer has arms and legs -- or better : wheels .
( I do n't want to make it too anthropomorphic . )
It has a television eye , and it moves around in the world .
It also begins its tale with " Call me Gilbert , " and tells a novel , but now we notice that if we do the trick that the New Critics say you should never do , and look outside the text , we discover that there 's a truth - preserving interpretation of that text in the real world .
The adventures of Gilbert , the fictional character , now bear a striking and presumably non-coincidental relationship to the adventures of this robot rolling around in the world .
If you hit the robot with a baseball bat , very shortly thereafter the story of Gilbert includes his being hit with a baseball bat by somebody who looks like you .
Every now and then the robot gets locked in the closed and then says " Help me ! "
Help whom ?
Well , help Gilbert , presumably .
But who is Gilbert ?
Is Gilbert the robot , or merely the fictional self created by the robot ?
If we go and help the robot out of the closet , it sends us a note : " Thank you .
Love , Gilbert . "
At this point we will be unable to ignore the fact that the fictional career of the fictional Gilbert bears an intersting resemblance to the " career " of this mere robot moving through the world .
We can still maintain that the robot's brain , the robot 's computer , really knows nothing about the world ; it 's not a self .
It 's just a clanky computer .
It does n't know what it 's doing .
It does n't even know that it 's creating a fictional character .
( The same is just as true of your brain ; it does n't know what it 's doing either . )
Nevertheless , the patterns in the behavior that is being controlled by the computer are interpretable , by us , as accreting biography -- telling the narrative of a self .
But we are not the only interpreters .
The robot novelist is also , of course , an interpreter : a self - interpreter , providing its own account of its activities in the world .
I propose that we take this analogy seriously .
" Where is the self ? " a materialist philosopher or neuroscientist might ask .
It is a category mistake to start looking around for the self in the brain .
Unlike centers of gravity , whose sole property is their spatio - temporal position , selves have a spatio - temporal position that is only grossly defined .
Roughly speaking , in the normal case if there are three human beings sitting on a park bench , there are three selves there , all in a row and roughly equidistant from the fountain they face .
Or we might use a rather antique turn of phrase and talk about how many souls are located in the park .
( " All twenty souls in the starboard lifeboat were saved , but those that remained on deck perished . " )
Brain research may permit us to make some more fine - grained localizations , but the capacity to achieve some fine - grained localization does not give one grounds for supposing that the process of localization can continue indefinitely and that the day will finally come when we can say , " That cell there , right in the middle of hippocampus ( or wherever ) - - that 's the self ! "
There 's a big difference , of course , between fictional characters and our own selves .
One I would stress is that a fictional character is usually encountered as a fait accompli .
After the novel has been written and published , you read it .
At that point it is too late for the novelist to render determinate anything indeterminate that strikes your curiosity .
Dostoevesky is dead ; you can't ask him what else Raskolnikov thought while he sat in the police station .
But novels do n't have to be that way .
John Updike has written three novels about Rabbit Angstrom : Rabbit Run , Rabbit Redux , and Rabbit is Rich .
Suppose that those of us who particularly liked the first novel were to get together and compose a list of questions for Updike - - things we wished Updike has talked about in that first novel , when Rabbit was a young former basketball star .
We could send our questions to Updike and ask him to consider writing another novel in the series , only this time not continuing the chronological sequence .
Like Lawrence Durrell 's Alexandria Quarter , the Rabbit series could include another novel about Rabbit 's early days when he was still playing basketball , and this novel could answer our questions .
Notice what we would not be doing in such a case .
We would not be saying to Updike , " Tell us the answers that you already know , the answers that are already fixed to those questions .
Come on , let us know all those secrets you 've been keeping from us . "
Nor would we be asking Updike to do research , as we might ask the author of a multi-volume biography of a real person ,
We would be asking him to write a new novel , to invent some more novel for us , on demand .
And if he acceded , he would enlarge and make more determinate the character of Rabbit Angstrom in the process of writing the new novel .
In this way matters which are indeterminate at one time can become determined later by a creative step .
I propose that this imagined exercise with Updike , getting him to write more novels on demand to answer our questions , is actually a familiar exercise .
That is the way we treat each other ; that is the way we are .
We can not undo those parts of our pasts that are determinate , but our selves are constantly being made more determinate as we go along in response to the way the world impinges on us .
Of course it is also possible for a person to engage in auto - hermeneutics , interpetation of one 's self , and in particular to go back and think about one 's past , and one 's memories , and to rethink them and rewrite them .
This process does change the " fictional " character , the character that you are , in much the way that Rabbit Angstrom , after Updike writes the second novel about him as a young man , comes to be a rather different fictional character , determinate in ways he was never determinate before .
This would be an utterly mysterious and magical prospect ( and hence something no one should take seriously ) if the self were anything but an abstractum .
I want to bring this out by extracting one more feature from the Updike thought experiment .
Updike might take up our request but then he might prove to be forgetful .
After all , it 's been many years since he wrote Rabbit Run .
He might not want to go back and reread it carefully ; and when he wrote the new novel it might end up being inconsistent with the first .
He might have Rabbit being in two places at one time , for instance .
If we wanted to settle what the true story was , we'd be falling into error ; there is no true story .
In such a circumstance there would be simply be a failure of coherence of all the data that we had about Rabbit .
And because Rabbit is a fictional character , we would n't smite our foreheads in wonder and declare " Oh my goodness !
There 's a rift in the universe ; we 've found a contradiction in nature ! "
Nothing is easier than contradiction when you 're dealing with fiction ; a fictional character can have contradictory properties because it 's just a fictional character .
We find such contradictions intolerable , however , when we are trying to interpret something or someone , even a fictional character , so we typically bifurcate the character to resolve the conflict .
Something like this seems to happen to real people on rare occasions .
Consider the putatively true case histories recorded in The Three Faces of Eve and Sybil .
( Corbett H. Thigpen and Hervey Cleckly , The Three Faces of Eve , McGraw Hill , 1957 , and Flora Rheta Schreiber , Sybil , Warner paperback , 1973 . )
Eve 's three faces were the faces of three distinct personalities , it seems , and the woman portrayed in Sybil had many different selves , or so it seems .
How can we make sense of this ?
Here is one way - - a solemn , skeptical way favored by some of the psychotherapists with whom I 've talked about such cases : when Sybil went in to see her therapist the first time , she was n't several different people rolled into one body .
Sybil was a novel - writing machine that fell in with a very ingenious questioner , a very eager reader .
And together they collaborated - - innocently -- to write many , many chapters of a new novel .
And , of course , since Sybil was a sort of living novel , she went out and engaged in the world with these new selves , more or less created on demand , under the eager suggestion of a therapist .
I now believe that this is overly skeptical .
The population explosion of new characters that typically follows the onset of psychotherapy for sufferers of Multiple Personality Disorder ( MPD ) is probably to be explained along just these lines , but there is quite compelling evidence in some cases that some multiplicity of selves ( two or three or four , let us say ) had already begun laying down biography before the therapist came along to do the " reading " .
And in any event , Sybil is only a strikingly pathological case of something quite normal , a behavior pattern we can find in ourselves .
We are all , at times , confabulators , telling and retelling ourselves the story of our own lives , with scant attention to the question of truth .
Why , though do we behave this way ?
Why are we all such inveterate and inventive autobiographical novelists ?
As Umberto Maturana has ( uncontroversially ) observed : " Everything said is said by a speaker to another speaker that may be himself . "
But why should one talk to oneself ?
Why is n't that an utterly idle activity , as systematically futile as trying to pick oneself up by one 's own bootstraps ?
A central clue comes from the sort of phenomena uncovered by Michael Gazzaniga 's research on those rare individuals -- the " split - brain subjects " -- whose corpus callosum has been surgically severed , creating in them two largely independent cortical hempisheres that can , on occasion , be differently informed about the current scene .
Does the operation split the self in two ?
After the operation , patients normally exhibit no signs of psychological splitting , appearing to be no less unified than you or I except under particularly contrived circumstances .
But on Gazzaniga 's view , this does not so much show that the patients have preserved their pre-surgical unity as that the unity of normal life is an illusion .
According to Gazzaniga , the normal mind is not beautifully unified , but rather a problematically yoked - together bundle of partly autonomous systems .
All parts of the mind are not equally accessible to each other at all times .
These modules or systems sometimes have internal communication problems which they solve by various ingenious and devious routes .
If this is true ( and I think it is ) , it may provide us with an answer to a most puzzling question about conscious thought : what good is it ?
Such a question begs for a evolutionary answer , but it will have to speculative , of course .
( It is not critical to my speculative answer , for the moment , where genetic evolution and transmission breaks off and cultural evolution and transmission takes over . )
In the beginning -- according to Julian Jaynes ( The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind , Boston : Hougton Mifflin , 1976 ) , whose account I am adapting -- were speakers , our ancestors , who were n't really conscious .
They spoke , but they just sort of blurted things out , more or less the way bees do bee dances , or the way computers talk to each other .
That is not conscious communication , surely .
When these ancestors had problems , sometimes they would " ask " for help ( more or less like Gilbert saying " Help me ! " when he was locked in the closet ) , and sometimes there would be somebody around to hear them .
So they got into the habit of asking for assistance and , particularly , asking questions .
Whenever they could n't figure out how to solve some problem , they would ask a question , addressed to no one in particular , and sometimes whoever was standing around could answer them .
And they also came to be designed to be provoked on many such occasions into answering questions like that -- to the best of their ability -- when asked .
Then one day one of our ancestors asked a question in what was apparently an inappropriate cirucmstance : thre was nobody around to be the audience .
Strangely enough , he heard his own question , and this stimulated him , cooperatively , to think of an answer , and sure enough the answer came to him .
He had established , without realizing what he had done , a communication link between two parts of his brain , between which there was , for some deep biological reason , an accessability problem .
One component of the mind had confronted a problem that another component could solve ; if only the problem could be posed for the latter component !
Thanks to his habit of asking questions , our ancestor stumbled upon a route via the ears .
What a discovery !
Sometimes talking and listening to yourself can have wonderful effects , not otherwise obtainable .
All that is needed to make sense of this idea is the hypothesis that the modules of the mind have different capacities and ways of doing things , and are not perfectly interaccessible .
Under such circumstances it could be true that the way to get yourself to figure out a problem is to tickle your ear with it , to get that part of your brain which is best stimulated by hearing a question to work on the problem .
Then sometimes you will find yourself with the answer you seek on the tip of your tongue .
This would be enough to establish the evolutionary endorsement ( which might well be only culturally transmitted ) of the behavior of talking to yourself .
But as many writers have observed , conscious thinking seems -- much of it -- to be a variety of particularly efficient and private talking to oneself .
The evolutionary transition to thought is then easy to conjure up .
All we have to suppose is that the route , the circuit that at first went via mouth and ear , got shorter .
People " realized " that the actual vocalization and audition was a rather inefficient part of the loop .
Besides , if there were other people around who might overhear it , you might give away more information than you wanted .
So what developed was a habit of subvocalization , and this in turn could be streamlined into conscious , verbal thought .
In his posthumous book On Thinking ( ed. Konstantin Kolenda , Totowa New Jersey , Rowman and Littlefield , 1979 ) , Gilbert Ryle asks : " What is Le Penseur doing ? "
For behaviorists like Ryle this is a real problem .
One bit of chin - on - fist - with - knitted - brow looks pretty much like another bit , and yet some of it seems to arrive at good answers and some of it does n't .
What can be going on here ?
Ironically , Ryle , the arch - behaviorist , came up with some very sly suggestions about what might be going on .
Conscious thought , Ryle claimed , should be understood on the model of self - teaching , or better , perhaps : self - schooling or training .
Ryle had little to say about how this self - schooling might actually work , but we can get some initial understanding of it on the supposition that we are not the captains of our ships ; there is no conscious self that is unproblematically in command of the mind 's resources .
Rather , we are somewhat disunified .
Our component modules have to act in opportunistic but amazingly resourceful ways to produce a modicum of behavioral unity , which is then enhanced by an illusion of greater unity .
What Gazzaniga 's research reveals , sometimes in vivid detail , is how this must go on .
Consider some of his evidence for the extraordinary resourcefulness exhibited by ( something in ) the right hemisphere when it is faced with a communication problem .
In one group of experiments , split - brain subjects must reach into a closed bag with the left hand to feel an object , which they are then to identify verbally .
The sensory nerves in the left hand lead to the right hemisphere , whereas the control of speech is normally in the left hemisphere , but for most of us , this poses no problem .
In a normal person , the left hand can know what the right hand is doing thanks to the corpus collosum , which keeps both hemispheres mutually informed .
But in a split - brain subject , this unifying link has been removed ; the right hemisphere gets the information about the touched object from the left hand , but the left , language - controlling , hemisphere must make the identification public .
So the " part which can speak " is kept in the dark , while the " part which knows " can not make public its knowledge .
There is a devious solution to this problem , however , and split - brain patients have been observed to discover it .
Whereas ordinary tactile sensations are represented contralaterally -- the signals go to the opposite hemisphere -- pain signals are also represented ipsilaterally .
That is , thanks to the way the nervous system is wired up , pain stimuli go to both hemispheres .
Suppose the object in the bag is a pencil .
The right hemisphere will sometimes hit upon a very clever tactic : hold the pencil in your left hand so its point is pressed hard into your palm ; this creates pain , and lets the left hemisphere know there 's something sharp in the bag , which is enough of a hint so that it can begin guessing ; the right hemisphere will signal " getting warmer " and " got it " by smiling or other controllable sings , and in a very short time " the subject " -- the apparently unified " sole inhabitant " of the body -- will be able to announce the correct answer .
Now either the split - brain subjects have developed this extraordinarily devious talent as a reaction to the operation that landed them with such radical accessibility problem , or the operation reveals -- but does not create - - a virtuoso talent to be found also in normal people .
Surely , Gazzaniga claims , the latter hypothesis is the most likely one to investigate .
That is , it does seem that we are all virtuoso novelists , who find ourselves engaged in all sorts of behavior , more or less unified , but sometimes disunified , and we always put the best " faces " on it we can .
We try to make all of our material cohere into a single good story .
And that story is our autobiography .
The chief fictional character at the center of that autobiography is one 's self .
And if you still want to know what the self really is , you 're making a category mistake .
After all , when a human being 's behavioral control system becomes seriously impaired , it can turn out that the best hermeneutical story we can tell about that individual says that there is more than one character " inhabiting " that body .
This is quite possible on the view of the self that I have been presenting ; it does not require any fancy metaphysical miracles .
One can discover multiple selves in a person just as unproblematically as one could find Early Young Rabbit and Late Young Rabbit in the imagined Updike novels : all that has to be the case is that the story does n't cohere around one self , one imaginary point , but coheres ( coheres much better , in any case ) around two different imaginary points .
We sometimes encounter psychological disorders , or surgically created disunities , where the only way to interpret or make sense of them is to posit in effect two centers of gravity , two selves .
One is n't creating or discovering a little bit of ghost stuff in doing that .
One is simply creating another abstraction .
It is an abstraction one uses as part of a theorical apparastus to understand , and predict , and make sense of , the behavior of some very complicated things .
The fact that these abstract selves seem so robust and real is not surprising .
They are much more complicated theoretical entities than a center of gravity .
And remember that even a center of gravity has a fairly robust presence , once we start playing around with it .
But no one has ever seen or ever will see a center of gravity .
As David Hume noted , no one has ever seen a self , either .
" For my part , when I enter most intimately into what I call myself , I always stumble on some particular perception or other , of heat or cold , light or shade , love or hatred , pain or pleasure .
I never can catch myself at any time without a percepton , and never can observe anything but the perception ....
If anyone , upon serious and unprejudiced reflection , thinks he has a different notion of himself , I must confess I can reason no longer with him .
All I can allow him is , that he may be in the right as well as I , and that we are essentially different in this particular .
He may , perhaps , perceive something simple and continued , which he calls himself ; though I am certain there is no such principle in me . "

The WHOIS is here .
After admiring the double and double - double dovetail joints that are capable with the Incra and other jigs , I started thinking , “ Why not try this by hand ? ”
So this box is my first experiment with handcut double dovetails .
It took me some time to figure out the joinery process , but once I realized a few things about this type of joint , it seemed do - able .
It was quite challenging but also a ton of fun .
It also does take some degree of patience and precision … which I ’m still working on .
In this blog , I ’m focusing on the sides of the box , but here ’s a few pictures of the nearly completed box -
Materials .
For this box ’s sides I used three types of primary contrasting woods , although there is no real reason to do so .
Two contrasting woods would work just as well .
The woods I chose are :
 Honduras Rosewood – front and back .
Quite hard and brittle .
Chopping pins was a slow process with many trips back to “ Mr. Tormek ” to regrind / hone .
But it ’s beauty made up for it .
 Caribbean Rosewood – sides .
This wood is very close grained , although very hard , it ’s not quite as hard as the Honduras variety , and not as brittle .
Has some “ florescence ” when changing the viewing angle .
 Birdseye Maple – inlay ( the first dovetails ) .
It ’s really pointless to use birdseye in this application , but it ’s what I had handy at the time .
Regular hard maple would probably work better , maybe even holly .
Construction Keys .
The things I found key when constructing a box like this are :
1 ) Each side of the box receives a rabbet cut on the inside of each end .
2 ) The width of the rabbet equals the width of the side to be joined into it .
3 ) The depth of the rabbet equals the thickness of the initial ( or “ inlaid ” ) dovetail – maple in this case .
4 ) You actually build the box frame ( sides ) twice , cutting the box apart leaving the first set of dovetails , then cutting dovetails within dovetails .
5 ) When doing so it ’s imperative that all the dovetails use precisely the same angle …all the time .
To the degree they are not , the inlaid lines ( maple in this case ) will not be a consistent width , thus detracting from the overall appearance .
You can see some of that in my try here .
The picture below shows the rabbet joint cut on each end of each side –
I set the rabbet depth at 1/8 ” and cut it on my router table .
The decision on the depth of this rabbet made here initially is what “ sets ” the width of the inlaid dovetail for the entire project .
In future boxes using this joinery , I ’ll strive to go narrower , ( maybe 1/16 ” ) but for the first time this seemed a little risky .
Below is a top - view picture of the pieces in relation to each other once they become integral to the box .
In the center is the second of two of my practice joints I tried before starting the box .
The close - up below shows in more detail .
From this picture the steps I next took were :
1 ) cutting tails in the maple ( note the sacrificial maple receives no rabbet joint )
2 ) cutting pins in the Honduras rosewood ( the front / back pieces )
The Tails .
Most often I cut my tails first , pins second .
The photos series below shows the tail cutting process in the maple -
I do n’t normally do this , but for this project I used a small block of wood cut precisely at the dovetail angle for hardwood ( 1:8 ) and used this as a “ guide block ” to rest my saw against for all tails in the box , so they would all be as consistent as possible .
This seems like cheating in a way , but it ’s critical that both sets of dovetails are all consistent .
Again , this is necessary to have an appealing “ inlay line ” in the maple once I ’ve cut the second set of dovetails in the Caribbean rosewood .
These pictures are kind of blurry , but hopefully give the idea –
Below all the saw cuts are made –
Here you can see the relationship of the shoulder in the maple to the rabbet in the rosewood –
In the picture below I ’ve made a cut nearly through the waste , but I stop short of going through and finish coming in from the other side .
This prevents any chance of the fret saw blade cutting into one of the tails .
Ready for pins –
The Pins .
The next series of photos shows how I mark and cut the pins in the Honduras rosewood .
These will accept the maple dovetails .
Note again that the maple is sacrificial , meaning it will be cut off once glued into the Honduras rosewood pins –
Below shows how I mark the pins .
When I ’m doing this for real , my free hand is applying downward pressure on the maple to prevent it from slipping during the marking .
The first picture shows squaring everything up prior to marking .
Notice that I like to use a light under the pieces when positioning the tails for marking the pins…so that the gap between the maple shoulders and the edge of the rosewood can be easily seen and closed very precisely .
For this project I ’m using a x - acto knife .
I have marking knives , and I was a little hesitant to try this , but it worked out fine .
Here I ’m marking the full thickness of the maple ( plus 1/64 ” ) on the rosewood so the pins will be a little proud after glue up –
In this picture I ’m cutting out the waste between the pins using a fret saw .
Again , at the point of this picture I stop cutting and feed the fret saw down the left side of the waste to finish the cut .
Notice how the pins look in combination with the rabbet initially cut into the rosewood .
This is a key to the maple “ inlaid ” dovetail being visible from the outside of the box sides .
Below is a picture of the finished pins -
The next two pictures show trimming the inside edges of the pins / tails .
Rob Cosman shows this techique in his video series and this helps remove some of the friction when fitting the joinery -
These shavings are then cut off cleanly using the chisel .
On this project I took this idea one step further and did a small amount of filing on the back of the sides of the pins / tails , to further relieve friction when fitting the joinery together .
This photo below is blurry , but I think you can get the idea .
Note that I ’m angling the file to purposefully avoid having the file come in contact with the front side of the rosewood pin .
I also will only do this at the base of the pin…never at the end where it will show once assembled –
The Completed Joint .
If you look closely you can see the pins / tails are slightly proud of the side surfaces –
Even though it ’s really hard to “ destroy ” something I ’ve just finished …here I ’m cutting the box apart right after getting all the initial corners completed and glued .
Notice the remaining maple revealed by the initial rabbet cut into the rosewood –
Below , I ’m re-squaring the rosewood to prepare them for the second set of dovetails –
This picture shows the relationship of the Honduras rosewood , to the Caribbean rosewood –
The amount of maple remaining on the inside face of the rosewood is the same thickness that needs to remain in the walls of the maple dovetail , thus determining the size of the Caribbean rosewood tails .
Here I ’m rechecking this width ( after sanding ) and will transfer that into the marking of the tails –
Unfortunately this turned out blurry , but this is how I transferred this width to mark the tails in the Caribbean rosewood –
In this picture below you can see how the maple and Caribbean rosewood pins will overlay each other , once cutting and assembly is complete :
This series of pictures show the second set of pins being cut :
At last !
The second set of pins / tails are complete !
This picture below shows the groove cut in the sides to accept the base … it also clearly shows my “ screw - up ” in cutting the groove on both upper and lower sides of one of the sides .
My “ cover - up ” was deciding to place a ¼’ strip of hickory inlay around the inside of the top of the box …whooops ! -
This picture shows the hickory base ( and inlay ) being fitted .
The tongue and groove were done on my router table -
Here ’s a partial “ dry - fit ” and I ’m ready for glue up .
I actually did completely dry fit each corner separately once , but did not do this for all four corners simultaneously , fearing I ’d never get them back apart without loosening the joinery fit –
The carcass portion of the box is complete .
Here ’s a picture of the clamping and end result –
And here ’s one after sanding the pins / tails clean … –
I ’m currently just starting to apply the finish to this box .
The top is 6 / 4 stock cebil with a contrasting maple stripe that runs across the top , “ joining ” into the maple in the double dovetail .
I ’ll post this as a project once I get the finish completed .
Thus far I ’ve put on one oil coat , but I ’m torn between a natural wood look and a multilayered poly / oil blend series of top coats that will end up filling in all grain pores .
Any suggestions on the completing finish are welcome .
Even though this blog ended up quite lengthy , I hope you ’ve enjoyed it .

LONDON ( Reuters ) -
Oil gushing from an undersea well in the Gulf of Mexico has damaged BP ’s reputation and share price but accidents involving other companies in less scrutinized parts of the world have avoided the media glare .
Investors have knocked around $ 30 billion off BP ’s value since an explosion at a drilling rig killed 11 people and began an oil spill the London - based major is struggling to plug nearly a month after the accident happened .
The U.S. media and political machine has turned its full force on BP and U.S. President Barack Obama has set up a commission into the leak which is sending an estimated 5,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) into Gulf of Mexico waters .
In contrast , the international media has largely ignored the latest incidents of pipeline damage in Nigeria , where the public can only guess how much oil might have been leaked .
The most recent damage in Nigeria , which has not been attributed to militant attacks that have preyed on Nigerian oil infrastructure for years , forced U.S. operator ExxonMobil to relieve itself of contractual obligations by declaring force majeure on its exports of Nigerian benchmark crude .
The light sweet crude is particularly well - suited for refining into gasoline and is regularly supplied to the United States , the world ’s biggest oil burner .
Exxon declined the opportunity to give details of the damage , clean - up or repair work .
An industry source , who declined to be named , said 100,000 bpd of oil had leaked for a week from a pipeline that has since been mended .
“ If this ( the BP spill ) were in the Niger Delta , no one would be batting an eyelid , ” said Holly Pattenden , African oil analyst at consultants Business Monitor International .
“ They have these kind of oil spills in Nigeria all the time . ”
SHARE PRICE IMPACT
BP ’s share price has fallen around 18 percent since news of the fire at the drilling station on April 20 , while Exxon shares were largely unchanged after the force majeure announcement .
The largest operator in Nigeria , Royal Dutch Shell has clashed with the Nigerian government for decades following numerous spills in Africa ’s largest energy producer .
Shell said in a statement on its website that its Nigerian joint venture cleans up oil spills as quickly as possible , no matter what their cause , but is sometimes delayed by security concerns or because some communities deny access .
The Anglo - Dutch major said the volume of oil spills in Nigeria for its joint venture was almost 14,000 tonnes last year , the equivalent of around 280 bpd , mainly because of militant attacks on facilities .
“ It ( the U.S. ) is without doubt the worse place for BP to lose their political capital , ” said James Marriott , oil and gas analyst at environmental organization Platform .
“ If the U.S. administration gets aggressive against BP , then it ’s a problem for them offshore , onshore in terms of shale gas , for conventional gas , refining , some cross - border projects with Canada and further afield . ”
In the United States , BP ’s massive spill and the risk of an environmental catastrophe could have implications throughout the industry as it has reopened the debate about deepwater drilling .
Analysts say , however , the world is hugely dependent on deepwater drilling to secure oil supplies .
The ExxonMobil force majeure relates to shallow offshore oil , but much of West Africa ’s crude production , like that in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico , is deepwater .
Analysts say it is unrealistic to veto deepwater drilling if the world ’s oil needs are to be met .
“ Perhaps in terms of health and safety regulation ( things will change ) , but not in terms of drilling , ” said Angus McPhail of Wood Mackenzie consultants .
“ It is not really feasible to stop drilling altogether as long as there is good demand for the product ....
It would be total economic madness . ”
University of Sheffield student Jon Leary was required to “ make something useful out of rubbish ” as part of his dissertation .
What he ended up doing was transforming lives .
As part of his studies as a Mechanical Engineering major , Leary spent four months in Guatemala .
There , he introduced the locals to his bicibomba movil , a mobile bicycle - powered water pump .
Now , using cast - off bicycles and discarded pumps , Guatemalan farmers can irrigate their land much more easily and effectively than ever before .
Leary developed the system while still in the UK .
Basically , it consists of an old electrical pump attached to a metal frame , which pivots around the rear axle of a bicycle .
When in transport mode , the frame and pump flip up and rest above the back wheel , so the bicycle can be pedaled .
When it ’s time to pump , the bicycle stops and the frame flips down underneath the back wheel , with the bike ’s tire resting against the armature of the pump .
Much like a stationary resistance trainer , the rider then pedals in place , thus spinning the armature and powering the pump .
On flat ground , it can move water at a rate of 40 liters per minute .
“ The inspiration came from regular pannier racks that are used on touring bikes to carry things over the back wheel of a bike ” Leary told us .
“ I was sketching up a few designs and noticed that the stand for lifting the rear wheel of the bike off the ground that I kept drawing could work just like a pannier rack if flipped upside down . ”
Jon Leary 's mobile bicycle - powered pump in transportation and pumping modes
The bicibomba movil was introduced with the help of Maya Pedal , a local organization that champions pedal - powered technology in the region .
Using unwanted bikes donated from the US and Canada , Maya Pedal was already making bicimáquinas ( bicycle machines ) that included washing machines , electrical generators and corn mills .
They even already had a stationary water pump , for bringing water up out of wells .
The mobile aspect of Leary ’s invention , however , makes it attractive to farmers .
Many of them have land that is on an incline , and the only way of getting water to the top is by lugging it up there .
With the bicibomba , however , they can pump from the bottom up to a midway tank , then ride up to the midway tank and pump from it to the top - or to any number of other midway tanks , riding from each one to the next .
Jon Leary 's mobile bicycle - powered pump in action
Jon ’s device can reportedly be made quite easily , using standard tools along with old bikes , bits of metal , and scrapped electric centrifugal water pumps .
Since he left Guatemala , the locals have made six more .
Students from Strathclyde University are also trying to bring knowledge of the machine to Malawi .
“ I 've produced a construction manual for the machine that is freely available to download on Maya Pedal 's website so that anyone can have a go at making it ” says Leary .
“ If more people have access to the bicycle technology that they produce , then more people will be able to work their way out of poverty . ”
Jon ’s project was funded by the University of Sheffield´s Department of Mechanical Engineering and Engineers Without Borders .
The dilemma of plants fighting infections
Scientists from Tübingen reveal an evolutionary dilemma : plants that are more resistant to disease grow more slowly and are less competitive than susceptible relatives when enemies are rare
Individuals of one and the same plant species often differ greatly in their ability to resist pathogens :
While one rose succumbs to bacterial infection , its neighbour blissfully thrives .
Scientists from the Max Planck Institute of Developmental Biology in Germany have tracked down an explanation for this common phenomenon .
Their conclusion : disease resistance can incur high costs .
Especially resistant plants of mouse ear cress ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) produce fewer and smaller leaves , and have a competitive disadvantage in the absence of enemies .
Whether it is better to invest in disease resistance or biomass is thus very much dependent on the unpredictable circumstances a plant may find itself in .
Therefore both large , but vulnerable plants co-exist in nature with small , but well - protected ones ( Nature , June 3rd 2010 ) .

In the course of evolution , plants have invented many ways to defend themselves against enemies .
Some produce smelly or bad - tasting ingredients , others develop thorns or have a particular effective immune response to viruses and bacteria .
If selection pressure is sufficiently high , one would thus expect only those individuals to survive that are best protected .
Pathogens , in turn , should have a difficult time .
Everybody knows that this is not the case .
Indeed , plants vary tremendously in their ability to defend themselves , and this is true not only for different species , but also for members of the same species .
The group of Detlef Weigel at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology has now tracked down a variant of the ACD6 gene , which functions as a universal weapon in the fight against predators .
With it , the plants both produce much more of a chemical that is directly toxic to microbes and more signalling molecules important in immunity .
These enable mouse ear cress plants to combat a wide range of enemies , from bacteria and fungi to insects such as aphids .
However , not all varieties have this variant .
While it occurs throughout the area where mouse ear cress grows , from North Africa to Scandinavia , and from Central Asia to Western Europe , at any given place it is found in only about 20 percent of individuals .
This already suggests that this variant might also confer some disadvantages .

" We could show that this gene makes plants resistant against pathogens , but at the same time it slows down the production of leaves and limits the size of leaves , so that these plants are always smaller than those that do not have this variant , " said Detlef Weigel .
" But as soon as they are being attacked , the plants with the special ACD6 variant have a leg up compared to plants with the standard version .
On the down side , at places or in years where there are few enemies , they are penalized and lose out compared to the larger fellow plants . "
Smaller size eventually leads to reduced number of seeds and hence to fewer progeny .
The conclusion of Weigel : " Just as in human society , there is no free lunch in nature . "
OTL : Paradise Lost
OUMA , La. --
The greatest tarpon fisherman who ever lived sits in a house on the side of a forgotten bayou , stuck in a blue recliner , watching his world die on live television .
Oil gushes out of the well , every lost barrel another line in his obituary .
Though he 's only 55 , Lance " Coon " Schouest is about to become obsolete .
Everything 's being taken from him , in living color with a network logo and theme music .
His way of life , his job , the marshes he grew up in and possibly even an entire breed of fish that has survived since dinosaurs walked the earth .
The tarpon has taken every disaster man and nature could throw at it .
Watch " Outside the Lines " There are places along the Gulf Coast where the oil coats birds and beaches , and there are places where the marshes remain untouched .
Wright Thompson shares the story of one town in the middle .
Watch this story .
Until now .
The oil pours into the water , and in the next frame , washes up on the shores , over and over , a looped montage of destruction .
Coon just stares .
" Look , y'all , " he says to his family , his voice raw .
" Jesus .
Look at that . "
Above his head hangs a long , silver tarpon , almost 200 pounds and taller than a man , with giant scales .
Every now and then , Schouest turns away from his TV and looks up at the fish , remembering the day he caught it -- Oct. 3 , 1976 -- and wondering if he 'll ever catch one again .
These days , he finds himself , hour after hour , obsessing over the map of oil on his television , a growing , black stain on the waters of his childhood .
That map is his family history and his memory .
He 's full of a lifetime of knowledge that might soon be useless .
He knows the Gulf of Mexico like other people know the streets of their hometown .
He knows where tarpon eat , how they move , when they arrive .
He senses them .
Sometimes , he can close his eyes and see the big school , acres across and sparkling like diamonds , migrating from Veracruz and the Florida Keys toward the mouth of the river .
Tarpon , he 's learned , love water that is 74 degrees .
They chase it , a need hardwired into their prehistoric DNA .
The water off Louisiana is just hitting 74 degrees .
The tarpon are coming , headed for the spreading shroud of oil .
Joe York for ESPN.com Lance " Coon " Schouest waits and watches as oil continues to foul the Gulf .
The man , the myth , the legend
Stand on any marina south of New Orleans and say the name Lance " Coon " Schouest ( pronounced Shwest ) .
Veteran guides will speak of him with reverence .
Other tarpon anglers will admit that their strategy is to follow him out of the marina .
He invented the lure that most everyone who chases the magnificent silver fish uses or copies : the Coon Pop .
That 's how you get to be the best tarpon fisherman in the world .
Joe York for ESPN.com Schouest shows the Coon Pop lure he invented .
" I can't tell you what time it is on this watch , " he says .
" Everything is blurry when I got to read something .
But I promise you , we could be running 30 miles an hour on that boat and a tarpon puts his fin out there , I 'm gonna see that son of a bitch .
Everybody 's got a reason to be on this earth .
I believe God made me a tarpon fisherman . "
Used to be , catching them was a man 's thing , using heavy spoons and tight drags , muscling the fish into the boat .
The weight of the bait gave the tarpon leverage , and they often got away .
As the bait got smaller , it took too long to make it down to the fish .
In the mid-'80s , Coon got to thinking .
He sat down at his kitchen table , and the design evolved : a bait tied to a hook with wire light enough to break when the fish hit .
The Coon Pop solved both problems .
It was heavy enough to get to the fish quickly , but after the strike , the heavy part fell away and left the fish on a Japanese tuna hook with no leverage .
The bait changed tarpon fishing ; for the first time , women and children could catch them .
The bait also changed the Schouest family , brought them even closer .
The lines between work and play blurred and disappeared .
They could all enjoy Coon 's love .
They could fall in love , too .
For decades , he 's taken clients fishing and hammered out Coon Pops on the kitchen table .
His wife , Gloria , long ago stopped complaining about the damage to her furniture .
Coon 's brothers run charter boats .
So do his sons .
When they started chasing tarpon , the state record was 192 pounds .
Coon has caught more than a dozen fish bigger than 200 pounds .
People jockey for space on his boat ; a man mows his yard every week in exchange for a trip .
The biggest weekend of the year is the Grand Isle Tarpon Rodeo -- the oldest fishing tournament in the United States , when 60,000 people bring their credit cards and livers to the tip of Louisiana and leave with both wrecked .
Anglers pay big bucks to hire Coon , because they stand a good chance of winning .
The tarpon rodeo is where his legend really began and where it grows , year after year , his boat pulling up to the Sand Dollar Marina at weigh - in with enormous , silver fish .
In dark Louisiana barrooms where rodeo contestants gather , the talk turns to Coon .
They call him a tarpon whisperer .
Men drink their beers and wonder how a person can know so much about a fish .
Joe York for ESPN.com Schouest 's legend was built on catching the biggest tarpon in the Grand Isle Tarpon Rodeo .
Schouest Family Album , Vol. I
Papa Joe and little Coon ran down the bayou .
They pushed the 19 - foot boat out past Cocodrie , 12 miles to Wine Island Pass , looking for redfish and speckled trout .
That 's what working men caught .
Fish to eat .
Papa
Joe worked on a tugboat , did construction , never stopping -- except to fish .
Coon was almost a teenager , and he'd been working since he was about 6 , sweeping the floor of job sites .
He loved to fish , too .
Loved to watch his daddy , see how he did things and try to do them just as good .
He learned a lot out there on the water .
That day , Coon saw them first , three of 'em , in a big mess of mullet .
A new fish , something he'd never seen before , a mirror flash in the Louisiana sun .
They rolled , then rolled again , shiny and beautiful amid the brown of the bayou .
The scales looked like sand dollars and the eyes like softballs .
" What 's that ? "
Coon asked .
" Oh , " Papa Joe said , " that 's them tarpon . "
They pulled up anchor and left Wine Island Pass , but Coon could n't shake image of the silver fish rolling .
He thought to himself , right there in that 19 - foot Seabreeze , the wind hitting his face : " That 's the fish I want to catch . "
A life built on tarpon
Joe York for ESPN.com
The plan has always been for Schouest to pass along his love for tarpon fishing to his children and grandchildren , including Kimberly .
Coon never lost his obsession .
He and his dad caught their first ones together in 1973 .
By the time Coon had kids of his own , he 'd invented the Coon Pop .
The first person ever to throw one was Lance Jr. He was 7 years old then , nearly three decades ago .
The bait hit the water , and bam , a tarpon took it .
Lance Jr. reeled the fish into the boat .
The Coon Pop not only made him well - known , it allowed Coon to share his love with the people he loved most .
All the Schouests went tarpon fishing .
When people saw Coon 's boat doing random circles in the ocean , they knew one of the grandkids was driving .
His family 's world revolved around the fish .
They always seemed to provide , like the universe had put them there just for Coon .
The family drew strength and faith from the tarpon .
When his son Lee got married , Coon promised to pay for the wedding .
Lee and Crystal did n't have much money , and her family did n't , either .
She 'd had a rough childhood , and Coon wanted them to have the best Cajun wedding money could buy .
With summer descending on south Louisiana , he tried to rent a recreation center for the October wedding .
But Coon did n't have much money , either .
The recreation center folks wanted deposits and all that .
He needed about $ 6,000 , and he did n't know where he'd get it .
Still short , the Schouests entered a tarpon tournament .
The water was rough .
They saw fish everywhere , but the fish would n't bite .
Not for them , anyway .
Coon tried to ease up on a big school .
He killed the engine and let the current take him close .
The tarpon went low , and he did n't see them anymore , so he started to crank up the engine and turn .
" Mr. Lance , " Crystal said , " look at 'em . "
A metallic tide of tarpon swam right for the boat .
Lee wound up and threw .
A big fish swallowed the hook , and Lee fought him into the boat .
They won the tournament and paid for the wedding with a few hundred bucks to spare .
The two boys and their sister started families of their own , and Coon took the grandkids out to fish , just as he'd taken their parents .
For Coon , tarpon marked the passage of time , a ring in the family tree .
Schouest Family Album , Vol. II
The cancer caught Papa Joe a year ago .
They found it on his kidney .
The doctors wanted to cut him open .
He did n't know what they 'd find in there , did n't know if he'd walk in that hospital and never walk out again , so he asked two of his sons , Coon and Crawdad , to take him out to catch one more tarpon .
The boys loaded the boat and made the run out of Grand Isle , eight or nine miles , toward the West Delta , maybe saying goodbye to their daddy .
A friend went with them , and he hooked the first fish .
He tried to hand the rod off .
" Here ya go , Papa Joe , " he said .
" You hooked him , you fight him , " Papa Joe said .
" No , no .
We came out here for you to catch a tarpon . "
The boys wanted him to take the fish , too .
They wondered if this would be his last one .
Papa
Joe stepped up and , just as he started to fight , his own line went off a few feet away , rod bent , reel screaming .
Papa Joe 's eyes got big .
He handed the first rod back , went down and fought his fish .
A big one , 170 pounds or more .
The boys watched their old man , 82 years old and ate up with cancer , fight for 20 minutes , no chair , no harness , just his hands and that jumping fish , sunlight reflecting off the silver scales .
He pulled the fish up to the boat , then let it go .
Papa
Joe would n't kill a tarpon today .
A life undone
Coon 's life obeyed a rhythm , much like the fish he'd based that life on .
He chased trout in May and June , then turned to tarpon the first week of July .
He took charters out into the Gulf .
His brothers went with him on days off .
His dad went with him , too ; Papa
Joe survived the cancer scare , and when he got released , he asked to go get another tarpon .
Then the oil well exploded .

Two weeks into the leak , Coon was n't that worried yet .
They 'd cap it , he figured , and he'd fish all summer .
The charter booking were as full as they 'd been since Katrina .
One day , he was on the phone with a longtime customer , a wealthy oilman named Sonny , when conversation turned to the first effort to stop the flow .
Coon poured a cup of coffee .
" What you think ? " Coon asked .
" It ai n't gonna work .
Too deep .
Too much pressure .
I do n't think they 're gonna be able to stop it . "
Coon took a gulp of his coffee .
He 'd remember this moment as long as he lived .
" We may never see Louisiana again , " Sonny said .
Coon panicked .
He might not have a fat savings account or health insurance , but he 's better at one thing than anyone else in the world .
What if he 's just another guy on the bayou with a stack of bills he can't pay and a story about who he used to be ?
" It gives me goosebumps right now thinking about it , " he says .
" It scares me .
It really does .
It 's a way of life for our family . "
For weeks on end , he sat at home , staring at the television , seeing live reports from Grand Isle that had nothing to do with the tarpon rodeo -- the little village he 's known his entire life was where the oil hit first and hardest .
The timing could n't have been worse .
Summer is when fishing guides make enough to live the rest of the year , and even during good years , Coon did construction in the winter to make the numbers add up .
Longtime clients sadly canceled their charters .
He 's known these people for decades , seen their boys grow up into men .
They send him coolers of steaks for Christmas , check on him after hurricanes .
One called and , instead of asking for the $ 1,000 deposit back , asked if Coon needed to be paid for the other days of fishing they 'd never do .
Coon went stir - crazy in his blue chair , watching oil pour out of the well .
Nothing keeps Coon away from work .
He nearly lost his leg to a staph infection last year and was back on the water four days after leaving the hospital .
He and his son actually had the conversation :
What if we have to move ?
Finally , he got a little work , two days every eight , running Coast Guard crews .
At least he would n't lose his house or his truck .
He settled the first time he pulled the boat out of the marina , feeling the wind on his face like when he was a boy .
He was calm .
The engines ran , and he picked up speed , a cool breeze running through his crew cut , white on the sides now .
He saw the green marsh and brown water , a beautiful sight .
He pointed the boat south , toward Grand Isle , looking into the distance , wondering :
What 's out there ?
The oil is a big black monster , he decided , coming to swallow them all .
AP Photo / Gerald Herbert The Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded April 20 , 2010 , killing 11 workers and creating an underwater oil gusher that has sent millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico .
This photo , taken in May , shows oil washing up along the coast of Louisiana between Cocodrie and Grand Isle .
A window into the future
So what is really out there ?
The answer waits at the Sand Dollar Marina in Grand Isle .
Instead of anglers unloading fish , there 's a man standing on the dock who knows for sure all the things Coon just fears .
His name is Steve Mars , and he's with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service .
His crews are out with local captains , picking up oil - slicked birds and bringing them in to be cleaned in the gray trailer behind the boat launch .
Even though it 's 90 degrees , the birds , with oil matting their downy feathers , are in danger of freezing to death .
" We have terns , " Mars says .
" We have egrets .
We have pelicans .
We have juvenile chicks running around .
They 've got oil on them .
It 's the worst of the worst .
This oil is killing the whole food chain .
We 're losing plankton .
There 's dead dolphins on the beach .
I saw a dead dolphin yesterday . "
Joe York for ESPN.com Marina owner Butch Gaspard faces the possible loss of his business because of the spill .
Marina owner Butch Gaspard sits by his cash register .
He looks at an old photo of the marina in good times , the slips full of boats , customers lining up at sunrise for gas , bait and sausage on flaky biscuits topped with a fried egg .
Then he looks out the window and sees an empty dock .
The only boats running are those chartered by the government and BP .
BP has his motel rented , but when BP leaves , he 'll have to shut it down .
He 's down from 25 to 15 employees .
In a few days , he 'll have to cut five more .
The store is full of supplies he bought two weeks before the well ruptured .
That 's how they do it down here : empty the checking account to get ready for the onslaught .
Butch has big loans at the bank .
After Katrina , he borrowed more than $ 1 million to get the marina and motel open .
His note 's due in five days .
Yesterday at his little pier - side bar , the woman from the bank said they 'd work with him .
" Let 's say it does n't come back , " he says .
" How long are they gonna work with us ?
We work hard for what we have .
We 'd like to keep it .
Right now , we 're robbing from Peter to pay Paul , but finally , Peter is gonna want his money . "
All Butch can do is stare out at the water .
It 's not a pretty sight .
In one direction , Queen Bess Island is covered in pelicans that are covered in oil .
One stands next to a red plastic gas can that drifted ashore .
The thick crude is killing them , and it 's killing the grass and oyster beds that keep the island together .
" The first storm we get , that island disappears , " Mars says .
" Instead of having a productive little island , with little fishes and oysters and crabs and baby tarpon , it 's gone .
It 's open water . "
In the other direction , toward the West Delta and the tarpon - fishing grounds , shiny red patches float on the water .
Oil , thick enough to give you a headache .
This is where Coon caught the rodeo - winning fish a year ago , and it 's ruined .
Out into the swells , Grand Isle getting small in the distance , coated brown pelicans fly overhead .
They struggle toward an oil rig , looking for a place to land , dozens of them , black like crows .

Praying for the fish
Coon 's brought home two 35 - pound bags of spillway crawfish for the family , and they 're gonna boil 'em with sausage , potatoes and corn .
It 's a celebration .
More than a month after the spill began , he 's got a full - time job , running crews for BP .
The family will survive , at least for now .
He feels a thousand pounds lighter , the tightness in his chest and aching in his head gone .
As he cuts up potatoes on the stainless T dividing the two halves of the sink , he can even joke about how close he came to putting his Drew Brees autographed football on eBay .
Joe York for ESPN.com
Their livelihood has been affected -- and residents along the coast say the whole food chain has been , too .
There 's always a cloud , though .
A few days earlier , he got the news : The Grand Isle Tarpon Rodeo was canceled .
He keeps losing things , pieces of who he used to be .
It makes him cling tighter to those he 's got left , like a family meal together .
They 've cooked crawfish a thousand times , but under the threat of extinction , small , everyday acts seem to mean more .
His son - in - law , Clint Buquet , turns on the burner in the garage and gets the water going , pouring in tons of crab boil , the spice burning every nostril in the house .
The men talk about the migrating tarpon .
Even if they survive the oil , they might starve to death .
They come to Louisiana to eat , and all the things they eat are covered in oil , too .
This is the time of year when life begins anew in the marsh .
Trout are laying eggs .
So are white and Brazil shrimp .
Crabs are hatching .
If the oil finds them , or the dispersant used to break up the oil does , it 's over .
" They 're gonna die , " Buquet says .
" Nothing 's gonna live . "
The crawfish turn bright red in the pot .
Coon and Clint dump the water by the side of the house .
They bring the silver pot inside and set it by the blue recliner .
The television stays on in the background , the same video montage of oil pouring into the ocean , then oil rushing onto the shore .
They can't escape it .
They can't stop thinking about those tarpon swimming to their death .
" When you say , ' When dinosaurs walked the earth , ' that 's a long time before me and you got here , " Coon says .
" And something like this to come kill them ?
What killed the dinosaurs ?
Is dispersant gonna kill the tarpon ?
That 's the question .
We were n't here when the dinosaurs left , but will we be here when all the fish in the Gulf are gone ? "
For a while , a small hope kept them going .
Maybe the tarpon would somehow sense the danger .
They 've survived for millions of years .
Maybe they 'd turn .
That hope died the other day when Lee Schouest was running a crew looking for oil .
They found it , in fingers miles long , with patches of clean water in between .
He saw a school of porpoises surface , five of them , right in the middle of the oil .
Six more joined them , 11 in all , sucking in the thick black tar , their blowholes making the sickest , saddest noise he ever heard .
He watched them struggle to breathe .
Joe York for ESPN.com
A sign poses one resident 's ultimate question .
Schouest Family Album , Vol. III
Coon 's granddaughter Kimberly runs into his living room .
He 's sitting in the blue recliner and she is grinning , laughing , talking a mile a minute .
She 's 3 ½ .
He knows what tomorrow will bring .
She does not .
" You went swimming today ? " he asks .
" It was too cold , " she says .
" Maybe another day . "
" The sun is gonna come out one of these days , " he says .
The End
So these are the final days of a way of life .
Recently , the Schouests gathered at the small house on the bayou , under the giant tarpon .
The grandchildren scooped out trays full of crawdads , the metal bowl clinking on the hard shells .
" I'ma peel a few for the kids , " Coon said .
Watch Wright Thompson 's story on the Gulf oil crisis and fishing on " Outside the Lines . "
" Claws ! " 5 - year - old Hunter called .
" I want claws ! "
The adults laughed , digging into the mudbugs , bending the tail at the second joint and pulling out the little nugget of meat .
Coon sucked the heads for the spicy juice .
They tossed the claws to Hunter , who , the sign in the front yard says , was the student of the month in March at Bourg Elementary .
" Uh , " he said , " why are n't they peeled ? "
" Ask Clint Jr. to peel them , " Coon said .
" He 's a claw professional . "
When he'd had his fill , Hunter stood up and theatrically fell to the floor .
Coon dies a little inside when he looks at Hunter .
Since the little boy was born , Coon has wondered when he'd fall in love , too .
Schouests do n't enter the world knowing how to catch tarpon .
They learn it , as children , watching the grown - ups .
It 's a treasure , handed down .
Coon saw it playing out with Hunter as it did with his own boys , Lee at 4 , Lance at 5 , little kids in shorts and no shirt , putting down their Coca - Colas and finally reeling in a big fish .
That might be the thing about the oil that hurts him the most .
This season was going to be Hunter 's time .
Is this where the tradition ends ?
" My 5 - year - old grandson , " he says , " we said this year he was gonna catch his first tarpon . "
Coon has n't yet told the boy that he can't go .
He holds onto hope .
Maybe the tarpon will turn , or survive , maybe the oil will go south and leave their marshes alone .
Maybe everything will be OK .
He 'll take Hunter out to clear , clean water , and they 'll see the sun shine off a silver fin , the big school sparkling like diamonds at the mouth of the river .

Join the conversation about " Paradise Lost . "
It has been condemned as sinister , frightening , misogynistic and oppressive .
Indeed , nothing seems to provoke more suspicion of Europe 's 15 million Muslims than the face veil worn by a tiny minority of women .
Even many followers of Islam are keen to disown and denounce it .
In heated discussions with my own father over the past few weeks , I discovered that he is one of those who take a sterner line , describing the face veil as " un-Islamic and unnecessary " .
“ If not for anything else , " he told me , " it should be banned for security reasons . "
I am no fan of the face veil , but I disagree with Dad .
Moves to ban it will surely backfire .
In recent months , several European governments have begun to legislate restrictions on both the niqab , a face veil that leaves the area around the eyes clear and is usually combined with a full body covering , and the burqa , which covers the entire face and body , leaving just a mesh screen to see through .
On 29 April , Belgium became the first European country to impose a nationwide ban on wearing a full face veil in public .
Just three days earlier , the five - month - old government of the Belgian prime minister Yves Leterme had collapsed amid bitter feuding between the political parties , but legislators in the House of Representatives found time to push through the bill with almost unanimous support .
Hostility towards the veil has united a divided nation .
Anyone found flouting the new law , which will come into force after Belgium 's general election on 13 June , will face a fine of up to € 25 ( £ 21 ) and possibly seven days in jail .
For Fouad Lahssaini , a Green MP in Belgium who emigrated there from Morocco as a youth , passing a ban on the face veil is like " taking out a bazooka to kill a fly " .
About 215 women " at most " in Belgium wear the veil , according to Edouard Delruelle , co-director of the Belgian Institute for Equal Opportunities .
Others put the number as low as 30 , out of an estimated Muslim population of just over 600,000 and a total Belgian population of 10.8 million .
Most Belgians will never meet a niqab - clad woman .
It 's a similar story in other European countries , but the anti-burqa cause is spreading .
France , Italy and the Netherlands are also considering nationwide bans .
The French security services estimate that 2,000 of the roughly two million adult Muslim women in France - 0.1 per cent - wear the full face veil , and a third of them are thought to be converts to Islam .
Yet the French are planning " emergency legislation " to ban the burqa and niqab before the country 's legislators go on their summer holiday in August .
The National Assembly has passed a non-binding resolution condemning the face veil as " an affront to the nation 's values of dignity and equality " , and the French cabinet has approved a bill making it illegal to wear clothing designed to cover the face in public .
The penalties in France will be much higher than in Belgium .
The fine for a first offence will be € 150 ( £ 130 ) .
And a man who is found to have forced a woman to wear a full - length veil by " violence or threats " will be punished with a fine of € 15,000 and face imprisonment .
The crackdown on the veil has come from the very top of the political establishment , with President Nicolas Sarkozy declaring that the burqa is " not welcome " in France and denouncing it as a symbol of female " subservience and debasement " .
Such has been the hysteria that French politicians and pundits have whipped up over the veil that the country has been hit by " burqa rage " .
On 15 May , a Muslim woman leaving a shoe shop in Trignac , near Saint - Nazaire on the west coast of France , is said to have overheard a 60 - year - old woman lawyer making " snide remarks about her black burqa " .
The 26 - year - old Muslim convert later described to reporters how " things got nasty .
The older woman grabbed my veil to the point of ripping it off . "
The two women allegedly traded blows before being separated by shop assistants and were then arrested by the police .
An officer close to the case said : " The lawyer said she was not happy seeing a fellow shopper wearing a veil and wanted the ban introduced as soon as possible . "
She is also said to have likened the Muslim woman to Belphegor , a mythical demon who frequently covers up his hideous features using a mask .
So much for a secular state protecting religious freedom .
Yet the proposed ban may , in fact , be unconstitutional .
The Council of State , France 's highest legal and administrative authority , warned in March that " a general and absolute ban on the full veil as such can have no incontestable judicial basis " , and that it could be rejected by the courts for violating both national law and the European Convention on Human Rights .
As the Moroccan - American academic Laila Lalami , who has written extensively on the politics of the veil , pointed out to me : " The societies that already have coercive laws - Iran and Saudi Arabia , for example , which force women to wear headscarves , Turkey and Tunisia , which forbid women to wear face veils - are not known for their respect of human rights . "
So , why pursue it ?
Polls suggest that a ban is popular , and Sarkozy 's personal poll rating is at an all - time low .
For François Hollande , the former head of the French Socialist Party , " the tactic is clear .
It 's about getting back a hold of a part of the electorate which has in part retreated into abstention or voting for the far right . "
Yet support for a ban cuts across the left - right divide .
In Belgium , the idea was first proposed by the Flemish far right ; in France , it was pushed by a communist mayor .
On the right , the veil is seen as a threat to European and in particular Christian culture ; a symbol of a foreign , belligerent faith community , the " other " - even though few Muslim women wear it .
On the left , it is seen as a repressive garment that subjugates women and violates their rights .
Yet not every Muslim woman is forced , under threat of violence , to wear the veil by a husband , father or brother ; some wear the niqab or burqa as a matter of choice .
Despite the ban being sold by both left and right as a measure to liberate oppressed Muslim women , it is opposed by leading human rights groups .
" At a time when Muslims in Europe feel more vulnerable than ever , the last thing needed is a ban like this , " said Judith Sunderland of Human Rights Watch on 21 April .
" Treating pious Muslim women like criminals wo n't help integrate them . "
The irony of using the threat of prison to freewomen from the so - called prison of the burqa is not lost on Muslim commentators , either .
" The Belgians have a funny idea of liberation , " says the British Muslim writer and activist Myriam François - Cerrah : " criminalising women in order to free them . "
Amnesty International has condemned the Belgian move as " an attack on religious freedom " , and Sunderland has said that " restrictions on women wearing the veil in public life are as much a violation of the rights of women as is forcing them to wear a veil " .
The award - winning Iranian graphic novelist Marjane Satrapi , an outspoken critic of the veil , agrees .
" It is surely a basic human right that someone can choose what she wears without interference from the state , " she wrote in 2003 .
But what else do we expect from the likes of Sarkozy in France or Silvio Berlusconi in Italy ?
Their co-opting of feminist rhetoric and the language of human rights cannot hide their abysmal form on gender issues - from Sar­kozy 's ex-wife Cécilia branding him a " stingy philanderer " to Berlusconi 's string of alleged affairs with very young women .
In the UK , Nick Griffin and Malcolm Pearson , leaders of the BNP and Ukip respectively - the only
political parties advocating an outright ban on the veil in this country - have similarly questionable attitudes to the advancement of women 's rights .
Western male politicians have a long history of hypocrisy in this area .
In her iconoclastic book Women and Gender in Islam , the Egyptian American feminist Leila Ahmed reminds readers of Evelyn Baring , the Earl of Cromer , who served as Britain 's first consul general of Egypt between 1883 and 1907 .
Cromer believed Islam degraded women and that it was essential that Egyptians " be persuaded or forced " into abandoning the veil , which he described as a " fatal obstacle " to the Egyptians ' " mental and moral development " .
Back in Britain , Ahmed notes , " this champion of the unveiling of Egyptian women " was the " founding member and some - time president of the Men 's League for Opposing Woman Suffrage " .
She concludes : " Feminism on the home front and feminism directed against white men was to be resisted and suppressed ; but taken abroad and directed against the cultures of colonised peoples , it could be promoted in ways that admirably served and furthered the project of the dominance of the white man . "
I am not defending the face veil .
I agree with the 100 or so imams and Muslim religious advisers from 40 different countries at a recent conference in Vienna organised by the Islamic Religious Authority in Austria , who concluded that Islam does not make it a requirement for women to wear face veils .
After all , the face veil is mentioned nowhere in the Quran , nor is there a Quranic injunction to cover the face .
Even in the traditions , or hadith , of the Prophet Muhammad , there is no explicit command for Muslim women to cover their faces - only their hair .
In fact , Muslim women are forbidden from offering the five daily prayers and from going on the Hajj - the religious pilgrimage to Mecca - if their faces are covered .
Mohammad Marmaduke Pickthall , the renowned English convert to Islam and translater of the Quran , observed in his 1925 lecture " The Relation of the Sexes " that the veiling of the face by women was " not originally an Islamic custom .
It was prevalent in many cities of the East before the coming of Islam , but not in the cities of Arabia . "
Muslim leaders adopted the face veil for their women , he said , " when they entered the cities of Syria , Mesopotamia , Persia and Egypt .
It was once a concession to the prevailing custom and was a protection to their women from misunderstanding by peoples accustomed to associate unveiled faces with loose character . . .
It has nothing to do with the religion of Islam , and , for practical reasons , it has never been adopted by the great majority of Muslim women . "
My own Muslim wife , of Indian origin but born and brought up in the United States , wears a headscarf ( but not a face veil ) .
She made the decision to wear the hijab at the age of 25 , and it was a spiritual , not a political or cultural choice .
I accept that , for many Muslim women , covering their face is not a choice , but is a ban the best response ?
There are many reasons to believe it is self - defeating .
For a start , state - imposed bans will poison relations between Muslims and non-Muslims even further .
Bans often encourage defiance .
In the words of the atheist writer Shikha Dalmia , of the Los Angeles - based Reason Foundation , " this law can't help but inflame French Muslims , not encourage them to assimilate .
Besieged minorities after all tighten - not loosen - their grip on their ways . "
During Britain's own row over the veil in 2006 , which was prompted by the then cabinet minister Jack Straw 's revelation that he had insisted Muslim women remove their face veils at his constituency surgeries in Blackburn , Islamic clothing stores across the north - west of England reported a rise in sales of niqabs , burqas and other veils .
One Muslim teenager I later met told me it had been Straw 's remarks that prompted her to switch from wearing the hijab to the niqab .
Then there is the matter of enforcement .
How will a ban work in practice ?
Will wealthy tourists from Gulf states also be prevented from wearing the niqab or the burqa as they shop along the Champs - Élysées ?
Or should the ban be limited to public buildings ?
If so , why the need for new legislation when a law already exists banning conspicuous religious symbols from public places such as hospitals and schools ?
Even Jean - Marie Le Pen 's Islamophobic National Front has questioned the need for new legislation , saying " it should simply be a police regulation " .
Most damningly , there is early evidence that a ban on the face veil could serve further to isolate and seclude the marginalised Muslim women whom it is supposed to help liberate .
In Italy , at the end of April , Tunisian - born Amel Marmouri became the first woman to be fined for wearing a face veil when she was stopped outside a post office in the city of Novara .
Marmouri was fined € 500 - and her husband has said he will now ensure she stays at home so that she never again has to venture out without her veil .
Is support for a ban among Europe 's political leaders , and the alarmist and vitriolic rhetoric that so often goes with it , really an expression of concern for Muslim women ?
And why , when confronted with a multitude of social and economic problems , including a debt crisis that could destroy its common currency , are they so obsessed with a small piece of cloth that so few women wear over their face ?
It is difficult to understand why so much political capital across the continent is being spent passing legislation to ban it , despite its minuscule impact on European societies .
In truth , the moves towards a ban seem primarily driven by a fear of Islam , the fastest - growing faith on the continent , and an inability on the part of Muslims and non-Muslims alike to discuss the future of Islam in Europe calmly .
As the hijab - wearing British Muslim writer Fareena Alam pointed out in 2006 , the controversy over the veil " has more to do with Europe 's own identity crisis than with the presence of some ' dangerous other ' .
At a time when post - communist , secular , democratic Europe was supposed to have been ascendant , playing its decisive role at the end of history , Islam came and spoiled the party . "
Or , as Isabel Soumaya , a convert to Islam and vice - president of the Association of Belgian Muslims , put it in an interview with the Washington Post on 15 May , Europe 's politicians are " preying on voters ' fears " .
The veil ban , she said , " is racism and a form of Islamophobia " .

Comic Strips
The Dick Tracy story " The Man of a Million Faces " features a string of bank robberies committed by celebrity lookalikes — or is it a single master of disguise ?
The story makes a big deal of using known heights of objects to measure ( they mean " calculate " ) the perpetrator 's height , which turns out to be a consistent 5 ' 11 " .
Yet a previous diagram shows a line labeled 69.9 " going over his head with room to spare .
Presumably the writer forgot that there were 12 inches to a foot , not 10 .
Another Dick Tracy story involves thieves stealing small - valued coins from parking meters .

The song / story " A Billion Baseballs " by the Green Chili Jam Band does multiple calculations related to these baseballs and gets almost all of them wrong .
For example , it says that this many baseballs placed on the ground would take up a giant square " eighty miles around . "
Since baseballs are three - inch diameter objects , a square of 31,623 by 31,623 baseballs would have a perimeter of under six miles .

Mythology and Religion
The people of the northern Kingdom of Israel , who were scattered by the Assyrians and disappear from the historical record after that , are popularly known as the " Ten Lost Tribes . "
The only problem is that the Northern Kingdom consisted of only nine tribes — Reuben , Issachar , Zebulun , Dan , Naphtali , Gad , Asher , Ephraim , and Manasseh .
The most likely explanation is that somebody subtracted the two tribes of the Southern Kingdom , Judah , and Benjamin , from the traditional twelve without realizing that the tribe of Simeon had disappeared from the census at this point ; and the priestly tribe of Levi ( which by law had no land holdings ) was spread out through both kingdoms .
The math was always a bit fuzzy anyway since Ephraim and Manasseh were actually half - tribes ( being descended from Joseph 's two sons ) and the other tribes would sometimes kick Dan off the list for its wickedness ( having slaughtered and resettled in a defenseless town in the book of Judges ) .
In the Christian Bible , a temple includes a sea ( large bowl ) of " cast metal , circular in shape , measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high .
It took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it , " implying that pi is equal to 3 and not 3.14159 .
However , the sea is also mentioned as being a " handbreadth " thick .
Taking the thickness of the sea into account , the numbers match quite accurately .

Scott Steiner 's infamous promo for a match against Samoa Joe and Kurt Angle in TNA : " You know they say all men are created equal , but you look at me and you look at Samoa Joe and you can see that statement is NOT TRUE !
See , normally if you go one - on - one with another wrestler you got a fifty / fifty chance of winning .
But I 'm a genetic freak , and I 'm not normal !
So you got a 25 percent at best at beating me !
And then you add Kurt Angle to the mix ?
You - the chances of winning drastically go down .
See , the 3 - Way at Sacrifice , you got a 33 and a third chance of winning .
But I !
I got a 66 and two - thirds chance of winning , cuz Kurt Angle KNOOOWS he can't beat me , and he 's not even gonna try .
So , Samoa Joe , you take your thirty - three and a third chance minus my twenty - five percent chance ( if we was to go one on one ) and you got an eight and a third chance of winning at Sacrifice .
But then you take my 75 perchance - chance of winnin ' ( if we was to go one on one ) , and then add 66 and two thirds percents , I got a 141 2/3 chance of winning at Sacrifice !
Señor Joe ?
The numbers do n't lie , and they spell disaster for you at Sacrifice ! "
Astonishingly , perhaps , arithmetically Steiner 's numbers actually all add up .
It 's just that chance does n't work like that .

BIONICLE has this across its multiple forms of media .
The size of the Great Spirit Robot was increased from its originally intended height ( about a small - to - middle sized continent ) to roughly the diameter of Earth without other measurements being changed accordingly .
This means the Denmark - sized island that was supposed to be covering the fallen robot's head would n't have fit .
Practically all forms of media disregard any given measurements about the sizes and population numbers of cities or villages .
In early media , the giant island Mata Nui had less than a hundred denizens living in tiny villages .
When the series was adapted into movies , the number was boosted to several hundred for dramatic purposes with no in -universe justification .
The second film , a prequel , not only showed but clearly stated that the true number was several thousand , yet offered no explanation for why thousands later became hundreds .
The writers were actually aware of these discrepancies , but their retroactive solution was to cap off the population number at one thousand , plus a small group of leaders and protectors .
This was arguably the worst solution , as it contradicted every single piece of prior media , along with common sense .
Early media explicitly said many islanders have died over the ages , which could have given some excuse for the inconsistent numbers , but this plot point was retconned , effectively meaning that the writers deliberately made their math even worse .
Related to the population number madness , it was also stated that there were 5000 Vahki police robots watching over the people , effectively meaning that there were five large , highly efficient enforcer units for every single meager worker , which in no way adds up .
Takua was even considered a weirdo for being so reckless and lazy that he had an entire Vahki squad assigned to watch him , but with a ratio of 5 Vahki for every person , his predicament does n't sound too strange at all .
Water began pouring into the massive cavern Karda Nui through an island - sized hole , which under a thousand years only managed to flood its bottom .
While Karda Nui is a gigantic place and its sizes can only be guessed at by comparing different pieces of concept art , fans have calculated that even under the most lenient of circumstances , the place would have been filled with water in a matter of weeks .
The franchise had issues with time scaling too .
Sometimes creatures or characters who were a couple thousand years old were considered ancient and among the oldest ever .
Yet in other parts of the story , hundred thousand year olds were said to be " young " and inexperienced .
At one point , The Shadowed One rapid - ages 3000 years and becomes frail and decrepit .
Later on he and practically everyone else is revealed to be 100,000 years old , so an added couple thousand should really be nothing .
Characters routinely talk of thousand year old objects or events as belonging to ancient , forgotten times that are only recorded in legend , though realistically they should all clearly remember them as they were alive at the time .
Visual Novels
Narcissu and its sequel , Narcissu ~ Side 2nd , have trouble keeping Setsumi's age straight .
In Side 2nd ( which takes place during the summer of 1999 ) , Setsumi is referred to as being an Aquarius ( thus born in late January or February ) , and it is alternatively claimed that she is fifteen years old , or that it is her fifteenth summer ( which would make her fourteen ) .
The original game ( taking place in late January and early February of 2005 ) claims that she is 22 , but adding the years up from her claimed age in Side 2nd indicate that she should be within a month of either her 20th or 21st birthday , depending on whether one uses the " 15th Summer " claim or the " 15 years old " claim .
Also , in the prologue of Side 2nd ( which takes place between the two stories ) , Setsumi makes a remark about how she 's been hospitalized on and off for a decade .
The main story indicates that she was first hospitalized sometime in April 1997 , thus making it impossible for the claim of a decade to be correct .
In Higurashi : When They Cry , Hinamizawa has a population of roughly 2000 , yet there are only 20 pupils in the village 's only school .
Realistically , around one tenth of a population would be of school age .

Early into Super Danganronpa 2 , Monokuma reveals that the students lost two years of their memories .
If one , however , factors in all the cumulative time periods , it actually more than likely twice that number .
To elaborate , they were a year ahead of the students from the first games , which lost two years of memories - one year at Hope 's Peak Academy and one year sheltering within the school .
Since one extra year of memories was erased , as was the time between the first game and the second , that works out to three or four years .

Zero Escape trilogy deals with a lot of science and math , both basic and advanced ( mostly done by Akane ) , and most of the time it gets it right , but few mistakes managed to slip in :
At one point in Nine Hours , Nine Persons , Nine Doors Seven pulls up a theory that the ship they 're on is RMS Gigantic ( a real - life ship that was later renamed to HMHS Britannic ) , to which Santa reacts with " There is no way we 're on a boat that 's almost 100 years old " .
Gigantic was finished in 1914 and game takes place in 2027 , so if Gigantic still existed it would be over 100 years old .
Zero Time Dilemma :
If you fail to get the correct code in the pantry , Carlos will say that a 4 digit - code has " hundreds of thousands of possible combinations " .
No , it does n't : it has exactly 10,000 combinations .
Akane makes a similar mistake in the infirmary when she claims there is over a thousand possible combinations for a 3 - digit code when it 's exactly one thousand combinations .
At one point , Akane says that the probability of getting 3 ones by throwing three dice at once is 1/216 ( which is correct ) but attempting it three times would give 1/72 chance , which is close but not entirely correct .
The probability of getting at least one success with three attempts is 1 minus the probability of failing three times in a row .
In this case , it 's 1-( 215/216 ) ^3 , or more precisely 139,321/10,077,696 , which is slightly lower than 1/72 .

It gives you plenty of time to try to figure out exactly what you are going to say when he finally reaches you .
It was simple : “ wanna cigarette ? ”
And then you realize you are probably lucky you did n’t need to head out to the lady ’s hall and try to wrestle a wet , naked , wirey Korean into a pair of pants and a set of steel - toes Doc Martins .
I have always described my practice as “ compassion tempered by wisdom ” where our innate ability to love and care is balanced by the learned ability to reason and apply experiential knowledge .
If you lean too much to the side of compassion you become a fool , blindly trying to aid with little or no foundational base of understanding .
Lean too much to the side of wisdom and you become detached and aloof ; always rethinking or analyzing without following intuition .
For me , Buddhist compassion needs to be defined by both these aspects , balanced throughout our lives by our own experience .
Keeping this balance is no simple thing – it is n’t easy .
It is n’t centered on simply believing or understanding the Dharma ( or any religious teaching ) .
The compassionate path transcends definition and requires fortitude , patience , flexibility and wisdom .
In essence , compassion is the culmination ( or at least the expression ) of our practice .
My experience with James did n’t apply any of these attributes .
My practice was poor .
For some reason , lost to me now but assuredly important at the time , I turned my back on him in a time of need .
For the life of me , I ca n’t recall the reason , but I do remember deciding that “ tough - love ” was the wisest course of action .
Then during that Summer break , sitting on my parents ’ front porch , smoking a cigarette , I received the call that James fell to his death on campus .
Drunk and / or stoned he fell from a roof .
Barely alive , his friends abandoned him there to die , drove home and from the security of their apartment , called 911 .
Too late for James .
He died on the asphalt , abandoned by friends both near and far .
People snorted coke at his funeral .
I snorted my own self - worth .
I am not so arrogant to consider my actions to be so karmic as to have been the sole cause of this event .
Nor am I so foolish to believe that any other action would have deferred Jame ’s fate , but in the process of cause and effect both desirable and undesirable acts produce results in an sequence that effects not only yourself but those around you .
We are born of a state that is being constantly created and destroyed by our actions .
At the same time our actions can either nurture or destroy karmic seeds in others .
Those seeds lead to either desirable and undesirable results .
Part of compassion is understanding whether our actions nurture or destroy .
I ’ve sat with this koan for quite sometime now and it far outweighs anything produced in a Zen Center .
I ’ve sat with it since that funeral .
“ Do my actions benefit ? ”
It ’s a simple question , with an impossible answer .
Christian priests could n’t answer it , although they tried their damnedest to convince me that all will be fine if I accept Jesus .
Jesus does n’t answer koans .
Neither does Buddha .
We do .
File this under “ Things that are the impetus to my practice . ”
Cheers ,

A buyer found 2000 child sex abuse images on the hard drive of the computer he bought on TradeMe , a court was told today .
In Christchurch District Court today , the seller , Philip Raymond Broadfoot , a 39 - year - old computer technician , was jailed for 18 months after admitting 12 representative charges of possessing objectionable images .
The court was told that Broadfoot , a committed churchgoer , co-operated with the police and showed them he had a total of 10,000 child sex images and 200 video clips .
Judge Stephen Erber ordered him to undergo the Stop programme for sex offenders and banned him from owning , leasing , or possessing a computer for six months after his release .
The judge ordered the computer system to be seized and forfeited to the crown , the images destroyed , and Broadfoot was told he must pay $ 45 to the TradeMe buyer for the hard drive that was confiscated by police .
Defence counsel Andrew Riches said Broadfoot was fully co-operative and truly repentant and had the support of his church community .
There had been no attempt to share the images and they had been purely for his private use .
They had not been actively hidden .
" He was careless with the images and that is how he came to be caught , when he sold this hard drive on TradeMe , " said Mr Riches .
Since his arrest he had fronted up to his church congregation and had lost his job and many friends .
He had lost his job .
Crown prosecutor Marcus Zintl said the crown opposed any release on home detention because it would be sending Broadfoot back to the environment where the offending occurred , and future internet use would be hard to police .
Judge Erber said he had viewed a representative sample of the images which depicted boys and girls in sex acts with each other , with adult men and women , and with animals , as well as young girls in bondage .
He mentioned the hypocrisy of Broadfoot being an active church member while committing these offences .
" Children making these films are certain to be badly damaged and most members of society abhor this type of pornography , " said the judge .
Parliament had made it clear that deterrence was the overwhelming consideration for sentencing in such cases .
" The images were explicit and degrading and are an assault on the proper values of our society which is concerned to protect children , " the judge continued .
" By viewing and keeping these images you are encouraging the production of the images , making you a participant in the degradation of the children . "
Why you should brush your teeth .
During my year long deployment as an Army Dentist in Kuwait and Iraq , I witnessed a very different “ conflict ” than what is currently portrayed by the news media .
I saw many wonderful and miraculous things as the people of Iraq worked with our servicemen and women to rebuild their country .
We went into the villages to provide dental exams and treatment .
We would care for the Iraqi children first , then their grateful parents .
I accompanied Army Veterinarians as they worked to rebuild the Baghdad zoo and conducted classes to teach simple spay and neutering surgeries to their Iraqi counterparts .
I spent a full day sorting a warehouse full of toys sent by the American people for the Iraqi children .
I saw many valiant works of service between our two countries .
I also saw miracles preserve our soldiers .
This photo shows the building adjacent to the Ibn Sina hospital that took a mortar through the window at 2:30 AM .
Miraculously , all the soldiers billeted in this room were downstairs playing poker and were not injured .
The most miraculous event I witnessed showed how a tooth saved a sergeant ’s life !
Christmas
Eve morning a soldier came into our clinic at the Ibn Sina Hospital in downtown Baghdad covered in his own blood .
He recounted an incredible story .
Early Christmas
Eve morning , two squads were assigned to sweep and clear two adjacent homes where Iraq terrorists were holed - up .
The patient , SGT C , was leading one of those assault squads .
The other squad hit their target first .
SGT C said that he heard a lot of small arms fire and yelling , so he thought he would round the corner and size up the situation before advancing his team .
Unfortunately , as he turned the corner , he found himself staring directly into the barrel of a 9 mm automatic pistol .
SGT C said he never had time to be scared , he just knew he was dead .
The terrorist pulled the trigger and , miraculously , SGT C found himself still standing .
He figured the bullet had missed .
He advanced on the Iraqi , who immediately surrendered .
After the enemy was rounded up , SGT C said he started to feel light headed and one of his soldiers insisted that he proceed to the hospital .
He realized at this time that he had lost his front tooth in the gun fight .
He figured the ballistic shock from the weapon ’s blast had knocked it loose .
He was wrong .
When he presented early that morning Major Kimberly Perkins , our oral surgeon , took a panograph and discovered the incredible truth .
The 9 mm bullet did NOT miss SGT C .
He was hit directly in the face .
The bullet entered just below his nose where it impacted the apex of # 8 .
The energy from the bullet was transferred to the tooth , literally ejecting the tooth from its socket , and stopping the bullet in its track .
Other than the missing tooth , the majority of SGT C ’s injuries were confined to soft tissue .
Here is the pan with the bullet clearly visible , embedded in the upper lip .
SGT C is a citizen soldier — a reservist .
When he returns to the states , the Army will see he has an implant replacement for the missing # 8 .
Meanwhile , the prosthodontist in Baghdad , LTC Richard Druckman , made him an acrylic interim treatment partial .
When SGT C came in for the prosthesis , I said “ Can you imagine what the enemy thought when he shot you point blank in the face , and you just kept coming at him !
Americans are invincible .
No wonder he surrendered so fast ! ”
SGT C smiled and said , “ This is why you should always brush your teeth ! ”

Summer brings sunshine , fresh air , and , sometimes , ants into your home .
If the ants become troublesome this year , home improvement site DIY Life suggests drawing lines with chalk around the house to keep the ants at bay .

Photo by photogirl17 .
With some chalk , apparently it's not hard to keep ants away from particular areas of your home without using harsh chemicals .
To keep ants out of your house , draw chalk lines around your doorways and windowsills .
Ants wo n't cross a chalk line .
Why ?
It 's not entirely clear , but some say the ants do n't like the particles sticking to their feet , while others say they 're averse to the calcium carbonate in the chalk .
Whatever the reason , this nontoxic solution will keep ants outside where they belong .

It may sound absurd ( okay , it does sound absurd ) , but a quick Google search shows a lot of support for this method .
And if that does n't work , consider other natural remedies like using cucumbers to keep the ants away .
Got other nifty tricks for keeping the bugs out of your home ?

Because this A - Team does not help people in trouble .
They ’re only out for revenge .
This A - Team did not serve time in the same military unit and then escape from a prison camp , thus bonding them together for life .
In fact …
This A - Team does n’t make any sense , whatsoever .
And it just got pitied like a fool by The Karate Kid , which made DOUBLE its gross in their mutual opening weekend .
At this time last year , “ The Hangover ” and “ Up ” were going gangbusters at the box - office — both ORIGINAL scripts .
But , wait , The Karate Kid is also a remake of a piece of campy 80s material .
So why did it fare so much better ?
Before you opine , let ’s take a look at a few recent press clippings …
Brandon Gray , Box -Office Mojo :
“ Recently , knocks against Hollywood ’s lack of originality have resonated more loudly than usual in light of the slow times at the box office .
But this weekend demonstrated what ’s really going on : general audiences are n’t that hung up on whether something ’s a retread or not ; it ’s the rote retreads that turn them off .
The Karate Kid was a movie that did not rest on the laurels of its famous brand .
It went all out with a grand and relatable underdog story … [ and ] took the time to set - up the story and characters .
The A - Team , on the other hand , came off as a generically slick action picture with no story in its advertising , banking on the television show branding to distinguish it . ”
Deadline Hollywood :
“ There were 11 screenwriters who worked on [ The A - Team ] … to produce so little .
This is not about whether the movie ’s any good .
It ’s about yet another unoriginal movie idea emanating from Hollywood and how it was developed . ”
The Hollywood Reporter :
“ [ The A - Team ] seems nearly writer - free .
Absolutely no time gets wasted on story , character development or logic . ”
So the summer of thuds continues .
And I , unfortunately , paid money to see The A - Team in a theater .
And I can tell you that all of the above comments are dead - on .
The movie is a mess ; but do n’t blame the screenwriters , blame the producers and director who collated all of the cohesive drafts into an incoherent blob .
At this time last year , The Hangover and Up were going gangbusters at the box - office — both ORIGINAL scripts .
This year , the industry is reeling from your rejection of all the bad remakes , reboots and sequels that are crowding theaters .
…ever - increasing competition in home and mobile entertainment is causing a sea change : audiences want good stories , not just eye candy .
Take a look …
Variety :
“ … box office receipts were down a steep 23 % compared to the same weekend last year . ”
Peter Bart interviewing director Brett Ratner :
“ We ’re in a funny time now .
Box - office so far this year is substantially down ; a lot of the pictures are not quite cooking — you ’re spending time with young people , NYU students .
Is this almost an instinctual reaction on your part that we need some fresh voices ? ”
Box -Office Mojo :
“ … May 2010 ’s drop - off was so steep and its estimated attendance so far below the norm of the past eight years that it was alarming .
The upshot is a reaffirmation that the box office is product - driven for the most part .
That ’s a positive sign : many people rejected or were indifferent to the current crop of movies , and that can be remedied in the future through the production of more compelling fare . ”
MY TAKE : I think it ’s clear that Hollywood needs us .
They will always need good stories and fresh characters and it ’s not only obvious to us but … it ’s starting to affect their bottom line like never before .
Of course , they will still make the derivative drivel , but ever - increasing competition in home and mobile entertainment is causing a sea change : audiences want good stories , not just eye candy .
Have the movie studio execs seen TV lately ?
How many great shows are waiting on our DVRs right now ?
Would you rather sit at home and watch a marathon of Breaking Bad , Dexter , Mad Men or True Blood on your flatscreen or go out and spend $ 12.50 to see the likes of Killers , Get Him to the Greek or The A - Team ?
The TV divisions are getting the message .
There is a HUGE return to SCRIPTED TELEVISION with tons of pilots getting the greenlight for this fall .
NBC , ABC , CBS , FOX , AMC , FX , Spike TV , MTV , USA Network and more have all committed to new scripted shows .
The volume of “ reality ” shows has dropped like a bag of hammers .
It turns out that people do n’t want to see real people , they want to follow great CHARACTERS .
So give ’em some .
There ’s no time like now .
That ’s why I ’m readying one script for submission , Story Mapping my next one and encouraging writers to do their best work and get it out there .
Now .
Do n’t let the cavalcade of crap this summer get you down .
Let it inspire you to greatness .
As always , I say …
Good luck and Happy Writing !

BitTorrent is the most effective way to share large files online , but it can also be used to stream live events .
In some cases it 's the only way for people to access cultural events .
After a Palestinian filmmaker was denied a visa to visit a film festival in Norway where one of his films is to be screened , the festival 's organizers are turning to BitTorrent to stream the festival live to Gaza .
This weekend , the International “ Nordic Youth Film Festival ” takes place in Tromsø , Norway .
As is the case every year , the festival ’s organizers have invited young filmmakers from all over the world to show their work , but not all were allowed to come .
Despite an invite , the Palestinian director of Ticket to Azrael was prevented from flying to Norway by the authorities .
“ It ’s not a secret that the blockade in the Middle East prevents vital resources like water , food and medicines going to the needy people in Palestine .
But it is perhaps not as general known that normal people who are traveling out of the area are denied a visa , ” the festival organizers write in a blog post commenting on the issue .
Luckily , with BitTorrent the filmmaker can still follow the festival .
The Norwegian film festival has close ties to the people of Gaza .
The festival ’s organizers have previously invited its young filmmakers and after the 2008/2009 siege they continued to collaborate on film workshops over the Internet .
This year , due to the political situation , they ’re going to take it up a notch by offering a BitTorrent - powered live stream to people all over the world , including Gaza .
The BitTorrent stream that the festival will use is facilitated by The Far North Living Lab which has experience with the technology .
Last year the lab kicked off with a spectacular experiment in which they used BitTorrent to stream a 2 K resolution film onto the big screen , and a few months later they hosted the first BitTorrent - powered live streamed concert .
The Far North Living Lab start their live stream from the festival tonight during the opening .
In order to get the stream to Gaza and other parts of the Internet they ’ve set up a BitTorrent - powered live stream ( approx 1.1 mbit h264 , full PAL resolution ) that will be transmitting from Norway ’s oldest still - used cinema .
Similar to the previous projects , the lab ’s researchers are using the P2P - Next codebase .
“ This is an important opportunity to reach our goal for an international awareness of Youth Cinema , ” festival director Hermann Greuel told TorrentFreak .
An important aspect is that through the stream young filmmakers in Gaza can follow the festival .
“ The current stream will not be possible on a central place or event in Gaza due to special permissions from the Gaza government , but the stream is available in Gaza , ” he added .
It ’s good to see that there are filmmakers and enthusiasts who put BitTorrent to creative use , rather than simply accusing the technology of facilitating copyright infringement .
Readers who want to check out the stream can do so from 6 PM CET .

Working together for free software is a new campaign of the Free Software Foundation , aimed at increasing awareness of free software to the general public , as well as striving to bring the free software community together to create the fully free operating system .
Our campaign for software freedom is not a campaign for freedom of choice .
Free software is n't just an alternative to proprietary software .
Free software is a social movement , a movement to rid the world of software that would otherwise be used to divide us and keep us powerless .
The software we use is not a matter of utility or convenience , it is a matter of securing our freedom now and ever more so in a future where we become increasingly dependent on the integrity of the software we run .

Haneen Zuabi , a Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset , has been sworn at by parliamentary colleagues and received death threats since disembarking on Monday
While other activists from the Gaza aid flotilla have returned home , one is left facing death threats and abuse in Israel .
Haneen Zuabi , a Palestinian member of the Israeli Knesset who was aboard the Mavi Marmara , is now under armed protection after nearly 500 people signed up to a Facebook page calling for her execution .
During a heated parliamentary session yesterday Zuabi was sworn at and then shoved out of the chamber amid shouts of " Go to Gaza , traitor " .
The 41 - year - old member of the Arab nationalist party Balad has also received death threats by phone and mail .
" I am not scared , " she said , speaking from her home town of Nazareth in northern Israel .
" This is inherent here , it is not something that started yesterday .
It is just harder and harsher now . "
Zuabi faces growing hostility for taking part in the Gaza aid flotilla , amid a climate of rage at what has been portrayed in Israel as a premeditated attack upon its soldiers by armed activists aboard the boats .
" Israel wanted many deaths to terrorise us and to send a message that no future aid convoys should try to break the siege of Gaza , " she told journalists this week .
Zuabi said that naval boats surrounded the Mavi Marmara and fired on it before soldiers abseiled aboard from a helicopter .
She went below to the ship 's hold and said that , within minutes , two dead passengers were brought inside , followed by two more who had been seriously wounded .
soldiers refused her requests for medical assistance for the injured passengers , who died shortly after .
Zuabi – known in Israel as an articulate Hebrew speaker – said that soldiers specifically asked her to translatetheir instructions .
At first , she refused .
" I shouted back , ' Why did n't you ask for my help before you murdered these people ? ' "
But she realised that such assistance could prevent further violence .
" My fear was that miscommunication and panic could lead to more deaths , " she said .
" Everyone on the boat was terrified , screaming and crying and I felt a sense of responsibility towards them . "
Zuabi spent the next few hours conveying the Israeli soldiers ' instructions to the passengers as they were searched , while also relaying concern over injured passengers and requests for water , medicine or to pray .
Disembarking with the others at Ashdod port on Monday , Zuabi , who has parliamentary immunity , was interrogated three times before being freed
The remaining four Palestinian citizens of Israel aboard the aid boats were released from Ashkelon prison this morning , but remain under house arrest until next week .
They have not been charged .
Having survived a situation in which she 'd factored a " 50 % chance to come out alive " , Zuabi said she is now facing a different threat , " of racist , illegitimate ideas that have turned violent " .
Zuabi was elected last year and , as the first female Knesset member on an Arab party list , views her support for the Free Gaza campaign as part of a wider fight for democracy , race and gender equality in Israel .
She said she cannot yet allow herself to process the violent events aboard the Mavi Marmarawhat happened .
" I can't forget the images of the dead , but I have n't cried for them yet .
I have to stay strong in this climate of threats against me . "

DETROIT --
Sometimes you can tell more about a man when a perfect game is taken away from him than you can when he pitches one .
Nobody would 've blamed Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga if he 'd spewed venom in discussing the blown call by first base umpire Jim Joyce .
And while he was obviously upset with the call that gave Cleveland Indians shortstop Jason Donald an infield single with two outs in the ninth , what did he do when he saw Joyce 's safe signal ?
" I had started to celebrate , " Galarraga said .
" But then I looked at him .
I thought , ' OK . '
I thought , ' I can smile or punch this guy . ' "
So , he smiled .
Later , Joyce summoned him to the umpire 's room to say he was sorry .
" He really feels bad -- probably more bad than me , " Galarraga said .
" But nobody 's perfect .
I give a lot of credit to that guy because he needed to talk to me and say , ' I 'm sorry . '
" His body language said more than a lot of words .
His eyes were watering .
I gave him a couple hugs .
There is going to be a couple more -- I hope so . "
Galarraga smiled and winked .
" Nobody 's perfect , " he added .
And nobody knew that more than Galarraga .
Yet , he handled it perfectly .
" It should be pointed out how classy Armando handled it , " Inge said .
" He handled it like an absolute man . "
And so did Joyce .
Remember that if you 're at Comerica Park on Thursday with Joyce behind home plate .
Nobody lost more than Galarraga did , but he forgave Joyce and showed him affection .
And we will remember this perhaps longer than we would have remembered an actual perfect game .
The notoriety of this one will cause it to be recalled much more frequently than some of the 20 actual perfect games .
When it was over , before several Tigers hooted on Joyce , catcher Alex Avila ran to the mound for the first hugs of the night .
" I 'm proud of you , " he told Galarraga .
" You did great tonight . "
Galarraga responded : " And I am proud of you . "
They were in perfect harmony all night long .
" He executed the gameplan to perfection , " Avila said .
" He had a really good sinker , but in the past had hesitated to throw it inside .
And that was the perfect complement to his good slider .
BY THE NUMBERS
A breakdown of Galarraga 's near - perfect game :
1 -- Hits allowed , which came with two outs in the ninth
0 -- Shutouts and complete games before Wednesday
9.18 -- ERA in last three starts against Cleveland , all losses
88 -- Pitches thrown
3 -- Number of starts since recalled from Triple - A Toledo on May 16
2004 -- Year of last one - hitter by a Tigers pitcher , thrown by Mike Maroth against the New York Yankees on July 16
104 -- Length of game , in minutes
17,738 -- Paid attendance
" We threw nothing but fastballs the first time through the order .
That 's how electric his stuff was .
And then , to keep them off balance , he started throwing sinkers in and sliders away .
That was the best and hardest stuff I 've seen from him .
He hit 95 ( mph ) on the radar a few times .
" It was just a fantastic performance , no matter what . "
Tigers pitching coach Rick Knapp had been telling Galarraga to trust his stuff for the last two seasons .
He 'd struggled since winning 13 as a rookie in 2008 , and Detroit manager Jim Leyland said pitchers who adjust to being hit and trust their stuff make it .
" Those who do n't are n't here long , " he said this week .
But this game punched his ticket for the future .
" Trust , oh yeah , " Knapp said .
" It was all there tonight . "
Galarraga added : " Rick has my back .
I really thank him and the whole organization for believing in me . "
Tigers general manager Dave Dombrowski and Leyland decided last week to go with Galarraga in the rotation over Dontrelle Willis , whom they designated for assignment Sunday before trading him Tuesday to the Arizona Diamondbacks .
His teammates gave him a congratulatory beer shower any way .
" We celebrate like I got it , " Galarraga said .
" It is not in the book .
But I can show you it on the tape .
I know myself that I threw a perfect game .
But I do n't think they are going to change it . "
And he smiled .
Tigers teammates gathered in the video room immediately after the game , and then in front of one of the big - screen TVs in the clubhouse .
They watched as stations played it again and again with these comments :
" How do you blow that ?
" Omigod ! "
" Jim , how can you make that call ?
" Unbelievable ! "
Leyland said : " We wanted it so much for the kid ; he deserved it . "
But no harsh stuff came from Galarraga .
He said he " expected more of a big - league umpire " before meeting Joyce , but that was about as hard as his tone got .
" I 'm happy and I 'm sad , " he said .
Hey , for a guy who was working out the kinks in Toledo just over two weeks ago , there was plenty to smile about .
" I feel good , " Galarraga said .
" It 's awesome .
" I am going to do it one time , you know .
I hope to finish it with 27 straight outs . "
But he got it right Wednesday night in ways that had nothing to do with whether a play is called safe or out .

The air strikes were aimed at Hamas training site and tunnels , Israel said
Israel has launched two night - time air strikes on the Gaza Strip which has left a number of people wounded , Palestinian medical sources said .
The Israeli air force bombed a target in the north of Gaza and struck tunnels in the south , near the border with Egypt .
Palestinian medical sources told reporters that about 22 people had been injured , two seriously .
The attacks come a day after militants in Gaza fired mortars into Israel .
One of the seriously wounded Palestinians was 15 , Palestinian medical sources said .
The Israeli Defense Forces confirmed the attacks in Beit Hanoun , east of Gaza City , and Rafah in the south .
" The tunnels were dug 1 km from the security fence and were intended for infiltrating into Israel and executing terror attacks , " a spokesman told the news agency Agence France Presse .
The attacks come just hours after a donkey cart carrying dynamite exploded on the border between Gaza and Israel .
The donkey was killed in the explosion , which was aimed at blowing a hole in the security fence .
Militants later fired two mortars into Israel , but there were no reported casualties .
