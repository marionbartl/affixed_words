Anatomy of a Game Mechanic
By Tyler Sigman
[ Game design veteran Sigman presents a detailed look at how game mechanics can be represented visually -- and what we can learn about how to make great video games thanks to such alluring graphs . ]
Whether discussing game features amongst the design team or communicating them to programmers , lack of proper terminology can obfuscate messages .
( Just like how using the word " obfuscate " can obfuscate messages . )
Coders have technical backgrounds and most went through rigorous college - level math classes .
As a result , if a designer is trying to explain a desired mechanic but using the wrong terms , the message content can be lost .
The foundations of math provide a convenient basis for understanding most game mechanics , so it generally makes sense to describe game mechanics in established mathematical nomenclature .
The first part of this article is a short primer on visual representation of game mechanics and some proper terms to describe those representations .
The second half discusses a few selected game mechanics in more detail for illustrative purposes .
Visual Value in a Graph
A picture 's worth a thousand words .
No , seriously .
I was trying to think of a wittier , more concise way to explain the value of talking about game mechanics visually , but societal wisdom beat me there .
The hitch about using visuals is that you still need a way to describe them .
So you kinda still need those thousand words after all .
So let 's dive in with some foundation items , and then we 'll get to the fun stuff .
Term : Function
Mathematically , a game mechanic is usually just a function .
A function is a mathematical " black box " .
Given a certain input , the black box ( game mechanic ) creates an output .
Game Mechanics are Functions ( Black Boxes )
Graphically , a function is represented by a line or curve in an X - Y plot :
A Function
Term : Domain
Function Domain
A game mechanic 's domain is the range of values over which the mechanic is active .
Graphically , this is represented by the X - axis ( " abscissa " ) .
Take an example game mechanic : " shooting accuracy as a function of RIFLE skill . "
The domain is the RIFLE skill range -- say 1 - 10 or 1 -100 or whatever your game system is .
Another example is the mechanic " acceleration as a function of transmission gear . "
In this case , the domain is the range of gears in the vehicle -- say 1 through 5 .
Term : Slope
Slope
Slope refers to the angle of the line or curve of a graphed mechanic .
Technically , slope is described as " rise over run " , which is just the change in Y value for a given change in X value .
Negative slope means downward trending ; positive slope is upward trending .
Conceptually , a high slope means a fast - changing mechanic , whereas a low slope is a slowly - changing mechanic .
High and Low Slope
Whether the mechanic is linear or non-linear ( see later ) , you can always still define a local slope .
In the case of a linear mechanic , the slope is constant ; for non-linear mechanics , the slope changes all over the place .
Term : Linear
One of the most useful descriptive characteristics of a game mechanic ( a.k.a. function ) is whether it is linear or non-linear .
Linear is pretty much like it sounds -- " like a line " .
Mathematically , this means the slope of the mechanic is constant .
Practically , this means that the mechanic steadily increases or steadily decreases at a given rate .
Linear Mechanics / Functions
Examples of Linear Mechanics :
Simple steering : position of the steering wheel corresponds linearly to turn rate
: position of the steering wheel corresponds linearly to turn rate Simple weapon damage as a function of charge - up time : if you charge up for 2.0 seconds , the damage is twice what it is if you charged up for 1.0 seconds
: if you charge up for 2.0 seconds , the damage is twice what it is if you charged up for 1.0 seconds Simple To - Hit Chance as a function of weapon skill : having a Weapon Skill of 50 gives the player two times the chance to hit as a Weapon Skill of 25 .
having a Weapon Skill of 50 gives the player two times the chance to hit as a Weapon Skill of 25 .
Simple XP Rewards as a Function of Monster Level : defeating a level 4 monster gives twice as much experience as defeating a level 2 monster
Term : Non-Linear
If a mechanic is not linear , then it is non-linear .
I know -- big surprise .
For every linear mechanic out there , there 's probably a non-linear one .
Well , maybe not that many , but the point is that non-linear mechanics are extremely common .
Sometimes you need to use a non-linear relationship because a linear mechanic just does n't accurately simulate or accomplish your design intent .
Non-Linear Mechanics / Functions
Examples of Non-Linear Game Mechanics :
Almost every RPG character level advancement XP table ever created ( you can thank the late Gary Gygax or Dave Arneson for that ) : it might take only 1,000 XP to climb from level 1 to 2 , but it could take 1,000,000 XP to climb from level 20 to 21 .
it might take only 1,000 XP to climb from level 1 to 2 , but it could take 1,000,000 XP to climb from level 20 to 21 .
Population growth in Civilization : your Year 500 Civ will typically have more than five times the population of your Year 100 Civ ... unless you 're on your way to extinction .
your Year 500 Civ will typically have more than five times the population of your Year 100 Civ ... unless you 're on your way to extinction .
Car acceleration as a function of " seconds from the line " in a driving game : real cars have higher acceleration in lower gears and lower acceleration in higher gears .
You may travel 0 - 60 in 6 seconds but you can't expect to gain another 60 MPH in the next 6 seconds .
: real cars have higher acceleration in lower gears and lower acceleration in higher gears .
You may travel 0 - 60 in 6 seconds but you can't expect to gain another 60 MPH in the next 6 seconds .
Score as a function of time played in Geometry Wars : if you can last 20 minutes , you 'll surely have far more than twice the score of someone who played for 10 minutes .
Non-linear mechanics are very familiar to us and more colloquial ways of describing them exist .
For example :
" the law of diminishing returns "
" geometric expansion "
Types of Non-Linear Mechanics
While linear mechanics differ only by their slopes , there are many different types of non-linear mechanics .
It is often necessary to subclassify them further as one of the following :
Asymptotic to a value : these mechanics tend to " flatten out " as they approach a certain result ( y value ) .
After a point , huge changes in X result in very small ( insignificant ) changes in Y .
In other words , slope approaches zero after a certain point .
Example Mechanic : to hit chance based upon weapon skill : you might design a combat system that eventually " tops out " the player 's chance to hit as his weapon skill increases .
After a point , further increases in weapon skill have little effect .
: these mechanics tend to " flatten out " as they approach a certain result ( y value ) .
After a point , huge changes in X result in very small ( insignificant ) changes in Y .
In other words , slope approaches zero after a certain point .
Asymptotic to a Value
Asymptotic to infinity : these mechanics tend to approach infinity ( Y ) as X increase or decreases .
Example : Population Growth ( geometric expansion ) .
Technically , some limit will eventually exert itself ( e.g. capacity of the planet ? ) , but until that limit , the mechanic may follow an Asymptotic to Infinity relationship .
these mechanics tend to approach infinity ( Y ) as X increase or decreases .
Asymptotic to Infinity
Non-asymptotic : the non-linear mechanic does n't ever " level off " and is n't asymptotic to infinity .
Non-Asymptotic
Segmented Linear
A segmented linear mechanic is technically non-linear overall , but you can think of it more as just a linear mechanic that is made up of two or more sections with different slopes .
An example of a segmented linear mechanic would be a really simple car transmission mechanic where you are modeling acceleration and torque as a function of speed .
Each gear would have different values .
The resulting graph would be made up of several different linear " gear bands " , each with a different slope .
Segmented Linear Mechanic : Notice the Distinct Linear Sections
Segmented Linear mechanics are relatively easy to create and often are a great way of simulating a complex non-linear mechanic .
If the assumption that the mechanic is linear between various key points is good enough , then it can be a good way to go and they are very tunable .
Linear and Non-Linear Living Together
If you like chocolate and you like vanilla , why not combine them together and have both ?
In and Out Burger does n't fight you on that , so you should n't fight yourself .
When designing a game mechanic , there 's no reason why you can't have some portions of the domain be linear and some non-linear .
However , you should probably avoid such complexity unless you have a really good reason .
( See next page . )
Notes on How to Choose the Right Mechanic : Linear or Non-Linear or Combined ?
Designing game mechanics is part science , part artistry .
Typically you have to make trade - offs between simplicity and accuracy .
All sorts of factors should be weighed in a design decision :
How accurate of a simulation do you want ?
How well known is the mechanic you are trying to model ?
How simple will it be to tune , retune , and balance ?
Will other team members understand it enough to work on it ?
Will the end - user ( player ) understand it ?
And so on .
Sigman Design Rule 41a : Choose the simplest mechanic that satisfies your design goal .
KISS and all that .
This is similar to a very handy axiom in AI Programming .
Remember that your goal is not to make the most eloquent / advanced / innovative SYSTEM , but rather to accomplish a DESIGN GOAL with the minimum amount of required work .
In other words , your game mechanic only needs to be as clever as it needs to be .
A bit Zen - like , but true .
This is n't to say always go simple -- sometimes a design goal can only be achieved with a complex system .
But always go as simple as you can get away with , because that will facilitate easier tuning , adjustment , iteration , and understanding .
In order of simplicity of implementation :
Linear mechanic Non-linear mechanic defined by a single equation ( e.g. y = x2 ) Segmented Linear mechanic Non-linear mechanic defined by multiple equations and / or combined linear / non - linear mechanic
However , do n't confuse implementation complexity with the complexity that the player sees or experiences !
Sigman Design Rule 41b : Complexity of implementing a mechanic does not always equal the player 's complexity of understanding that mechanic .
Non-linear mechanics are usually more complex to implement than linear mechanics , but they are n't typically hard to understand !
Like I mentioned earlier , concepts like " diminishing returns " are intuitively familiar to many people .
The reason is that we encounter tons of different mechanics in everyday life , and many of them are non-linear .
It is not hard to understand that a car 's acceleration varies over its 0 - 60 run ( as gears are changed ) , or that bunnies multiply exponentially , or that your financial investments can behave any number of ways in between key time periods .
People observe mechanics all around them every day , even if they are n't thinking about it .
If you are making a simulation or an arcade action game , studying real - life mechanics is hugely important to game design .
A Few Linear Mechanics in Life
Travel speed and distance : if you travel at 120 mph in a straight line , you cover twice as much distance per hour as you do traveling 60 mph in a straight line .
Yes that sounds obvious , but that 's a linear mechanic for you !

Kinetic energy as a function of mass : a flying object moving at 50 feet per second and weighing 2 lbs .
has exactly ½ of the kinetic energy of a flying object moving at the same speed but weighing 4 lbs .
a flying object moving at 50 feet per second and weighing 2 lbs . has exactly ½ of the kinetic energy of a flying object moving at the same speed but weighing 4 lbs .
Temperature in the troposphere : temperature tends to decrease at a steady rate ( " lapse rate " ) from the surface on up to the tropopause .
A Few Non-Linear Mechanics in Life :
US Federal Taxes : thanks to the myriad of factors involved in US taxes ( including tax brackets , phased out deductions , and a million other things ) , someone who earns 100 k is n't guaranteed to pay twice as much taxes as someone who earns 50 k .
But even within your own tax return , you pay more taxes for the last $ 10 you earn than the first $ 10 you earn ( assuming you make enough to hit the second marginal tax bracket ) .
The core tax bracket system is segmented linear .

Sometimes you have rapid gains , and sometimes you plateau for a time .

( non-linear increasing ) Compounding Interest : if you invest $ 1,000 in a 5 % earning money - market account at age 20 , it will be worth $ 7,040 at age 60 .
If you had invested the same $ 1,000 at age 40 , it would only be worth $ 2653 at age 60 ( 37.7 % of the former ) .
If interest compounding was a linear mechanic , you would have expected a 20 year investment to be worth exactly 50 % of a 40 year investment .

Salary as a function of years of experience ( Ok , the Game Developer Salary Survey is always on my mind ) : someone with 15 years of experience does n't typically make 3 times what a person with 5 years of experience makes .

Gravity : the attraction of two bodies decreases non-linearly with distance .
If you weigh 200 lbs. at Sea Level ( ~4,000 miles distance from the center of the Earth ) , you will actually weigh far less than half of that at an altitude of twice that .
Kinetic energy as a function of speed : a five - pound object moving at 50 mph has four times as much kinetic energy when moving at 100 mph ( non-linear increasing )
A normal ( aka " bell shaped " ) distribution of data ( see my Statistics article < LINK > ) : values in the upper 10 % band are far more rare than those in the middle 10 % band .
Ok , enough about real life .
Let 's do a couple quick case studies of actual game mechanics .
Game Mechanic # 1 : Leveling Tables in Typical Role - Playing Games
Quick Description : Characters gain " levels " , which correspond to predefined improvements in key attributes and skills .
It takes a certain amount of Experience Points ( earned through completion of various tasks ) to gain levels .
Later levels cost vastly more Experience Points to advance than early levels .
Graph It !
Typical Experience Point / Level Chart
Dissect It !
When it comes to an experience point system , there are two main ways of skinning the cat .
Method 1 , which is by far the most popular , uses an experience point curve like that shown above -- experience to reach the next level increases non-linearly .
Only 1,000 may be required to achieve level 2 , but you 'll need a total of nearly 200,000 to reach level 20 .
This system was used in the grandpappy of all RPGs , Dungeons and Dragons .
The advantage of this system is that bigger monsters award the player larger XP numbers , so it is easy to compare monsters on an apples to apples basis .
Also , the players feel a sense of accomplishment in gaining the larger rewards .
For completeness ' sake , the other common system for XP / Levels involves keeping a constant level ramp ( say 1,000 XP per level ) but adjusting XP awards for monsters to be relative to the players .
For example , defeating a kobold with a level 1 character may yield 50 XP , but defeating the same kobold with a level 10 character might only award 5 XP .
Game Mechanic # 2 : Gold Income in Age of Empires : the Age of Kings DS
Quick Description :
In this game , the player earns 200 gold per turn for each mine .
If you have 3 mines , you earn exactly 3 times the income of 1 mine ( 3 x 200 = 600 gold ) , not counting tech bonuses .
Graph It !
Gold Income as a Function of # Mines in Age of Empires : the Age of Kings DS
Dissect It !
This income mechanic is totally linear .
More farms gives a directly - proportional increased food income .
Why do you think the designers chose a linear mechanic in this case ?
I have a strong suspicion * that this was a simple case of it being the simplest way to get the desired economic simulation .
That is , there was no strong reasoning for having a non-linear mechanic -- it 's logical and expected that two mines produce twice as much as one mine .
Given that the focus of the game is on core strategy and tactics , there was n't any compelling justification to model second - order effects of a complex economy .
( The designers could have included an efficiency mechanic that simulates more or less efficiency as the combined network of mines increases ... but why bother for this game about skirmishes ?
It would just be adding complexity where it is n't needed . )
* My suspicion is actually fact , since I designed that particular system
Game Mechanic # 3 : Victory Points for Routes in Ticket to Ride
Quick Description :
In this game , you earn victory points by claiming train routes between different towns .
Train routes are claimed by playing enough matching train color cards to fit the route length ( e.g. four red train cards to claim a length four red route ) .
Victory Point awards are non-linear for route length -- a length six route awards 15 points whereas a length three route gives only four points .
Graph It !
Scoring Points for Different Route Lengths in Ticket to Ride
Dissect It !
Once again , we have a non -linear mechanic breathing down our necks .
Claiming a length six route is more than twice as valuable as claiming a length three route .
Why do you think the designer chose a non-linear mechanic for this ?
While many mechanics are a choice of artistry , I believe in this case that using a non -linear curve is the only real valid decision .
This is because of how the game will weaken if the mechanic was linear .
If claiming a length six was only twice as valuable as a length three , or length four vs. length two , then the player has no incentive for claiming the larger routes besides simply needing the route to connect to their destination .
But by having the route lengths award victory points non-linearly , the designer created an additional motivation : if you can manage to save your cards of a given color and claim one of the long routes , it can be a big payoff .
This creates opportunities and decisions within the game -- players have a reason to sometimes hold on to their train cards instead of simply spending them whenever a route looks promising .
It is a strategy game , after all .
( Note that a length two route is worth exactly twice the points of a length one route .
However , claiming a route two is not appreciably harder than a route one , so in this case a nonlinear step was likely unnecessary . )
Game Mechanic # 4 : Insurance Policies for Starships in Eve Online
Yeah , yeah -- who wants to talk about insurance ?
But it is in a game , so it 's worth discussing because a broken mechanic here is n't much different than a broken mechanic in say , combat .
Quick Description : In Eve online , you can purchase replacement insurance for your starships .
If they get destroyed in a valid way ( no self - destructs , thank you ) , the insurance company pays out Interstellar Kredits ( ISK ) based upon the value of your ship and the level of insurance you purchased .
Graph It !
Here is a sample Insurance Policy choice screen :
Insurance Policy Options for a Starship in Eve Online
BTW , free insurance covers 40 % of the ship value .
Let 's graph those numbers .
In this case the " domain " ( X value ) is the purchase cost of the insurance and the payout value is the Y value .
The game mechanic , or function , is the behind the scenes link between policy purchase cost and payout value .
Graph of a Insurance Options for a Starship in Eve Online
Dissect It !
As you can see , the mechanic is linear .
Paying nothing gets you insured for 40 % of the ship 's value .
Paying 8,250 for this ship gets you insured for 99 % of its value .
Why do you think the developers chose a linear mechanic in this case ?
What are the advantages or disadvantages of this over a nonlinear insurance schedule ?
The starship insurance policies have a 12 week expiration .
In what ways does the expiration time affect how the policy costs are structured ?
Asymptotically Approaching the End of this Article
Linearity and non-linearity are core game system design elements I deal with on a daily basis .
A simple choice of curve makes a huge difference in everything from control schemes to treasure drops .

While I was watching the episode , I kept thinking of an episode of the cartoon Johnny Test in which moles were pulling objects and people underground .
The episode is still ingrained in my brain , and the whole time I was expecting to see an entire mole civilization thriving underground .
Alas that never happened but nonetheless the story was intriguing .
It was a typical standalone episode prompted by the disappearance of people .
What started as a possible connection to Olivia 's disappearance became a search for missing guy who was pulled underground .
Apparently you can make mole people by genetically modifying them while still gestating .
There was that much time dedicated to the mole man story though I found it pretty cool .
It was an above average monster of the week which was fine .
I liked how the writers still tried to add a lot of the main storyline into this standalone though I think it could be problematic , which I 'll elaborate on later .
Walter explains his alternate universe theory again and says that people who have traveled between them are changed .
Olivia has superhearing and supervision now which help in the case though she almost kills Peter in arguably the most shocking moment of the episode .
Nina Sharp approaches Olivia and tells her where to find some specialist .
At the end of the episode , Olivia meets him .
Broyles and Peter 's huge plan to fight back is apparently doing well as the most trouble they 're having is getting a C - 130 .
Agent Jessup was thankfully scare in the episode and found some evidence hidden in a Bible which goes along with her persona .
Charlie clone was up to no good again with his ( it's ? ) awesome typewriter .
The problem with the half the episode being monster of the week and half serialized is that the middle just does n't produce very good of anything .
Spending time on the monster story takes away from the main Pattern story and vice versa .
Networks often like standalone episodes because anyone can jump in and start watching , but adding serial elements like the Charlie replacement would surely confuse the average viewer .
Fans of the show are extremely intrigued by the alternate universe stuff after the season one finale and are waiting to see what will happen with that .

The corporate media is ignoring S. 2028 , the flu pandemic bill that was unanimously passed by the Massachusetts Senate .
The draconian bill was covered extensively by the alternative news sites , but not a word from the New York Times or the Washington Post .
S. 2028 will be used as a template for legislation in other states .
The bill imposes a virtual police state and martial law on Massachusetts at the behest of the governor in the event of a flu pandemic this autumn .
It gives the state health commissioner , law enforcement , and medical personnel wide authority to mobilize forces , vaccinate the population , enter private property with no warrants , and even quarantine people against their will in violation of the Constitution .
The bill allows the state to enter property without a search warrant and destroy the property without a court order .
It would force in - state health care providers to assist in the performance of vaccination .
Law enforcement authorities are authorized to “ arrest without warrant any person whom the officer has probable cause to believe has violated an order for isolation or quarantine and shall use reasonable diligence to enforce such order .
Any person who knowingly violates an order for isolation or quarantine shall be punished by imprisonment of not more than 30 days and may be subject to a civil fine of not more than $ 1,000 per day that the violation continues . ”
Other states are in the process of implementing legal actions in response to the H1N1 virus hyped by the government and the corporate media .
Florida has distributed blank quarantine order forms , including a voluntary home quarantine agreement , a quarantine to residence order , a quarantine to residence order ( non-compliance ) , a quarantine to facility order , quarantine detention order , quarantine of facility order , building quarantine closure order and area quarantine closure order .
North Carolina released a draft isolation order that would provide for imprisonment for up to two years and pretrial detention without bail for any citizen who fails to comply with an isolation order .
Washington has granted authority to local health officers to issue emergency detention orders forcing citizens to be immediately and involuntarily isolated or quarantined for up to 10 days .
A form released by the state of Iowa for voluntary home confinement , home quarantine and home isolation recently made the rounds on the internet .
“ Rumors started swirling after a quarantine form was found by someone on the internet , ” KIMT 3 reported .
“ Health leaders in Iowa are reassuring people that there are no H1N1 related quarantines being ordered . ”
The form calls quarantine of all individuals suspected of coming in contact with the virus .
Bob Dwyer of MassLPA discusses S. 2028 .
S.2028 is now in Massachusetts House Ways and Means Committee .
The Liberty Preservation Association of Massachusetts has vowed to kill the legislation before it can reach the House ( see MassLPA video above ) .
The organization plans to lobby lawmakers at the capital on Beacon Hill on September 9 and convince them not to vote for and pass the bill .

A weather front rolls in from the horizon , storm clouds darken the sky , and ( at least 1.3 billion times a year ) lightning strikes .
Last month , the National Weather Service promoted their Lightning Safety Week , with information designed to call attention to safe practices , helping people avoid lightning strikes which kill an average of 100 people every year .
While the exact nature of the initial formation of lightning remains a subject of debate , what is known is that lightning strikes are caused by electrical imbalances present in the clouds .
Those imbalances correct themselves suddenly , with an often spectacular light show - which I 've tried to show here , with a handful of recent photographs of lightning from around the world .

Its rough analog in Classical music is a coda .
Tags are characterized by a heightening of the dramatic tension of the song , frequently including a " hanger " , or posted ( held ) note .
In addition , good tags can be sung as short , stand - alone works .
Tags may be soft and tender but are typically characterized by loud , " paint - peeling , " ringing chords .
According to the competition rules of the Barbershop Harmony Society , every song entered for a competition must have a tag .
When Barbershoppers get together , even if they have never met before , it is common for them to get into groups of four or more and sing a few tags .
Those that do n't know the tag being sung can be easily taught by those that do .
This typically brings feelings of joy and camaraderie to all involved .

Barbershop is a style of a cappella ( unaccompanied ) singing , characterised by four male vocal parts sung in close , rich , consonant harmony .
The most well - known expression of this musical style is the " Barbershop quartet " , the contemporary form of which has shed its twee image of four men with moustaches , striped suits and boater hats , and is now sleek , professional , musically sophisticated entertainment .
Groups of men larger than four can also sing Barbershop music .
Organised groups are usually known as " choruses " and are found in most North American cities , as well as in Australia / New Zealand , Great Britain and several countries in Europe .
The organisation responsible for overseeing Barbershop singing and development in North America is the de facto world championships for the art form .
Groups from affiliate organisations in other countries are also invited to compete .
Contestants must adhere to strict rules governing their performance style and the musical structure and subject material of their chosen songs .

Groups from affiliate organisations in other countries are also invited to compete .
Contestants must adhere to strict rules governing their performance style and the musical structure and subject material of their chosen songs .
The female counterparts to the Barbershop Harmony Society include Sweet Adelines International ( SAI ) , Harmony , Inc ( HI ) , and others .
Mixed ( male and female ) Barbershop groups exist , but are not common .

SATB stands for " Soprano , Alto , Tenor , Bass ( or Baritone ) " - the names of the voice parts of a typical four - part mixed - gender ( female / male ) a cappella quartet or choir .
SATB groups sing a wide variety of a cappella music , not just Barbershop
A Cappella is a musical style comprising of one or more voices without instrumental accompaniment .
The term is Italian ( or Latin ) and literally translates as " From the chapel " ( although most a cappella music is not church - related ) .
Barbershop is one type of a cappella singing .
Multitrack refers to a recording technique .
When it applies to tag - singing , it means that each of the voice parts is recorded separately and then mixed together after recording is complete ( as opposed to recording several singers harmonising with each other in one recording ) .
In a multitrack recording , each voice part can be sung by a separate individual , or one person can sing all voice parts .
The term can equally apply to video recording .
During the mixing stage of a multitrack video , the video screen is typically split into sections ( 4 , 6 , 8 , etc ) , each section showing one person singing one voice part ( they can often be all the same person , resulting in an eerie effect ) .

The 22 - year - old was greeted by fellow Liverpool fans
Liverpool fan Michael Shields received a warm welcome from fellow supporters as he watched his team at Anfield for the first time since being freed .
The 22 - year - old saw Liverpool beat Burnley in a comfortable 4 - 0 win .
The last game he had watched was the club 's Champions League final win in 2005 .
On his journey home from that game he was accused of trying to kill a barman in Bulgaria .
Justice Secretary Jack Straw approved a royal pardon on Wednesday .
As Mr Shields took his seat on Saturday , fans greeted him and shook his hand .
Mr Shields was invited to Saturday 's game along with his father Michael Snr , his mother , Maria , and his two sisters .
He was released from Thorn Cross Young Offenders Institute , in Warrington , on the same day .
Mr Shields had said the prospect of attending a Liverpool match with his father had kept him going while in jail .

More interesting is when you give it a very short period , one that is shorter than that of the timing source :
In current versions of VirtualDub , I do n't use any of these methods for frame timing in preview mode .
Instead , I have my own timer queue thread that uses timeGetTime ( ) coupled with a Sleep ( ) loop , with precision boosted by timeBeginPeriod ( ) and with thread priority raised .
You might think this is a bit barbaric , and it is , but it was the best way I could think of to get a reliable , precise timer on all versions of Windows .
The trick to making this work is putting in feedback and adjusting the delay passed to Sleep ( ) so that you do n't accumulate error .
As a result , I can do what I could n't do with timeSetEvent ( ) , which is to have a timer that has an average period of 33.367 ms .
I suppose I could rewrite it on top of the waitable timer API , but it did n't seem worth the effort .
After being somewhat depressed at the mediocre performance of the timer queue API , I remembered the CreateWaitableTimer ( ) API .
This is a different API where you create a timer object directly instead of part of a timer queue , and it also runs the timer in your thread instead of a thread pool thread , which is much easier to deal with if you 're trying to time work that requires APIs that must be called on a specific thread , particularly most DirectX APIs .
As it turns out , the waitable timer API does n't fare any better than the timer queue API for periodic timers , as it still takes the period in milliseconds and still has the same problems of significant , consistent error in period and sensitivity to the timer interrupt rate .
However , the good side is that you specify the initial delay in 100ns units instead of milliseconds , and more importantly , you can specify an absolute deadline .
This is very advantageous , because it means that you can compute timer deadlines internally in high precision off of a consistent time base , and although each individual timer may be imprecise , you can precisely control the average period .
There 's another factor , by the way : the timer queue API shares the same characteristic as many timing APIs in Windows of being dependent upon the resolution of the system timer interrupt and is thus also affected by timeBeginPeriod ( ) .
The reason I know is that the first time I tried this , I got results that still were n't great , but were a lot better than what you see above .
The 47ms timer , for instance , turned in deltas of 48 - 49 ms .
Then I realized that I was playing a song in WinAmp in the background , and had to redo the test again .
The first number is the time offset in milliseconds , measured by timeGetTime ( ) , which has approx .
1 ms accuracy and precision .
The second number is the delta from the last timer event .
Notice a problem ?
The period is consistently longer than requested .
In this case , we 're 10 % slower than intended .
If you request a lower period , it gets much worse .
Here 's the results for a 47 ms periodic timer :
That 's not the worst part , though .
Let 's say we just want a regular 100 ms beat .
That should n't be hard for a modern CPU to do .
Well , here are the results :
The first problem is the interface .
CreateTimerQueueTimer ( ) takes a parameter called DueTime , which specifies the delay until the timer fires for the first time .
Delay relative to what ?
Well , when you call the CreateTimerQueueTimer ( ) function .
Or rather , some undetermined time between when you call the function and it returns .
The problem with an interface like this is that you have no idea if something sneaks in between and stalls your thread for a while , like another thread or a page fault .
Therefore , you get a random amount of jitter in your start time .
Another problem is that if you are creating a repeating timer , you can only set the period in milliseconds .
That 's not precise enough for a lot of applications .
If you 're trying to lock to a beam position on a 60 Hz display , for instance , this forces you to take a third of a second error per frame , or a 2 % error .
The classic timer queue API in Windows is SetTimer ( ) .
This is mainly intended for UI purposes , and as a result it 's both cheap and imprecise .
If you 're trying to do multimedia timing , SetTimer ( ) is not what you want .
It 's also a bit annoying to use because you need a message loop and there 's no way to pass a ( void *) cookie to the callback routine ( a common infraction which makes C++ programmers see red ) .
The newer timer API , however , is CreateTimerQueue ( ) .
This allows you to create your own timer queue without having to tie it to a message loop , and looks like it would be a good replacement for timeSetEvent ( ) .
First , a review of what timer queues do .
A timer queue is used when you have a bunch of events that need to run at various times .
What the timer queue does is maintain a sorted list of timers and repeatedly handles the timer with the nearest deadline .
Not only is this more efficient when you have a bunch of timers because you do n't have a bunch of pieces of code all maintaining their own timing , but it's also a powerful technique because it can allow you to multiplex a limited timing resource .
It 's especially good when you have a bunch of low - priority , long - duration timers like UI timers , where you do n't want to spend a lot of system resources and precise timing is not necessary .

Just curious , is there no way to sync playback precisely with the monitor refresh and / or audio playback rate ?
It always bothers me that I need special hardware ( AJA / Avid/ DeckLink /etc ) to do broadcast - quality video output , where the main stumbling block to doing it directly with commodity hardware is not bandwidth but frame and audio synchronization .
This also makes me cringe when I see people driving high - end home theater equipment from a PC - how can you guarantee frame - for - frame synchronization of software video playback with the refresh of the TV or projector ?
( I seem to recall that SGI 's old multimedia API had some neat features where you could wait on frame refresh using select ( ) or poll ( ) on a UNIX file descriptor ... is there anything like this on PCs today ? )
Dan Maas - 04 09 09 - 17:55
The situation is very bad if you are in windowed mode , especially in Windows XP .
Essentially , the only way you can do refresh - synced display in windowed mode is to poll .
There is n't even a command to wait for vertical blank .
( Polling with 100 % of the CPU is an egregious sin . )
You also can't get a frame counter or queue anything to the vblank , so you also have to stall the graphics accelerator so you can time the blit with the CPU .
Direct3D has vblank - synced presentation modes in windowed mode , but internally on XP , it just does sleep / poll / blit loop .
One alternative is to use a video overlay , but there are a few drawbacks .
First , they 're usually only YCbCr -- bad if you want to display rendered graphics .
Second , they 're buggy as all across video hardware and drivers , and you get everything from corrupted displays to bad chroma upsampling to whacked levels .
Third , there 's generally no option to render as fast as possible , so you typically get throttled to refresh rate .
That 's bad if the video you happen to be showing is running slightly faster than refresh , because you get latency problems as your render loop is stalled .
Full screen mode is also better , because at least there you get hardware - based , v-synced page flipping .
The main problem there tends to be latency , because you do n't actually know the exact number of frames that are queued up .
There used to be problems with video drivers that could queue up too many frames when the GPU got backed up , like five or more frames .
Some programs resort to hard - stalling the GPU or using events to control latency .
The situation is theoretically better on Windows Vista with a WDDM driver .
I say theoretically just because I have n't tested it .
The main advantage is that with a WDDM driver , everything is redirected to a single 3D pipe , which solves a lot of the stalling problems you get with mixed 2D and 3D in windowed mode on XP .
Direct3D 9.L also provides much better status and control over frame queueing , such as the ability to set a latency limit , to query frame timing statistics , to actually wait for vertical blank ( although I would have preferred an event ) , and to explicitly tell the driver to discard queued frames to catch up .
I believe you lose the ability to query the exact beam position if you are using D3D10 , but you do n't care anyway if a composited desktop is used .
Windows 7 improves things again slightly by reintroducing hardware overlay support , bypassing performance problems when the desktop can't recomposite quickly enough , but improved over XP 's overlays in that now you can drive the overlay from D3D instead of DDraw and with more precise specification of color spaces .
Do n't get me started with TV out , where you can't even control fields reliably .
Sucks on most Linux systems , too , if my MythTV box is any indication .
I hear that NVIDIA 's VDPAU API is a huge improvement .
Wish they 'd port it to Windows .
What would really be useful is a reliable way to do timestamp - based presentation .
The only built - in way to do this right now is DirectShow through VMR9 / EVR .
That 's ( a ) a pain in the butt to deal with if you are n't doing decoding through DirectShow , and ( b ) it has only marginal success at avoiding tearing , depending on your system .
It also has some quite annoying levels problems due to the programmers ' annoying insistence that people whack their monitor settings for best color output , despite it being a huge pain to deal with and totally screwing up display of anything other than video .
Probably what pains me the most is that I could probably write a reliable , easy - to - use timestamp based presentation API on my Atari 800XL ....

> Which blog was this ?
I'm a bit reluctant to say since I do n't want to beat up on MS folks too much , but it was from this post : I was reminded of it by a comment on a newer post , and later found out amusingly I 'd already read it and commented on the timeGetTime ( ) vs. GetTickCount ( ) error ( on which he 's clarified correctly in a recent followup ) .
Annoyingly , I just checked again , and the docs for timeSetEvent ( ) are still screwed up like they were four years ago ....
Phaeron - 05 09 09 - 05:58
Does not this help ( Frame Refresh ) ?
asd - 05 09 09 - 07:52
That 's a previously internal function that takes a kernel handle you 're not likely to have .
Good luck calling it with a Direct3D object .
Phaeron - 05 09 09 - 09:42
Phaeron , what do you think of HPET ?
My understanding is that there is no OS support in anything less than Vista , but can it be used directly ?
There is a driver .
GL
GrofLuigi - 05 09 09 - 10:01
HPET is long overdue , but not all BIOSes have it enabled .
I have no idea to what extent Vista takes advantage of it .
I suppose I should try redoing these tests in Windows 7 RC .
Phaeron - 05 09 09 - 10:25
I think it is used for at least QPC / QPF .
Yuhong Bao - 05 09 09 - 13:50
DirectSound could be used as a clock itself , just by watching the playposition of the buffer and converting it to some reference time .
I have never measured its precision though , wheather it beats timeGetTime at a normal 48 khz .
In DirectShow playback is synced to that , if there is audio .
Gabest - 06 09 09 - 10:45
If I remember correctly , on Win9x and WinNT5 at least , DirectSound 's clock is based on the sound card 's internal clock - so as to provide as much of a gapless and scratchless playback as possible .
However , these clocks are on many sound cards quite imprecise - they are not suitable for a reliable timer .
On Vista , since DirectSound is entirely emulated in software , preventing hardware access , I think it is based on the system clock .
Whether is uses the HPET if present or not , I do n't know .
Mitch 74 ( link ) - 06 09 09 - 19:45
I seem to recall hearing that even on some cards that should have audio clocks that the driver still reports position to 10 ms accuracy anyway .
It might have something to do with avoiding an expensive trip to kernel mode to read the DMA counter .
It 's been a long time since I did SB16 programming , but I wonder whether there may have been a problem with getting a stable readout of the DMA pointer .
I do n't remember whether the 8237 latches both bytes together or whether you can get mixed LSB / MSB values like with the timer chip .
And then , of course , there 's the problem of buggy chipsets ....
Phaeron - 06 09 09 - 21:21
Even X - Fi Titanium has a problem with the internal clock .
When I enabled Dolby Digital Live , I noticed random skipping watching movies .
I was forced to use ReClock instead of the default DirectSound filter .
ReClock uses the video card clock instead of the sound card clock .
Mirage - 08 09 09 - 11:03
Just remembered another clock source I had in my machine .
Live digital broadcast has PCRs in transport stream , this is from a satellite ( converted to 100ns for directshow ) : 807010013276807010261364807010515981807010760805807011008892807011263509807011511597807011766214807012014302807012268919807012513742807012761830807013013182
The clock is 27MHz , so the resolution is about 0.037 ms .
Buffering and other data transformation delay may introduce some jitter of course .
I could only find two PCRs per buffer at most ( the buffer size was about 64 k ) , but that depends on how loaded is a frequency with programs .
It would be quite crazy to just use the hardware for the clock though :P
Gabest - 08 09 09 - 15:13
That 's only useful for video timing , though .
It 's not very useful if you 're trying to do local timing , like trying to time the playback !
Also , that assumes that the timestamps are correct .
It was a joyous day when I discovered that one particular popular MPEG - 1 encoder had a tendency to randomly encode GOP timestamps that were a full minute off ....
Phaeron - 08 09 09 - 15:17
You 're definitely right that CreateTimerQueue is n't good for multimedia - it 's guarantee is that the timer will delay * at least * as long as you ask , not necessarily that it will delay * exactly * as long .
If you set a timer on thread A and thread B is running when it goes off , we 're not going to preempt thread B to instantly service thread A's timer function .
The best time source you 've got in Windows is QueryPerformanceCounter ; as for a high - resolution , thread preempting timer that will guarantee your code is running every n milliseconds on the dime , not even kernel mode has this :-/
What you could ( must ! ) do is live with CreateTimerQueue 's inaccuracy , but correct for it via QPC .
Paul Betts - 08 09 09 - 18:16
Thanks for the information .
The error in a single callback is understandable , but the gross cumulative error in periodic timers on XP is less defensible ( and arguably should have been documented ) .
I much prefer the behavior in Windows 7 .
As for QPC , I 've actually found that it's not a good idea to use QPC in production code , because there are too many machines on which it is unreliable : everything from its rate changing based on processor scaling to random discontinuities due to TSC mismatches between processor cores to periodic large jumps in value .
As a result , I now use timeGetTime ( ) for anything that needs to be reliable -- it 's lower precision and more expensive , but you can generally rely on it to be stable .
Phaeron - 08 09 09 - 18:40
Is NtSetTimerResolution of no use ?
Mark ( link ) - 08 09 09 - 21:13
Ditch sleep , and switch to using select ( ) for timing .
Surprisingly , it does have a better - than - millisecond resolution .
When I was researching timing , this was the best I could find that worked consistently well .
( I put the select ( ) ing thread on higher priority , perhaps even realtime -- do n't remember , it was 5 years ago ) .

" I argued this before , and well , the Windows HAL is supposed to find a reliable timer source .
Linux does this as well , with it 's timer= options .
From http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archiv..
" If the HAL ca n't use RDTSC , what does it use instead ?
Well , as I said , it 's up to the HAL to find something suitable .
" I also said in http://www.virtualdub.org/blog/pivot/ent..
when I was comparing it with RDTSC that :" Also , at least the OS can fix the problem , while RDTSC is just an assembly instruction that the OS cannot do anything about .
The /usepmtimer switch is a good example .
It would not be able to fix program that use RDTSC , but it will fix programs that use QPC ( ) . "
Yuhong Bao - 09 09 09 - 18:20
It does n't matter if the HAL is supposed to pick a reliable source if there are significant numbers of systems out there where it does n't .
What matters is that QPC ( ) is broken on some systems .
Telling users to make system - wide configuration changes to address the problem is a non-starter , because ( a ) it 's highly user unfriendly , ( b ) it does n't always fix the problem , and ( c ) not all users have such access .
Try shipping a commercial product where you have an insert in the manual to put / usepmtimer in boot.ini .
Phaeron - 09 09 09 - 18:35

BTW , that particular AMD dual - core problem where / usepmtimer was required was I think fixed in Server 2003 SP2 , and Vista of course do n't have this problem .

It is like claiming Netscape 8 is insecure because it expose you to the bugs of both IE and Firefox .

NEW data has thrown doubt on the strength of Australia 's rebound from the global financial crisis .
Corporate profits and stockpiles slumped sharply in the June quarter , while business lending was still going backwards in July .
On a day when the Chinese sharemarket staged another spectacular plunge amid growing concerns over the strength of China 's recovery , the run of favourable data in Australia hit a hurdle , or several of them , suggesting tomorrow 's national accounts might be more subdued than we had expected .
Yet speculation on an early rise in interest rates only increased after real estate monitor Residex reported that house prices jumped 1.1 per cent in July to a record , under the stimulus of first home buyers grants .
Financial markets have now priced in three rate rises in the next six months , the first in November .
The Reserve Bank board holds its September meeting today , but is expected to keep rates on hold for now .
The Bureau of Statistics yesterday reported that corporate profits slumped 7.8 per cent in the June quarter after seasonal adjustment .
It was their third consecutive quarterly fall , and the steepest yet .
Racing legend Jim Clark won both his world titles with Lotus in 1963 and 1965
Lotus are to return to Formula 1 next season for the first time since 1994 .
The Malaysian - funded outfit have been awarded the final grid spot and join Campos GP , Manor and US F1 as one of four new teams for 2010 .
The FIA has given current team BMW Sauber " 14th place " for next season , meaning they are now first reserves .
However , motorsport 's governing body says it will " consult urgently " with the 10 existing teams to expand the grid from 13 to 14 teams for 2010 .
" The FIA believes that a good case can be made for expanding the grid to 14 teams , " read an FIA statement released on Tuesday .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" It will be consulting urgently with the existing teams regarding the introduction of an appropriate rule change to expand the grid to 28 cars in time for the first Grand Prix in 2010 . "
The Lotus team will initially be based in Norfolk , though its future design , research and development , manufacturing and technical centre will be purpose - built at Malaysia 's Sepang International circuit .
In its new incarnation the team is a partnership between the Malaysian Government and a consortium of Malaysian entrepreneurs .
It will be led by team principal Tony Fernandes , the founder of the Malaysian - based Tune Group , which owns the Air Asia airline .
Mike Gascoyne - who has 20 years ' experience in the sport after working with Jordan , Renault , Toyota , and most recently Force India - returns to F1 as the team 's technical director .
" We are not just a small new team , we have the possibilities to be a very substantial team , " Gascoyne told BBC Sport .
" And the FIA recognise that , combined with the name and that we 're also a team based outside Europe .

" When you look at the calendar now , the centre of F1 is changing .
With all that 's happening in the sport , this is a very good news story for F1 .
" Next year will be a huge challenge we will be releasing the car late , and that has reliability aspects .
But we 'll target being the best of the new cars on the grid and I would hope by mid-season we are challenging the bottom rung of the current teams .
That 's achievable . "
Asked about the exact involvement of Lotus Cars , the original company behind Lotus who are now owned by Malaysian carmaker Proton , Gascoyne added : " That has to be defined and it 's under discussion with Proton and Tony Fernandes .
" I think we 'll be able to clarify that in the coming days . "
A statement from the Malaysian Government read : " The team will announce its two drivers by October 31 2009 .
Currently six local and international drivers have been selected , " said And Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak added : " This is not only a dream , it is a reality .
Malaysia is part of Formula 1 and we are determined to do our best to make our mark in this arena .
" I believe this is a meaningful development that will boost Malaysia 's image . "
606 : DEBATE
It will be wonderful to see the Lotus marque again but the big question is which drivers can they get ?

Just three hours after the Lotus return was confirmed by the FIA on Tuesday , BMW Sauber revealed Swiss - based Qadbak Investments had agreed to buy its team .
The German car manufacturer , which took over Sauber in 2005 , had said it would withdraw from F1 at the end of July , citing " current developments in motorsport " as the reason for their decision .
BMW was the second major manufacturer to announce it was leaving the sport after Honda 's withdrawal eight months earlier .
But the FIA said it had received an " impressive application " from the team despite the uncertainties over its future ownership .
BMW Sauber 's reserve slot means they can fill any vacancy that might occur between now and the start of the 2010 championship .
The organisation behind the new Lotus team have bought the rights to the name Team Lotus - which competed in F1 from 1958 through to 1994 - and have been awarded BMW 's place , also pushing out Spanish outfit Epsilon Euskadi , following an intensive selection and due diligence process conducted by the FIA .
The team won seven constructors ' crowns and six drivers ' championships , including wins by Britons Jim Clark and Graham Hill , during their golden era in the 1960s and ' 70s .
Three - time world champion , the late Ayrton Senna , drove for Lotus for three seasons between 1985 and 1987 - although the team enjoyed limited success during that period .
Lotus withdrew from F1 in 1994 because of financial pressures but remains the fourth most successful constructor of all time .

A 27 - year - old Southeast Portland man who beat his ex-girlfriend and then stabbed her pet fish and left it impaled in her apartment has been sentenced to two years of probation and a psychological evaluation .
An attorney for Donald Earl Fite III said he did n’t want to talk about the details of the assault , but that stabbing the fish was “ a very low point ” in his client ’s life .
" He is absolutely mortified and ashamed about what he did to the fish , " said attorney Tom MacNair today in Multnomah County Circuit Court .
Fite had no criminal history and declined to comment , saying only that his attorney had said it all .
According to an affidavit filed with the court , Sarah Harris had broken up with Fite , but returned to her East Burnside Street apartment in Portland last July 25 to find Fite lying on her bed .
Fite wanted to get back together , but Harris did n't .
When she told him she had plans that evening , Harris refused to let her leave the room she was in , the bathroom , according to the affidavit .
She tried to push past him .
He threw her against a wall .
She again tried to leave , punching him in the nose to get by .
He grabbed her by the hair and threw her against the bathtub – ripping out her hair extensions and causing her to hit her head .
She escaped and called 9 - 1 - 1 from a pay phone .
When she returned with an officer , she discovered her fish , a brilliant purple betta named DeLorean , had been impaled on her wood floor .
It still had a knife sticking through it .
" I started crying hysterically , " said Harris , who did n't attend the hearing but spoke with The Oregonian by phone .
" Donald bought the fish for me , and I 'm sure he knew how much I cared for it . "
Fite admitted to police that he killed the betta , saying , " If she can't have me , then she can't have the fish . "
Fite pleaded guilty to first - degree animal abuse and fourth - degree domestic - violence assault .
In addition to probation and a mental - health evaluation , he must work 80 hours of community service , pay $ 617 in fines and fees and stay away from Harris .
Deputy district attorney Eric Zimmerman told Judge Eric Bergstrom that the victim had requested restitution for an unusual reason – she wanted Fite to pay for a memorial tattoo she plans to get of the fish .
The judge declined to order Fite to pay for the tattoo .
The judge also decided against banning Fite from having contact with fish , saying the stabbing was probably a one - time incident .
Fite misinterpreted what the judge had said , and appeared upset .
" What ?
I 'm not allowed to walk into a pet store ? "
The judge repeated himself , to Fite 's relief .
" I 'm not imposing that condition , " Bergstrom said .

With admirable calm , President Obama has sought to deflect the supercharged politics of race by expressing his optimism about American attitudes and ignoring the most extreme statements by his critics .
For his own sake , as well as the nation ’s , he is wise to give a pass to the likes of Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh .
That is not , however , what they deserve .
The behavior of those media provocateurs over the past few months is almost beyond parody .
They call the president a racist , even though there is no evidence of prejudice on his part and much evidence to the contrary .
They demand that nobody should ever point out racial prejudice , but spend hours on the airwaves making false claims of bias against whites .
And they whine constantly about being called racists , even though the president has never made that accusation against them .
“ You ca n’t get your agenda , ” protested Beck the other day , speaking of the president , “ so you unleash the hounds and point the fingers , and everybody is a racist . ”
That was around the same time Obama ’s spokesman said quite emphatically that the president does not believe his opponents are motivated by racism .
But since Beck and Limbaugh seem to be obsessed with this touchy subject , let ’s examine their record .
It turns out that both established their keen racial sensitivity on air long ago .
Back when Beck was simply a coked - out zoo - style morning talk jock on a Kentucky station — rather than a national political philosopher — he regularly mimicked African - American speech patterns for fun .
“ He used to do a funny ‘ black guy ’ character , really over the top , ” recalls one of his former colleagues , quoted by biographer Alexander Zaitchik in a fascinating Salon profile .
Beck also became a devotee of the Mormon crank author and conspiracy theorist W. Cleon Skousen , whose writings he enthusiastically promotes to this day .
Among Skousen ’s pet theories was that Southern slave owners were actually the victims of the plantation system , which according to him favored the lazy and pampered slaves , whose children he called “ pickaninnies . ”
Like his ultraright friends in the John Birch Society and kindred groups , Skousen was a dedicated foe of civil rights legislation .
Does that mean Beck is a bigot ?
If Obama had ever endorsed the writings of Louis Farrakhan , replete with vile slurs against whites and especially Jews , that would certainly be enough for Beck — who says he believes that the president has “ a deep - seated hatred for white people , or the white culture . ”
That must be why the Obama White House has so many whites of all ethnic and religious backgrounds advising the president , from the Cabinet down .
As for Limbaugh , perhaps nobody remembers the time that he told a black caller to “ take that bone out of your nose ” ; or the time when he said the nonviolent NAACP “ should get a liquor store and practice robberies ” ; or the many times when he would play the “ Movin ’ On Up ” theme from the old “ Jeffersons ” TV show to accompany his commentary about Carol Moseley Braun , the first black woman in the United States Senate .
He used to do mocking bits in black dialect , too .
But who needs to remember those sorry episodes when he continues that ugly pattern on air nearly every day ?
The Limbaugh show reached a new low recently when he began a campaign around a school - bus incident in Belleville , Ill. , in which two black students were videotaped beating up a white kid .
Police authorities first said they believed the assailants were motivated by race , but later said it was just a nasty bullying assault ( for which the two little thugs are now being prosecuted ) .
But Limbaugh could not resist the opportunity to turn that nastiness into something much more dangerous .
“ It ’s Obama ’s America , is it not ?
Obama ’s America — white kids getting beat up on school buses now .
I mean , you put your kids on a school bus , you expect safety , but in Obama ’s America , the white kids now get beat up , with the black kids cheering . ”
In a more reflective mood , he later asked , “ Can this nation really have an African - American president ? ”
Yes , we can — and despite the racial poison spread by Beck and Limbaugh , most Americans are proud that at long last , we do .

Sergey Magnitskiy dies in suspicious circumstances
Sergey Magnitskiy died on 16 November 2009 in a Russian prison .
After testifying about the involvement of Russian Interior Ministry officials in the largest ever theft of Russian state funds , he was illegally arrested and imprisoned by those very same officials in order to silence him .
He had been detained for one year without trial .
To add your condolences please follow this link .
Tribute to Sergey Magnitsky .
Bill Frist never had 60 votes .
Bill Frist never cared .
Republicans ran the Senate as if they owned the place , even when enjoying razor - thin majorities .
Yet when Democrats took the chamber , the first thing Harry Reid did was complain that he could n't do anything because he did n't have 60 votes .
Then voters delivered 59 votes .
And Harry Reid whined that he still could n't do anything .
In fact , nothing would ever get accomplished unless they had 60 , and to do that , they had to bring turncoat Joe Lieberman back into the fold , even though he had spent the previous year making common cause with John McCain and Sarah Palin , even speaking at the Republican National Convention in Minnesota .
You see , we were told , Joe Lieberman is with us on everything except the war !
So we need him for 60 , and when we have 60 , everyone will get ponies !
And if Lieberman strays , why , Evan Bayh said Senate Democrats could punish him !
If he does retain his chairmanship , we still exert oversight over him and control over him .
He does n't have the ability to just do whatever he wants .
The caucus still has the right to remove him from that position at any time if he starts going off on some kind of tangent .
Control him ?
Ha ha ha ha ha ha !
Good thing we never believed his bullshit , because neither Bayh , nor Reid , nor any of the ineffective corporatist Dems would ever let this sort of thing actually happen .
Lieberman knows this , which is why he 's once again making common cause with Republicans .
So once again , Reid is complaining that he does n't have 60 votes , which is why they need to anoint Olympia Snowe as de facto President of the United States .
Maybe SHE will get us to 60 !
But we all know Snowe has no intention of voting for real reform , and yet Reid ( with White House backing ) continue to let themselves get played .
It 's all a farce .
So much for 60 .
Still , do n't ask Harry Reid , Democratic Leader , Senate Leader , and the party 's # 3 leader to actually start leading .
Senator Harry Reid ’s office is now going on record pushing back hard against a campaign by the left to compel him to force Dem Senators into line on health care , with Reid ’s spokesman sending me a statement claiming the idea is unworkable and a non-starter [...]
“ Senator Reid is focused on crafting a health care bill that will overcome a Republican filibuster .
Stripping Democratic Senators of their leadership titles is a decision that would be left up to the Caucus , not Senator Reid .
In light of this reality it ’s unlikely that the Caucus would ever go along with this idea . ”
So that 's that .
The notion of " leading " is clearly a non-starter for Reid , according to his office .
Well , glad Reid 's office has admitted as such .
Time for new leadership .
And take special note of this sentence :
Senator Reid is focused on crafting a health care bill that will overcome a Republican filibuster .
Republican filibuster ?
Democrats have 60 votes .
There is no Republican filibuster , just a Democratic one .
The problem is Reid 's inability to keep his caucus together .
His office can't even be honest about Reid 's leadership failures .
Fucking liars .
I 'll take a Chuck Schumer - run Senate with 57 Democrats ( bye bye Reid , Lieberman , and Lincoln ) than a Harry Reid - run one with 75 Democrats .
Republican members of the Congressional Anti-Terrorism Caucus said the Council on American Islamic Relations ( CAIR ) have tried to plant “ spies ” within key national - security committees in order to shape legislative policy .

House races toward Dems Freedom Caucus members see openings in leadership MORE ( R - Ariz . ) , citing the book Muslim Mafia : Inside the Secret Underworld that ’s Conspiring to Islamize America , called for the House sergeant at arms to investigate whether CAIR had been successful in placing interns on key panels .
The lawmakers are specifically focused on the House Homeland Security Committee , Intelligence Committee and Judiciary Committee .
“ If an organization is connected to or supports terrorists [ and ] is running influence operations or planting spies in key national security - related offices , I think this needs to be made known , ” said Broun , who sits on the Homeland Security Committee .
“ So I join my colleagues here today in calling for action . ”
But the Office of the House sergeant at arms said that it has received no such request from any of the four Republicans and declined to speculate on how a request of that nature would be addressed .
“ We have not received any request at this time , ” said Kerri Hanley , a spokeswoman for the House sergeant at arms office .
“ Until we know of the exact request , a determination cannot be made on how it will be handled . ”
The book , which was written by P. David Gaubatz and Paul Sperry with a foreword by Myrick , is scheduled to be released on Thursday .
A representative of CAIR called the accusations unfounded and worried that they would tarnish the improving relations between Muslim and non-Muslim Americans .
“ God forbid American Muslims take part in the political process and exercise their rights , ” said Ibrahim Hooper , a CAIR spokesman , in a telephone interview .
“ I suppose they ’re going to investigate the Muslim Staffers Association next .
“ If these people were n’t so hate - filled , it would be laughable , but unfortunately they have an audience and , given their positions , it ’s going to get picked up by the hate blogs . ”
While the Republicans said they did not know of specific legislation that CAIR had affected , Franks , a Judiciary Committee member , said he would n’t be surprised if it was trying to amend the Patriot Act .
“ One of the target policies that they might be concerned about is the Patriot Act itself — those things that give us the greatest tools to be able to surveil those conversations outside of this country … and I think organizations like CAIR would like to diminish that . ”
The GOP accusations come as Congress is considering reauthorizing expiring provisions in the Patriot Act , which has been attacked by critics on both the left and the right .

The Republicans also called on the IRS to launch a full investigation into CAIR ’s lobbying activities , “ to judge if they are in violation of their federal nonprofit status . ”
Hooper said that CAIR is in full federal compliance with its status as a 501 ( c ) 3 nonprofit group , and that the group devotes less in terms of resources than the maximum legal limit allowed .
“ We ’ve always stayed within our legal limits , ” he said .
“ If anything , we do n’t have enough staff to lobby as much as we legally can . ”
Gaubatz , the co-author of Muslim Mafia , could not be reached at press time .
On his website , daveg.us , he asks supporters for money to “ legally destroy CAIR . ”
“ CAIR will use their routine and expected ‘ smear ’ campaign to discredit me , ” Gaubatz wrote on Wednesday morning .
“ It will not work .
I have one foot on CAIR .
I tell the truth .
They simply lie and we have the proof .
“ Please support me in these eforts [ sic ] to help shut this terror supporting organization down .
donate all weekend .
We need to raise $ 25,000 to put more research in the field and to bring more intelligence agianst [ sic ] them …
If you want to protect your children and America , then help me now . ”
Citing the book , Myrick requested that the Justice Department share with all lawmakers and their chiefs of staff an executive summary of the findings that led the department to name CAIR as a co-conspirator in an anti-terrorism case .
She said the Justice Department identified CAIR as an “ un- indicted co-conspirator ” in the Holy Land Foundation case in Dallas , which concluded with the sentencing of the two founders of the foundation to life in prison for funneling $ 12 million to Hamas , which the U.S. has labeled a terrorist organization .
“ We need to know that information so that we can discern whether we want to take interns associated with that group into our office , ” said Myrick .
Earlier this year , the FBI cut off communication with CAIR out of concern that the group had ties with Hamas .
Hooper said that CAIR welcomed the scrutiny from the Republican lawmakers and that he was disappointed to see them associate with Gaubatz , whom he called a “ hate - monger . ”
“ It ’s a shame to see elected officials take part in a smear campaign based on bigotry , ” Hooper said
A call for comment from the Justice Department was not returned .
What if we paved over the whole state of Wisconsin ?
Actually , we already have .
According to recent Federal Highway Administration figures , the United States has close to 240 million motor vehicles - almost 40 million more cars than licensed drivers - and just under 4 million miles of paved roads for them to run on .
All told , some 61,000 square miles of the United States - an area a little smaller than the Badger State - is solidly paved over , either with roads or with parking .
And , of course , there 's always more pavement on the way .
We were n't always an asphalt nation .
What happened ?
There 's plenty of blame to go around , from pressure by vested interests , such as oil and automobile companies , to political pork barreling to plain old infatuation with our four - wheeled friends .
But the most disgraceful portion of blame for our autocentric landscape goes to people who should know better : our own city planners .
For the past six decades , they 've swallowed the premise of the asphalt nation whole .
It 's city planners who 've long uncritically accepted the notion that cars should be the focus of our urban design , turning the built environment into one big playground for motor vehicles .
It 's city planners who 've allowed draconian parking requirements , rather than intelligent land use , to determine what gets built - a policy that literally puts humans second to their cars .
But do n't take my word for it .
In his book " The High Cost of Free Parking , " UCLA urban planning Professor Donald Shoup flatly states :
" Parking requirements create great harm :
They subsidize cars , distort transportation choices , warp urban form , increase housing costs , burden low - income households , debase urban design , damage the economy , and degrade the environment . "
We make these sacrifices to accommodate a machine that , despite having been civilized a bit by electronics , essentially remains an early 20th century - style , oil - burning , exhaust - spewing contraption .
The legacy of this long reign is an utterly car - centered environment of huge , signal - clogged boulevards and buildings adrift in vast oceans of parking .
But this kind of autocentric design is n't just ugly and wasteful , it also creates a vicious planning cycle .
In order to kowtow to all those cars , we have to build everything on a superhuman scale , which in turn uses more land , which in turn lowers density and creates sprawl .
And once density gets down to the level of the average suburb , you simply can't walk anywhere anymore .
Your kids can't walk to school , and you can't walk to work or to the shopping center , because everything is spread so far apart .
The result is that we 're ever more beholden to our cars to get anywhere .
If all this seems perfectly normal , it 's only because most of us do n't have any alternative .
On the other hand , in most European cities , not to speak of Asian ones , close - knit , easily walkable neighborhoods packed with urban amenities are the rule .
It 's not that their planners are any smarter than ours .
Rather , it 's just the natural result of humanly scaled urban design that predates cars by many centuries and that will doubtless outlast them by many centuries as well .
Whether our own cities will outlive cars is n't all that clear yet .
Los Angeles County Dist .
Atty .
Steve Cooley said Thursday he will prosecute medical marijuana dispensaries for over - the - counter sales , targeting a practice that has become commonplace under an initiative approved by California voters more than a decade ago .
“ The vast , vast , vast majority , about 100 % , of dispensaries in Los Angeles County and the city are operating illegally , they are dealing marijuana illegally , according to our theory , ” he said .
“ The time is right to deal with this problem . ”
Cooley and Los Angeles City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich recently concluded that state law bars sales of medical marijuana , an opinion that could spark a renewed effort by law enforcement across the state to rein in the use of marijuana .
It comes as polls show a majority of state voters back legalization of marijuana , and supporters are working to place the issue on the ballot next year .
The district attorney ’s office is investigating about a dozen dispensaries , following police raids , and is considering filing felony charges against one that straddles the Los Angeles - Culver City line .

“ We have our strategy and we think we are on good legal ground , ” Cooley said .
Medical marijuana advocates say the prosecutors are misinterpreting the law .
“ I ’m confident that they are not right , ” said Joe Elford , chief counsel for Americans for Safe Access .
“ If they are right , it would mean that thousands of seriously ill Californians for whom the Compassionate Use Act was intended to help would not be able to get the medicine that they need . ”
Law enforcement officials have been frustrated by the explosion in the number of dispensaries in Southern California , arguing that most are for - profit enterprises that violate the 1996 voter initiative legalizing medical marijuana and the 2003 state law permitting collective cultivation .
Cooley ’s announcement , coming at a news conference that followed a training session he and Trutanich conducted for narcotics officers , dramatically raises the stakes .
Advertisement
In the city of Los Angeles , some estimates put the number of dispensaries as high as 800 .
The city allowed 186 to remain open under its 2007 moratorium , but hundreds of others opened in violation of the ban while the city did nothing to shut them down .
In August , Cooley and Sheriff Lee Baca sent a letter to all mayors and police chiefs in the county , saying that they believed over - the - counter sales were illegal and encouraging cities to adopt permanent bans on dispensaries .
Mark Kleiman , a professor of public policy at UCLA and an expert on drug policy , was not surprised that local prosecutors had decided to attack the rapid proliferation of marijuana stores .
“ I think it ’s a natural response to the rather flagrant marketing practices of a bunch of the dispensaries .
The medical veneer has been wearing thinner and thinner , ” he said .
“ I ’ve always wondered why those things were legal when they did n’t look legal to me . ”
Advertisement
Cooley said he believes that under state law , collectives must raise their own marijuana and can only recoup their costs .
“ That ’s absolutely legal , ” he said .
“ We ’re going to respect that . ”
But he said none of them currently do that .
The district attorney ’s warning could make the situation more chaotic in Los Angeles , where the City Council has struggled for two years to devise an ordinance to control the distribution of medical marijuana .
In addition to prosecuting dispensaries , Cooley said he would consider going after doctors who write medical marijuana recommendations for healthy people .
Medical marijuana critics argue that some doctors freely recommend the drug to people who are not ill .

Medical marijuana advocates celebrated a brief thaw in the enforcement climate after the Obama administration signaled earlier this year that it would not prosecute collectives that followed state law .
That spurred many entrepreneurs to open dispensaries in Los Angeles .
As stores popped up near schools and parks , neighborhood activists reacted with outrage and police took notice .
Councilman Dennis Zine , a key player on the issue at L.A. City Hall , welcomed Cooley ’s decision to prosecute dispensaries .
“ There are many that are operating illegally and it ’s not a secret , ” he said , adding that he believes “ a few ” collectives in the city are operating legally .
Anticipating that police departments will ramp up raids on dispensaries , medical marijuana advocates reacted with dismay to Cooley ’s announcement .
“ What we ’ll see is a big disruption , ” said Don Duncan , the California director for Americans for Safe Access .
He called Cooley ’s decision “ incredible ” and said , “ It certainly sounds scary . ”
Advertisement
Duncan acknowledged that many dispensaries do not follow the law and urged Cooley and Trutanich to focus exclusively on them .
“ You do n’t have to cast a net over the entire community , you can target the problem people and not take this extreme adversarial position , ” he said .
“ Some good people are going to be caught in the crossfire . ”
About 100 medical marijuana patients , activists and dispensary owners protested on a sidewalk outside the Montebello Country Club , where about 150 prosecutors and narcotics officers met .
Motorists repeatedly honked and shook their fists in support as they rolled by , triggering cheers from the crowd .
Barry Kramer , the operator of California Patients Alliance , a collective on Melrose Avenue , said many dispensaries have responsibly regulated themselves for years in the vacuum left by the City Council ’s inaction .
“ I feel like that gets lost , ” he said .
“ It ’s frustrating to get painted with one brush by the city . ”
Advertisement
Kramer said he believed that dispensaries would continue to operate .
“ People have found ways around marijuana laws for as long as there have been marijuana laws , ” he said .
But he also said that stepped - up prosecutions could resuscitate the criminal market : “ Things will go underground .
We ’ll see a lot more crime . ”
When Californians voted for Proposition 215 in 1996 , they made it legal for patients with a doctor ’s recommendation and their caregivers to possess and raise pot for the patient ’s medical use .
In 2003 , the Legislature allowed patients and caregivers “ collectively or cooperatively to cultivate marijuana for medical purposes ” but said they could not do it for profit .
Advertisement
Cooley and Trutanich , after reviewing a state Supreme Court decision from last year , have concluded that the law protects collectives from prosecution only in the cultivation of marijuana , not for sales or distribution .
Medical marijuana advocates , however , note that the state currently requires dispensaries to collect sales taxes on marijuana , and that guidelines drawn up by the attorney general conclude that “ a properly organized and operated collective or cooperative that dispenses medical marijuana through a storefront may be lawful . ”
The guidelines allow collectives to take costs into account but do not deal directly with over - the - counter sales .
Jacob Appelsmith , special assistant attorney general , said Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown talked to Cooley on Thursday .
“ Our staffs are continuing to meet about these issues , ” he said .

There 's nothing good in Genesis .
RealNetworks yesterday launched its Rhapsody music - streaming application for the iPhone and iPod Touch , after what the company said was a " smooth process " of back - and - forth with Apple .
Apple 's approval of Rhapsody marks the first time the company has allowed an on - demand music streaming subscription - based service on its iconic iPhone in the U.S .
The application , which is a free download , lets Rhapsody customers listen to any of the service 's 8 - million - plus tracks the service offers , call up saved albums and tune into any of Rhapsody 's ready - to - go playlists .
Users can stream music to both the iPhone and the iPod Touch via a Wi -Fi connection ; iPhone users can also connect via AT&T's EDGE and 3G data networks in the U.S.
Only people who subscribe to the $ 14.99 - per-month Rhapsody to Go plan can use the iPhone / iPod Touch application , however .
Customers paying $ 12.99 per month for the Rhapsody Unlimited plan are ineligible .
RealNetworks expects to ship a second edition of the software by the end of the year that will allow users to cache tracks on the iPhone or iPod Touch for later offline playback .
Rhapsody to Go already supports that functionality on some Windows Media Player - based devices from vendors such as SanDisk and Philips .
" That 's definitely our intent , " said RealNetworks ' spokesman Ryan Luckin today .
" We 're also working on audio improvements , and hard at work to bring Rhapsody to other platforms .
We 'd like to bring the same thing to Android phones , for example , " he said , referring to the Google operating system that some handset makers have adopted .
Rhapsody streams 64 K bps - quality tracks to the iPhone and iPod Touch , half the audio quality of the 128 Kbps - encoded tracks that the service streams to subscribers on the desktop .
" That 's a trade - off , " Luckin acknowledged , noting that higher - quality tracks put a greater burden on AT&T 's wireless network when iPhone owners are n't within range of a wireless hot spot .
To tempt others to try the service , RealNetworks is offering a seven - day trial that allows full access to Rhapsody 's library .
Because of hardware limitations , Rhapsody wo n't play music in the background while the iPhone or iPod Touch is being used for other tasks , such as browsing or making phone calls .
During Computerworld 's brief testing , Rhapsody automatically dropped out when an incoming phone call rang , then popped back up after the call was completed .
Although some were expecting Apple to block Rhapsody from the iPhone based on the company 's treatment of Google Voice , the process went pretty smoothly , said Luckin .
" Apple came back with requests for a few minor tweaks , " he said , " but from there it was approved .
Apple was very responsive . "
From submission to approval was less than a month , Luckin said .
Other developers , however , have n't had as easy a time as RealNetworks .
Google 's integrated telephone service , Google Voice , for example , remains in limbo .
Last month , in a reply to an FCC inquiry launched at the end of July , Apple denied that it had rejected Google Voice and said it was still " pondering " the submission .
Previously , Apple has told developers that it rejected their applications for the iPhone because they duplicated one or more built - in features of the iPhone or the iPod Touch .
Both devices link to Apple 's iTunes music store to download tracks , and they play tunes synchronized from a user 's collection on a Mac or PC .
However , Apple does not offer a subscription - based music streaming service .
Rhapsody for the iPhone and iPod can be downloaded directly to the devices , or to a Mac or PC , then pushed to the smartphone or music player at the next sync session .
Joe Biden to Solar Power USA With P.A.C.E. ‘ Recovery through Retrofit ’ Berkeley First Municipal Financing
October 21st , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
Vice President Joe Biden just revealed a plan to make Berkeley First available nationwide .
Yesterday at his Middle Class Task Force meeting Biden proposed the way to make solar roofs easy for everyone to afford with virtually free solar panels .
If you now pay your current electricity bill and own a home , that ’s literally all it takes to go solar under municipal tax assessment financing .
That ’s because his plan ; detailed in Recovery Through Retrofit simply makes the very successful Berkeley First municipal tax assessment financing a Federal program , called PACE Program ( Property Assessed Clean Energy ) , funded nationwide through the Recovery Act .
The plan from Biden ’s very practical Middle Class Task Force on Environmental Quality addresses and solves two issues :
1 . That homeowners who might move in a few years do n’t retrofit with solar power .
So this loan attaches to the home , not the borrower , and is passed along to the next buyers for 20 years till paid off .
2 . That only a few rich cities can muster the bonds needed to offer the program .
When I asked my Mayor why we were not joining with our neighbor Berkeley to offer Municipal Tax Assessment Financing , I was told “ because we ca n’t get the bond financing ” .
Sonoma , San Francisco and these cities have followed in Berkeley ’s footsteps .
Biden ’s plan addresses that financial barrier by securing funding from the Recovery Act to provide cities with the wherewithall to make free solar power available to homeowners .
The risk is low .
Most homeowners pay the electricity bill .
This simply replaces that bill with another for the same amount or less .
The next buyer would pay the same set rate for the solar that stays the same , instead of electricity rates that continue to rise an average of 6 % a year .
Berkeley First was a pioneering new way to make solar affordable .
In a small pilot program – that sold out in the first nine minutes (! ) 40 homeowners in Berkeley won the chance to put solar on their houses and pay it back over twenty years through a property tax assessment added to their homeowners property tax .
In practice , that meant their household expenses would really not change at all , but they would be paying down solar instead of paying electricity bills monthly .
The $ 100 or $ 200 that they used to send to PG&E would just get added to the mortgage bill each month instead ; to pay down their solar roof .
I saw first hand how Berkeley First truly enabled anyone to go solar , it was so affordable .
I did solar estimates in the East Bay during that time and worked with people who ’d managed to snare a place in Berkeley First .
There were no nasty bank loan applications with those installs .
Literally , no money changed hands .
So I really believe this would be the way to get ‘ shovel - ready ’ green jobs projects out almost instantly and clean the nations carbon emissions very quickly .
Cities are ready .
Homeowners are ready .
Joe Biden : let it roll !

Harmonix employs 320 people , and is responsible for the creation of Guitar Hero and Rock Band , two of the videogame industry ’s most successful game franchises .
Yet , as founding members Alex Rigopulos and Eran Egozy reveal , the musical duo had a very rough start , along with numerous failures that ultimately showed them the road to success .
The two met as graduate students at MIT ’s Media Lab , Eran an Electrical Engineering / Computer Science major at MIT , and Alex a Music Composition major .
The two first built an application where people could use a flight simulator joystick to compose and output music on the fly .
In order to continue doing what they loved , they created Harmonix using funds from their friends and family totaling $ 100,000 .
For five years , the group operated without generating any revenue , and a failed attempt at making a karaoke game also made them realize that they did n’t really understand the draw of karaoke games ( or music games for that matter ) .
Alex explains how this came about :
“ I was watching people interact with our product , and the realization came crashing down on me — we had spent 18 months on a music system that was fundamentally flawed .
Karaoke is n’t about personal expression .
It ’s about people reproducing the songs they know as accurately as they can . ”
This realization gave them the drive to make Frequency and Amplitude , two “ electronic rhythm - action games ” that were built very well but also failed to become big wins for the company .
The incredibly addictive music titles became underground hits , but nothing more .
And the reason really was that people did n’t understand what the games were about at face value .

“ The problem of writing about comedy is that it ’s like trying to hold a gas , ” Conan O’Brien told John Ortved during an interview for “ The Simpsons : An Uncensored , Unauthorized History ” ( Faber and Faber ) .
“ The tighter you squeeze , the more it dissipates . ”
Despite that warning — and the refusal of many key figures behind the series to cooperate with him — Mr. Ortved set out to write an inside look at the longest - running comedy series in American television history , which has just begun its 21st season .
Mr. Ortved , 29 , a self - described “ comedy nerd , ” who says he likes to laugh “ more than the average person , ” first pitched the idea of an oral history of the show when he was a 26 - year - old editorial associate at Vanity Fair .
” ‘ The Simpsons ’ has been so influential that it is difficult to find a strain of television comedy that does not contain its bloodline , ” Mr. Ortved said .
Three years , 80 on - the - record interviews and one Vanity Fair article later , Mr. Ortved has produced a 300 - page combination of juicy entertainment gossip , rich television history and notes from a disenchanted lover .
Mr. Ortved recently spoke about the challenges of writing the book , the show ’s legacy , Spider Pig and the possibility of a Simpsons Land theme park .
Have your own questions for Mr. Ortved ?
Submit them here .
Q .
Some of the biggest players in the show ’s history — Matt Groening , James L. Brooks — would not talk to you for the Vanity Fair article or for the book .
How big a challenge was that ?
A .
The advantage was that it was kind of a crash course in investigative journalism .
It was hard , but it also weirdly worked to my advantage .
It would have been wonderful to interview Matt Groening , James L. Brooks , but frankly , they ’ve been interviewed 50 times about “ The Simpsons ” over the past 20 years .
What new were they going to tell me ?
I mean , I would be insane not to want to interview them .
But not having that option , I had to start digging , and the advantage there is that by them not cooperating , I found tons of sources and background that I might not have found if they had cooperated .

Q .
Why an oral history ?
A .
Even before I knew this became “ unauthorized , ” I knew it was a story with a lot of voices in it , and with something as contentious as a collaborative creative project , sometimes the best and most objective way to display the different sides of that story is through an oral history .
Outside of that , I am a fan of the form .
“ Edie : American Girl ” [ about Edie Sedgwick ] and “ Please Kill Me ” [ a history of punk music ] are two of my favorite histories , period , never mind that they are oral histories .
Q .
Who was your favorite interview ?
A .
Conan O’Brien [ a writer and producer from 1991 - 1993 ] was one of the best interviews I ever had .
He speaks in perfect paragraphs — it is remarkable — and everything he says is funny .
The bummer about interviewing him , is that of course I am such a little comedy nerd , I was trying to make him laugh and I did not make him laugh .
Q .
Talk a little about the “ Simpsons ” - Fox relationship .
People often point out that it is interesting that a show that was initially criticized by the right ( most notably George H. Bush during the 1992 Republican national convention ) has run for so long on Rupert Murdoch ’s Fox network .
A .
The most telling anecdote I have is that one of the people I sat down to interview was Rupert Murdoch , and I asked him , “ Rupert , how much money has ‘ The Simpsons ’ made for you ? ”
And he just sat back , smiled and was like , “ Let ’s just say it ’s a lot . ”
Q .
You make a number of references in the book to the decline in quality of the show .
Have you ever heard of Fox or the folks behind the show pulling the plug at some point soon ?
A .
In terms of its spiral , to be fair to the writers , there ’s only so much you can do with a set of characters .
I mean , 20 years ?
I do n’t know how they do it .
But if they ’re still trying to break ground , they should have canned it 10 years ago .
William P. O’Donnell / The New York Times
But I do n’t see them ending it anytime soon unless it becomes unprofitable .
They just opened “ The Simpsons ” ride at Universal Studios , and I see a trend in that way .
In the interviews I conducted , someone compared Matt Groening to Walt Disney .
“ The Simpsons ” is a brand at this point that is as recognizable or getting to be as recognizable as Mickey Mouse and Disney , and I do n’t know why they ca n’t have a Simpsons Land at some point .
Q .
What did you think of the movie ?
A .
It was 90 minutes of throwaway jokes .
It was about as good as a very good episode in the later seasons , but I do n’t think it worked .
Its kind of shocking to me that that group of writers could n’t come up with something better .
I mean the final scene in the movie literally involved a ticking time bomb .
I think that ’s what happens at screenwriting class at the Y .
The funniest stuff involved the pig .
That ’s Homer at his very best : Homer becoming absorbed with something ridiculous .
Whether it ’s a trampoline or a pig — or sugar , there ’s one where he gets involved with sugar — that stuff tends to be the best .
Q .
“ The Simpsons ” fought a pretty long , disappointing battle with the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences for a chance to be nominated for outstanding comedy series .
Do you think people behind the show were upset by the “ Family Guy ” Emmy nomination ?
A .
I find it funny .
I ca n’t speak to what they thought of it .
James L. Brooks is probably rolling his eyes , the guy has so many Oscars and Emmys , he ’s probably like , “ Who cares ? ” “ The Simpsons ” deserved the Emmy back in 1992 , when it was the fastest , funniest thing on TV .
But any head - slapping that would had gone on over the [ Family Guy ] nomination would have happened 15 years ago .
Now , “ The Simpsons ” would never stand a chance .
Q .
Who ’s your favorite character ?
A .
Good Lord .
I mean , obviously it ’s Homer , but I think that ’s everyone ’s favorite .
There ’s something about Homer that speaks to — well , men especially — but everyone .
In the canon of Western entertainment , people will look back and see Homer Simpson as this perfectly malleable American stereotype .
Q .
If you had to pick one episode as your favorite , could you ?
A .
It ’s a paradox :
If you watch your favorite one over and over , it becomes not your favorite , but the Monorail episode and the Burns bear episode is as good I think as that show ever got .
Q .
Are you one of those people who walk around quoting “ The Simpsons ” all the time ?
A .
Yes , I would always walk around and annoy people and say “ Simpsons ” things to them , but I have nowhere near enough cool or comedic timing to get the line out without giggling .
Q .
Give me your three favorite lines .
A .
This is really hard .
O.K. , No. 1 : . “ Does whiskey count as beer ? ” — Homer ( after being asked by a TV announcer , “ Are you on your third beer of the evening ? ” )
No .
2 . “ That man is my exact double … that dog has a puffy tail !
[ Chasing the dog ]
Heehee .
Puff ! ” — Homer ( on seeing a man who looks as exactly the same as him , lying bloodied outside Moe ’s tavern , then being distracted by a dog with a puffy tail ) .
No .
3 . “ Me fail English ?
That ’s unpossible . ” – Ralph Wiggum
Q .
How would you describe “ The Simpsons ” in a sentence to someone who has never heard of it ?
A .
It ’s a cartoon sitcom about a family and their town that better than any live - action show satirized the American way of life .

BOSTON -- President Barack Obama and his congressional allies have made insuring nearly all Americans a major goal of overhauling the nation 's health - care system .
One of their toughest challenges will be trying to cover people like Ron Norton of Worcester , Mass .
Mr. Norton , 49 years old , is an adjunct professor at a local community college who earns about $ 40,000 a year .
He 's also one of roughly 200,000 Massachusetts residents who remain uninsured despite a state law requiring residents to have health insurance .
" I can't use up all of my savings just to buy mandatory insurance , " Mr. Norton says .
It 's like penalizing " the homeless for refusing to buy a mansion . "
As lawmakers hammer out legislation aiming to extend coverage to the country 's 46 million uninsured , one of the most sweeping proposals has so far stoked relatively little debate : a requirement that nearly all Americans carry health insurance , much like drivers are required to have car insurance .
All of the major health bills winding through Congress feature a so - called individual mandate similar to the one in Massachusetts .
Mr. Obama supported the idea in his speech to Congress last week .
Such a mandate , proponents argue , is necessary to keep premiums affordable :
The healthy , who are relatively cheap to cover , help pay for the sick .
A growing number of people are taking LSD and other psychedelic drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy to help them cope with a variety of conditions including anorexia nervosa , cluster headaches and chronic anxiety attacks .
The emergence of a community that passes the drugs between users on the basis of friendship , support and need – with money rarely involved – comes amid a resurgence of research into the possible therapeutic benefits of psychedelics .
This is leading to a growing optimism among those using the drugs that soon they may be able to obtain medicines based on psychedelics from their doctor , rather than risk jail for taking illicit drugs .
Among those in Britain already using the drugs and hoping for a change in the way they are viewed is Anna Jones ( not her real name ) , a 35 - year - old university lecturer , who takes LSD once or twice a year .
She fears that without an occasional dose she will go back to the drinking problem she left behind 14 years ago with the help of the banned drug .
LSD , the drug synonymous with the 1960s counter - culture , changed her life , she says .
" For me it was the catalyst to give up destructive behaviour – heavy drinking and smoking .
As a student I used to drink two or three bottles of wine , two or three days a week , because I did n't have many friends and did n't feel comfortable in my own skin .
" Then I took a hit of LSD one day and did n't feel alone any more .
It helped me to see myself differently , increase my self - confidence , lose my desire to drink or smoke and just feel at one with the world .
I have n't touched alcohol or cigarettes since that day in 1995 and am much happier than before . "
Many others are using the drugs to deal with chronic anxiety attacks brought on by terminal illness such as cancer .
Research was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s into psychedelics .
In some places they were even used as a treatment for anxiety , depression and addiction .
But a backlash against LSD – owing to concerns that the powerful hallucinogen was becoming widespread as a recreational drug , and fear that excessive use could trigger mental health conditions such as schizophrenia – led to prohibition of research in the 1970s .
Under the 1971 Misuse of Drugs
Act it is classified as a Class A , schedule 1 substance – which means not only is LSD considered highly dangerous , but it is deemed to have no medical research value .
Now , though , distinguished academics and highly respected institutions are looking again at whether LSD and other psychedelics might help patients .
Psychiatrist Dr John Halpern , of Harvard medical school in the US , found that almost all of 53 people with cluster headaches who illegally took LSD or psilocybin , the active compound in magic mushrooms , obtained relief from the searing pain .
He and an international team have also begun investigating whether 2 - Bromo - LSD , a non-psychedelic version of LSD known as BOL , can help ease the same condition .
Studies into how the drug may be helping such people are also being carried out in the UK .
Amanda Feilding is the director of the Oxford - based Beckley Foundation , a charitable trust that investigates consciousness , its altered states and the effects of psychedelics and meditation .
She is a key figure in the revival of scientific interest in psychedelics and expresses her excitement about the initial findings of two overseas studies with which her foundation is heavily involved .
" One , at the University of California in Berkeley , was the first research into LSD to get approval from regulators and ethics bodies since the 1970s , " she said .
Those in the study are the first to be allowed to take LSD legally in decades as part of research into whether it aids creativity .
" LSD is a potentially very valuable substance for human health and happiness . "
The other is a Swiss trial in which the drug is give alongside psychotherapy to people who have a terminal condition to help them cope with the profound anxiety brought on by impending death .
" If you handle LSD with care , it is n't any more dangerous than other therapies , " said Dr Peter Gasser , the psychiatrist leading the trial .
At Johns Hopkins University in Washington , another trial is examining whether psilocybin can aid psychotherapy for those with chronic substance addiction who have not been helped by more conventional treatment .
Professor Colin Blakemore , a former chief executive of the Medical Research Council , said the class - A status of psychedelics such as LSD should not stop them being explored as potential therapies .
" No drug is completely safe , and that includes medical drugs as well as illegal substances , " he said .
" But we have well - developed and universally respected methods of assessing the balance of benefit and harm for new medicines .
" If there are claims of benefits from substances that are not regulated medicines – even including illegal drugs – it is important that they should be tested as thoroughly for efficacy and safety as any new conventional drug . "
Past reputations may make it hard to get approval for psychedelic medicines , according to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .
" The known adverse effect profiles of psychedelic drugs would have to be considered very carefully in the risk / benefit analysis before the drugs may be approved for medicinal use , " said a spokeswoman .
" These products , if approved , are likely to be classified as a prescription - only medicine and also likely to remain on the dangerous drug list , which means that their supply would be strictly controlled . "
British sports car manufacturer Ultima is claiming to have beaten the time set by Michael Schumacher in his Ferrari FXX around the Top Gear test track .
In a privately conducted but independently verified test , an Ultima GTR720 , powered by a 720 bhp Chevrolet V8 , lapped the Dunsfold aerodrome circuit in 1 min 9.9sec , beating the 1 min 10.7sec time set by seven - times world champion Schumacher in his £ 1 million trackday - only FXX .

An Ultima spokesman said Top Gear had ignored repeated requests to feature its cars , so the private test session was organised instead .
The GTR720 had been optimised for the circuit , but the spokesman said it was still completely road - legal , unlike the FXX .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Car dealership operator Penske Automotive Group announced on Wednesday that it has cancelled plans to acquire General Motors ' Saturn unit .
As a result , GM said it will wind down the brand and dealer network , potentially putting 13,000 Saturn dealership jobs at risk .
The announcement comes nearly four months after Penske agreed to buy the rights to the 19 - year old brand from GM when the automaker was in bankruptcy .
As part of the deal , GM would have continued making Saturn 's three best - selling models -- the Aura sedan , as well as the Vue and Outlook cross - over SUVs -- for the rest of this year and next .
Penske , which would have been the distributor but not the manufacturer of the vehicles , would have sold the cars on behalf of GM .
Penske said it would find another third - party manufacturer to make new Saturns in 2011 .
But negotiations with another , unnamed manufacturer fell through after an agreement was rejected by that manufacturer 's board , according to Penske .
According to a report in the Wall Street Journal , the manufacturer in question is Renault .
" Without that agreement , the company has determined that the risks and uncertainties related to the availability of future products prohibit the company from moving forward with this transaction , " the company said in a statement .
End of a brand
As a result , GM said it would begin to wind down the brand and its roughly 350 dealerships nationwide .
Penske 's deal with GM was expected to be completed in October .
" Today 's disappointing news comes at a time when we'd hoped for a successful launch of the Saturn brand into a new chapter , " said GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson in a statement .
" We will be working closely with our dealers to ensure Saturn customers are cared for as we transition them to other GM dealers in the months ahead . "
A spokesman for GM said the broken negotiations with Penske would have " no anticipated impact " on plant closures or job losses .
GM makes Saturns at plants in Fairfax , Kan. , Lansing Mich . and Ramos , Mexico , all of which also make other GM brands , so GM does n't expect that Saturn 's closure will affect employment levels at those plants .
" In all three cases where [ Saturn ] products are produced , there are other products , and GM will shift resources to those , " said the company spokesman .
The automaker said Saturn owners will still be able to have their cars serviced at GM dealerships after Saturn is shuttered .
A tough job
Some experts were skeptical about the risks inherent to Penske 's deal with GM when it was first announced back in June .
They argued that Saturn had led the auto industry with customer satisfaction , but that the brand sold poorly because the underlying car was n't great .
As a result , auto industry experts said Penske had its work cut out for it in finding a manufacturer who could make a great car for the Saturn brand .
" The Saturn dealership network represented a unique opportunity for Penske , " said Jeremy Anwyl , CEO of Edmunds.com .
" The risk was sourcing product and that proved to be too much to overcome to complete the deal . "
Penske ( PAG , Fortune 500 ) is owned by former race car driver Roger Penske , who owns NASCAR and IndyCar racing teams and distributes Daimler AG 's Smart cars in the United States .
Shares of the auto dealer fell 10 % after hours .

The Coen Brothers , Joel and Ethan , have gained an entirely new level of respect and appreciation as filmmakers over the last few years thanks to their Oscar - winning adaptation of Cormac McCarthy ’s No Country for Old Men and last year ’s box office hit Burn After Reading .
Having their names attached to a movie called True Grit has gotten a lot of interest because the 1969 John Wayne movie of the same name is a popular Western .
In fact , the Coens have decided to go back to the Charles Portis novel of the same name to create their own movie based on it .
ComingSoon.net had a chance to interview the Coens with a small group of journalists for their new movie A Serious Man and eventually , they were asked about the Western .
“ We did see it as kids .
I do n’t know if Joel ’s seen it since , ” Ethan said once the movie was mentioned .
“ It made very little impression on me , the movie .
We subsequently both read the book and the book made a huge impression and I guess that ’s kind of why we ’re interested in doing the movie . ”
“ It ’s not a great movie but it is a great book actually , ” his brother continued .
“ It ’s not really a remake , it ’s an adaptation , ” Ethan admitted to which Joel added , “ Yeah , we were trying to figure out what it was the other day , too .
What do you call it ? ”
They ’re hoping that this project will be next although they ’re not sure and are hoping that it will get done in the spring .
Despite there having been word out of Toronto that Jeff Bridges aka “ The Dude ” from The Big Lebowski was the frontrunner for the John Wayne role in the new movie , the brothers remained coy about confirming that , merely saying , “ We ’re talking to somebody . ”
Look for our full interview with the Coens plus an exclusive interview with the stars of their new movie A Serious Man closer to the film ’s limited release on October 2 .
Trailer for Toy Story 3 .
The creators of the beloved Toy Story films re-open the toy box and bring moviegoers back to the delightful world of Woody , Buzz and our favorite gang of toy characters in Toy Story 3 .
No toy gets left behind .
Tom Hanks and Tim Allen ( Woody and Buzz ) recorded their lines together for Toy Story 3 , after having done so for the previous Toy Story installments .
This is rarely done in voice over work .
Once again , John Morris returns to voice the character of Andy .
He has been Andy 's voice throughout all the Toy Story movies , but a substitute had to be used to voice younger Andy in flashbacks during Toy Story 3 , since Morris ' voice is broken .
Look out for Sid Phillips , the antagonist from the original Toy Story movie , making an appearance in Toy Story 3 as a garbage man .
Wondering why Toy Story 3 took so long to come together ?
Well , for a start , there are 302 characters in the film , and Ken alone wears 21 different outfits !
The toys are back in town !
There are few movies more enjoyable than Toy Story , and its sequel , Toy Story 2 , is one of those rare instances where a franchise absolutely nails it and produces a sequel of equal standing , if not even better than the original .
Now , we meet up with Andy 's toys , including Buzz , Woody , Rex , Hamm and Mr Potato Head , as Andy prepares to leave for college .
Understandably , the toys are worried for their fate so rather than risk being thrown out in the trash , they decide to donate themselves to daycare .
We all know how brutal young kids can be , right ?
Especially when they move in a pack .
This Toy Story 3 trailer gives a fair hint at what our toys are subjected to but it gets even worse when they discover an underground gang run by mobster boss Lotso ' Huggin Bear .
The question is ; if Buzz , Woody and the gang can ever escape Sunnyside daycare , what awaits them on the outside now that Andy is all grown up ?
As the trailer suggests , Toy Story 3 is the perfect continuation of a franchise that most of us have grown up with .
It features all the characters we love , being just as hilarious and lovable as always , as well as some brand new ones too .
You will laugh , you will cry ( a lot ) and you will love every single second .
Bush 's Interrogators Stressed Nudity The CIA shared with George W. Bush ’s Justice Department the details of how an interrogation strategy – with an emphasis on forced nudity and physical abuse – could train prisoners in “ learned helplessness ” and demonstrate “ the complete control of Americans . ”

The 19 - page document , entitled “ Background Paper on CIA ’s Combined Use of Interrogation Techniques ” and dated Dec. 30 , 2004 , contains repeated references to keeping suspected al - Qaeda captives – called “ high - value detainees ” or HVDs – naked as part of the strategy for breaking down their resistance .
The first of several “ specific conditioning interrogation techniques ” lists “ Nudity .
The HVD ’s clothes are taken and he remains nude until the interrogators provide clothes to him . ”
[ Underline in original . ]
The CIA said the prisoner is kept nude ( or occasionally dressed in a diaper ) while being subjected to other “ conditioning techniques , ” sleep deprivation and a bland diet of Ensure .
Nudity continues while interrogators apply other more aggressive techniques designed to emphasize a prisoner ’s helplessness .
The background paper , which was prepared for the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel and released last month in response to an ACLU lawsuit , described in bureaucratic wording the process used to interrogate a suspected terrorist after his capture and “ rendition ” to a CIA - run “ black site . ”
“ During the flight , the detainee is securely shackled and is deprived of sight and sound through the use of blindfolds , earmuffs , and hoods , ” the report said .
“ There is no interaction with the HVD during this rendition movement except for periodic , discreet assessments by the on - board medical officer . ”
From the start , the goal was to dramatize the prisoner ’s vulnerability .
“ The HVD is subjected to administrative procedures and medical assessment upon arrival at the Black Site , ” the report said .
“ The HVD finds himself in the complete control of Americans . ”
Initially , that control is underscored by an ominous coldness of the reception .
The report said : “ The procedures he is subjected to are precise , quiet , and almost clinical ; and no one is mistreating him .
While each HVD is different , the rendition and reception process generally creates significant apprehension in the HVD because of the enormity and suddenness of the change in environment , the uncertainty about what will happen next , and the potential dread an HVD might have in US custody . ”
The prisoner is next subjected to a dehumanizing process in preparation for the interrogations .
“ The HVD ’s head and face are shaved , ” the CIA report says .
“ A series of photographs are taken of the HVD while nude to document the physical condition of the HVD upon arrival .
A Medical Officer interviews the HVD and a medical evaluation is conducted to assess the physical condition of the HVD .
… A Psychologist interviews the HVD to assess his mental state . ”
Then , if no “ contraindications ” are found , the interrogations begin , with continued emphasis on stripping the prisoner of his clothing , his self - respect and his ability to resist .
‘ Learned Helplessness ’
“ Effective interrogation is based on the concept of using both physical and psychological pressures in a comprehensive , systematic , and cumulative manner to influence HVD behavior , to overcome a detainee ’s resistance posture , ” the CIA report said .
“ The goal of interrogation is to create a state of learned helplessness and dependence conducive to the collection of intelligence in a predictable , reliable , and sustainable manner . ”
The report said a typical “ session one ” would start as “ the HVD is brought into the interrogation room , and under the direction of the interrogators , stripped of his clothes , and placed into shackles . ”
After a round of questioning – that would include some slaps and slamming the prisoner against a wall – sleep deprivation and dietary manipulation ( which along with nudity are regarded as “ conditioning techniques ” ) are begun .
The report said : “ The interrogators , assisted by security officers … will place the HVD in the center of the interrogation room in the vertical shackling position and diaper the HVD to begin sleep deprivation .
The HVD will be provided with Ensure Plus … to begin dietary manipulation .
The HVD remains nude . ” [ Underlines in original . ]
In the next session , “ coercive techniques ” are brought into play .
The nude prisoner is doused with cold water , repeatedly slammed against a wall and forced into stress positions before being returned to the shackling position for more sleep deprivation and more dietary manipulation , with the recurring advice , “ the HVD remains nude . ”
Summing up this second session , the CIA wrote , “ the following techniques were used : sleep deprivation , nudity , dietary manipulation , walling , water dousing , attention grasp , insult slap , and abdominal slap .
The three Conditioning Techniques were used to keep the HVD at a baseline , dependent state and to weaken his resolve and will to resist . ”
For session three , the CIA also noted that the prisoner “ is nude ” before more abusive techniques are added to the mix and then applied in combination .
The report stated : “ Interrogators will often use one technique to support another .
As an example , interrogators would tell an HVD in a stress position that he ( HVD ) is going back to the walling wall ( for walling ) if he fails to hold the stress position until told otherwise . …
This places additional stress on the HVD who typically will try to hold the stress position for as long as possible to avoid the walling wall . ”
According to the report , wall slamming , which involves putting a harness around a prisoner ’s neck and whipping him into a wall , “ is one of the most effective interrogation techniques because it wears down the HVD physically , heightens uncertainty in the detainee about what the interrogator may do to him , and creates a sense of dread when the HVD knows he is about to be walled again . …
“ An HVD may be walled one time ( one impact with the wall ) to make a point or twenty to thirty times consecutively when the interrogator requires a more significant response to a question .
During an interrogation session that is designed to be intense , an HVD will be walled multiple times in the session . ”
After the end of the third session , the prisoner is put back “ into the vertical shackling position to resume sleep deprivation .
Dietary manipulation also continues , and the HVD remains nude , ” the report said .
Cramped Confinement
In later interrogations , the prisoner could also be locked in boxes for differing periods depending on the size of the box .
Under guidance from the CIA ’s medical personnel , “ the duration of cramped confinement limits confinement in the large box to no more than 8 hours at a time for no more than 18 hours a day , and confinement in the small box to 2 hours , ” the report said .
According to the report , “ sleep deprivation may continue to the 70 to 120 hour range , or possibly beyond for the hardest resisters , but in no case exceed the 180 - hour time limit . ”
Although “ the entire interrogation process outlined above … may last for thirty days , ” the report said , “ if the interrogation team anticipates the potential need to use interrogation techniques beyond the 30 - day approval period , it will submit a new interrogation plan to HQS for evaluation and approval . ”
The Bush administration insisted that its “ enhanced interrogation techniques , ” which earlier also included the near - drowning of “ waterboarding , ” were effective in eliciting valuable intelligence about al - Qaeda and its plans , but FBI and some military interrogators opposed the techniques as counterproductive .
As early as spring 2002 , FBI agents objected to the CIA ’s brutal treatment of badly wounded al - Qaeda captive Abu Zubaydah , only to be informed that the tactics had been approved “ at the highest levels , ” according to a Justice Department Inspector General ’s report that was released last year .
FBI interrogators claimed that they achieved better results from rapport - building and other non-violent techniques with Zubaydah than the CIA did later with its use of torture .
For instance , author Jane Mayer in her book The Dark Side wrote that the two FBI agents , Ali Soufan and Steve Gaudin , “ sent back early cables [ in 2002 ] describing Zubayda as revealing inside details of the [ 9/11 ] attacks on New York and Washington , including the nickname of its central planner , ‘ Mukhtar , ’ who was identified as Khalid Sheikh Mohammad . …
“ During this period , Zubayda also described an Al Qaeda associate whose physical description matched that of Jose Padilla .
The information led to the arrest of the slow - witted American gang member in May 2002 , at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago . …
“ Abu Zubayda disclosed Padilla ’s role accidentally , apparently .
While making small talk , he described an Al Qaeda associate he said had just visited the U.S. embassy in Pakistan .
That scrap was enough for authorities to find and arrest Padilla .
" These early revelations were greeted with excitement by [ CIA Director George ]
Tenet , until he was told they were extracted not by his officers but by the rival team at the FBI . ”
Soon , a CIA team arrived at the secret CIA detention center in Thailand where Zubaydah was being held and took command , adopting more aggressive interrogations tactics , Mayer wrote .
The Bush administration approved the full battery of harsh tactics , including waterboarding , in mid-summer 2002 .
Mayer 's account was backed up last April by one of the FBI agents , Ali Soufan , who broke his long silence on the topic in an op-ed in the New York Times , citing Zubaydah 's cooperation in providing information about Padilla and KSM before the CIA began the harsh tactics .
" It is inaccurate ... to say that Abu Zubaydah had been uncooperative , " Soufan wrote .
" Under traditional interrogation methods , he provided us with important actionable intelligence . "
[ NYT , April 23 , 2009 ]
After taking office in January , President Barack Obama issued an executive order closing the " black sites " and prohibiting the CIA ’s “ enhanced interrogation techniques . ”
The Obama administration also has released documents describing how Bush ’s Justice Department issued legal opinions that permitted waterboarding and other torture techniques .
Last month , the Obama administration released a 2004 CIA Inspector General ’s report , which was critical of the CIA 's abusive interrogations .
The CIA background paper detailing how the methods were used in combination was part of the package of documents made public at that time .

Zipcar Inc. , the fast - growing Cambridge self - serve car rental company , has been sued for allegedly charging customers excessive or hidden fees .
The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Boston last week on behalf of Ryan Blay , an Illinois man who has been a Zipcar customer since April 2007 , along with other customers who were potentially charged the fees .
The complaint is also a reminder that Zipcar , once a small local start - up , has become an international enterprise - big enough to attract a federal lawsuit by plaintiffs who seek to make it a class - action proceeding .
Zipcar rents vehicles by the hour and by the day from lots and garages scattered around Greater Boston and other cities .
“ It ’s a backhanded compliment , ’’ said John LaLiberte , an attorney with Boston law firm Sherin and Lodgen who is not involved in the litigation .
The suit shows Zipcar “ has made it , ’’ he said .
A Zipcar spokeswoman , Nancy Scott , declined to comment on the suit .
But the privately held company said it has about 320,000 customers in 28 states and provinces in North America , including Massachusetts , and in London .
So any improper fees could add up to millions of dollars in damages .
Blay ’s lawyers estimated the fees at issue amount to more than $ 5 million .
Specifically , the complaint accused Zipcar of unfairly charging customers with a “ discreet medley of customer charges . ’’
According to the suit , many customers may not even be aware of the charges because Zipcar does not send monthly statements .
The suit cited several charges :
■ Phone fee .
A $ 3.50 charge to talk to a customer service representative even when customers call to report a problem that ca n’t be handled through the website or automated phone system .
■ Parking tickets .
Customers who receive a parking ticket or traffic citation are typically charged for the cost of the ticket plus an additional fee , even when the ticket was issued in error and customers were not given any opportunity to appeal .
■ Late fee .
The fee is $ 50 per hour up to $ 150 , three times the regular charge for a day ’s rental .
■ Lost items .
To retrieve an item left in a vehicle , customers are required to rent the car again for at least an hour - unless customers retrieve the lost item within three hours after the reservation ended .
■ Inactivity fee .
Zipcar deducts $ 20 per month from a customer ’s deposit until the deposit is depleted if the customer has not used the service for 12 consecutive months .
The lawsuit says the charges are “ arbitrary and capricious ’’ and disproportionate to the company ’s actual costs .
“ Charges imposed by similar vehicle rental businesses are not nearly as exorbitant as Zipcar ’s , ’’ the lawsuit stated .
LaLiberte said some law firms have built a cottage industry in representing consumers in class - action lawsuits .
While the amount of damages is typically small for each customer , it can add up to millions of dollars when multiplied by all the customers affected nationwide .
In this case , the outcome will probably depend on how clearly Zipcar disclosed the fees .
“ It ’s a matter of what is in the contract and what is in the fine print , ’’ said LaLiberte , who focuses on commercial litigation .
“ I do n’t think [ this case ] is anything out of the ordinary . ’’
Blay is represented by the Boston law firm Wayne , Richard & Hurwitz LLC and three Illinois firms with experience handling class - action lawsuits .
None of the firms could be reached yesterday .
Todd Wallack can be reached at twallack@globe.com .

Hundreds have been killed in drone attacks in the past year
At least three suspected militants have been killed in a US drone attack in north - west Pakistan , officials say .
Two others were injured when the missile struck a vehicle near the town of Mir Ali in North Waziristan , officials say .
A similar attack in South Waziristan in early August killed Pakistan 's top Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud .
Hundreds of militants and civilians have been killed in dozens of drone attacks in the past year .
Those killed in Monday 's attack are said to be Taliban militants , but officials cannot confirm whether any foreign militants were among them .
Villagers told the BBC all the dead men were local Taliban .
Witnesses said that they saw a drone hovering over the area before the attack early on Monday .
Series of attacks
After the attack , the villagers came out of their houses to see smoke rising from near a house .
Two witnesses to the latest attack told the Associated Press news agency that the missile hit a vehicle with blacked out windows .
At least 13 people died in a similar attack in North Waziristan last week when two missiles targeted a compound used by Taliban fighters .
Hundreds of militants and civilians have been killed in dozens of drone attacks in the past year .
Most of the attacks have taken place in North and South Waziristan .
Pakistan has criticised drone attacks , saying they fuel support for the militants .
The US military does not routinely confirm drone attacks , but the American armed forces and CIA in Afghanistan are the only forces capable of deploying drones in the region , say analysts .

This following article was an address by Rob Kirby at the Gold Anti-Trust Action Committee Inc. , GATA Goes to Washington -- Anybody Seen Our Gold ? , at the Hyatt Regency Crystal City Hotel , Arlington , Virginia , Saturday , April 19 , 2008 .
The original address has been updated and added to since new information has come to light .
My name is Rob Kirby � proprietor of Kirbyanalytics.com , proud GATA supporter and frequent contributor to Bill Murphy�s LeMetropolecafe.com .
I would like to extend a warm welcome to GATA delegates from all over the world to Washington , D.C.
I�d like to delve into the numbers , or math , showing how J.P. Morgan�s derivatives book cannot be �hedged� .
As per their call reports filed with the Comptroller of the Currency�s Office , we know J.P. Morgan�s derivatives book grew by a cancerous 12 Trillion from June 07 to Sept. 07 .
The OCC�s Quarterly Derivatives Report serves as the public�s only peek into the opaque and murky world of derivatives - flim - flammery .
Flim Flammery is the understatement of the century .
In fact , dealer notionals have EXPLODED parabolic - ally in recent years while END USER demand has been static and virtually non-existent .
J.P. Morgan�s derivatives book is epitomized by the chart above ; it clearly serves no observable or commercially productive purpose , it�s pyramidal in structure and its elephant - sized interest rates derivative composition exerts pressure on the global interest rate complex .
Let �s look at the composition of their book :
We �re shown that 65 % , or , 61.5 Trillion of the total is IRS [ on page 22 of 32 ] .
Hedging Mechanics of Interest Rate Swaps > 3 yrs .
Duration Interest rate swaps > 3 yrs. in duration customarily trade as a " spread " - expressed in basis points - over the current yield of a corresponding benchmark government bond .
That is to say , for example , 5 year interest rate swaps [ IRS ] might be quoted in the market place as 80 - 85 over .
This means that the 5 yr. swap is " bid " at 80 basis points over the 5 yr. government bond yield and it is " offered " at 85 basis points over the 5 year government bond yield .
Let 's assume that 5 year government bonds are yielding 1.90 % and the two counterparties in question consummate a trade for 25 million notional at a spread of 84 basis points over .
Here are the mechanics of what happens :
The payer of fixed rate pays [ 1.90 % + 84 basis points =]
2.74 % annually on 25 million for 5 years .
The other side of the trade - the floating rate payer - pays 3 month Libor on 25 million notional , reset quarterly - typically compounding successive floating rate payments at successive 3 month Libor rates so that actual cash exchanges are settled " net " annually .
To ensure that the trade remains a " true spread trade " [ and not a naked spec. on rates ] and to confirm that 1.90 % is a true measure of where current 5 year government bond yields really are - the payer of the fixed rate actually buys 25 million worth of physical 5 year government bonds - at a price exactly equal to 1.90 % - from the receiver of the fixed rate at the front end of the trade .
So , in this regard , we can say that 25 million IRS traded on a spread basis creates a " need " for 25 million worth of 5 year government bonds - because it has a 5 year bond trade of 25 million embedded in it .
Interest rate swaps of duration < 3 years are typically hedged with strips of 3 month Eurodollar futures instead of government bonds .
In recent years the Chicago Mercantile Exchange [ or CME ] has developed an interest rate swap - futures based hedging product for the 5 and 10 year terms .
I acknowledge the existence of these products but due to their 200k contract size and amounts traded , as reported in archived CME volume data , they do not materially impact the numbers in this presentation .
As demonstrated , Interest Rate Swaps create demand for bonds because bond trades are implicitly embedded in these transactions .
Without end user demand for the product � trading for �trading sake� creates ARTIFICIAL demand for bonds .
This manipulates rates lower than they otherwise would be .
I learned these basics � first hand - over 15 years as a broker in Capital Markets .
My largest client at that time was Citibank Canada � who pioneered these instruments for Citibank worldwide .
For the bulk of the 1980�s , Citibank Canada was the largest interest rate derivatives player in the world .
Here�s the breakdown of 12 Trillion in derivatives growth in 3 months : 65 % of 12 Trillion , or , 7.8 Trillion of it is Interest Rate Swaps 35 % of 7.8 Trillion , or , 2.73 Trillion requires bond hedges 2.73 Trillion / 66 days per quarter = 41.4 billion in bonds per day Here�s the math showing that 35 % of interest rate swaps require bond hedges :
So , in the latest quarter it took 41.4 billion in bonds per day JUST TO SATISFY HEDGING OF THE GROWTH in their SWAP BOOK .
The existing book minus the growth , or 80 Trillion , - 52 Trillion of that is IRS .
65 % of the 52 Trillion figure - 33.8 Trillion - matures in 3 yrs .
or less with the lion�s share of that in under1 year as you can see here : Assume a conservative average maturity of 18 months [ 6 quarters ] then one sixth of 33.8 Trillion , or 5.63 Trillion worth of Swaps roll off and need to be replaced every 3 months .
35 % of 5.63 Trillion , or 2 Trillion , required bond hedges to keep the book static .
2 Trillion / 66 days = another 30.3 billion bonds required per day .
So , In Aggregate : J.P. Morgan required more than 71.7 billion worth of bonds each business day � from Jun. 30 to Sept. 30 / 07 - JUST FOR THEIR SWAP BOOK � if it is hedged .
Some , like the OCC themselves , might argue that �netting � � or balancing short against long internally within J.P. Morgan�s book � reduces the amount of bonds required to hedge .
Over time netting would have some effect � but �netting � generally occurs at day�s end .
This math does not even work intra-day : According to the U.S. Treasury : � During the July � September 2007 quarter , Treasury borrowed $ 105 billion of net marketable debt� .�
J.P. Morgan is but one of 20 primary dealers of U.S. treasury securities .
50 % of all Treasury Securities auctioned over this period were 2 yr. , 20 yr , or 30 yr. � so they were not used to hedge swaps .
This leaves a balance of around 50 billion bonds suitable for hedges .
Treasury also tells us foreign participation in U.S. bond auctions typically tops 20 % .
So you �re now left with 40 Billion in �net new �
U.S. Treasury Securities � suitable for hedges - to distribute among all domestic players for an entire quarter .
The growth component of J.P. Morgan�s book alone , if it�s hedged , requires more than 1.4 billion more than this amount every day !
Bonds required to hedge the growth in Morgan�s Swap book are 1.4 billion more in one day than what is mathematically available to the entire domestic bond market for a whole quarter ?
This interest rate swap book is not hedged .
J.P. Morgan is the FED .
If you believe the yeomen�s work of John Williams of Shadow Gov�t Stats � this helps explain how we get bogus inflation reports from officialdom in the 2 % range when in reality it is running �double - digits� .
Historically , bond vigilantes would have spotted the ruse and sold bonds raising rates of interest to levels commensurate with real inflation rates at 10 % plus the historic premium of 250 points or 12 � 14 % nominal market rates .
If you �re wondering where the bond vigilantes have gone :
They have all lost their jobs .
Long ago , the last of the true bond vigilantes sold bonds � intuitively correct I would argue � not realizing that J.P. Morgan�s Swap Book was a �black hole� of stealth artificial demand .
They lost their shirts along with their jobs .
Nowadays � bond traders who have chosen to remain employed � resemble trained monkeys and play the game the way their masters intend them to : Monetary authorities have long been pursuing expansionary monetary policies while attempting to cloak their actions by suppressing rising interest rates and other natural market reactions .
This has completely perverted our whole banking and monetary system .
This is why false values have been assigned to a host of financial instruments .
This explains why the gold price has been suppressed .
It �s another canary in the coal mine that was vigorously and nefariously silenced .
If you �re wondering why J.P. Morgan never seems to get caught up in any sort of hideous mark - to - market losses concerning their derivatives or hedge book � consider that back in the spring of 2006 , Business Week�s Dawn Kopecki reported , � President George W. Bush has bestowed on his intelligence czar , John Negroponte , broad authority , in the name of national security , to excuse publicly traded companies from their usual accounting and securities - disclosure obligations .
Notice of the development came in a brief entry in the Federal Register , dated May 5 , 2006 , that was opaque to the untrained eye . �
So do any of you think that J.P. Morgan gets a pass ?
I would suggest to you that if they had not � our whole financial system would already have collapsed in a heap .
You see folks ; hubris has been cast upon us in an attempt to have us believe that wealth is really created on a printing press and on trading desks in N.Y. at J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs .
Remember , real wealth really comes from the earth � like gold � just as it always has .

When the feds smelled anti-competitive behavior on Apple 's breath in July after the computer maker rejected an iPhone app for Google 's Voice calling service , the FCC asked Apple , its telecom partner AT&T and Google to explain what happened .
When the three tech giants replied three weeks later , one decided to file part of its answer in secret .
Oddly , that was Google — the ostensible victim in the incident and a company that prides itself on its openness and transparency .
Google 's decision ( .pdf ) causes a big blind spot in the story of the highest - profile mobile app store rejection yet — a story that is likely to change how app stores are run , how people expect apps stores to be curated , and whether the feds decide to regulate them .
That 's why Wired.com is asking the feds Friday , via an official government sunshine request ( .pdf ) , to publish the answer in full .
In contrast to Google , Apple , a company known for its ultra-secret ways , opted for total public disclosure in its letter to the FCC — which it also linked to on the front page of its website .
Apple could n't actually bring itself to say it rejected Google ' innovative calling application , instead saying it was still studying the application , months later , to see if might confuse users .
AT&T , a company with quite a bit of practice sharing information secretly with the feds ( specifically , your info to the NSA ) , also choose full disclosure .
It unequivocally said IT had no hand in the rejection of the Voice app and laying out its agreement with Apple over streaming video and VOIP applications .
But Google told the feds that its conversations with Apple were commercial secrets and so filed that portion of its answer ( . pdf ) under seal .
That means there 's no way to fact - check what Apple and AT&T told the feds .
With all due respect to Google 's great search algorithms , that secrecy is just ridiculous .
For one , there 's no commercial advantage anyone could possibly get by knowing the timeline and contents of the conversation between Google and Apple over an iPhone app .
And even if there were , it 's got to be substantial — not hypothetical or slight — to count for an exemption .
Secondly , this whole story started with Google complaining to the press that Apple blocked its iPhone app .
If that 's such a secret , then Google would never have talked about it in the first place .
Thirdly , there 's no way to fact - check whether Apple actually rejected the application or not without Google 's side of the story being public .
Given how important app stores and their policies are turning out to be — and with the FCC thinking about rules for them , the public deserves to know what happened .
Fourth , the only real reason for Google to keep these records from the public is to try to keep a good relationship with Apple , by continuing to downplay the incident .
Google has some prime real estate on the iPhone and as part of its strategy to fight Microsoft , has long had good relations with Apple ( with Google 's CEO Eric Schmidt sitting on the Apple board until just a few days after this started ) .
The feds even suspect that the two companies had an agreement not to poach each other 's employees , a possible violation of competition laws .
Once the story became bigger than they expected , Google made it clear when it spoke to reporters about the rejection that it was n't mad at Apple .
But that 's not a fair reason to keep information from the public .
And finally , the FCC has some strict rules about what you need to do to justify having your comments hidden from the public , including naming the specific " substantial " harms and giving a deadline for when the comments could come to light .
Google did neither .
Wired.com is filing the following Freedom of Information Act request Thursday , asking for the full Google answer and for rush handling by the feds .
Google asked for — and will likely get — the opportunity to challenge Wired.
com 's request .
Wired.com looks forward to its justifications and the opportunity to rebut them .
Of course , Google could save all of us the trouble and just publish the full document themselves today and ask the FCC to do the same .
After all , Google — if AT&T and Apple can be open and transparent , certainly you can too .

Breaking the " Unbreakable " Oracle with Metasploit
Talk Abstract :
This is the video of the talk titled " " given at Defcon 17 by Chris Gates and Mario Ceballos .
Over the years there have been tons of Oracle exploits , SQL Injection vulnerabilities , and post exploitation tricks and tools that had no order , methodology , or standardization , mainly just random .sql files .
Additionally , none of the publicly available Pentest Frameworks have the ability to leverage built - in package SQL Injection vulnerabilities for privilege escalation , data extraction , or getting operating system access .
In this presentation we are going to present an Oracle Pentesting Methodology and give you all the tools to break the " unbreakable " Oracle as Metasploit auxiliary modules .
We 've created your version and SID enumeration modules , account bruteforcing modules , ported all the public ( and not so public ) Oracle SQL Injection vulnerabilities into SQLI modules ( with IDS evasion examples for 10g / 11g ) , modules for OS interaction , and modules for automating some of our post exploitation tasks .

On yesterday 's Bonus Round on GameTrailers , Wedbush Morgan Analyst Michael Pachter had this to say about Borderlands , which releases tomorrow .
Sent to die .
I think “ Borderlands ” is the definition of a game that should have had it ’s own window and not be up against all this stuff .
It ’s absolutely the same audience .
I do n’t think it ’s as much an RPG as they would like us to believe .
If it ’s an RPG , “ Dragon Age ” is going to kick its butt ; and if it ’s a shooter , “ Call of Duty ” or something else is going to kick its butt .
There 's a wildcard at play though here that Mr. Pachter neglected , and that 's the full extent of the co-op support that Borderlands has versus the other two games mentioned .
For one , Dragon
Age has absolutely no co-op , RPG fans will have to look elsewhere for their co-op experience .
Modern Warfare 2 ?
It has a co-op mode , one that many previews seem to say is a blast to play , but it 's missing a core co-op component .
Ya know , because it broke the experience .
So while some may think Borderlands will get lost in the shuffle this fall , I know there 's quite a few people in our community that plan on picking it up .
It 'll do just fine , and things will keep going strong once the DLC hits down the road .
It may not sell as well as it could had it been released earlier this year when there was a glut of gaming , but saying it will " die " is a stretch .

The Fed released the Q2 2009 Flow of Funds report today : Flow of Funds .
According to the Fed , household net worth is now off $ 12.2 Trillion from the peak in 2007 .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
This is the Households and Nonprofit net worth as a percent of GDP .
This includes real estate and financial assets ( stocks , bonds , pension reserves , deposits , etc ) net of liabilities ( mostly mortgages ) .
Note that this does NOT include public debt obligations .
According to the Fed , household net worth increased in Q2 mostly from increases in stock holdings - although the value of household real estate increased slightly too .
Note that this ratio was relatively stable for almost 50 years , and then ... bubbles !
This graph shows homeowner percent equity since 1952 .
Household percent equity ( of household real estate ) was up to 43 % from the all time low last quarter of 41.9 % .
The increase was due to a slight increase in the value of household real estate and a decline in mortgage debt - and also a decline in overall GDP ( so the ratio increases ) .
When prices were increasing dramatically , the percent homeowner equity was stable or declining because homeowners were extracting equity from their homes .
Now , with prices falling , the percent homeowner equity has been cliff diving .
Note : approximately 31 % of households do not have a mortgage .
So the 50 + million households with mortgages have far less than 43 % equity .
The third graph shows household real estate assets and mortgage debt as a percent of GDP .
Household assets as a percent of GDP increased slightly in Q2 - because of a slight increase in real estate values , and a decline in GDP .
Mortgage debt declined , but was flat as a percent of GDP in Q2 - since GDP declined too .
After a bubble , the value of assets decline , but most of the debt remains .

ANYWAY THE DOMAIN WENT ON GODADDY AFTERMARKET THE WHOLE AND WAS ON THE WHOLE TIME WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE FOR THE PAST MONTH .
NO ONE CONTACTED ME ABOUT THIS AND I HAD NO ADMIN SCREEN TO TELL ME .
THE DOMAIN WAS RECENTLY SOLD ON THE GREEDY GODADDY AFTERMARKET FOR 107 DOLLARS .
I AM IN THE PROCESS OF EITHER BUYING IT BACK AND CONTACTING GODADDY .

as I post from a WordPress hosted blog …
please vote for this on reddit
It all started when I started my little arts and culture blog on blogger , http://www.thegonzojournal.blogspot.com, I was a freelance journalist in my spare time , writing on issues ranging from technology to the art .
Eventually I wanted cultivate my own media outlets one of these was a culture blog I started on blogspot http://www.thegonzojournal.blogspot.com.
I started getting a ­lot of traffic and people really liked my writing , so I decided to spring for a custom domain address .
It would cost ten dollars and as long as I set it up through the backend of the Blogger Dashboard , Google would handle everything for me .
Google would purchase the domain from Godaddy and act as the middleman while giving me no access to the server settings of a usual Godaddy account .
They would simply point the nameservers for the domain to the blogspot servers I figured this would be a sure way to keep what Pagerank I already had .
All I had to do was type the desired address in a little input field .
“ Wow this could n’t be better or easier I thought . ”
Things went very nice for a year , I had the advantage of not worrying about my large database of blog posts and Google handled everything with 99 % uptime ; my site started getting recognized and had lots of inbound links and great SEO value .
This all changed when it came time to renew my domain .
I procrastinated until about 2 or three days before my domain would expire , I did not think this would be a big problem .
I paid for two years this time around and everything went through , with a receipt from Google .
The Whois information was updated to having my domain expire in 2010 and everything else on Whois stayed the same , I was registered through Godaddy / Domains by Proxy .
Unfortunately it must have taken the Google team a while to process that I made the payment and the page started redirecting to one that said “ this page parked free by Google Apps . ”
I could then and even now can still log into the backend of my Blogger dashboard and access , update and edit my blog posts .
Shortly after I got this first warning sign , I got contacted by a person asking to buy my domain , apparently it had been placed on a watch list of available high pagerank ( PR 4 ) domains by Godaddy .
I resubmitted the site , filled out a contact form to Google and whether this did anything or not my site was back up in a few days .
Webmaster tools gave no indication that anything was wrong at any point in this process showing all paged indexed .
Phase 2 of the problem started when the site stopped showing up in Google , ( see help link here http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Apps/thread?tid=41bd8853577bd706&hl=en) this only lasted for one day but it told me something was still going on with the hosting .
The next day I was back in the SERP ’s and ranking great as usual , this went on for another week until my site was down again .
First it gave the ubiquitous “ This Page has Been Parked Free by Godaddy , ” then a few hours later it would redirect to the default search engine page by my host Roadrunner , “ Sorry we can not find this page . ”
I checked the Blogger dashboard and under the little input field where I get to type in my custom domain , it read …
“ The DNS record for your domain is not set up correctly yet .
If you just purchased this domain the set up process may take up to a day . ”
This is when I knew that DNS hijacking had taken place .
The next day my New York city music blog for all the eccentric techies , freaks and artists in New York was redirected to a one page spam site .
I picked up on something suspicious when I looked at Google Analytics for the time period that my site was de-indexed from Google .
The only visits to my blog were coming from a “ site : ” command somewhere in India .
There was nothing I could do , I had given up my life and soul to the great cloud computer in the sky run , run by what I thought was the ironclad braniac team of Google .
I have no access to FTP , server settings or DNS , Google handled all of that for me through Godaddy .
I only hope that when Matt Cutts gives his presentations at WordCamp on why we should blog , encouraging us all to start up blogging , that he cares enough about his company ’s own blogging software and security .
Or maybe this is why he uses WordPress ?
My only hope is that I get this message to someone at Google to take a look at the DNS settings and problems on their stealth servers , as it would be hard to know which server to redirect back to in the first place even if I could Hijack the NS records myself .
I still believe Google is one of the best companies ever , besides it ’s too late to turn back now .

I resubmitted the site , filled out a contact form to Google and whether this did anything or not my site was back up in a few days .
Webmaster tools gave no indication that anything was wrong at any point in this process showing all paged indexed .
Phase 2 of the problem started when the site stopped showing up in Google , ( see help link here http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Apps/thread?tid=41bd8853577bd706&hl=en) this only lasted for one day but it told me something was still going on with the hosting .
The next day I was back in the SERP ’s and ranking great as usual , this went on for another week until my site was down again .
First it gave the ubiquitous “ This Page has Been Parked Free by Godaddy , ” then a few hours later it would redirect to the default search engine page by my host Roadrunner , “ Sorry we can not find this page . ”
I checked the Blogger dashboard and under the little input field where I get to type in my custom domain , it read …
“ The DNS record for your domain is not set up correctly yet .
If you just purchased this domain the set up process may take up to a day . ”
This is when I knew that DNS hijacking had taken place .
The next day my New York city music blog for all the eccentric techies , freaks and artists in New York was redirected to a one page spam site .
I picked up on something suspicious when I looked at Google Analytics for the time period that my site was de-indexed from Google .
The only visits to my blog were coming from a “ site : ” command somewhere in India .
There was nothing I could do , I had given up my life and soul to the great cloud computer in the sky run , run by what I thought was the ironclad braniac team of Google .
I have no access to FTP , server settings or DNS , Google handled all of that for me through Godaddy .
I only hope that when Matt Cutts gives his presentations at WordCamp on why we should blog , encouraging us all to start up blogging , that he cares enough about his company ’s own blogging software and security .
Or maybe this is why he uses WordPress ?
My only hope is that I get this message to someone at Google to take a look at the DNS settings and problems on their stealth servers , as it would be hard to know which server to redirect back to in the first place even if I could Hijack the NS records myself .
I still believe Google is one of the best companies ever , besides it ’s too late to turn back now .

Katie : Can you explain what you mean by the White Culture ?
Because some people might say , that sounds kind of racist .
Beck : Really ?
It 's amazing to me that , for the first time I think in history , somebody can ask a question and say , do n't you think ?
We have several pieces here , we have several pieces .
George Bush says , my grandmother was a typical African American , that had , uh , that had her views bred into her ?
You do n't think maybe we would ask some questions about that comment ?
How is it that for the first time , I think in history , you should check on it , somebody says , " Hey , there 's some red flags here - maybe we should look at them ? " has become the target ?
How am I the target for asking questions ?
Katie : People just want to know .
What - what is White Culture ?
“ I ’d like to be a resource to my former colleagues , to the extent that I can , to the administration , to the stakeholders and to people interested in just kind of knowing how this is all going to play out , ” he said .
“ I am most comfortable with the word resource . ”

White House officials say they appreciate his help .
“ He is one of a number of people that provides outside advice to the White House , and the president greatly appreciates that advice and Tom ’s friendship , ” said Dan Pfeiffer , a spokesman for the White House who previously worked for Mr. Daschle .
Mr. Pfeiffer added that the former senator was “ a recognized expert on health reform who knows more about the legislative process than just about anyone . ”
Critics , though , say his ex officio role gives Alston & Bird ’s health care clients privileged insights into the policy process .
They say Mr. Daschle ’s multiple advisory roles illustrate the kind of coziness with the lobbying world that Mr. Obama vowed to end .
If he had been confirmed as health secretary , Mr. Daschle would have been subject to strict transparency and ethics rules .
His position , some liberals say , raises at least an appearance of a conflict of interest .
“ I hope the president can make a decision based on what the country wants , not what a handful of Daschle ’s clients want , ” said Representative Lynn Woolsey of California , a leader of the progressive caucus .
Clients of Alston & Bird say Mr. Daschle advises them , sometimes indirectly through the firm ’s registered lobbyists , about the personalities of his former colleagues , as well as strategies to achieve their policy goals .
“ He would tell us , ‘ Make sure you present the value proposition of home care with as great detail as you can , so Congress understands that home care is part of the solution rather than a cost to be cut , ’ ” said William A. Dombi , a lawyer at the National Association for Home Care and Hospice .
Some of the health overhaul bills would make deep cuts in Medicare payments for home health services , but Mr. Daschle has instead argued for an increase .
And though he does not lobby , he took that message to Capitol Hill last month , giving a paid speech at a meeting for Congressional staff convened by a group of home health care equipment concerns .
Kim Nimon , assistant professor in the department of learning technologies at the University of North Texas , is emerging as a national voice on what 's becoming an increasingly common and potentially controversial practice : companies hiring chaplains to minister to workers .
In this month 's Annals , the quarterly publication of the American Psychotherapy Association , Nimon addresses the blend of business and religion in pursuit of happier , more productive workers .
Using placement companies such as Dallas - based Marketplace Chaplains USA , such firms as Tyson , Pepsi and Walmart have begun hiring chaplains in an effort to boost employees ' overall life satisfaction , and in the process up their on - the - job productivity .
" In the past we wanted people to just bring their bodies to work and leave their minds at home , but this is part of a realization that in fact , everyone is bringing everything to work , " Nimon told Unfair Park .
" It 's all connected . "
Nimon says corporations are willing to invest in spiritual counselors because studies show that a sense of community and meaningful work that 's aligned with personal values are linked to workers ' job performance and length of tenure .
And , in spite of potentially thorny questions of separation of church and state , Nimon says anecdotal evidence shows workplace chaplains are more effective than counselors .
" There 's somewhat of a stigma attached to using a psychologist or counselor , " Nimon says .
" The chaplains are coming into lunchrooms , attending community functions , they 're part of that community . "
That 's helpful since generally , people are spending more time at work than ever before and do n't necessarily get the spiritual or psychological nourishment they need , she says .
If such people are struggling with a family issue , a difficult work relationship or even a death , they 're more likely to talk to a familiar chaplain than reach out to a therapist .
Chaplains , Nimon says , can play an important role in reducing turnover , retaining employees , improving productivity , reducing stress and improving morale .
Even so , she warns in her column that any company using chaplains should stop short of anything that could be considered religious harassment or the promotion of a single faith .
And just in case , they should also have a policy that spells out a process for harassment complaints .
Nimon writes in her column that the courts have worked to balance employers ' rights to express their values through their business and the right of employees not to be proselytized .
Opening the workplace to religion could mean a lot of lawsuits , considering that according to The Economist more than 300 companies in more than 45 states have hired chaplains through Marketplace Chaplains USA .
I do n’t generally think that women are too feeble and befuddled to know what they want .
I tend to assume that the women I meet are autonomous and know their own minds , much as I know mine .
Others , however , disagree .
Radical feminist Margaret Jamison , for instance :
I know I ’ve said before – here and elsewhere – that female “ heterosexuality ” is not a meaningful concept to me .
That is , politically , and with regard specifically to radical feminism , I do n’t believe that whatever a woman feels in her head ( influenced so mandatorily as it is by male supremacy ) about her own sexual inclinations really matters in the grand scheme .
Hear that , straight ladies ?
Your heterosexuality – sorry , your “ heterosexuality ” – is n’t meaningful .
The male supremacy has you duped .
Whatever it is you feel – and by extension whatever it is you think – is of no consequence in the “ grand scheme ” of Margaret Jamison :
An internal self - assessment just really does n’t matter in comparison with the external interactions , and the way those interactions reflect and perpetuate male supremacy .
Ah. Compared to “ external interactions , ” your feelings are irrelevant - indeed they most likely are n’t your own .
Cynics may already be amending the object of Ms Jamison ’s assertions and pondering the likely reaction : “ Female ‘ homosexuality ’ – so - called ‘ lesbianism ’ - is not a meaningful concept to me .
I do n’t believe that whatever a woman feels in her head about her own sexual inclinations really matters in the grand scheme . ”
Readers may recall similar sentiments being expressed by the Guardian ’s Julie Bindel , who insists desire should be reconfigured to comply with ideology .
And it ’s no use protesting to the contrary .
Whatever you might say , you ’re collaborating with the oppressor :
Women wanting what men want – the subjugation of women – does n’t mean that women ’s subjugation is now a female desire .
It simply means that some women want what men want .
They are men ’s women .
If your desires should coincide with those of a man - who , like all men , desires your subjugation - you become his property .
I do hope you ’re following this .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Some 7,500 wealthy Americans turned over information about hidden overseas assets , including some valued at more than $ 100 million , ahead of a tax amnesty program ’s Thursday deadline , the top U.S. tax collector said .
Doug Shulman , commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service , said his agency would expand its crackdown on offshore tax evasion and will open new criminal investigation offices in Beijing , Panama and Sydney , Australia .
The amnesty plan revealed accounts in 70 countries .
“ You add all of this up and it means increased risk for anyone still hiding assets offshore , ” Shulman told reporters at a Wednesday briefing .
“ The IRS has new momentum in this entire area and in the coming months our efforts will only intensify , ” he said .
Roughly 7,500 Americans have taken part in the amnesty program , he said , more than double the participation reported a few weeks ago .
The amnesty deadline was extended once and will not be extended again .
In the past , without the special program , about 100 people came forward annually .
Under the amnesty program that began in September , tax cheats can declare offshore accounts and income , pay reduced fines and , in general , get immunity from criminal prosecution .
The program turned up undeclared offshore accounts ranging from $ 10,000 to more than $ 100 million , Shulman said .
At the heart of the U.S. offshore tax effort is the government 's investigation of UBS AG UBSN .VX .
The giant Swiss bank earlier this year settled a criminal probe by paying $ 780 million and admitting it helped U.S. citizens evade taxes .
In August , the bank agreed to turn over 4,450 names of clients with undisclosed offshore accounts to end a related civil lawsuit .
Shulman said government investigators would scour the 7,500 accounts declared in the amnesty program to detect financial advisers who promoted and otherwise helped Americans skirt their tax obligations .
“ This entire effort is not just about UBS , ” Shulman said .
WAS IT VOLUNTARY ?
Some wanted more information about results of the program before calling it a success .
Senator Carl Levin , a Democrat and chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations , has estimated the U.S. loses $ 100 billion annually from international tax evasion .
He questioned how many of the individuals came forward without nudging from banks .
“ The IRS revealed today that ( at least ) one person alone disclosed foreign accounts with more than $ 100 million in assets , but did n’t say whether that individual acted after being informed by their bank that their name was being given to the United States , ” said Levin , who is a sponsor of offshore tax abuse legislation .
“ If that is what happened , it does n’t count as a voluntary disclosure in my book , ” he said .
A lawyer for Bradley Birkenfeld , a UBS whistleblower turned government informant , wanted to know more about the size of the accounts revealed to the IRS , in particular how many were small accounts closer to the $ 10,000 figure .
“ The IRS needs to put away the celebratory firecrackers , ” Dean Zerbe , special counsel for the National Whistleblowers Center said .
Other information absent is the total assets estimated to be recouped from the program , and how much money there really is overseas , Zerbe said .
MORE BANKS ?
WAKE UP CALL
Assets in the accounts that were voluntarily declared to the IRS include inheritance money , international business transactions and profit scams by U.S. business , Shulman said .
Private tax lawyers say a large majority of those coming forward are UBS clients , but they are also seeing customers of Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.VX , HSBC Holdings Plc HSBA.L and others .
UBS sent letters to clients last month to tell them their account information could be turned over to the U.S. government .
That contributed to the last - minute rush to participate in the IRS amnesty program , the lawyers said .
“ It ’s clearly the ultimate wake - up call because it says you will be turned in , ” said William Sharp , a Florida attorney for some who have sought amnesty .
“ I think people have finally looked at these letters and said , ‘ Wow , I ’m going to get turned in . ’ ”
Stoking that fear are 150 criminal tax cases that the U.S. Justice Department said it is preparing to file against evaders .
The cases are likely to spring from the initial 250 names that UBS handed to the U.S. government as part of its February criminal settlement .

IT IS the biggest peacetime fiscal expansion in history .
Across the globe countries have countered the recession by cutting taxes and by boosting government spending .
The G20 group of economies , whose leaders meet this week in Pittsburgh , have introduced stimulus packages worth an average of 2 % of GDP this year and 1.6 % of GDP in 2010 .
Co-ordinated action on this scale might suggest a consensus about the effects of fiscal stimulus .
But economists are in fact deeply divided about how well , or indeed whether , such stimulus works .
The debate hinges on the scale of the “ fiscal multiplier ” .
This measure , first formalised in 1931 by Richard Kahn , a student of John Maynard Keynes , captures how effectively tax cuts or increases in government spending stimulate output .
A multiplier of one means that a $ 1 billion increase in government spending will increase a country 's GDP by $ 1 billion .
The size of the multiplier is bound to vary according to economic conditions .
For an economy operating at full capacity , the fiscal multiplier should be zero .
Since there are no spare resources , any increase in government demand would just replace spending elsewhere .
But in a recession , when workers and factories lie idle , a fiscal boost can increase overall demand .
And if the initial stimulus triggers a cascade of expenditure among consumers and businesses , the multiplier can be well above one .
The multiplier is also likely to vary according to the type of fiscal action .
Government spending on building a bridge may have a bigger multiplier than a tax cut if consumers save a portion of their tax windfall .
A tax cut targeted at poorer people may have a bigger impact on spending than one for the affluent , since poorer folk tend to spend a higher share of their income .
Crucially , the overall size of the fiscal multiplier also depends on how people react to higher government borrowing .
If the government 's actions bolster confidence and revive animal spirits , the multiplier could rise as demand goes up and private investment is “ crowded in ” .
But if interest rates climb in response to government borrowing then some private investment that would otherwise have occurred could get “ crowded out ” .
And if consumers expect higher future taxes in order to finance new government borrowing , they could spend less today .
All that would reduce the fiscal multiplier , potentially to below zero .
Different assumptions about the impact of higher government borrowing on interest rates and private spending explain wild variations in the estimates of multipliers from today 's stimulus spending .
Economists in the Obama administration , who assume that the federal funds rate stays constant for a four - year period , expect a multiplier of 1.6 for government purchases and 1.0 for tax cuts from America 's fiscal stimulus .
An alternative assessment by John Cogan , Tobias Cwik , John Taylor and Volker Wieland uses models in which interest rates and taxes rise more quickly in response to higher public borrowing .
Their multipliers are much smaller .
They think America 's stimulus will boost GDP by only one - sixth as much as the Obama team expects .
When forward - looking models disagree so dramatically , careful analysis of previous fiscal stimuli ought to help settle the debate .
Unfortunately , it is extremely tricky to isolate the impact of changes in fiscal policy .
One approach is to use microeconomic case studies to examine consumer behaviour in response to specific tax rebates and cuts .
These studies , largely based on tax changes in America , find that permanent cuts have a bigger impact on consumer spending than temporary ones and that consumers who find it hard to borrow , such as those close to their credit - card limit , tend to spend more of their tax windfall .
But case studies do not measure the overall impact of tax cuts or spending increases on output .
An alternative approach is to try to tease out the statistical impact of changes in government spending or tax cuts on GDP .
The difficulty here is to isolate the effects of fiscal - stimulus measures from the rises in social - security spending and falls in tax revenues that naturally accompany recessions .
This empirical approach has narrowed the range of estimates in some areas .
It has also yielded interesting cross-country comparisons .
Multipliers are bigger in closed economies than open ones ( because less of the stimulus leaks abroad via imports ) .
They have traditionally been bigger in rich countries than emerging ones ( where investors tend to take fright more quickly , pushing interest rates up ) .
But overall economists find as big a range of multipliers from empirical estimates as they do from theoretical models .
These times are different
To add to the confusion , the post - war experiences from which statistical analyses are drawn differ in vital respects from the current situation .
Most of the evidence on multipliers for government spending is based on military outlays , but today 's stimulus packages are heavily focused on infrastructure .
Interest rates in many rich countries are now close to zero , which may increase the potency of , as well as the need for , fiscal stimulus .
Because of the financial crisis relatively more people face borrowing constraints , which would increase the effectiveness of a tax cut .
At the same time , highly indebted consumers may now be keen to cut their borrowing , leading to a lower multiplier .
And investors today have more reason to be worried about rich countries ' fiscal positions than those of emerging markets .
Add all this together and the truth is that economists are flying blind .
They can make relative judgments with some confidence .
Temporary tax cuts pack less punch than permanent ones , for instance .
Fiscal multipliers will probably be lower in heavily indebted economies than in prudent ones .
But policymakers looking for precise estimates are deluding themselves .

It is spring in McAllen , Texas .
The morning sun is warm .
The streets are lined with palm trees and pickup trucks .
McAllen is in Hidalgo County , which has the lowest household income in the country , but it ’s a border town , and a thriving foreign - trade zone has kept the unemployment rate below ten per cent .
McAllen calls itself the Square Dance Capital of the World .

McAllen has another distinction , too : it is one of the most expensive health - care markets in the country .
Only Miami — which has much higher labor and living costs — spends more per person on health care .
In 2006 , Medicare spent fifteen thousand dollars per enrollee here , almost twice the national average .
The income per capita is twelve thousand dollars .
In other words , Medicare spends three thousand dollars more per person here than the average person earns .
The explosive trend in American medical costs seems to have occurred here in an especially intense form .
Our country ’s health care is by far the most expensive in the world .
In Washington , the aim of health - care reform is not just to extend medical coverage to everybody but also to bring costs under control .
Spending on doctors , hospitals , drugs , and the like now consumes more than one of every six dollars we earn .
The financial burden has damaged the global competitiveness of American businesses and bankrupted millions of families , even those with insurance .
It ’s also devouring our government .
“ The greatest threat to America ’s fiscal health is not Social Security , ” President Barack Obama said in a March speech at the White House .
“ It ’s not the investments that we ’ve made to rescue our economy during this crisis .
By a wide margin , the biggest threat to our nation ’s balance sheet is the skyrocketing cost of health care .
It ’s not even close . ”
The question we ’re now frantically grappling with is how this came to be , and what can be done about it .
McAllen , Texas , the most expensive town in the most expensive country for health care in the world , seemed a good place to look for some answers .
From the moment I arrived , I asked almost everyone I encountered about McAllen ’s health costs — a businessman I met at the five - gate McAllen - Miller International Airport , the desk clerks at the Embassy Suites Hotel , a police - academy cadet at McDonald’s .
Most were n’t surprised to hear that McAllen was an outlier .
“ Just look around , ” the cadet said .
“ People are not healthy here . ” McAllen , with its high poverty rate , has an incidence of heavy drinking sixty per cent higher than the national average .
And the Tex - Mex diet has contributed to a thirty - eight - per-cent obesity rate .
One day , I went on rounds with Lester Dyke , a weather - beaten , ranch - owning fifty - three - year - old cardiac surgeon who grew up in Austin , did his surgical training with the Army all over the country , and settled into practice in Hidalgo County .
He has not lacked for business : in the past twenty years , he has done some eight thousand heart operations , which exhausts me just thinking about it .
I walked around with him as he checked in on ten or so of his patients who were recuperating at the three hospitals where he operates .
It was easy to see what had landed them under his knife .
They were nearly all obese or diabetic or both .
Many had a family history of heart disease .
Few were taking preventive measures , such as cholesterol - lowering drugs , which , studies indicate , would have obviated surgery for up to half of them .
Yet public - health statistics show that cardiovascular - disease rates in the county are actually lower than average , probably because its smoking rates are quite low .
Rates of asthma , H.I.V. , infant mortality , cancer , and injury are lower , too .
El Paso County , eight hundred miles up the border , has essentially the same demographics .
Both counties have a population of roughly seven hundred thousand , similar public - health statistics , and similar percentages of non-English speakers , illegal immigrants , and the unemployed .
Yet in 2006 Medicare expenditures ( our best approximation of over - all spending patterns ) in El Paso were $ 7,504 per enrollee — half as much as in McAllen .
An unhealthy population could n’t possibly be the reason that McAllen ’s health - care costs are so high .
( Or the reason that America ’s are .
We may be more obese than any other industrialized nation , but we have among the lowest rates of smoking and alcoholism , and we are in the middle of the range for cardiovascular disease and diabetes . )
Was the explanation , then , that McAllen was providing unusually good health care ?
I took a walk through Doctors Hospital at Renaissance , in Edinburg , one of the towns in the McAllen metropolitan area , with Robert Alleyn , a Houston - trained general surgeon who had grown up here and returned home to practice .
The hospital campus sprawled across two city blocks , with a series of three - and four - story stucco buildings separated by golfing - green lawns and black asphalt parking lots .
He pointed out the sights — the cancer center is over here , the heart center is over there , now we ’re coming to the imaging center .
We went inside the surgery building .
It was sleek and modern , with recessed lighting , classical music piped into the waiting areas , and nurses moving from patient to patient behind rolling black computer pods .
We changed into scrubs and Alleyn took me through the sixteen operating rooms to show me the laparoscopy suite , with its flat - screen video monitors , the hybrid operating room with built - in imaging equipment , the surgical robot for minimally invasive robotic surgery .
I was impressed .
The place had virtually all the technology that you ’d find at Harvard and Stanford and the Mayo Clinic , and , as I walked through that hospital on a dusty road in South Texas , this struck me as a remarkable thing .
Rich towns get the new school buildings , fire trucks , and roads , not to mention the better teachers and police officers and civil engineers .
Poor towns do n’t .
But that rule does n’t hold for health care .
At McAllen Medical Center , I saw an orthopedic surgeon work under an operating microscope to remove a tumor that had wrapped around the spinal cord of a fourteen - year - old .
At a home - health agency , I spoke to a nurse who could provide intravenous - drug therapy for patients with congestive heart failure .
At McAllen Heart Hospital , I watched Dyke and a team of six do a coronary - artery bypass using technologies that did n’t exist a few years ago .
At Renaissance , I talked with a neonatologist who trained at my hospital , in Boston , and brought McAllen new skills and technologies for premature babies .
“ I ’ve had nurses come up to me and say , ‘ I never knew these babies could survive , ’ ” he said .
And yet there ’s no evidence that the treatments and technologies available at McAllen are better than those found elsewhere in the country .
The annual reports that hospitals file with Medicare show that those in McAllen and El Paso offer comparable technologies — neonatal intensive - care units , advanced cardiac services , PET scans , and so on .
Public statistics show no difference in the supply of doctors .
Hidalgo County actually has fewer specialists than the national average .
Nor does the care given in McAllen stand out for its quality .
Medicare ranks hospitals on twenty - five metrics of care .
On all but two of these , McAllen ’s five largest hospitals performed worse , on average , than El Paso ’s .
McAllen costs
Medicare seven thousand dollars more per person each year than does the average city in America .
But not , so far as one can tell , because it ’s delivering better health care .
One night , I went to dinner with six McAllen doctors .
All were what you would call bread - and - butter physicians : busy , full - time , private - practice doctors who work from seven in the morning to seven at night and sometimes later , their waiting rooms teeming and their desks stacked with medical charts to review .
Some were dubious when I told them that McAllen was the country ’s most expensive place for health care .
I gave them the spending data from Medicare .
In 1992 , in the McAllen market , the average cost per Medicare enrollee was $ 4,891 , almost exactly the national average .
But since then , year after year , McAllen ’s health costs have grown faster than any other market in the country , ultimately soaring by more than ten thousand dollars per person .
“ Maybe the service is better here , ” the cardiologist suggested .
People can be seen faster and get their tests more readily , he said .
Others were skeptical .
“ I do n’t think that explains the costs he ’s talking about , ” the general surgeon said .
“ It ’s malpractice , ” a family physician who had practiced here for thirty - three years said .
“ McAllen is legal hell , ” the cardiologist agreed .
Doctors order unnecessary tests just to protect themselves , he said .
Everyone thought the lawyers here were worse than elsewhere .
That explanation puzzled me .
Several years ago , Texas passed a tough malpractice law that capped pain - and - suffering awards at two hundred and fifty thousand dollars .
Did n’t lawsuits go down ?
“ Practically to zero , ” the cardiologist admitted .
“ Come on , ” the general surgeon finally said .
“ We all know these arguments are bullshit .
There is overutilization here , pure and simple . ”
Doctors , he said , were racking up charges with extra tests , services , and procedures .
The surgeon came to McAllen in the mid-nineties , and since then , he said , “ the way to practice medicine has changed completely .
Before , it was about how to do a good job .
Now it is about ‘ How much will you benefit ? ’ ”
Everyone agreed that something fundamental had changed since the days when health - care costs in McAllen were the same as those in El Paso and elsewhere .
Yes , they had more technology .
“ But young doctors do n’t think anymore , ” the family physician said .
The surgeon gave me an example .
General surgeons are often asked to see patients with pain from gallstones .
If there are n’t any complications — and there usually are n’t — the pain goes away on its own or with pain medication .
With instruction on eating a lower - fat diet , most patients experience no further difficulties .
But some have recurrent episodes , and need surgery to remove their gallbladder .
Seeing a patient who has had uncomplicated , first - time gallstone pain requires some judgment .
A surgeon has to provide reassurance ( people are often scared and want to go straight to surgery ) , some education about gallstone disease and diet , perhaps a prescription for pain ; in a few weeks , the surgeon might follow up .
But increasingly , I was told , McAllen surgeons simply operate .
The patient was n’t going to moderate her diet , they tell themselves .
The pain was just going to come back .
And by operating they happen to make an extra seven hundred dollars .
I gave the doctors around the table a scenario .
A forty - year - old woman comes in with chest pain after a fight with her husband .
An EKG is normal .
The chest pain goes away .
She has no family history of heart disease .
What did McAllen doctors do fifteen years ago ?
Send her home , they said .
Maybe get a stress test to confirm that there ’s no issue , but even that might be overkill .
And today ?
Today , the cardiologist said , she would get a stress test , an echocardiogram , a mobile Holter monitor , and maybe even a cardiac catheterization .
One of the updates is for the yet to be released Windows 7 Microsoft will issue its biggest ever security update on 13 October .
The update will include 13 bulletins that between them tackle 34 vulnerabilities .
Microsoft said that eight of the bulletins were rated as critical - the most serious sort of vulnerability .
The security patches will close loopholes in many different programs including different editions of Windows , Internet Explorer and some elements of Office .
One update , rated as critical , tackles a loophole in Internet Explorer 8 running under Windows 7 .
The next version of Microsoft 's operating system is due to be released on 22 October .
Most people will get the updates automatically but links to download them can also be found on Microsoft 's security pages .
Once applied to a PC , the machine will need to be re-started before the fixes take effect .
In a blog posting giving an outline of the updates , Jerry Bryant , a Microsoft security expert , said two of the fixes were for problems flagged up in earlier advisories .
One of those loopholes , for the File Transfer Protocol ( FTP ) bundled in with Microsoft 's Internet Information Server , is already being exploited by some hi-tech criminals .
Windows is by far the most popular target for cyber criminals and the vast majority of the millions of malicious programs , including worms and trojans , are aimed at the operating system .
Prior to the bumper October security update , Microsoft 's biggest ever update was released in June 2009 .
That package of 10 fixes tackled 31 vulnerabilities .
Microsoft typically issues its updates on the second Tuesday of every month .
It started this regular monthly update system in late 2003 .

Mr Rajapaksa , seen here with his wife , is riding high after the rebels ' defeat
Sri Lanka will hold both presidential and parliamentary elections before April 2010 , state radio says .
The holding of the presidential poll nearly two years ahead of schedule reflects the government 's popularity .
The announcement comes five months after its military victory over Tamil Tiger rebels .
The move also comes three days after the coalition of President Mahinda Rajapaksa scored its eighth clear victory in provincial polls .
The coalition has now decided the decks are clear for elections by April .
Mr Rajapaksa , who is hugely popular among the Sinhalese majority , is likely to score a clear victory .
The opposition is weak and the president is hoping for a two - thirds majority which would enable him to change the constitution , possibly making provision for more than two successive presidential terms .
He has said that he will wait until after the vote to introduce political reforms aimed , for instance , at addressing Tamil grievances .
Mr Rajapaksa and other top politicians regularly speak of the need for reconciliation .
On Monday the president used the Tamil language to address newly - elected local politicians from the north and pledged to resettle displaced Tamils soon .
But his critics say he is being vague about concrete plans for reconciliation and about the nuts and bolts of reforms - for instance , the degree to which powers might be devolved to Tamil - majority areas .
Dayan Jayatilleka , recently sacked as Sri Lanka 's ambassador to the UN in Geneva , writes in a new article that " there is no informed discussion about the nature of the post - war order " .

Via Media Matters .
This is even more shocking than the usual misleading Fox News coverage .
This is an outright lie , manufactured by someone treated as credible by the rest of the media .
But do n't worry , I 'm positive it will be covered in depth on all the other networks !
( Not . )
On Fox News Sunday , Chris Wallace repeatedly cropped quotes from a Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) document to falsely suggest that the Obama administration is pressuring veterans to end their lives prematurely and to accuse Assistant Secretary of Veterans Affairs Tammy Duckworth of lying about it .
In fact , contrary to Wallace 's false assertions , the document he referred to does not require doctors to direct veterans to what conservatives have labeled the " Death Book for Veterans . "
WALLACE : If I may , Ms. Duckworth , because we have limited time here --
DUCKWORTH : Sure .
WALLACE : Why would a question -- I can understand questions about if you 're in an irreversible coma , do you want us to pull the plug .
But why -- as I asked Mr. Towey -- why would you even have a question in an end - of - life plan -- counseling book about , " If you 're in a wheelchair , if you 're living in a nursing home , does that make life worth living ? "
DUCKWORTH :
Well , I know that before I was injured , I certainly let my husband know that , you know , being in a wheelchair was something that I feared and I was afraid for , but that I also wanted my life prolonged .
This is a tool .
This is a simple tool that was put into place , as I said , under Secretary [ Jim ] Nicholson .
It was something that was used throughout -- and let me make a correction .
We 've not used it since 2007 , when under the Bush administration , we decided to go ahead and revise it .
This checklist is still under revision on a timetable according to a program that was actually decided on under the previous administration .
Because I know that President Bush and Secretary Nicholson and Secretary [ James ]
Peake all valued life .
And that 's what we 're doing , is we 're revising it .
It will be out in 2010 .
It 's not yet out .
So Mr. Towey was not correct by saying --
WALLACE : Secretary Duckworth , that 's just not true .
The VHA put out a directive on July 2 , 2009 , and I want to put up two pages from that directive .
The first one , Page 8 .
" Primary care practitioners are responsible for giving patients pertinent educational materials , e.g. , refer patients to the ' Your Life , Your Choices ' module . "
And on Page 9 , it says if they request more information , " patients may be directed to the exercises in ' Your Life , Your Choices . ' "
So , as of July 2 , 2009 -- last month , more than a month ago -- VA health practitioners were told to refer all veterans -- not just end - of - life veterans , but all 24 million veterans -- to this document , " Your Life , Your Choices . "
DUCKWORTH : Let me make a correction there , Chris .
What our practitioners were told is to refer patients to any type of a tool .
They can use Mr. Towey 's if they want to spend the $ 5 apiece .
VA simply was not willing to buy his booklet at $ 5 per veteran at the time .
WALLACE : But how do you explain --
DUCKWORTH :
This is a decision that was made by the previous administration .
WALLACE : It does n't say , " Give them access to anything . "
I mean , in the specific VA booklet -- it 's only about 15 pages long -- it specifically refers to this booklet twice .
DUCKWORTH :
The only directive that is out there is actually left over from -- I believe it was beginning of 2007 , our advanced planning directive put into place , and it is actually very clear in saying that we need to provide veterans with information that they can make on how they want their care .
You know , this ultimately is about the care and health care for veterans , and we 're actually expanding benefits for veterans .
We 're actually trying to get more priority aid veterans to sign up for VA benefits .
We estimate it will be another 500,000 veterans coming in for benefits .
We are expanding VA benefits to veterans .
It is in our best interest to make sure that every veteran out there receives the care and access to the treatments and everything that he needs .
Because after all , these are the men and women who fought for us and fought -- and they deserve nothing less than the best care .
[...]
DUCKWORTH : Chris , it has not been reinstated .
Let me make it clear :
The only advanced directive that we have is dated February of 2007 .
And it actually encourages veterans to use any type of tool or checklist they would like to .
There are many , many good ones out there .
This " Your Life , Your Choice " [ sic ] is widely used out there , not just within VA .
There are many others that are out there .
And veterans are free to use whatever they would like to use .
We just urge them to use them .
WALLACE : Let me -- I mean , I just -- I have a problem here .
And often -- too often on these shows , we just say , " One person said , and another person said . "
Secretary Duckworth , I do n't know if we 're able in the control room to put up the full screen of the VHA directive , but I 'd like you to put up the first full screen if you can .
In the VHA directive of July 2 , 2009 , it says the following on Page 8 : " Primary care practitioners are responsible for giving patients pertinent educational materials , e.g. , refer patients to the ' Your Life , Your Choices ' module . "
I mean , it 's just there in black and white on the VHA directive of July 2 .
DUCKWORTH : Chris , I 'm sorry .
I can't see that on a monitor in here .
I will tell you that I know for a fact that the only directive signed by Secretary [ Eric ] Shinseki -- I mean , signed by a VA secretary -- was actually signed by Secretary Nicholson , and it 's dated February of 2007 .
What you 're looking at may not actually be a directive .
So I -- since I can't see it -- I 'd be happy to come back and discuss it with you .
The international order that emerged after World War II has rightly been termed the Pax Americana ; it ’s a Washington - led arrangement that has maintained political stability and promoted an open global economic system .
Today , however , the Pax Americana is withering , thanks to what the National Intelligence Council in a recent report described as a “ global shift in relative wealth and economic power without precedent in modern history ” -- a shift that has accelerated enormously as a result of the economic crisis of 2007 - 2009 .
At the heart of this geopolitical sea change is China ’s robust economic growth .
Not because Beijing will necessarily threaten American interests but because a newly powerful China by necessity means a relative decline in American power , the very foundation of the postwar international order .
These developments remind us that changes in the global balance of power can be sudden and discontinuous rather than gradual and evolutionary .
The Great Recession is n’t the cause of Washington ’s ebbing relative power .
But it has quickened trends that already had been eating away at the edifice of U.S. economic supremacy .
Looking ahead , the health of the U.S. economy is threatened by a gathering fiscal storm : exploding federal deficits that could ignite runaway inflation and undermine the dollar .
To avoid these perils , the U.S. will face wrenching choices .
The Obama administration and the Federal Reserve have adopted policies that have dramatically increased both the supply of dollars circulating in the U.S. economy and the federal budget deficit , which both the Brookings Institution and the Congressional Budget Office estimate will exceed $ 1 trillion every year for at least the next decade .
In the short run , these policies were no doubt necessary ; nevertheless , in the long term , they will almost certainly boomerang .
Add that to the persistent U.S. current account deficit , the enormous unfunded liabilities for entitlement programs and the cost of two ongoing wars , and you can see that America ’s long - term fiscal stability is in jeopardy .
As the CBO says : “ Even if the recovery occurs as projected and stimulus bill is allowed to expire , the country will face the highest debt / GDP ratio in 50 years and an increasingly unsustainable and urgent fiscal problem . ”
This spells trouble ahead for the dollar .

The financial privileges conferred on the U.S. by the dollar ’s unchallenged reserve currency status -- its role as the primary form of payment for international trade and financial transactions -- have underpinned the preeminent geopolitical role of the United States in international politics since the end of World War II .
But already the shadow of the coming fiscal crisis has prompted its main creditors , China and Japan , to worry that in coming years the dollar will depreciate in value .
China has been increasingly vocal in calling for the dollar ’s replacement by a new reserve currency .
And Yukio Hatoyama , Japan ’s new prime minister , favors Asian economic integration and a single Asian currency as substitutes for eroding U.S. financial and economic power .
Going forward , to defend the dollar , Washington will need to control inflation through some combination of budget cuts , tax increases and interest rate hikes .
Given that the last two options would choke off renewed growth , the least unpalatable choice is to reduce federal spending .
This will mean radically scaling back defense expenditures , because discretionary nondefense spending accounts for only about 20 % of annual federal outlays .
This in turn will mean a radical diminution of America ’s overseas military commitments , transforming both geopolitics and the international economy .
Since 1945 , the Pax Americana has made international economic interdependence and globalization possible .
Whereas all states benefit absolutely in an open international economy , some states benefit more than others .
In the normal course of world politics , the relative distribution of power , not the pursuit of absolute economic gains , is a country ’s principal concern , and this discourages economic interdependence .
In their efforts to ensure a distribution of power in their favor and at the expense of their actual or potential rivals , states pursue autarkic policies -- those designed to maximize national self - sufficiency -- practicing capitalism only within their borders or among countries in a trading bloc .
Thus a truly global economy is extraordinarily difficult to achieve .
Historically , the only way to secure international integration and interdependence has been for a dominant power to guarantee the security of other states so that they need not pursue autarkic policies or form trading blocs to improve their relative positions .
This suspension of international politics through hegemony has been the fundamental aim of U.S. foreign policy since the 1940s .
The U.S. has assumed the responsibility for maintaining geopolitical stability in Europe , East Asia and the Persian Gulf , and for keeping open the lines of communication through which world trade moves .
Since the Cold War ’s end , the U.S. has sought to preserve its hegemony by possessing a margin of military superiority so vast that it can keep any would - be great power pliant and protected .

Financially , the U.S. has been responsible for managing the global economy by acting as the market and lender of last resort .
But as President Obama acknowledged at the London G - 20 meeting in April , the U.S. is no longer able to play this role , and the world increasingly is looking to China ( and India and other emerging market states ) to be the locomotives of global recovery .
--
Going forward , the fiscal crisis will mean that Washington cannot discharge its military functions as a hegemon either , because it can no longer maintain the power edge that has allowed it to keep the ambitions of the emerging great powers in check .
The entire fabric of world order that the United States established after 1945 -- the Pax Americana -- rested on the foundation of U.S. military and economic preponderance .
Remove the foundation and the structure crumbles .
The decline of American power means the end of U.S. dominance in world politics and the beginning of the transition to a new constellation of world powers .
The result will be profound changes in world politics .
Emerging powers will seek to establish spheres of influence , control lines of communication , engage in arms races and compete for control over key natural resources .
As America ’s decline results in the retraction of the U.S. military role in key regions , rivalries among emerging powers are bound to heat up .
Already , China and India are competing for influence in Central and Southeast Asia , the Middle East and the Indian Ocean .
Even today , when the United States is still acting as East Asia ’s regional pacifier , the smoldering security competition between China and Japan is pushing Japan cautiously to engage in the very kind of “ re-nationalization ” of its security policy that the U.S. regional presence is supposed to prevent .
While still wedded to its alliance with the U.S. , in recent years Tokyo has become increasingly anxious that , as a Rand Corp.
study put it , eventually it “ might face a threat against which the United States would not prove a reliable ally . ”
Consequently , Japan is moving toward dropping Article 9 of its American - imposed Constitution ( which imposes severe constraints on Japan ’s military ) , building up its forces and quietly pondering the possibility of becoming a nuclear power .

Although the weakening of the Pax Americana will not cause international trade and capital flows to come to a grinding halt , in coming years we can expect states to adopt openly competitive economic policies as they are forced to jockey for power and advantage in an increasingly competitive security and economic environment .
The world economy will thereby more closely resemble that of the 1930s than the free - trade system of the post - 1945 Pax Americana .
The coming end of the Pax Americana heralds a crisis for capitalism .
The coming era of de-globalization will be defined by rising nationalism and mercantilism , geopolitical instability and great power competition .
In other words , having enjoyed a long holiday from history under the Pax Americana , international politics will be headed back to the future .
Four people across the city were killed by gunfire in a 12 - hour span , police said today .
One person was found dead about 7 a.m. in Glassell Park , and three people were killed in separate shootings Saturday night in Gramercy Park , West Adams and Hyde Park , authorities said .
Los Angeles police said the man who was found dead early today , in the 3400 block of Drew Street , appeared to be about 35 .
He had a gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene .
He has not been identified .
The first of Saturday night ’s three shootings occurred at 8:10 p.m. in the 1700 block of West Century Boulevard when Samuel Leonard walked out of a liquor store to go to his car and was confronted by another man , said Officer Norma Eisenman of the Los Angeles Police Department .
Leonard , 22 , was shot multiple times without provocation and tried to flee on foot .
He collapsed at a nearby McDonald’s .
The suspect fled in a red pickup truck , Eisenman said .
Leonard was taken to a hospital , where he died , Eisenman said .
About 10 minutes later in the West Adams district , a man was shot and killed as he approached the front door of a home in the 2900 block of Rimpau Boulevard , police said .
Larick Matheson , 58 , was apparently trying to pick up a car key from someone in the home , police said .
The suspect was standing in the driveway when Matheson came to the home with a friend , Eisenman said .
When Matheson got out of the car , the suspect approached him and shot him multiple times before fleeing on foot , Eisenman said .
Matheson was taken to a hospital , where he died .
Another man was shot and killed just before midnight in Hyde Park , police said .
In that incident , three people were standing outside in the 6400 block of 7th Avenue when someone emerged from a vehicle and began firing a rifle at them .
One man , Brandon Jamal Perry , 17 , was shot in the face .
He was transported to a hospital , where he died .
A second victim was shot in the back and a third was shot in the leg , Eisenman said .
Both were receiving medical care at the same hospital .
[ UPDATE : Police said a fourth person was also shot and was treated at the scene and released .
The second and third victims were expected to survive , police said . ]

Filament , a magazine for women featuring semi-naked men , launched earlier this year to widespread media coverage .
Issue 1 featured three photo sets of men , none of whom removed their trousers .
While some questioned whether women would even buy visual erotica , Filament 's readers soon put them straight .
Not only were women buying it , they were asking for more explicit pictures .
That demand brought Filament smack up against the biggest problem in providing visual erotica for straight women : the pervasive nervousness about depictions of aroused men .
Previous attempts to offer erotic imagery to women flopped when publications such as For Women and Playgirl offered only photography that many believed fell short of what women wanted from an adult mag .
Filament , responding to reader feedback , had planned to include a photo set of an aroused man in their second ( September ) issue .
It 's not illegal to print images of erections but the Obscene Publications
Act is notoriously vague .
After taking legal advice , Filament intended to make a test case of sorts .
Its printers , however , refused , citing potential objections from " the women 's / religious sectors " .
As a new , independent publisher , Filament can't yet afford more liberal - minded printers willing to tackle the taboo on tumescence .
It 's the second major hurdle for Filament , which has already been turned down by numerous UK distributors refusing to handle a women 's magazine with a man on the cover .
When set against the plethora of men's lifestyle and top - shelf magazines featuring scantily clad and open - legged women , the struggles faced by Filament highlight a deeply entrenched sexism : men can look at women but women cannot look at men .
Attempts to even out this disparity often lead to cries that two wrongs do n't make a right ; that countering the prevalence of eroticised women by adding men to the mix legitimises sexist objectification .
But there 's nothing inherently sexist about depicting nudity .
It 's sexist when only women are deemed to signify the erotic ; it 's sexist when eroticised images of women are so normalised and widespread that women stand to be viewed first and foremost as sex objects – their value inextricably linked to their sexual desirability .
The sexism is in the inequality .
In challenging a culture that positions women as sex- products for men , Filament is n't seeking to turn the tables in an act of vengeance .
Instead , it 's asking for women to be acknowledged as human beings who can look and lust just as men can .
While some contend the lack of female - oriented erotica reflects a lack of demand , claiming the free market would prevail if women wanted such material , Filament 's experience of cockblocking proves otherwise .
Perhaps what 's most insidious in this saga is that the market 's refusal to admit Filament reinforces an idea of female sexuality which justifies that very refusal .
The absence of visual erotica for women on shelves crammed with magazines where women are products for male consumers , reduces female desire to the less - interested counterpart of male desire .
The deficit positions women as the providers of sex for perpetually horny dudes .
And so , runs the self - fulfilling logic , of course women do n't want magazines targeting their desire .
Women do n't have desire , see ?
They merely receive it .
How do we know ?
Just check out those magazine shelves .
S.C. Gov. Mark Sanford may be an amateur Romeo , but it looks like he ’s got nothing on his appointment to the S.C. State Board of Education .
Kristin Maguire , an Upstate evangelical and one of South Carolina ’s most respected social conservatives , has been one of the governor ’s closest education policy advisors for years .
She ’s also Sanford ’s appointment to the S.C. Board of Education , which last year elected her its Chairwoman .
What else is she ?
The prolific author of hardcore erotic fiction on the Internet , according to documents provided to the governor ’s office earlier this summer and later obtained by FITS .
Maguire , a professed Christian who home - schools her four children , declined to comment for our story but did not deny that she had previously frequented websites that feature such X - rated material .
Maguire believes that a former friend is leaking the information to the media in an effort to ruin her political career .
As for the specific writings alleged to have flowed from Maguire ’s pen , most have been deleted from the Internet .
FITS was able to use conversations in various Internet chat rooms , however , to link at least two “ erotic stories ” to Maguire ’s alleged pen name , “ Bridget Keeney . ”
From there , numerous similarities between “ Bridget ” and Maguire emerged , including commonalities in age , geographic location , engineering background , hobbies ( knitting , for example ) and number of children .
One comment left in an erotic chat room by “ Bridget ” even reveals the name of a professor who was at Clemson University ’s College of Engineering at the time when Maguire was a student there , while another comment references a specific medical procedure that Maguire underwent several years ago .
Confronted with these numerous identifying markers , Maguire spoke to FITS of difficult times in her life and acknowledged that she had visited certain websites where such material was posted and reviewed .
She did not admit to authoring erotic fiction , however .
A source familiar with Sanford ’s response to receiving this information tells a different story , however .
This source says that Maguire emphatically denied that the writing samples were hers , and that she and the governor ’s chief of staff , Scott English , immediately set about to ensure that none of the material remained on the Internet .
None of the writings attributed to Maguire are illegal , obviously , and none of them coincide with her tenure as Chairwoman of the State Board .
But they do coincide with her extensive interaction with the Governor ’s Office during Sanford ’s first term .
That part of Maguire ’s life is now facing intense scrutiny – especially in light of the way Sanford ’s office appears to have helped put a lid on the information being leaked about Maguire .
For example , several sources have related to FITS an incident involving Maguire and Scott English at a Columbia area bar at the end of the 2004 legislative session .
“ She was giving him a lap dance , ” says a witness at the bar .
“ There ’s no other way to describe it . ”
Another former Sanford staffer tells FITS that Maguire once unbuttoned her blouse and hiked up her skirt in front of him to show off her see - thru , light blue underwear .
This incident allegedly occurred not at a bar , but inside the governor ’s office – at the unoccupied desk of First Lady Jenny Sanford , no less .
“ Lies , lies , lies , lies , ” a friend of Maguire ’s told FITS .
“ These are all lies .
That is not Kristin and shame on any person who says that it is . ”
Maguire ’s involvement in S.C. politics goes well beyond her leadership of the S.C. Board of Education or her involvement with the Sanford administration .
She is an executive committeewoman of the S.C. Republican Party , as well as the woman responsible for drafting the party ’s education platform .
Prior to being elected Chairwoman , Maguire led the panel responsible for approving education standards taught in South Carolina classrooms , including what textbooks were to be used and how teachers were to be certified .
She has been a strong supporter of “ abstinence only ” sex education , as well .
When Maguire was elected to lead the S.C. Board , her appointment was hailed as a victory for social conservatives and feted on Christian blogs and websites across the Southeast .
Maguire ’s alleged alter - ego would obviously be quite a contrast from her carefully - cultivated public persona .
“ I fantasize about being the ‘ second ’ F ( female ) in a MFF ( threesome ) where the other two are in a committed relationship , ” the sultry “ Bridget ” writes on one post .
“ I would like to focus on pleasuring her and ‘ enhancing ’ their intercourse … ”
So , did Sanford ’s office help Maguire engage in a cover -up of this highly - sensitive information ?
Or , as English told FITS , was the Governor ’s Office simply reeling from the distraction caused by the governor ’s own sex scandal ?
Who knows , but shortly after Sanford ’s office was informed of the alleged connection between Maguire and “ Bridget , ” her writings began disappearing from the web .

For the five years that the wood bungalow next door has been empty , Darlene Banks has kept an eye on it as Halloween approaches .
She was n’t expecting anyone to burn it weeks sooner .
But the dilapidated house on Detroit ’s east side went up in flames one weekend in early October , along with 10 other houses on six adjacent streets — an apparent challenge to the city ’s annual mobilization to prevent arsons over the Halloween period that has become infamous as Devils ’
Night .
The stakes are even higher this year , as the city already devastated by the exodus of jobs and unemployment of around 27 percent moves toward the Halloween weekend .
Along with tens of thousands of long - vacant homes and buildings , the more than 40,000 others recently emptied by the foreclosure crisis could present tempting targets .
And the recent rash of fires caught many people , like Banks , off guard .
“ I hope they do n’t bother it again , ” she said of the partially blackened shell a few yards away .
Had the two houses been closer , she said , her modest brick bungalow “ probably would be gone up in smoke . ”
Known as “ Mischief ” and “ Cabbage ” nights in other parts of the country , Devils ’ Night in Detroit once brought pranks such as egging houses .
But the tricks took a sinister turn in the late 1970s .
Devils ’
Night fed on its own notoriety and the city ’s abundant supply of abandoned buildings .
At its peak in 1984 , 810 fires were reported over the three - day Halloween period .
Flames high in the night sky were seen on television broadcasts around the world .
Police and firefighters became more vigilant , eyeing streets with large swaths of empty houses .
They were joined by a growing army of volunteers patrolling their neighborhoods in an anti-arson campaign that was dubbed Angels ’ Night in 1996 .
The patrols are a success .
Of the 136 fires reported last Halloween , 94 were believed to be intentionally set .
That ’s down from 142 fires reported in the same period in 2007 , with 111 being suspicious .
Fires overall fell between 2007 and 2008 , Detroit ’s fire department says .
It responded to 32,351 in 2008 , down 3 percent from a year earlier .
That included 1,230 arsons , a drop of nearly 17 percent .
But the 11 houses that burned within 90 minutes on Oct. 11 have authorities concerned about an arsonist at work before the three - night neighborhood patrols begin Oct. 29 .
And this year , there are simply many more houses to watch .
Three years ago , about 70,000 properties in Detroit were vacant .
Massive job losses in the auto industry and manufacturing have forced thousands more homeowners into foreclosure .
“ With the foreclosure issue and the abandoned homes , it becomes a temptation to some people , ” said Luther Keith , executive director of Arise Detroit ! , a coalition of community groups .
“ We know we have mischief makers .
They do n’t care about lighting the house that could destroy someone else ’s property , or hurt or kill someone . ”
Mayor Dave Bing , who has devoted most of his attention to a $ 300 million budget deficit , ca n’t afford to be seen as lax on the issue just before the Nov. 3 election in which he is seeking a full term .
He began planning this summer and expects 50,000 volunteers — about the same number as in past years — to help patrol by car and on foot .
Curfews for anyone under 18 again will be in place .
“ Foreclosed and abandoned homes are always a concern for the police and fire departments , ” Bing said .
“ This year is no different .
While we are in the midst of an economic crisis , there is no excuse to not protect the city from those who want to do it harm . ”
Police patrols have increased in Banks ’ neighborhood .
Known arsonists are being tracked down , said Police Chief Warren Evans , who does n’t believe the rash of fires are precursors “ of things to come . ”
“ I think we ’ve earned an Angels ’ Night reputation , ” he said .
“ Who knows where these phenomena start , the idea of acting a fool on these nights , anyway ? ”
The series of arsons frightened Willie Mae Foreman , who woke to find that the house across the street had been torched .
Two more vacant homes are next door .
Whoever set that house on fire “ could have got the one next door and I would have been hit , ” said Foreman , speaking through protective metal bars on the door of the house she has lived in since 1973 .
In the past , neighborhood patrols kept arsonists at bay over the Halloween period , she said .
But “ after this happened the other night , I ’m fearful . ”

* State - owned firms may default on commodity hedges - report
* Bankers dismayed , confused by report ; seek more details
* Lawyers question legality of the move
* Traders suspect lurking losses may have prompted warning ( Adds analysts comments )
By Eadie Chen and Chen Aizhu
BEIJING , Aug 31 ( Reuters ) - A report that Chinese state - owned companies will be allowed to walk away from loss - making commodity derivative trades provoked anger and dismay among investment bankers on Monday as they feared it may set a damaging precedent .
The State - owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission , the regulator and nominal shareholder for state - owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , told six foreign banks that SOEs reserved the right to default on contracts , Caijing magazine quoted an unnamed industry source as saying in an article published on Saturday .
While the details of the report could not be confirmed , it was Monday ’s hot topic in financial circles from Shanghai to Singapore as commodity marketers feared that companies holding underwater price hedges could simply renege on the deals , costing banks millions of dollars in profit .
The warning from SASAC follows a series of measures from Beijing this year to crack down on the sale of derivative products by foreign banks to Chinese enterprises , principally big consumers , who bought protection against higher prices last year only to watch the market collapse -- leaving them with losses .
While many companies including top airlines have come clean on the losses , some analysts fear another wave may follow .
“ I would n’t be surprised if more state firms emerge with big derivatives trading losses , otherwise SASAC would n’t come out with such a radical move , ” said a Hong Kong - based derivatives analyst , who like most other industry officials and bankers declined to be named due to the high sensitivity of the issue .
A SASAC media official said on Monday that he was waiting for the “ relevant department ’s ” official comment before he can clarify to media .
A government official said that the Bureau of Financial Supervision and Evaluation under SASAC was handling the issue .
The official declined to be named and did not elaborate .
Spokespersons at Goldman Sachs GS.N and UBS UBSN .VX declined comment , and media officials at Morgan Stanley MS.N and JPMorgan JPM.N were not immediately available for comment .
All are major global providers of commodity risk management .
No bank were named in the Caijing report .
The SASAC media officer also declined to identify any specific banks .
“ It ’s a handful of companies who are being encouraged by regulators to re-negotiate , ” said a second banking source .
“ It ’s outrageous , but it ’s China , so everyone is treading very carefully . ”
DAMAGING PRECEDENT
For banks that are hoping to sell more derivatives hedges in China , the world ’s fastest - expanding major economy and top commodities consumer , the danger goes beyond the immediate risk to existing contracts to the longer - term precedent that suggests Chinese companies can simply renege on deals when they like .
The report follows an order from SASAC in July that required all central government - controlled state companies engaged in trading derivatives to make quarterly reports about their investments , including details of holdings and performance .
But the reported letter opened several important questions that could not immediately be answered .
“ If we were among the banks receiving that letter , we would be very angry .
But now the key is to find out more details on the letter :
In whose name the letter was issued , the government or the corporate ’s ?
And under what was the reason for defaulting ? ” said a Singapore - based marketing executive with a foreign bank .
The source , whose bank did not receive a letter , said that Air China , China Eastern and shipping giant COSCO -- among the Chinese companies that have reported huge derivatives losses since last year -- had issued almost identical notices to banks .
“ If it ’s in the name of the government , the impact will be very negative , ” said the source , who declined to be named .
Beijing - based derivatives lawyers said the so - called “ legal letter ” has no legal standing -- SASAC as a shareholder has no business relationship with international banks .
“ It ’s like the father suddenly told the creditors of his debt - ridden son that his son wo n’t pay any of his debt , ” said a lawyer from the derivatives risks committee of the Beijing Lawyers Association .
It ’s also unclear why Chinese state firms , which have complained that their foreign banks sometimes did not disclose full information of potential risks when selling them complicated products , did not seek redress through the courts .

Off the Beat : Bruce Byfield 's Blog
Bruce Byfield
A month ago , I wrote an article about sexism in the free and open source software ( FOSS ) community .
The result has been educational , to say the least .
It 's one thing to know about issues intellectually , and quite another to plunge headlong into a firestorm of reactions .
So what have I learned exactly ?
To start with , while members of the FOSS community like to think of themselves as rational beings , when subjects like gender issues are raised , emotion swamps logic to an alarming degree .
This tendency shows up occasionally among feminists in over - reactions , such as the call by srlinuxx on Tuxmachines.org to boycott Ubuntu because its founder Mark Shuttleworth made some sexist remarks in his LinuxCon keynote .
However , such reactions are understandable , given that the issue is just now being discussed openly after years of people gritting their teeth in silence .
They are also a minority of reactions .
More balanced responses to incidences of sexism are expressed regularly on such sites as Geek Feminism , where the regular bloggers show a consistent sense of the appropriate level of response , and seem dedicated to constructive activism .
But the real flood of emotion comes from the anti-feminists and the average men who would like to deny the importance of feminist issues in FOSS .
Raise the subject of sexism , and you are met with illogic that I can only compare to that of the tobacco companies trying to deny the link between their products and cancer .
Because I took a feminist stance in public , I have been abused in every way possible -- being called irrelevant , a saboteur , coward , homosexual , and even a betrayer of the community .
I know that many women in the community have been attacked much more savagely than I have , so I 'm not complaining .
Nor am I a stranger to readers who disagree with me , but the depth of reaction has taken me back more than once .
I think the reaction is an expression of denial more than anything else .
Personal vs. Institutionalized Sexism
That brings up another point I 've learned : people who are not consciously sexist themselves tend to be unable to see institutionalized sexism around them .
They are not aware of any prejudice against women in themselves , so how could there be any sexism involved ?
They seem unaware that institutions and customs can be sexist simply by what they value or how they operate , that even something like a discourse developed by men talking to men can institutionalize sexism .
Nor do they understand that , by simply accepting such institutions or ways of acting , they become supporters of sexism .
For instance , I am currently part of an email conversation with a prominent FOSS community member who has been pilloried who is hurt and baffled that I ( or anyone else ) could apply the word " sexism " to them .
Their reasoning ?
They did not intend to be sexist , so therefore they can't possibly be .
Therefore , labelling their behavior as unacceptable is unfair , they argue .
The fact that , in context , their actions and remarks could not possibly be described in any other way honestly does not seem to have occurred to them .
No matter what I say , they remain hurt and baffled -- and , like so many , deeply in denial .
Cutting across existing lines
But probably the largest lesson for me has been how understanding of gender issues cuts across other connections .
Having spent much of my life in academia before becoming a freelance writer , I always assumed that , if you knew one or two opinions that a person held , you had a strong chance of knowing what their opinions were on other subjects .
For instance , if someone worked for left wing political candidates and promoted recycling , they were probably concerned about recycling and racism as well .
Similarly , I assumed that , in the FOSS community , if you were a free software supporter , you were concerned about social justice and would therefore be against sexism as well .
No doubt I was naive , but that turns out not to be the case .
Developers are just as likely to be feminist as testers , technical writers , and artists .
More importantly , people in the open source camp are just as likely to be feminist as free software supporters .
In fact , to my chagrin , if anything free software supporters are often more likely to be hostile to feminism than open source supporters .
While all sorts of people claim that no problem exists , in the last month , I 've found that free software supporters are the most likely to accuse me of betrayal for raising the issue , or to argue that legitimate responses to sexist behavior is part of a deliberate effort at character assassination .
Not all free software supporters act this way , let me emphasize , but a large and vocal minority certainly do .
I 'm not sure , but I think that the logic here is that if you are already part of an idealistic movement , your actions must be above criticism in every other sense .
From that assumption , perhaps it follows that anyone questioning any part of your actions must have the most Machiavellian of motives .
The fact that some people who raise issues do seem to enjoy fault - finding because of past grievances only makes this assumption all the easier to hold .
With such painful lessons coming my way , this last month has been shocking , disappointing , and -- above all else -- exhausting .
I 've lost respect for some people I thought I knew , and gained respect for others .
At times , I 've been happy to escape into writing a purely technical article to take a brief holiday from the endless angst .
But am I sorry I raised the issue , or got involved in the discussions when other people did ?
Not in the least .
I was convinced a month ago by the facts that FOSS has a problem with sexism , and the reactions I 've seen have proved the accuracy of that conviction a hundred times over .
It 's not a comforting conviction , but it 's a true one .
Besides , I keep telling myself , if what I see is offensive to me , at least it does not directly oppress me .
Compare to female feminists , I have it easy .
So what right do I have to complain ?
Anyway , I 'm not very good at lying to myself .
Since very few other writers about FOSS care to approach the topic , I expect that I 'll be writing and acting on my convictions from time to time in the future , no matter what reactions I get .

Video from Halifax shows an angry sea
The Canadian Press is reporting not much damage from Hurricane Bill
, which pretty much behaved as forecast .
It paralleled the coast of Nova Scotia , keeping the deteriorating eye offshore on Sunday .
I found the seas at the mouth of the Halifax Harbor got up to about 32 feet . .
I ’ve got to think that there was some damage to shore assets such as boardwalks , marinas and some roads .
Video of giant waves at Peggy ’s Cove ( watch the waves get bigger and bigger ) supported the fact that there was damage to some cool places there .
There were some power outages but the storm had weakened a bunch as it was in the transition from a tropical cyclone to an extratropical storm .
So , stronger winds aloft were not really all that suited to be brought down to the surface .
Offshore I saw wind gusts at some buoys to 70 kts and seas upward of 40 feet .
The International Space Station captured some cool video of Hurricane Bill .
Cape
Cod video shows some pretty good wave action and even some surfers showed up .
In North Carolina , a lifeguard had to save a swimmer who did n’t heed the warnings of riptide dangers , as this video shows .
There was some pretty good beach erosion in New Jersey .
Some people were swept out to sea by huge waves in Maine .
All were rescued but a little girl later died .
I have yet to figure out why people do this .
In Hurricane Ike , several people thought it would be cool to have their picture taken with crashing waves behind them on the seawall
For a few , that photograph was the last anyone saw of them .
And there were lots of people standing there with small children .
People have no concept of the power of water .
Well , Bill is off to the North Sea , though I still think it may swing back around to Spain or Portugal .
Either way , it did its job of transporting heat and moisture from the tropical regions to the polar regions and it did so without really hitting land .
It was a good hurricane .
There is a new Tropical Disturbance that I was n’t overly consumed with because it was a wave interacting with an upper low .
But , I ’ll tell you what .. the satellite image looks pretty interesting .
Worth watching .

FORECASTER BROWN / ROBERTS
Wal - Mart : Violence and Lies
The night of September 2nd , Yu Xiaochun ( 余小春 ) who was viciously beaten by Wal - Mart workers , passed away after three days of rescuing efforts by the doctors .
Since the exposure of the incident , Wal - Mart murder case was the hot topic of the internet forums .
On August 30th 7 pm , 37 - year - old Yu Xiaochun went to Wal - Mart supercenter in Jingdezhen plaza .
When she walked out of the store , five Wal - Mart employees ( four men and one woman ) chased up to her .
They accused Yu of stealing and demanded her to show receipt .
Because those guys were not wearing Wal - Mart uniforms , Yu snatched the receipt back .
As a result , five employees beat her up senselessly to the ground .
They would not even stop went Yu ’s family was kneeling at the scene begging .
Eventually the police showed up and rushed her to the hospital .
But Yu still passed away 3 days later .
For the details of this news coverage in September check out “ Wal - Mart Workers Beat Customer To Death ” by ESWN
This article “ Wal - Mart : Violence and Lies ” is the cover story of the Faren Magazine October issue .
It reviewed this incident attempting to uncover the root cause of such bloody violence and the ugly truth of Wal - Mart .
Wal - Mart workers beat customer to death , obviously was not an accident , but what was it that really made this retail giant to be forever tainted ?
After Yu Xiaochun passed away for 25 days , most people still were not clear on what really happened on August 30 afternoon – from Jingdezhen Wal - Mart Supercenter to Yu Xiaochun ’s home was only one small street apart .
In such a short distance , Yu Xiaochun , on her way back home from shopping at Wal - Mart was followed and beaten to death by Wal - Mart workers .
Just like one of the regularly occurred disputes between the Wal - Mart employees and the customers , they suspected Yu Xiaochun of shoplifting , followed her and even assaulted this 37 - year - old defenseless woman to death .
Whether if Yu Xiaochun shoplifted from the supermarket or not , we obviously have to wait till the result of the Jingdezhen police ’s investigation .
However , in the hazy statement issued by Wal - Mart China headquarters , people could see this worldwide retail giant not only did not have the slightest remorse , but Wal - Mart also demonstrated their arrogance and indifference –
They were always trying to dress up the Wal - Mart employees murder case into an accident , they never thought about these evil actions may be rooted in the Wal - Mart ’s culture which lacked caring and compassion .
To those customers who have been shopping in Wal - Mart , no one believed Yu Xiaochun ’s death was just an accident .
Wal - Mart ’s distrust towards the Chinese customers could be seen in every segment of the shopping experience .
If the customer was buying products like toothpaste , during the check out , cashier often opened boxes to see if customer had switched the products inside ; even when purchasing an entire case of milk , cashier could also open up the original manufactory seals , just to see whether the customer had altered the package .
As for suspecting customer of shoplifting and conducting illegal searches in Wal - Mart were also not uncommon .
Perhaps the death of Yu Xiaochun still cannot bring Wal - Mart into disrepute , but this retail giant ’s long time slogan “ save money , live better ” will not be as attractive as before , at least not in China anymore .
Even in its mother land – the United Sates , Wal - Mart always played a contradictory role of most apprised yet being hated at the same time .
In one hand Wal - Mart ’s attractive “ everyday low prices ” saved consumers a lot of money , but in the other hand it mercilessly squeezed profits from suppliers and employees , also shamelessly became one of the few world ’s top 500 companies without a worker union .
Because of this , even the famous couple – Barack Obama and his wife refused to shop at Wal - Mart .
President Obama certainly is not deliberately making the nation ’s largest private employer ’s life more difficult , it ’s just he has already seen through the inherent toxins of the Wal - Mart corporate culture long ago .
In his view , it is not possible for a company who refuses and looks down upon workers union , to care for and to have compassions to people ’s rights .
Wal - Mart has become powerful in the United States .
More than 300 billion dollars annually in sales , even makes the national income of some small countries in the world look insignificant .
This is not only making Wal - Mart the king of the global channel networks , but also making it easy for controlling the industrial chain and changing people ’s daily lives .
Wal - Mart also entered China precisely with this powerful face .
In the mid-nineties of the last century , Wal - Mart already was developing an ambitious plan to enter China , and to hope in the emerging Chinese market to duplicate its success in the United States , including the strong logistics and distribution , advanced technology and careful management .
However , blindly copying , plus China ’s unique soil , Wal - Mart quickly lost its ways .
Although China already had powerful production capacity in this period of time , but was lack of effective distribution channels .
Wal - Mart saw this clearly , and changed the United Sates effective purchasing , made full use of its advantages to greatly profit in the downstream consumer market , at the same time kept “ squeezing ” profits from the upstream manufacturers , for example , low balling the purchase price , asking for market admission fees and so on .
For suppliers who have dealt with Wal - Mart before , all with no exception felt the toughness and cruelness of Wal - Mart .
At the top position of the retail market , though Mal - Mart ’s market share in China was not too high , still had a very strong dominant power .
Such power allowed them to force unequal and unfair trade to any vendors , and the majority of the suppliers kept their resentment to themselves .
In term of this , Wal - Mart ’s so called “ everyday low prices ” was fully established on top of the relentless “ exploitation ” of the suppliers .
For three consecutive years , Wal - Mart purchased more than 100 billion dollars worth of goods from China , which for the thousands of domestic suppliers is truly an irresistible temptation .
However , we must think about it :
Who is controlling the suppliers ?
Who is controlling the industrial chain ?
Whom did the cost of “ everyday low prices ” really pass onto ?
Is such “ low price ” really low price ?
Because I despise politics in general , and the two major parties in this country in particular , I go through life constantly bemused by all the weight that people put on partisan political loyalties and on adherence to the normative demarcations the parties promote .
Henry Adams observed that “ politics , as a practice , whatever its professions , has always been the systematic organization of hatreds . ”
This marshalling of hatreds is not the whole of politics , to be sure , but it is an essential element .
Thus , Democrats encourage people to hate big corporations , and Republicans encourage people to hate welfare recipients .
Of course , it ’s all a fraud , designed to distract people from the overriding reality of political life , which is that the state and its principal supporters are constantly screwing the rest of us , regardless of which party happens to control the presidency and the Congress .
Amid all the partisan sound and fury , hardly anybody notices that political reality boils down to two “ parties ” : ( 1 ) those who , in one way or another , use state power to bully and live at the expense of others ; and ( 2 ) those unfortunate others .
Even when politics seems to involve life - and - death issues , the partisan divisions often only obscure the overriding political realities .
So , Democrats say that anti-abortion Republicans , who claim to have such tremendous concern for saving the lives of the unborn , have no interest whatever in saving the lives of those already born , such as the poor children living in the ghetto .
And Republicans say that Democrats , who claim to have such tremendous concern for the poor , systematically contribute to the perpetuation of poverty by the countless taxes and regulations they load onto business owners who would otherwise be in better position to hire and train the poor and thereby to hasten their escape from poverty .
If the unborn children happen to be living in the wombs of women on whom U.S. bombs and rockets rain down in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , however , all Republican concerns for the unborn evaporate completely , as do the Democrats ’ concerns for the poor children living in the selfsame bombarded villages .
Both parties ’ positions would seem to rest on very flexible and selective morality , if indeed either party may be said to have any moral basis at all , notwithstanding their chronic public displays of “ moral ” wailing and gnashing of teeth .
In any event , the parties ’ principles of hatred have never passed the sniff test ; indeed , they reek of hypocrisy .
Thus , while railing against the “ corporate rich , ” the Democrats rely heavily on the financial support of Hollywood moguls and multi-millionaire trial lawyers , among other fat cats .
And the Republicans , while denouncing the welfare mother who makes off with a few hundred undeserved bucks a month , vociferously support the hundreds of billions of dollars in welfare channeled to Lockheed Martin , Boeing , and General Electric , among many other companies , via larcenous “ defense ” contracts , Export - Import Bank subsidies , and countless other forms of government support for “ national security ” and service to “ the public interest ” as Republicans conceive of these nebulous , yet rhetorically useful entities .
Notice , too , that although ordinary Democrats and Republicans often harbor intense mutual hatreds , the party leaders in Congress rub shoulders quite amiably as a rule .
Regardless of which party has control , the loyal opposition can always be counted on to remain ever so loyal and ready to cut a deal .
And why not ?
These ostensible political opponents are engaged in a process of plunder from which the bigwigs in both parties can expect to profit , whatever the ebb and flow of party politics .
At bottom , the United States has a one - party state , cleverly designed to disguise the country ’s true class division and to divert the masses from a recognition that unless you are a political insider connected with one of the major parties , you almost certainly will be ripped off on balance .
Such exploitation , after all , is precisely what the state and the political parties that operate it are for .
Yet , rather than hating the predatory state , the masses have been conditioned to love this blood - soaked beast and even , if called upon , to lay down their lives and the lives of their children on its behalf .
From my vantage point on the outside , peering in , I am perpetually mystified that so many people are taken in by the phony claims and obscurantist party rhetoric .
As the song says , “ clowns to the left of me , jokers to the right , ” but unlike the fellow in the song , I am not “ stuck in the middle . ”
Instead , I float above all of this wasted emotion , looking down on it with disgust and sadness .
Moreover , as an economist , I am compelled to regret such an enormously inefficient allocation of hatred .

BATTLE SCARS : Robert Davis has had 25 skin - cancer surgeries over the past four years and he has the scars to prove it .
He also suffers from lymphoma and smokes marijuana to counteract his lost appetite .
Rich looks like comedian Ron White — if someone wrapped him in an “ Oaksterdam ” T - shirt .
He asked not to have his full name published in this story .
Why ?
Rich founded Cannafornia Health Services earlier this year , one of a handful of medical marijuana delivery services in SLO County .
Such services are now one of the only ways for patients to obtain medical marijuana in SLO County because brick - and - mortar dispensaries are forbidden in any incorporated city and the risk of law - enforcement crackdowns deters setting up dispensaries in unincorporated areas .
Rich is nervous .
He ’s nervous for himself , and he ’s nervous for his family , even if he sometimes brushes aside the risks that come with his line of work .
There was the time he got a suspicious call about setting up an exchange that would have gone beyond the legal boundaries of medical - marijuana laws — he did n’t go through with it .
Then there was the time he got a call from a couple of guys he believed were setting him up for a robbery — he avoided them .
Such situations are common , he said .
Another time he zigzagged off the highway onto urban streets to lose someone tailing him whom he believed was either a cop or someone looking to rob him .
He still worries about being followed or pulled over and usually has his eyes glued to his car ’s rearview mirrors .
New Times tagged along with Rich for a day of deliveries .
He began the day at a small South County diner along with one of his drivers , who asked to go by L.C .
She was short and thin , wearing an overly baggy shirt that dangled loosely across her shoulders .
Sitting over a small breakfast and talking above the echoes of family chatter and clanging silverware , L.C. spent most of the morning hunched and rubbing her neck .
She said she has chronic pain caused by a nearly severed vertebrae in her neck .
Her brother died about two years ago after 15 years of taking many of the same pain medications L.C. also took .
She blamed his death on those drugs .
“ So here I am in the exact same shadow , ” she said .
L.C. switched to marijuana for her pain , which she said , not only worked , but helped her detox off fentanyl and OxyContin .
After breakfast , L.C. left and New Times headed out on the road with Rich .
Despite medical marijuana ’s pseudo - legal status in California , Rich sees the law as a mild protection from being arrested .
“ It ’s an illegal substance .
You ’re in possession of it , ” he said while driving around SLO County in a large truck .
He carried a small pizza box where he stored the marijuana for deliveries .
“ It ’s really not more that the anxiety goes away , ” he said , “ it ’s that you get used to the anxiety . ”
The service is n’t a business and makes no profit , Rich stressed ; it ’s a collective of patients and growers .
He likes to call it a collective on wheels .
Basically , Rich is boring for someone who deals with drugs — legal or otherwise .
Rich said he sees new delivery services start up every few weeks and disappear just as quickly .
He believes most of the failed services lose interest because medical marijuana delivery is n’t as glamorous or profitable as the illegal variety .
Another big blockade is that fledgling drivers can be careless and fudge the guidelines provided under medical - marijuana laws .
On Aug. 25 , Bruce James Guerin was arrested in Santa Maria for possession of about 156 grams of marijuana “ packaged for sales , ” according to a Santa Maria Police Department news release .
Guerin was the former operator of “ Impressions , ” another SLO County delivery service .
Guerin could not be reached for comment and every number associated with his name was disconnected or somehow unreachable , except one : “ Hi , this is James , ” a recorded voice says on the outgoing message .
“ Thanks for calling .
Sorry I could n’t get back to everybody last week — unavoidable . ”
The fear of arrest makes Rich utterly paranoid .
He wears his seatbelt , drives with the flow of traffic , never plays music loudly , keeps the car clean , and always travels with a good - luck pair of aviator sunglasses and a ready supply of cigarettes .
Rich is basically the square among his friends , even when he ’s delivering pot throughout the county .
“ Other people can do screwy stuff and get away with it , ” Rich said from behind the wheel .
“ Me , if I do screwy stuff , I ’m going to get arrested . ”
Screwy stuff means doing anything not spelled out in either the voter initiative Proposition 215 , which decriminalized medical marijuana in California in 1996 ; or SB 420 , which further clarified the initiative and spelled out how medical marijuana could be legally distributed .
Rich said he abides by those tenuous laws because what he does is n’t recognized federally nor truly given carte blanche by local law enforcement .
Rich used to be a chemical dependency counselor .
Before that , he worked in a mental hospital .
He ’s worked with abusive parents and their children ; he ’s worked as a high - school counselor .
Rich said he ’s seen the full spectrum of drug use and abuse .
After a career spent witnessing the effects , he was clearly unsettled , particularly by people who treated patients with indifference .
Almost certainly , the experiences inspired his latest endeavor .
In 2000 , his friend George was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer : Ewing ’s Sarcoma .
George was barely eating , reeling from the effects of chemotherapy , and , as Rich tells it , mired in a morose state while facing his own certain death .
“ So my buddy with cancer comes to me and says , ‘ Hey .
Can you get me some pot ? ’ ”
Rich said .
Although his friend had never smoked pot , Rich got it , gave it to his friend , but told him what to expect in a clinical manner , he said .
George took the drugs and then , surprisingly , he began laughing , got up , walked to the kitchen , and started eating yogurt , Rich said .
George had barely eaten in almost a week .
“ He told me , ‘ You ’re the best chemical dependency counselor , ’ ” Rich laughed in a characteristic high - pitched giggle that bubbled up throughout his 11 - hour ride with New Times .
George married , Rich was best man in his wedding , and though George died shortly afterward , Rich was clearly thankful for the final lucid month and a half , which he credits fully to the drug .
After that experience , Rich felt strongly that marijuana did n’t deserve to be in the same legal category as heroin or methamphetamine , as federal law currently classifies it .
Following the death of his friend , Rich attended the Oaksterdam University in Oakland , where he was schooled in the state ’s medical marijuana laws and became certified to establish a collective .
“ I kind of wanted his death to mean something , ” Rich said .

TAKE AS NEEDED : Cannafornia Health Services is one of the few ways to obtain medical marijuana in SLO County .
No incorporated cities allow dispensaries and even delivery services are hard to come by due to legal risks .
Among 20 coastal counties in California , SLO County is one of only four that have no medical marijuana dispensaries or other facilities where card - holding patients can obtain medical pot , according to California NORML , which tracks collectives by region .
Monterey , Del Norte , and Ventura are the three others .
Every incorporated city within SLO County has some sort of ban on pot dispensaries .
Morro Bay , where owner Charles Lynch ’s dispensary was shut down by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency with the help of the SLO County Sheriff ’s Department , instituted a ban in April .
Atascadero then pinched off the last potential locations in incorporated cities .
On Sept. 8 , Atascadero City Council members unanimously voted to temporarily ban dispensaries from being permitted , leaving only the unincorporated areas of the county .
So what ’s the fuss about ?
Combined , if all the people to whom SLO County granted permission to obtain and use medical marijuana still have active cards ( the county does n’t track how many people annually renew medical marijuana cards , only those who have been approved ) , there would be 200 patients as of this past August , according to the SLO County Health Agency .
Rich said his service delivers to more than 150 local patients .
He rigorously verifies doctor recommendations and state identification cards for local patients .
Most of his patients are older than 35 , he said , and include such people as accountants , doctors , and at least one local law enforcement officer .
Statewide , there are only 34,258 people allowed to consume and share medical marijuana , according to the California Department of Public Health .
If that entire medical marijuana community lived in SLO County , it would comprise about 13 percent of the population .
Former state senator John Vasconcellos , who wrote the state law , told New Times how he felt about raids of dispensaries and medical marijuana patients : “ It ’s such a silly waste of public funds and public attention and cruel — silly and cruel .
” County Sheriff ’s Department spokesman Rob Bryn said profitable dispensaries encourage criminal activities .
Regarding criticism of law enforcement raids , he said , “ This is just such a joke , it ’s pathetic . ” Indeed , SLO County may soon no longer be such an exception to marijuana dispensaries .
Los Angeles County could easily be called the mecca of medical marijuana , with more dispensaries than anywhere else in the state , but that , too , is changing .
Los Angeles County officials have begun shutting down the estimated hundreds of for - profit dispensaries , according to the district attorney ’s office there .
As of this printing , about a dozen dispensaries had been shut down in the area and officials were planning to eliminate every dispensary where medical marijuana is being distributed for profit .
A spokeswoman for the D.A. , Sandi Gibbons , said on Oct. 8 that law enforcement agents were preparing to go after all such dispensaries .
“ It ’s our contention and the contention of law enforcement that this is an illegal activity , ” Gibbons told New Times .
“ It sucks , ” Robert Davis said , pointing to his various scars as though they were battle wounds .
He pointed to a fading scar on his hand where doctors removed a chunk of cancerous skin .
He had a dime - sized dent in his forehead from another surgery .
The worst , he said , was a large patch taken out of his neck .
The surgeons had to pull together and sew the remaining skin to cover the hole , but it left Davis ’ neck so tight he could n’t lift his head and had to slowly stretch the remaining skin .
In all , he ’s had 25 skin - cancer operations in the past four years .
Davis also has lymphoma , another form of cancer .
A calendar on his wall is filled with doctor appointments .
Davis lives in an RV on a large lot in Los Osos where the property owner allows him to stay at reduced rent .
In exchange , he cares for the owner ’s horses .
Davis survives mainly on Social Security and Medi-Cal , occasionally picking up part - time jobs , usually yard work .
He ca n’t work fulltime because he ’s sometimes too sick .
In any event , he ’d lose his Medi -Cal benefits if he did work fulltime , he said .
“ I really do hate to be a crybaby , ” he said with a face that said he was n’t looking for pity .
Davis said he does n’t drink .
He smokes cigarettes , but he feels guilty for doing it and could n’t quit .
Rather than take such medications as OxyContin to counteract the chemotherapy he endures , he smokes marijuana .
After his eight - hour chemo sessions , it takes about a month before he begins feeling the side effects .
“ I do n’t feel sick .
I just feel more like I have nothing , ” he said .
Perhaps the greatest benefit from marijuana is it gives Davis an appetite , he said .
He appears meek and fragile , with a head of wilted blond hair .
He said he ’s 6 feet , 2 inches tall , but only weighs 160 pounds .
At one point , he weighed as little as 150 pounds due to his illnesses .
But smoking pot replenishes his appetite the chemo takes away , he said .
He stood up excitedly and opened his cupboards to show off the junk food stashed throughout the RV : a trove of cookies , Cheetos , and other stereotypically stoner foods .
Davis obtained his medical marijuana card in 2006 .
He said he used to drive to San Francisco about twice a week for work , which is where he used to get marijuana because there are no local dispensaries .
He can no longer afford to drive to San Francisco and now gets marijuana from Rich .
Davis made his career tending racehorses , a career he hopes to return to if he regains health .
While visiting his sister in South Carolina years ago , he went to a race track .
“ And I was like , ‘ Wow , that looks like fun . ’ ”
So he struck up a conversation with someone in the stables and was hired on the spot to help prepare horses for races .
He moved to Florida and worked with racehorses , until he was diagnosed with cancer .
He moved back to the Central Coast and now lives in his RV on a multi-million - dollar property overlooking coastal bluffs .
Outside the trailer a light breeze swirled through the brilliantly sunny afternoon .
Horses trotted behind the RV , kicking up dust as they headed in the direction of the Pacific Ocean .
The air smelled of seawater mixed with an earthy musk from wood chips that covered the ground .
Davis said , all in all , it was n’t a bad spot .
That day , he told Rich , his doctors had just told him his lymphoma was shrinking and he would have a four - month break from chemo .
Rich pulled onto the driveway of a house in Atascadero to make his second delivery of the day .
There were about a half - dozen people inside , most of them lounging on a couch .
A woman read a magazine while a cat nestled next to her ; a young boy sat snacking on a peach .
Shelves lined the walls of the kitchen , and were stuffed with homey trinkets like teapots and saucers , many of which were painted with corny phrases .
Matt Green ’s face exploded in a gaping smile and he flailed his arms erratically when he saw Rich walk in .
“ He ’s happy , ” Green ’s mother , Toni Paradis , said to Rich .
“ Thank you .
” “ Hey , I could tell he ’s happy , ” Rich said .
Green yelped incoherently due to a physical inability to speak clearly .
He ca n’t stand up , either .
He writhed violently in his wheelchair , often kicking his legs and contorting his arms in erratic , uncontrollable bursts .
When Green was 20 months old , he nearly drowned in a pool while at daycare , leaving him a spastic quadriplegic , Paradis said .
She had to speak for Green because he was in a coma for three months and when he awoke he “ tore up ” his tongue and now has a severe speech impediment that makes him almost incomprehensible to anyone unfamiliar with his vocal patterns .
He went to school ; graduated from college .
“ He ’s quite intelligent , ” Paradis said .
But Green ’s spasms can be so severe he ’s knocked his own teeth out and he ’s knocked Paradis ’ teeth out .
He hit her so hard one time it unhinged her jaw .
His spasms can be so stressful they cause him to lose weight .
If ever there were a prime candidate for the legalization of medical marijuana , Green could be him .
He proudly flaunted his black T - shirt emblazoned with a colorful illustration of a cannabis plant and laughed at the irony that his last name is Green .
( Think marijuana and you ’ll get it . )
Green began smoking marijuana in 2004 ( his friends and family help him ) .
His doctors had wanted him to take other drugs , but those could have severely damaged his liver , Paradis said .
Green chose marijuana .
Smoking it dulls his spasms to a manageable level .
“ If you could see what it ’s like when he has nothing versus when he actually has something , ” Paradis lamented .
But the stigma surrounding marijuana is sometimes hard to overcome .
“ It ’s his right to take the kind of medication he needs that works for him . …
I ’ll fight for it as long as I possibly can .
” Before there was a delivery service , Paradis would drive Green to Oakland dispensaries at least twice per month .
“ And it ’s a hard drive for him .
It ’s hard ; we do n’t like it .
” “ No , ” Matt said When Paradis learned the Atascadero City Council was temporarily banning marijuana dispensaries within the city limits , she cut a barbecue short and went to the meeting with Green .
No one from the public spoke in favor of a ban , but the council members voted unanimously to prohibit dispensaries from operating within city limits .
“ They ’ll look at Matt , ” Paradis said of the council members .
“ Maybe have a bit of compassion for him .
But they do n’t want to talk about it .
” In a cookie - cutter suburban house wedged within a few small blocks of nearly identical houses , Rich met with one of his new growers .
The grower , Mike ( he asked New Times not to use his real name ) , had just returned home from work and his hands were covered in dark gray blotches of grease .
Mike lives in a plain white - walled house in the Nipomo area , with one marijuana plant growing upstairs and two other plants in his backyard .
Rich was there to give him two new baby plants .
Upstairs , in the closet of a mostly bare room with just a red rubber exercise ball and a small metal clothes rack , Mike opened the closet door .
A small fan blowing against a short , adolescent marijuana plant gently hummed .
The plant sat in a white pot inside a homemade growing box cobbled together from PVC pipe and thick sheets of black plastic .
The plant ’s small leaves rustled lightly from the fan and glowed bright green under a single fluorescent tube .
On the adjoining wall , Mike posted a photocopy of his medical marijuana card .
Rich left that house and headed west as sunrays peeked beneath thick blankets of coastal fog that slid over the South County coastline .
He left New Times in the early evening , but said he was going on more deliveries .
Earlier that day , he evaluated each delivery like this : “ You think , ‘ Am I gonna get robbed , killed , or arrested ? ’
Maybe all three .
Or , am I gonna hear some sick person thank me a million times because I ’m the only one who really helped them out ? ” Staff Writer Colin Rigley can be reached at crigley@newtimesslo.com .
NEW YORK , Sept. 13 ( UPI ) --
The Transportation Security Administration says it has seized 123,189 items from passengers at three New York - area airports , including a baby alligator .
The New York Post said Sunday also among the tens of thousands of prohibited items seized since January at the three local airports was a 6 - foot - long African spear and a gassed - up chainsaw .

The federal agency said other items that passengers were not allowed to board flights with include unwashed adult toys , 10 - point deer antlers and even a kitchen sink .
The unidentified passenger caught attempting to travel from New York to Puerto Rico with a baby alligator had the live animal strapped to his thigh in an attempt to fool airport officials .
Meanwhile , a total of 122 passengers were stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport , John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport since January for attempting to board flights with ammunition and gunpowder .
The Post said the three airports also account for nearly 450 pounds worth of abandoned goods each month .
EVERETT , Wash . —
Five bikini baristas have been accused of prostitution in Everett .
Police say they charged customers to touch their breasts and buttocks , which falls under the city 's definition of prostitution .
The Everett Herald reports the women were charging up to $ 80 to strip down while fixing lattes and mochas .
During a two - month investigation , detectives also saw the women lick whipped cream off each other and pose naked for pictures at the Grab - n - Go Espresso stand on Broadway .
Owner Bill Wheeler told KCPQ - TV any employee caught doing anything illegal will be fired on the spot .
Sgt. Robert Goetz says the women , ages 18 - to - 24 , were not arrested .
They are expected to be in Municipal Court in a few weeks to answer misdemeanor charges .

Jeffrey DeGraaf , the top - ranked technical analyst in Institutional Investor magazine ’s poll for the past four years says S&P 500 Rally Poised to End .
The 34 percent rebound in the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index since March shows few hallmarks of a bull market , and stocks will probably stagnate for years , top - ranked analyst Jeffrey deGraaf said .
The S&P 500 is at a level it first surpassed in 1997 even after the steepest quarterly advance in a decade , and is down 43 percent from its October 2007 record , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
The main benchmark for American equities probably will continue to make “ no net price progress ” for at least two more years , deGraaf said in an interview .
“ The market in my best estimation is probably range - bound between roughly 1,000 on the upside and 700 on the downside , but I would put the risk to the downside , ” he said .
DeGraaf is a senior managing director at ISI Group Inc. in New York and was the top - ranked technical analyst in Institutional Investor magazine ’s poll for the past four years .
“ Japan from 1992 to 2000 was in what aviators call a phugoid -- which is just this long oscillation in price , ” deGraaf said .
“ It looks to us like there ’s a reasonable probability that we ’re going to enter into a similar period , with more government intervention and all these things that tend to come about after a bubble , particularly one that ’s been driven by credit . ”
Long Term Buy And Hold Is Still Bad Advice
In spite of what you hear from main stream media and self - serving advice from Wall Street , an investment philosophy of long term buy and hold is not what it 's cracked up to be .
Unfortunately , many boomers headed into retirement are finding that out now , at the worst possible time .
Moreover , looking ahead , I doubt the next decade is going to be much better than the last .
Why Is Bad Advice So Common ?
Clearly , stay the course is bad advice .
So why is it so common ?
A personal anecdote might help explain things :
In January of this year , an investment advisor from Wachovia Securities called me up and stated " Mish , I am sitting on millions because I see nothing I like " .
I told the person I did not like much either and that Sitka Pacific was heavily in cash and or hedged .
His response was " Well , I do not get paid anything if my clients are sitting in cash " .
I called up a rep at Merrill Lynch and he said the same thing , that reps for Merrill Lynch do not get paid if their clients are sitting in cash .
[ By the way , that person at Wachovia Securities did the right thing and sat on that cash . ]
Massive Conflict of Interest
Notice the massive conflict of interest possibilities .
Reps for various broker dealers have a vested interest in keeping clients 100 % invested 100 % of the time , even if they know it is wrong .
And so it is every recession , bad advice permeates the airwaves and internet " Stay The Course " .
A Look Ahead
Clearly stocks are a better buy now than in 2007 or 2008 .
But that does not mean stocks are cheap .
Indeed , by any realistic measure of earnings , stocks are decidedly not cheap .
Then again , 6 - month treasury yields are yielding a paltry .31 % .
Can equities easily beat that ?
Yes they might , but that does not mean they will !
Fundamentally , the S&P 500 can easily fall to 500 or below , a massive crash from this point .
Alternatively , stocks might languish for years .
Please consider a chart of the Nikkei .
$ NIKK - Nikkei Monthly Chart
The Japanese Stock Market is about 25 % of what it was close to 20 years ago !
Yes , I know , the US is not Japan , that deflation can't happen here , etc , etc .
Of course deflation did happen here , so the question now is how long it lasts .
Even if it does not last long , there are no guarantees the stock market stages a significant recovery .
Buy and hold is no more likely to be a good choice for the next 5 years than it was for the last 20 .
Investment Opportunities
Technically there is room for huge rallies , but there is also room for plenty of misery ( for both bulls and bears ) .
The key will be to stay nimble as the opportunities that present themselves may not follow traditional post WWII recovery patterns .
E - Wave Update
does alt med equal fewer vaccinations ?
Researchers find more evidence that alternative medicine practitioners are a public health menace .
Did you know that the state of Washington requires insurance companies to cover alternative medicine under a special provision that requires them to compensate all types of medical care ?
Heh .
Forget what I said in my post about why alternative medicine faces a long shot at being covered by insurance companies .
Science be damned when enough state lawmakers have a sympathetic ear .
But where there are lemons , a quartet of clinical researchers saw an opportunity to make some lemonade and use data from insurance companies to try and find out whether there ’s a correlation between alternative medicine and pediatric vaccinations .
As it turns out , the correlation is there and unfortunately , it ’s negative .
Children who see alternative medicine providers are up to 75 % more likely not to receive the four major vaccines intended to prepare their immune systems against chicken pox , diphtheria , mumps , measles and hepatitis among other infections .
And even worse , they were notably more likely to be diagnosed with a preventable childhood disease when compared to kids who were treated by conventional doctors and received their vaccine regimen .
The best case scenario found that children treated by chiropractors were 25 % less likely to get their shots which is not good , but it ’s a drastic improvement over the aforementioned three quarters of pediatric patients treated by naturopaths .
Yes , a study that uses insurance claims is inherently limited in the information it can collect and there is the possibility that vaccinations were done without the companies ’ involvement .
However , given the high costs of medical care , it ’s not likely that the omissions were all that drastic .
It ’s cheaper to have insurers who already cover vaccinations to a significant extent , pay for them than to shell out for them yourself .
And as was noted by Orac , the study ca n’t be taken to mean that alternative medicine practitioners are actively deterring patients in their care from getting their kids vaccinated .
Quite a few people who go to naturists or chiropractors who still ascribe to the idea that alignments of the spine cause all disease rather that those who simply say they can help you with your back pain , already have a deep seeded suspicion of conventional medicine in general .
However , there are cases of homeopaths trying to scare potential patients with stories about how evil and dangerous vaccines can be .
We also know that naturism and other types of medical woo reject the reliable and successfully used germ theory in favor of vitalism and the ever ill - defined “ aggregate toxicity , ” so for them , vaccines are either a menace or totally useless .
Even if they do n’t outright reject the merit of vaccinations , it ’s not very likely that they ’ll be rushing patients to get their regimens .
Let ’s remember that alternative medicine is a business that makes billions of dollars in selling unregulated treatments exempt from FDA review thanks to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 which treats alt med products as food rather than a medical treatment .
When naturists and homeopaths attack conventional evidence - based medicine as limited , useless against numerous diseases , narrow - minded , arrogant , poisonous and profit - minded , they ’re really protecting their income in a rather callous and hypocritical way .
When it comes to vaccines , we know that while they ’re not perfect , they work .
We have volumes of evidence for how effective they are , which is why we rely on them to control dozens of diseases .
However , on the other side of the debate , we have people who deal in fears rather than fact and go by stubborn personal opinions on a subject they know very little about .
And even worse , alongside them we have quacks who promote anti-vaxer rumors and accusations for their personal gain while hypocritically accusing doctors of giving vaccination only for the sake of profit .
Together , they seem firmly committed to slam over half a century of radical progress into reverse , obliviously unaware of just how dangerous their proposition really is .
All doctors want to do is infuse us with potential defenses for as widespread diseases and vaccines are the best technology we have at the moment .
Why should those of us who have nothing to gain from it attack their goal of helping us live a longer and better life by training our immune systems ?

Zambia 's president has taken revenge after a monkey urinated on him during a press conference , by evicting a group of some 200 primates from State House .
President Rupiah Banda has asked for the animals to be relocated to parkland outside the capital Lusaka .
About 61 monkeys have already been moved to the Munda Wanga Botanical Gardens land , an official said .
At the time , Mr Banda made light of the incident and suggested he would give the monkey to the opposition leader .
He also suggested that the event might bring him good luck .
" The president recently requested to the Munda Wanga Botanic Trust to remove and relocate some of the monkeys , and so far 61 monkeys have been humanely captured and translocated to the gardens , " said director Bill Thomas , according to the AFP news agency .
There are also many species of antelope and bird in the State House grounds , according to Reuters news agency .
In fact , such secrecy runs counter to international norms for foreign assistance .
In a part of the world prone to corruption and poor governance , it also raises questions about who actually benefits from China ’s projects .
The answers , international development specialists say , are hidden from public view .
“ We know more about China ’s military expenditures than we do about its foreign aid , ” said David Shambaugh , an author and China scholar at George Washington University .
“ Foreign aid really is a glaring contradiction to the broader trend of China ’s adherence to international norms .
It is so strikingly opaque it really makes one wonder what they are trying to hide . ”
Until recently , wealthy nations could hardly hold themselves out as an example of how to run foreign aid , either .
Many projects turned out to be tainted by corruption or geared to enrich the donor nation ’s contractors , not the impoverished borrowers .
But over the past 10 or 15 years , some 30 developed nations under the umbrella of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development ( O.E.C.D. ) have made a concerted effort to clean up their assistance programs .
They demanded that foreign money be awarded and spent transparently , using competitive bidding and outlawing bribery .
Increasingly , they also are also pushing to give borrowers more choice among suppliers and contractors , rather than insisting that funds be recycled back to the donor nation ’s companies .
China , which is not a member of the O.E.C.D. , is operating under rules that the West has largely abandoned .
It mixes aid and business in secret government - to - government agreements .
It requires that foreign aid contracts be awarded to Chinese contractors it picks through a closed - door bidding process in Beijing .
Its attempts to prevent corrupt practices by its companies overseas appear weak .
Some developing nations insist on independently comparing prices before accepting China ’s largesse .
Others do not bother .
“ Very often they are getting something they would n’t be able to get without China ’s financing , ” said Chris Alden , a specialist on China - African relations with the London School of Economics and Political Science .
“ They presume that the Chinese are going to give value for money . ”

Back in late 2006 and early 2007 , most appraisals of Vista were fairly kind .
Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer is n’t so sure about how folks are going to respond to Windows 7 .
As Mary - Jo Foley says in a ZDNet blog post , Ballmer told Bloomberg that “ The test feedback ( on Windows 7 ) has been good , but the test feedback on Vista was good .
I am optimistic , but the proof will be in the pudding . ”
Mary - Jo goes on to muse :
… I ’m left wondering about Vista , as many are / were about the current financial crisis :
Why did n’t anyone inform us sooner of the impending meltdown ?
Were n’t there warning signs ?
Where was everybody ?
Most of Mary - Jo ’s post involves Windows Vista beta testers ’ reaction to the OS , but it got me wondering :
How about the reviews that came out when Windows Vista was released ?
Negative reaction to Vista among consumers and businesses ended up preventing it from ever truly superseding Windows XP in the way it was supposed to do–but were the reviews among the first signs that something was amiss ?
To find out , I dug up evaluations of Vista from late 2006 and early 2007 as they appeared in nine major publications , written by a bunch of distinguished Windows - watchers : BusinessWeek ( Steve Wildstrom ) , CNET ( Robert Vamosi ) , Forbes ( Stephen Manes ) , The New York Times ( David Pogue ) , PC Magazine ( John Clyman ) , Paul Thurrott ’s Windows Supersite , PC World ( Preston Gralla and Richard Baguley ) , USA Today ( Ed Baig ) , The Wall Street Journal ( Walt Mossberg ) , and ZDNet ( Ed Bott ) .
I reread them all , and in a moment I ’ll summarize here what they said about Vista ’s visuals , its performance and stability , its compatibility with existing products , and User Account Control security–as well as their overall take on the OS .
First , though , a mini-FAQ on what I found :
How favorable were the reviews ?
I ’d say the majority were guardedly positive , saying that Vista looked good overall but was n’t a killer product that demanded instant installation on every PC on the planet .
ZDNet ’s Ed Bott ( who did n’t publish a comprehensive review ) , PC World ’s Preston Gralla , and Paul Thurrott were enthusiastic overall ; BusinessWeek ’s Steve Wildstrom , CNET ’s Robert Vamosi , and PC Magazine ’s John Clyman all accentuated more negatives than most .
Only Forbes ’ Manes was extremely negative , period .
( His piece , the last he ’s written for Forbes to date , is the only software review I ’ve ever read which discusses ripping anyone ’s liver out . )
Did any of the reviews predict widespread dislike of and / or disinterest in Vista , or guess that it would never become the dominant version of the OS ?
No , and that ’s OK :
The point of a product review is n’t to predict how the marketplace will react .
Some of the reviews did make the understandable but incorrect assumption that Vista would become pervasive ( Mossberg : “ Gradually , all Windows computers will be Vista computers ” ) , and I suspect that even the reviewers that were lukewarm - to - negative would be startled by the widespread rejection of the OS that came to happen .
Did the reviews identify performance and compatibility as problem points ?
Some said that Vista would require a beefy PC and might be slower than XP ( others , however , explicitly contended it would run well on modest machines ) .
Some mentioned compatibility snafus with applications and drivers –BusinessWeek ’s Wildstrom warned readers to be cautious based on the woes he ’d encountered –but with the possible exception of Manes , nobody said that Vista would continue to be rocky from a compatibility standpoint for months after its release .
What did reviewers say about UAC , which ended up being the poster boy for everything that Vistaphobes disliked about the OS ?
Some of them actively praised it as an effective security measure , including Baig , Mossberg , and Pogue .
Others call it potentially annoying but worth the pain .
Only Manes and Gralla seemed to regard it as a significant , permanent annoyance .
What was the bottom - line buying advice ?
Most writers said to think carefully before upgrading an existing PC to Vista , but that it would be a welcome improvement over XP when acquired on a new machine .
Ed Bott recommended that medium - and larger - sized businesses wait for Service Pack 1 but said consumers and small companies did n’t need to hesitate ; Manes said nobody should upgrade existing PCs , period , and that it was best to avoid the OS on new machines until Service Pack 1 .
Hey , Harry , you were writing and editing stories about Vista back when it came out , right ?
What did you say ?
Um , thanks for reminding me .
I wrote quite a bit about Vista in my Techlog blog for PC World , and was smart enough to express caution about its significance and raise questions about compatibility issues , but not savvy enough to guess it would become a legendary flop .
( Here ’s a post from March 2006 in which I ’m fairly skeptical , but say “ It …seems unlikely that it ’ll be a Windows Me-style fiasco . ”
Wrong ! )
I was editor of PC World when it published the review discussed below .
Do I wish , in retrospect , that we ’d held the new OS to a higher standard , criticizing it for introducing too few new features of substance and failing to fix enough long - standing Windows annoyances ?
Do I think we should have reminded readers that all new OSes have bugs and compatibility problems that can be largely avoided by waiting for the first service pack ?
Do I believe we gave it too much credit for looking pretty ?
Yes , I do .
OK , enough preface .
Here ’s what software critics said about Vista before anyone knew for sure just how Windows users would greet it .
BusinessWeek
“ Vista : Upgrade–or Trade Up ? ” by Steve Wildstrom , January 15th , 2007 ( also : “ Burglar Proof Windows , ” January 22nd , 2007 )
How are the visuals ?
“ All this eye candy is nice , but it ’s not going to make it any easier to draft a business plan or a budget . ”
How are performance and stability ?
Not addressed .
How compatible is it ?
“ Based on the troubles I ’ve had in tests , I ’d warn against upgrading if you have old accessories , such as printers , or if you run any custom or obscure business software .
If you decide to upgrade anyway , make sure your existing computer has the horsepower to do Vista justice .
Any system older than six months or a year may be trouble .
Functions could feel sticky or sluggish , and if the graphics on your PC are n’t up to snuff , you ’ll lose the fancy visual effects . ”
How ’s UAC ?
“ Vista wo n’t install anything , from any source , without explicit permission …
But some work needs to be done , especially by third - party software suppliers , to keep account control from driving you nuts .
For example , every time I start up , the Logitech mouse software wants to check the Web for updates — and triggers an alert .
So does a test version of Norton Antivirus .
Eliminating these false alarms will encourage users to pay attention to the warnings rather than just reflexively clicking O.K . ”
The bottom line ?
“ XP … is good enough that you may just want to make do , for now .
Based on the troubles I ’ve had in tests , I ’d warn against upgrading if you have old accessories , such as printers , or if you run any custom or obscure business software .
… Any system older than six months or a year may be trouble …
With a new made - for - Vista computer , at least you ’ll know that everything will work .
And Vista is a big step forward ; in time , you ’ll want it . ”

Imagine flipping a Frisbee in Quebec , Canada , and seeing it land in Zimbabwe .
That ’s a distance of 8,000 miles now , but 2.6 billion years ago , with good wrist action , it would have been no feat at all ( if only there had been Frisbees and , of course , people ) .
Present - day Quebec and Zimbabwe were adjacent way back then , say geologists who are using new techniques to map Earth ’s early continents .
Some 300 million years ago , the supercontinent Pangea included much of the landmass of today ’s continents , all crammed together .
Prior to that , continental masses joined and separated several times , but scientists have n’t been able to reconstruct those earlier arrangements with much precision .
Richard E. Ernst of the University of Ottawa , Michael A. Hamilton of the University of Toronto , and several colleagues intend to remedy that .
They ’ve developed new ways to collect and to precisely date rare microscopic minerals found in ancient basalt veins .
If the minerals and dates from several veins on one ancient landmass match those on another , there ’s a good chance the landmasses were contiguous when the basalt formed .
Within five years and for just $ 1 million , the team hopes to provide a series of snapshots showing the continents ’ positions over the past 2.6 billion years .
The work was detailed at the American Geophysical Union Joint Assembly in May 2009 .

Mornings are underrated .
I consider them fundamental for the whole diurnal experience .
What you do in the very first moments of your morning will fundamentally and inexorably shape your entire day .
Most of the time you spend your mornings by routinely performing some habits , on auto pilot .
Hence , your days will routinely unfold towards you , the same way , day after day , on auto pilot .
Consciously inserting your intentions in these very first moments will have a huge effect .
Taking charge of those moments it ’s like activating some subtle , unconscious triggers which will ultimately determine your whole daily experience , exactly the way you want .
Mornings are fundamental .
This is why I experimented a lot with my very first moments of the day .
Here are at least 33 tips to start your day , small changes which will transform your days by only spending 5 minutes every morning .
1. Write In Your Journal
I love the morning stillness and the unspoken promise of something ready to start .
Mornings are fantastic for journaling .
Whenever I do it , I feel like I already consumed several hours from that day and yet I ’m only at the very beginning of it .
Journaling acts like a mind emptier and out of nowhere I feel energized and ready to go .
Not to mention that in the morning I have less inhibitors and my journaling is far more authentic .
2. Enjoy The Morning Silence
And do nothing .
Just feel the silence and let it spread over your mind and body .
I ’m fascinated by all the little noises that are born from that morning silence : from my familiar house noises ( wife and daughter waking up , steps , windows , doors ) up to the neighborhood noises ( car engines , low voices , small buzz ) .
Everything starts in that silence and sometimes I think that if I focus enough on it I could actually predict , or even create all those little noises .
3. Be Grateful For Something 5 Minutes
Point your mind to something you ’re really grateful for and stay there .
Might be your family , your wealth , your health or just your present moment .
Feel grateful for it .
There ’s nobody between you and that thing , there ’s nobody watching or listening .
You ’re free to feel grateful and happy .
And then start your day as usual .
It ’s only 5 minutes , yet the impact of such a day starter is overwhelming : whenever I ’m doing it I feel like walking 2 centimeters above the road for the entire day .
4. Open Windows
Regardless of the current season .
If it ’s cold outside , even better .
Open your bedroom windows , your living room windows , your kitchen windows .
Let the fresh air inside , welcome the small buzz of the city waking up , silently watch the last forces of the night walking away .
Let yourself be refreshed .
The yesterday you is no longer there and the today you is slowly getting in shape .
Those open windows will unconsciously allow you to receive change and novelty with much more ease during the day .
5. Throw Away A Useless Object
You ’re going to spot it pretty easily if you put your mind to it .
It often happens to me to stumble upon unneeded stuff in my house during the early morning .
If it ’s a chair staying in my way , maybe its place is not in my house .
Maybe it ’s a piece of paper or a wrecked device .
I find joy and a subtle enthusiasm in throwing away things that are only cluttering my space , and doing it first thing in the morning makes it even more powerful .
6. Help Somebody
Write an answer to an old question , do part of a small chore , move an object out of somebody ’s way .
No need to be huge or visible .
Just keep in mind the intention of being helpful immediately to somebody else .
During the morning your mind is far more clear and you have access to more energy than usual .
Hence , your helping activities will be much more effective if you decide to do them as the first thing after you wake up .
7. Meditate For 5 Minutes
EmptyÂ your mind and isolate from your environment .
Focus on your breathe .
If there are thoughts coming in your way , acknowledge their presence and then kindly ask them to go away .
Meditating in the morning is easier , there are fewer perturbing factors .
Even after a good sleep , your mind is still trying to find answers , to solve problems , to fight or resist .
Do yourself a simple , yet solid service and pack your morning time with an extra meditation on top .
8. Think How To Help Somebody During The Day
This is different from number 6 in terms of the actual time of the helping act .
Now you ’re planing how to help somebody during the day , you ’re visualizing the context and try to find a specific time in your schedule for this helping act .
Again , does n’t have to be huge , a piece of advice , facilitating something or a small gift .
The mere act of planing how to help somebody will change the course of your entire day .
9. Exercise
Like in getting physical .
I ’m not doing this every single day , but I ’m doing it often enough .
A part from your brain there ’s a body , too .
A collection of joints , muscles and bones .
And in order to be balanced you have to take care of those too .
The good news is that your body has a feedback mechanism for the good things you do to it : it ’s called “ endorphins ” .
Every time you start your day with a decent workout , you ’ll be blessed with a decent rush of endorphins .
Usually , it lasts until evening .
10 . Spend 5 Minutes In The Garden
Alternatively , spend some times near your flowers .
Or your terrace .
Just be outside in the first minutes of the day , trying to breathe the fresh air and feel the vibe of the green life .
Clear you mind and open your senses .
Let your awaken body to synchronize with this frequency and do n’t start the day until you completely immersed in this flow for at least 5 minutes .
I seldom run into a fight or even got closer to some aggressive scene when I start my day like this .
11 . Forgive Somebody
Let go .
Forgive and forget .
Morning are very good for that because you have so little inference from the outside world , only your own mind and personal history .
Does it really matter that much ?
Feeling that grudge and anger towards somebody who hurt you ?
Yes , that person hurt you , but it really matter that much ?
Forgiving somebody as the first thing in the morning makes me want to conquer the world the very next minutes .
And it works really well with forgiving yourself too .
12 . Think For 5 Minutes At Someone You Love
Again , that person may be your family , someone you loved at some point in your life or someone who just appeared .
Keep that person in mind , imagine having a conversation or doing something together .
Create an internal representation of a desired bond .
Not only it will actually attract that person towards you ( somehow ) during the day , but what you think in those moments will add up to the relationship in a very mysterious way .
It ’s like what you think it ’s already happening .
13 . Read A Poem
Poetry , or any form of art , talks to your irrational mind .
Usually , your morning is cluttered with rational thoughts and activities : get up and ready for the job , prepare the kids , get the morning tasks solved .
Talking to your irrational mind will break this circuit , but it will do it creatively .
For instance , my favorite morning poem is “ If ” , by Rudyard Kipling .
Every time I read it , even if the day is packed with difficult tasks , somehow , I find the energy and right attitude to get over them .
Totally irrational .
14 . Make Coffee or Tea For Your Partner
I like this whole beverage ritual in the morning , I think it has something to do with deeply buried recollections of religious rituals we humans , as a species , performed during the history .
There ’s something sacramental about preparing the water , making fire , putting the right amount of tea or coffee .
It ’s like asking gods for benevolence .
Only this time is not about gods , it ’s about your partner .
Paving your road through today with your partner blessing .
15 . Write A Thank You Letter
You do n’t have to send it , just write it .
When I first experienced this I had a little bit of a shock .
I realized I do n’t know how to do it .
And for whom .
That was a sad shock .
Not having somebody to say “ thank you ” in your life can bring in quite a sorrow .
So , be sure to start at least one of your mornings with a “ thank you ” letter .
Bring to the light people or events you are thankful for .
If you say “ thank you ” to something first thing in the morning , you ’re inviting those specific type of events into your life .
16 . Take A Day Off From Your Job
And use the rest of the day for yourself .
Even if you ’re self employed , or especially if you ’re self employed , take a day off .
And start it clean , from the early morning .
Those free days are somehow bigger when I decide to have them unexpectedly .
If I start my morning with the clear decision to take the day off , something very strange will happen : my businesses will run smoother without me .
My blog traffic will spike .
It ’s like too much work means getting in the way of your own success .
17 . Do Some Crafting For 5 Minutes
Just fix something , replace a light bulb , use your screwdriver to harden some piece of furniture or modify some clothes .
Just do something with your hands , without any preparation , in the morning silence .
In a very surprising way , this morning crafting will unfold some new opportunities .
You can find a solution to an old problem or you will solve something for somebody else .
It ’s like this morning crafting will actually make you craft the rest of your entire day .
18 . Learn A New Word In A Foreign Language
Just one word .
Every morning , for several weeks .
I used to learn some hiragana and katakana only in the morning ( and that proved really interesting during my first trip to Japan ) .
It forces your brain to find parallel ways to solve problems and your body to stay focused on a small problem from the very beginning of the day .
Again , in a very strange way , learning a new foreign word each morning makes me dream about foreign lands .
Which is quite a way to start your day .
19 . Imagine Your Morning in a New Country
How your morning will be in New Zealand ?
Or in Thailand ?
Or in Austria ?
If you ’ve ever been there , try to remember the smells , the air , the noises .
Waking up in a different country every morning might be a fantastic experience ( I might do this one day , by the way ) .
If you ’ve never been there , just try to imagine your morning there .
After spending 5 minutes in a distant country , getting back to your actual day will feel like coming home from a long trip .
Which is , partially , true .
20 . Go For A Short Walk
Like the first thing in the morning , before even having breakfast .
Breathe the air , look at the neighborhood .
Watch the morning light and hear the noises .
Move around .
When you got home , your day will be different .
This short walk often acts like setting up the scene for something I want to happen .
Walking around alone , before igniting the day , makes me feel like a director inspecting the stage .
Everything looks cool , let ’s make a great film today .
21 . Write A Powerful Goal
Mornings are very good for writing goals .
I especially like that time of the day for writing goals because I have very few interference from the outside world .
Which makes me much more authentic .
I value more the goals written in the morning because I am less influenced .
I know for sure that during the morning I do n’t have to prove anything to anyone , I ’m just me and what I want .
Some of my best health decisions are picked up during the morning .
22 . Clean Your Desk
Again , this must be done before having breakfast , or before any other domestic task ( and this also assumes you work from home , at some point ) .
Put things in order , wipe the dust , prepare your working setup .
And then start the day as usual .
After having breakfast , interacting with your family or just finishing your morning routine , come back to your office .
A shiny , fresh and neat vibration will welcome you .
A short sign of appreciation from yourself .
23 . Sing a Song
I do this all the time in the shower .
And I highly recommend it .
Despite what your neighbors may say ( or even some of your early riser family members ) .
Singing goes hand in hand with reading a poem .
Does n’t matter if you know how to sing .
just go ahead and knock some “ Let It Be ” as loud as you can ( “ Let It Be ” is my favorite shower song , by the way ) .
If you hear me humming some tunes in my beard that ’s a good sign I started with a loud song in the shower .
24 . Read and Evaluate your Morning Phrase
Do you have a morning phrase ?
Craft one , it ’s easy .
Starting a day with a morning phrase it ’s like a mental programming exercise for maximizing your potential .
It may take even less than 5 minutes and it ’s a powerful tool for energy channeling .
The trick is to keep it for at least several weeks .
But the advantage is that this exercise is very powerful .
Planning on quitting smoking ?
Put it in a morning phrase and use it .
25 . Delete Some Email
Or some old , unneeded files .
That ’s the mirror in the virtual world of number 5 . Remove the clutter .
Get rid of old messages , logs or files .
Be in the flow .
They say you have to let go the current you in order to become who you really want .
I used to be a packer .
Making folders and packing and storing everything in my computer .
Now I start my mornings every now and then with a refreshing session of file deletion .
Making room for what the day may bring in .
26 . Watch The Sunrise
Easiest of all and yet so underrated .
There ’s so much power and simplicity in watching the sunrise , connecting to the light and actually feeling how the Sun will start another day .
And you ’re there witnessing this cosmic process .
Every time I watch the sunrise , being it at my home or in a foreign country , I have a subtle feeling of responsibility .
This huge cosmic mechanism is turning around me as my playground : what am I going to do in it today ?
27 . Read Your Yesterday Journal
If you keep a journal , of course .
Look at yesterday from the very first moment of your new day .
What do you love about yesterday ?
What do you do n’t like about it ?
Now you have the chance to change those things .
Reading your journal first thing in the morning is a surprising experience .
Seeing what you wrote without any noise and with a clear mind will reveal things that you did n’t noticed .
Maybe because you did n’t like them ?
28 . Do A Short Yoga Session
You do n’t have to be an expert yogi to start your day with a mild yoga session .
I often find myself lighter and more flexible when starting the day with a short suite of Surya Namaskara , or Sun Salutation .
It stretches your body and calm your mind .
I once did this for more than 6 months , every single morning .
It was perhaps the most calm and balanced period of my life .
And besides calm and balance , what else do you need when you start your day ?
29 . Visualize 3 Moments From Yesterday
Keep your eyes closed and try to remember 3 moments from yesterday .
It ’s not reading about them in your journal , it ’s trying to visualize them in your mind .
First of all , the very selection of those 3 moments will tell you something about your current state .
Are those moments embarrassing or happy ?
Second , keeping them live in your head will help you find a solution or a sequel to them .
It will help you keep yesterday linked to today .
Some people call this flow .
30 . Visualize 3 Moments From Today
Can be practiced in tandem with the one above , or separately .
Visualizing 3 moments from today means actually create those 3 moments .
See yourself performing those actions , attending those meetings , saying those words or writing those sentences .
It ’s early in the morning and nobody is pressuring .
You have the freedom to see yourself exactly as you want to be .
In my experience , almost any of these “ predicted ” moments are actually happening during the day .
31 . Take A Picture Of Yourself
I started this as a technical challenge a few years ago ( trying to automate my Mac PhotoBooth ) and proved to be enlightening .
Not the actual process of taking a photo of myself each morning , but seeing those photos in a fast moving sequence months after .
You ca n’t fool the camera in the morning .
All your problems , joys , frustrations or thrills are so transparent in a photo taken in the first moment of the day .
It ’s like a message you send to your future self without even knowing the message .
32 . Identify One Task To Be Canceled
There must be one .
Out of your entire to do list for today there must be one task which can be canceled .
Sometimes I wake up with the only thought of identifying my canceled task for the day .
I usually chose this approach after a very intense and tiring yesterday .
It give me a sense of freedom and flexibility .
And most of the time the freed time will make room for something interesting , or at least surprising .
It ’s like opening your door to the unexpected .
33 . Chose A Theme Of The Day
This works in tandem with your personal mission ( if you do n’t have a personal mission maybe it ’s time to find one ) .
Find one red stripe which will go through your entire day .
Like making this day “ the productivity day ” .
Or “ the observation day ” .
Or “ the money day ” .
This will be the dominant vibe of your entire day .
By setting course in the very first moments of the morning you will maximize your chances to actually create your day on that exact theme .
Already picked one ?
Great , now go ahead and pick one way to end your day . 😉
It 's metamod , not SM by the looks of it .
But I would n't be surprised if both are heavily knackered in this update .
edit : oh I might be wrong , let me check
edit2 : yeah , just SM , phew , but still OH GOD

After a botched Union naval effort on the Mississippi River , Rear Admiral David D. Porter resorted to trickery to prevent one of his captured ironclads from being used by the Confederates .
S ignal rockets pierced the darkness over Vicksburg , Mississippi , on February 25 , 1863 .
Dozing Southern artillery crews sprang to life , yelling , " Ironclad approaching ! "
Supporting a skull - and - crossbones flag at her bow , the iron hulk protruded guns from all sides .
Both paddle - wheel housings bore the taunting legend " Deluded People Cave In . "
Angered by the vessel 's audacity , the Confederate batteries opened a blistering fire .
" Never did the batteries of Vicksburg open with such a din , " recalled Union Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter .
" The earth fairly trembled , and shot flew thick and fast around the devoted monitor . "
Incredibly , the vessel simply cruised past at her leisure with no alteration in speed , nor did she bother to return fire .
O n course to Vicksburg , the Confederate ram Queen of the West spotted the behemoth and swung quickly around .
Her captain , James McCloskey , recalled , " Her guns were run out and her deck was cleared for action . "
With her steam up , Queenretreated downriver with the ironclad seemingly in pursuit .
What the panic - stricken McCloskey failed to realize was that the giant Union ironclad was a giant hoax sent to prevent the salvage of a real Union ironclad , USS Indianola .
I ndianola was part of a new , supposedly faster class of river ironclads constructed to bolster the sluggish river " tinclads " currently in use .
Named for the city in Iowa , she possessed the shallow draft of a conventional riverboat , but with casemates of 3 - inch armor plating in the bow and stern .
For wide - angle firing , two powerful 11 - inch Dahlgren cannons were placed on pivots in the front casemate .
Two 9 - inch guns were mounted in the rear .
Two side paddle wheels , enclosed in iron housings , and two screw propellers beneath the stern propelled Indianola .
Each paddle wheel had its own engine , enabling the vessel to turn sharply in narrow channels .
The crew 's quarters were virtually nonexistent , since the engines took up most of the interior space .
Despite that , she could only manage a paltry 6 knots , or slower if going against the current .
Anticipation , however , was great for Indianola -- so great that no journalists were allowed on board to reveal her secrets .
L ieutenant Commander George Brown was tabbed as Indianola 's skipper .
A graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis , Brown had seen action with the blockading fleets off Mobile and New Orleans .
O n January 23 , 1863 , Indianola joined the Mississippi Squadron under Admiral Porter , son of the controversial Commodore David Porter of War of 1812 fame .
Commodore Porter was a hot - tempered , impulsive man who once led an unauthorized attack on the Puerto Rican city of Fajardo to force an apology from Spanish authorities for arresting one of his officers .
He was subsequently court - martialed and resigned his commission .
He then served in the Mexican navy , taking his son along with him .
Young David served as a midshipman on the Mexican vessel Guerrero off the coast of Cuba .
After an encounter with a Spanish frigate , he was captured and spent several months in a Havana prison .
Eventually he returned to the United States , and in 1847 he served with distinction against the country he previously fought for as a U.S. Navy captain aboard the steamer Spitfire .
D uring the early days of the Civil War , Porter commanded a flotilla of mortar schooners that were used with telling effect against Confederate forts guarding the passage to New Orleans .
Impressed with his vigor , Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles tapped Porter for command of the Mississippi Squadron , even though 80 naval officers preceded him in rank .
Consumed with ambition , Porter would not hesitate to trample on a fellow officer if he could benefit from doing so .
One newspaper correspondent wrote that he was " vain , arrogant and egotistical to an extent that can neither be described nor exaggerated . "
For all his vanity , Porter possessed extraordinary resourcefulness , a tremendous asset in river warfare .
P orter 's vessels operated above Vicksburg , held at bay by the city 's formidable batteries .
The Mississippi Squadron consisted of " City Class " ironclads financed by wealthy steamboat salvager James Eads , mortar schooners , transports and the steamboat rams commanded by Colonel Alfred Ellet .
More than 50 vessels would eventually join Porter 's command , including his sumptuous flagship , Black Hawk .
Porter 's flagship included such amenities as a gourmet kitchen and a cow for fresh milk .
Impressed with Black Hawk 's bill of fare , Union Maj. Gens. Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman would often leave their billets to dine with the admiral .
T he Confederacy still held a 240 - mile - long portion of the Mississippi between Vicksburg and Port Hudson , La. Some 45 miles upriver from Port Hudson , the Red River flowed into the Mississippi from the Confederacy 's western states -- a vital source of food and manpower .
Admiral David Farragut had conquered that portion of the river the previous summer , but was forced to return to New Orleans after the river level dropped .
An attempt to circumvent Vicksburg by digging a canal ended in failure .
T hat the Rebels were still able to supply Vicksburg was particularly vexing for Porter and gave newspapers fodder to launch barbs at the admiral .
The Chicago Tribune labeled him " The greatest humbug of the war .
He absolutely never accomplished anything unaided .
He bombarded Vicksburg for months ; threw hundreds of tons of metal into the city ; never hit but one house and never killed a man .
The Confederates laughed at him . "
As a further inducement to act , Assistant Navy Secretary Gustavus Fox telegraphed Porter that he would be made a full admiral if he could reconquer the lower Mississippi .
P orter decided instead to send a ram , one of the lightweight maneuverable vessels designed by Charles Ellet Jr. , downriver to disrupt Confederate supply shipments .
Colonel Charles Rivers Ellet , the 19 - year - old son of Charles Ellet Jr. , was given the assignment .
Porter thought highly of young Ellet and considered him a " gallant young fellow , full of dash and enterprise . "
A former medical student , Ellet had no formal naval training , but made up for it with a relentless courage in battle .
No fort or vessel was too tough for his ram .
At the Battle of Memphis on June 6 , 1862 , he personally accepted the surrender of that city after the fleet commanded by his father annihilated the Confederate River Defense Fleet .
Ironically , Charles Ellet Jr. was the only Federal casualty of that battle , dying of his wounds later in the month .
C olonel Ellet took command of Queen of the West and was ordered to ram the steamboat City of Vicksburg , moored at the Vicksburg docks , then proceed downriver , destroying any Confederate vessels along the way .
The attack was to be at night to conceal Queen from the city 's batteries .
Porter warned Queen 's crew : " Look out for [ yourselves ] and press with full speed downriver .
If you get disabled , drift down until abreast of our batteries and a small army steamer will go to your assistance .
The great object is to destroy all you can of the enemy 's stores and provisions and get your vessel back safe . "
Ellet reinforced the ram with two layers of cotton bales around the decks and bulwarks .
To protect the helmsman , the wheel was moved below the pilothouse to the lower deck .
Unfortunately , the pilot 's view was significantly reduced , forcing Ellet to move the wheel back to the pilothouse .
Precious time was lost during the experimentation , and Queen would have to attack in daylight .
H ugging the Mississippi's west bank , Queen rounded De Soto Peninsula on February 2 .
Ellet made a hard left turn and headed directly for City of Vicksburg .
The Mississippi was at flood stage , causing the current to flow more rapidly .
Queen became caught in a powerful eddy and was forced to veer off course .
Still , the ram was able to strike a glancing blow , taking out a portion of Vicksburg 's cabin .
While the two vessels were interlocked , Ellet managed to start a blaze on Vicksburg , but the Southern crewmen doused the fire before it caused much damage .
T he vessels then moved apart , providing Vicksburg 's river batteries with the opportunity to shell Queen .
The Rebel shellbursts soon ignited some of Queen 's cotton - bale armor , forcing Ellet to concentrate on saving his ship rather than destroying his enemy .
The Yankees went to work beating out the flames and headed downriver through a storm of shot and shell .
A group of Rebel infantrymen added to Queen 's misery by popping off at the burning ship as she floated by .
C rewmen on Queen pushed burning cotton bales overboard .
Ellet reported : " After much exertion , we finally put out the fire by cutting the bales loose .... We were struck twelve times , but though the cabin was knocked to pieces , no material injury to the boat or any of those on her was inflicted . "
City of Vicksburg was not sunk , but a hole was punched in the ship below the waterline .
She was later propped up on two coal barges , and her machinery and cargo were salvaged .
Q ueen next rendezvoused with the termite - ridden steamer De Soto , stationed downriver to offer assistance to Queen if needed .
Ellet and De Soto proceeded downriver .
For the next two weeks , Ellet operated below Vicksburg with the two ships .
He had the vessels steaming up the Big Black and Red rivers capturing ships and making a general nuisance of himself .
Ellet also outfitted Queen with two Parrott cannons , a 30 pounder and a 20 pounder , armament he obtained from the Union infantry that was in control of Young 's Point .
O n February 12 , hearing of possible targets on the Atchafalaya River , Ellet cruised down to the Louisiana town of Simmesport .
Queen 's crew went ashore , destroying all supplies on the wharves and looting the residential area .
That evening , Queen went back upriver toward the Mississippi .
Local civilians fired their rifles at her along the way , shattering the knee of 1st Mate James Thompson .
Angered by the attack , Ellet burned three plantations believed to have been the homes of those who wounded Thompson .
As her manor house burned , a planter 's daughter defiantly sang " The Bonny Blue Flag " into the face of a startled Ellet .
O n February 14 , 1863 , Queen and De Soto set course up the Red River , overtaking and capturing the steamboat Era No.5 carrying 4,500 bushels of corn to Little Rock .
After paroling the ship 's crew and passengers , a small crew from Queen transferred to Era to sail the vessel .
The wounded Thompson was not among those transferred , a mistake that would come back to haunt Ellet .
Era was left behind while Queen and De Soto proceeded toward the earthen Confederate battery at Fort Taylor ( later renamed Fort DeRussey ) , built to defend the upper passages of the Red River .
W arned of Queen 's approach , Fort Taylor 's commander , Captain John Kelso , carefully targeted his guns at the site where the ram would come into view .
De Soto laid anchor behind a bend while Ellet reconnoitered Fort Taylor that evening .
The stronghold opened fire , and Ellet ordered Queen about to avoid the shells .
Not one of Ellet 's men had any knowledge of the Red River , thereby increasing the risk of running aground , especially in darkness .
True to the risk , pilot Thomas Garvey ran Queen into a mudbank .
Captain Kelso set fire to a nearby warehouse to light up the area where Queen was grounded , which was well within range of Fort Taylor 's guns .
F our 32 - pounder cannons poured shells into the hapless ram , fracturing her steam chest .
Scalding steam drove the crew out on the decks and over the sides .
To prevent steam from entering their lungs , they stuffed shredded pieces of uniform into their mouths .
The cotton bale armor was pitched overboard , and men clung to the bulky but buoyant bales as life preservers .
Too wounded to move , 1st Mate Thompson had to be left on board .
As a result , Queen could not be scuttled , but had to be abandoned to the Fort Taylor garrison .
Thompson died in captivity several days later .
T he survivors floated down to De Soto and clambered aboard .
Departing in a thick fog , De Soto also ran aground , shearing off her rudder in the process .
Ellet blamed pilot Garvey , whom he clapped in irons for treasonous behavior .
Era No. 5 came to the rescue and took Ellet and his men aboard .
No longer able to steer , De Soto was set on fire by spreading hot coals across her decks .
T wo days prior to Queen 's capture , Admiral Porter had sent Indianola downriver with a load of coal for Queen and De Soto .
Lieutenant Commander George Brown lashed two coal barges to either side of Indianola and headed out .
He caught the Vicksburg batteries napping around midnight on February 13 and slipped past without any appreciable damage .
According to newspaper reporter W.S. Ward , " The fun had actually begun -- shot and shell screamed and burst above and beyond us , and the pilot 's orders , now changed from whispered signs to vigorous commands , were heard and answered with no need of intervening messengers . "
E ventually , Era No. 5 , battered by driftwood floating in the Red River that had snapped off portions of her starboard paddle wheel , limped into the Mississippi River .
Ellet had exhausted his supply of coal , and had also burned his coal barge to prevent its capture .
The harried officer was burning the cargo of captured corn as fuel .
On February 16 , Era made contact with Indianola .
" You may be sure that no men ever witnessed a more welcome sight than this same good steamer Indianola , " a reporter on Era stated .
" It was a miraculous escape ; from the depths of despair we were raised to the heights of exaltation . "
E llet explained his fiasco to Brown over coffee .
He warned him that Queen had been captured and would certainly be redeployed as a Confederate ram .
After loading up on coal , Era set off upriver .
Cotton bales , confiscated from plantations along the way , were used to protect her from gunfire .
Indianola remained behind to block the mouth of the Red River .
The Confederate ram William H. Webb tried to pursue Era No. 5 , but after Indianola fired a few shots in her direction , Webb quickly turned upriver to warn Fort Taylor and any vessels she encountered .
T he Confederate commander of Louisiana , Maj. Gen. Richard Taylor , was soon aware of Indianola 's presence .
" We barely had time to congratulate ourselves on the capture of the Queen , " he wrote , " before the appearance of the Indianola deprived us again of the navigation of the great river , so vital to our cause . "
Taylor , a prominent local planter and son of President Zachary Taylor , ordered the captured Queen towed to Alexandria , La. , for repairs .
" She was an ordinary river steamer , with her bow strengthened for ramming , " he observed .
" A heavy bulwark for protection against sharp - shooters , and with embrasures for field guns , surrounded her upper deck . "
L ater Queen of the West , William H. Webb and the steamer Grand Era were assembled to drive off Indianola .
At 14 knots against the current , Webb was one of the fastest vessels on the Mississippi .
Both rams were loaded with sharpshooters and field artillery .
Eager volunteers from the garrison at Fort Taylor served as crew members .
Slaves to be used as stokers for the engine boilers were forcibly obtained from nearby plantations .
" It was a curious feature , " noted Taylor , " that Southern people would cheerfully send their sons to battle , but kept their slaves out of danger . "
Major Joseph Brent was given command of the expedition .
A lawyer before the war , Brent was a master improviser in a theater where supply lines were at a trickle .
Short of paper , he once used wallpaper for wrapping rifle cartridges .
Brent later recalled , " I doubt whether any commander ever had an expedition of poorer promise against as formidable and well equipped an enemy . "
T he garrison at Port Hudson got involved in the fray by sending a steamer of its own .
The commandeered vessel Dr. Beatty was equipped with a 24 - pounder Parrott gun , two fieldpieces and an enthusiastic crew of 250 .
" A warm send off was given by the fort 's garrison , " a private recalled , " the deafening acclamations of these and those on board marked this as one of the most memorable incidents of Port Hudson . "
A fter four days , Commander Brown decided to head Indianola back upriver .
" My purpose was to communicate with the squadron as soon as possible , " Brown later wrote , " thinking that Colonel Ellet had not reached the squadron , or that Admiral Porter would expect me to return when I found that no other boat was sent below . "
To hasten his return , Brown could have left the coal barges behind .
But he felt the coal would be needed if Porter sent another vessel down .
Besides , he had a 90 - mile lead on any potential pursuers .
The loaded - down ship , however , could do only about 2 1/2 knots against the current , and the speedier Confederate rams would soon catch up .
O n the evening of February 24 , 1863 , on the east bank of the Mississippi , just above Palmyra Island , Brown spied the shadowy outlines of four vessels heading straight toward him .
He cleverly brought Indianola about to interpose one of the barges between his ship and the Confederate warships .
M ajor Brent reported : " We first discovered the Indianola about 1,000 yards distant , hugging the eastern bank of the Mississippi , with his head quartering across and down the river .
Not an indication of life was given as we dashed on toward him -- no light , no perceptible motion of his machinery was discernible . "
Q ueen of the West served her new Confederate cause well .
She struck first , slicing through the coal barge on Indianola 's port side , but doing little damage .
Next came Webb .
" I stood for her at full speed , " recalled Brown .
" Both vessels came together bows on , with a tremendous crash , which knocked nearly everyone down aboard both vessels . "
As the rams plowed into Indianola , the transports poured rifle fire into portholes .
Webb rammed the starboard side next , splitting that coal barge in two .
Queen followed , shearing off the starboard rudder and caving in the wheel housing .
Water began to pour into Indianola 's hull , causing her to list dangerously to one side .
The 9 - inch Dahlgrens fired wildly into the dark , not scoring a single hit .
Major Brent recalled , " The moon was partially obscured by a veil of white clouds and permitted just sufficient obscurity to render uncertain the aim of the formidable artillery of the enemy . "
To make matters worse , cotton bales piled around the pilothouse for added protection significantly reduced pilot visibility .
B rown recklessly ran about while trying to coordinate the defense of his ship .
" Brown exposed himself everywhere , " recalled assistant surgeon H.M. Mixer .
" He stood upon the hurricane deck , swept by volleys of musketry , grape and canister shot , looking out for the rams , giving orders to his pilots , and with his revolver firing upon the pilots of the enemy .
He stood on his knees on the grating on the main deck to see to it that the engineer correctly understood the orders from the pilots . "
Realizing his command was sinking fast into the Mississippi , Brown decided to keep Indianola in deep water , hoping she could not be salvaged by the Confederates .
T he signal books were tossed overboard to keep them from falling into enemy hands .
Aboard Dr. Beatty , Colonel Frederick
Brand called out to his men , " Prepare to board ! "
Brown heard the command and called out that he was sinking .
" For God 's sake do n't shoot anymore , I 've surrendered ! " he cried .
Brown offered his sword to Colonel Brand , who eagerly accepted it .
The victorious Confederates took Brown and his men to a Vicksburg jail , and they were later sent to a prison camp in east Texas .
W ebb and Dr. Beatty took their prize in tow , only to have her sink over a sandbar off Palmyra Island .
Salvage parties worked furiously to patch the hull and raise Indianola .
Slaves from Brierfield , the nearby plantation of Confederate President Jefferson Davis , were sent over to assist .
O nce again , a significant portion of the Mississippi was still in Confederate hands .
Two of Porter 's finest vessels , Queen of the West and Indianola , were gone .
Along with the December 1862 repulse of Union forces at Chickasaw Bluffs , Vicksburg had reason to rejoice .
" Piping and dancing have been the order of the night for every night this week , " reported Vicksburg Daily Whig publisher Marmaduke Shannon .
" Victory celebrations and relief from tension could be carried too far , by both citizens and soldiers , " the newsman warned .
B efore Indianola 's crew was jailed , the finger pointing began .
Still unable to pass Port Hudson , Admiral Farragut blamed his own adoptive brother , Admiral Porter .
" Porter has allowed his boats to come down one at a time and they have been captured by the enemy , which compels me to go up and recapture the whole or be sunk in the attempt . "
Porter blamed Ellet for grounding Queen " under the guns of a battery which she had foolishly engaged .
Had Ellet waited patiently he would have been joined in less than 24 hours by Indianola .
I can give good orders , but I can not give officers good judgement . "
As for Indianola , Porter declared , " she had been indifferently fought .
She gave up too soon .
She would have gained victory if properly managed ! "
U nconcerned with who was to blame , Gideon Welles thundered , " The Indianola is too formidable to be left at large . "
He demanded that a sufficient squadron be gathered to recapture the ironclad before she was salvaged .
Porter , on the other hand , thought that he had too few vessels for a sufficient squadron .
Two more Ellet rams , Lancaster and Switzerland , had been sunk or severely damaged by battery fire .
None of his remaining vessels could match the speed and maneuverability of Queen or Webb .
Not wanting further embarrassment , Porter came up with the idea of using a mock ironclad to frighten away Rebel salvagers .
S tarting with an abandoned flatboat , Porter put his command to work constructing his ruse .
Tapered logs were added to the sides of the flatboat to give it a hull - like appearance .
Canvas and wooden planks were used in the center to form a casemate , pilothouse and paddle - wheel housings .
Two unusable lifeboats were bolted to fake davits for further realism .
Blackened logs served as the vessel 's weaponry .
Pork barrel smokestacks were added to either side of the pilothouse .
For a dark , sinister appearance , the exterior was blackened with tar .
As a final touch , two iron pots filled with tar and oakum were placed at the base of the smokestacks and ignited .
Clouds of black smoke curled upward as the ersatz ironclad was set adrift in the Mississippi current .
Dubbed Black Terror , she was built in 12 hours for a mere $ 8.63 .
A t 11 p.m. , on February 25 , Black Terror was towed into the Mississippi , cut loose and sent on her journey .
After cruising past Vicksburg , the vessel struck the west bank of the Mississippi near Warrenton , but Union soldiers pushed her back into the current , and soon Black Terror was drifting at 5 knots .
Confederate crewmen on Queen of the West saw Black Terror approaching and turned about and headed downriver to warn any vessels of the Union 's latest threat .
Coming upon the wrecked Indianola , Captain McCloskey of Queen warned the salvage party of the ironclad 's approach .
The frightened salvagers decided to scuttle Indianola to prevent her recapture .
The guns were spiked or thrown overboard .
What was left was set on fire , burning her down to the waterline .
Colonel Wirt Adams , commander of a nearby cavalry regiment , remarked , " With the exception of the wine and liquor stores of the Indianola , nothing was saved .
The valuable armament , the large supplies of powder , shot and shell are all lost . "
Black Terror , her mission completed , drifted on for two more miles , then struck a mudbank .
She fired no shots and no crew members appeared on the deck .
Curious about the lack of any crew activity , a Confederate party from ashore rowed toward the silent vessel .
Upon closer inspection , they realized too late the duplicity .
T he Southern press wasted no time in running down the botched Indianola salvage effort .
" Laugh and hold your sides lest you die of a surfeit of derision , " stated the Richmond Examiner , " blown up because , forsooth , a flat boat or mud scow , with a small house taken from a back garden of a plantation put on top of it , is floated down the river , before the frightened eyes of the Partisan Rangers . "
N ot only had Indianola been denied to the Confederate Navy , but Webb and Queen skeedaddled up the Red River , never again to emerge on the Mississippi as a threat .
" Gunboat panic seized the whole country , " reported the Examiner , " and it became a serious question at the Navy Department whether liberty and the Southern Confederacy could exist in the presence of a cannon floating on a piece of wood in the water . "
The Confederacy would have to rely on the garrisons of Vicksburg and Port Hudson to hold its shrinking portion of the Mississippi .
Both key cities would fall the following summer to Union land troops supported by gunboats .
Black Terror , however , had also played a small role in clearing the Mississippi of Rebel ships .
Porter modestly summed up his piece of naval trickery as " a cheap expedient which worked very well . "
It was likely the most effective $ 8.63 spent by the Union 's military forces during the entire war .

The region , though , has seen an enormous increase in water use since the 1960s .
Part of that is because of the growing population , though even more resulted from the so - called Green Revolution , which dramatically increased India 's agricultural production - in part by exponentially expanding the use of groundwater for irrigation .
European leaders were deciding what message to send to the G20 Summit European Union leaders have agreed to seek a global deal for bankers ' bonuses to be clawed back if profits fall .
The leaders meeting in Brussels approved the clause as part of a common EU position for next week 's G20 summit in Pittsburgh in the US .
They want the threat of sanctions to be used to force banks to link bonuses to long - term performance .
There is concern the current system may encourage short - term risk - taking , which helped trigger the banking crisis .
Speaking ahead of the meeting , UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there was broad backing for bonus restrictions .
' Appalled ' " I believe that people have been appalled by the suggestion in some institutions and their practices that they simply want to return to the policies of the past , " Mr Brown said .
The president ... supports a robust approach to executive compensation but has been reluctant to sort of set individual compensation levels
Mike Froman , US international economic affairs advisor
Bonus reform country by country " There is no support in any part of the world for failing to take the action that is necessary and I believe that we will be able to agree on a structure for how bonuses should be examined in the future . "
But the US and UK have rejected calls for mandatory caps on bonuses .
" The G20 should commit to agreeing to binding rules for financial institutions on variable remunerations backed up by the threat of sanctions at the national level , " said the agreed statement .
The EU leaders will also urge the G20 nations to maintain stimulus spending that has prompted some signs of global recovery .
Deadlock French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who has led the charge against high levels of banker pay , has threatened to walk out of the conference if no stringent compensation rules are passed .
" The bonus bubble burst tonight , " said Swedish Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt , whose country holds the EU presidency .
" We have agreed to say that enough is enough and we need to move away from the current culture of compensation based on short - term performance . "
But US President Barack Obama has repeatedly said he is against being over - prescriptive on pay .
" The president has been pretty clear that he supports a robust approach to executive compensation but has been reluctant to sort of set individual compensation levels , " said Mike Froman , deputy national security advisor for international economic affairs .
Mr Froman said the G20 was most likely to agree a " set of principles " on bonuses .
The UK , Germany , France and Italy are the only official members of the EU in the G20 - which brings together developed and emerging economies .
The EU itself is the 20th member , though Spain and the Netherlands will sit in on the talks .

Cosmic Trigger Volume I : Final Secret of the Illuminati Preface to the Falcon Press Edition , 1986 Cosmic Trigger was originally published by And / Or Press about ten years ago , and by Pocket Books shortly thereafter .
Although some of my novels have sold far better , in two dimensions at least it is my most " successful " book in human terms .
1 . From the date of the first printing to the present , I have received more mail about Cosmic Trigger than about anything else I ever wrote , and most of this mail has been unusuallly intelligent and open - minded .
For some reason , many readers of this book think they can write to me intimately and without fear , about subjects officially Taboo in our society .
I have learned a great deal from the correspondence , and have met some wonderful new friends .
2 . On lecture tours , I am always asked more questions about this book than about all my other works together .
This new edition presents an opportunity to answer the most frequent questions and to correct the most persistent misunderstandings .
It should be obvious to all intelligent readers ( but curiously is not obvious to many ) that my viewpoint in this book is one of agnosticism .
The word " agnostic " appears explicitly in the prologue and the agnostic attitude is revealed again and again in the text , but many people still think I " believe " some of the metaphors and models employed here .
I therefore want to make it even clearer than ever before that I DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING
This remark was made , in these very words , by John Gribbin , physics editor of New Scientist magazine , in a BBC - TV debate with Malcolm Muggeridge , and it provoked incredulity on the part of most viewers .
It seems to be a hangover of the medieval Catholic era that causes most people , even the educated , to think that everybody must " believe " something or other , that if one is not a theist , one must be a dogmatic atheist , and if one does not think Capitalism is perfect , one must believe fervently in Socialism , and if one does not have blind faith in X , one must alternatively have blind faith in not -X or the reverse of X .
My own opinion is that belief is the death of intelligence .
As soon as one believes a doctrine of any sort , or assumes certitude , one stops thinking about that aspect of existence .
The more certitude one assumes , the less there is left to think about , and a person sure of everything would never have any need to think about anything and might be considered clinically dead under current medical standards , where absence of brain activity is taken to mean that life has ended .
My attitude is identical to that of Dr. Gribbin and the majority of physicists today , and is known in physics as " the Copenhagen Interpretation , " because it was formulated in Copenhagen by Dr. Niels Bohr and his co-workers c. 1926 - 28 .
The Copenhagen Interpretation is sometimes called " model agnosticism " and holds that any grid we use to organize our experience of the world is a model of the world and should not be confused with the world itself .
Alfred Korzybski , the semanticist , tried to popularize this outside physics with the slogan , " The map is not the territory . "
Alan Watts , a talented exegete of Oriental philosophy , restated it more vividly as " The menu is not the meal . "
Belief in the traditional sense , or certitude , or dogma , amounts to the grandiose delusion , " My current model " -- or grid , or map , or reality - tunnel -- " contains the whole universe and will never need to be revised . "
In terms of the history of science and knowledge in general , this appears absurd and arrogant to me , and I am perpetually astonished that so many people still manage to live with such a medieval attitude .
Cosmic
Trigger deals with a process of deliberately induced brain change through which I put myself in the years 1962 - 1976 .
This process is called " initiation " or " vision quest " in many traditional societies and can loosely be considered some dangerous variety of self - psychotherapy in modern terminology .
I do not recommend it for everybody , and I think I obtained more good results than bad ones chiefly because I had been through two varieties of ordinary psychotherapy before I started my own adventures and because I had a good background in scientific philosophy and was not inclined to " believe " any astounding Revelations too literally .
Briefly , the main thing I learned in my experiments is that " reality " is always plural and mutable .
Since most of Cosmic Trigger is devoted to explaining and illustrating this , and since I still encounter people who have read all my writings on this subject and still do not understand what I am getting at , I will try again in this new Preface to explain it ONE MORE TIME , perhaps more clearly than before .
" Reality " is a word in the English language which happens to be ( a ) a noun and ( b ) singular .
Thinking in the English language ( and in cognate Indo - European languages ) therefore subliminally programs us to conceptualize " reality " as one block - like entity , sort of like a huge New York skyscraper , in which every part is just another " room " within the same building .
This linguistic program is so pervasive that most people cannot " think " outside it at all , and when one tries to offer a different perspective they imagine one is talking gibberish .
The notion that " reality " is a noun , a solid thing like a brick or a baseball bat , derives from the evolutionary fact that our nervous systems normally organize the dance of energy into such block - like " things , " probably as instant bio-survival cues .
Such " things , " however , dissolve back into energy dances -- processes or verbs -- when the nervous system is synergized with certain drugs or transmuted by yogic or shamanic exercises or aided by scientific instruments .
In both mysticism and physics , there is general agreement that " things " are constructed by our nervous systems and that " realities " ( plural ) are better described as systems or bundles of energy functions .
So much for " reality " as a noun .
The notion that " reality " is singular , like a hermetically sealed jar , does not jibe with current scientific findings which , in this century , suggest that " reality " may better be considered as flowing and meandering , like a river , or interacting , like a dance or evolving , like life itself .
Most philsophers have known , at least since around 500 B.C. , that the world perceived by our senses is not " the real world " but a construct we create -- our own private work of art .
Modern science began with Galileo 's demonstration that color is not " in " objects but " in " the interaction of our senses with objects .
Despite this philosophic and scientific knowledge of neurological relativity , which has been more clearly demonstrated with each major advance in instrumentation , we still , due to language , think that behind the flowing , meandering , inter-acting , evolving universe created by perception is one solid monolithic " reality " hard and crisply outlined as an iron bar .
Quantum physics has undermined that Platonic iron - bar " reality " by showing that it makes more sense scientifically to talk only of the inter-actions we actually experience ( our operations in the laboratory ) ; and perception psychology has undermined the Platonic " reality " by showing that assuming it exists leads to hopeless contradictions in explaining how we actually perceive that a hippopotamus is not a symphony orchestra .
The only " realities " ( plural ) that we actually experience and can talk meaningfully about are perceived realities , experienced realities , existential realities -- realities involving ourselves as editors -- and they are all relative to the observer , fluctuating , evolving , capable of being magnified and enriched , moving from low resolution to hi-fi , and do not fit together like the pieces of a jig - saw into one single Reality with a capital R. Rather , they cast illumination upon one another by contrast , like the paintings in a large museum , or the different symphonic styles of Haydn , Mozart , Beethoven , and Mahler .
Alan Watts may have said it best of all : " The universe is a giant Rorschach ink - blot . "
Science finds one meaning in it in the 18th Century , another in the 19th , a third in the 20th ; each artist finds unique meanings on other levels of abstraction ; and each man and woman finds different meanings at different hours of the day , depending on the internal and external environments .
This book deals with what I have called induced brain change , which Dr. John Lilly more resoundingly calls " metaprogramming the human bio-computer . "
In simple Basic English , as a psychologist and novelist , I set out to find how much rapid re-organization was possible in the brain functioning of one normal domesticated primate of average intelligence -- the only one on whom I could ethically perform such risky research -- myself .
Like most people who have historically attempted such " metaprogramming , " I soon found myself in metaphysical hot water .
It became urgently obvious that my previous models and metaphors would not and could not account for what I was experiencing .
I therefore had to create new models and metaphors as I went along .
Since I was dealing with matters outside consensus reality - tunnels , some of my metaphors are rather extraordinary .
That does not bother me , since I am at least as much an artist as a psychologist , but it does bother me when people take these metaphors too literally .
I beg you , gentle reader , to memorize the quote from Aleister Crowley at the beginning of Part One and repeat it to yourself if at any point you start thinking that I am bringing you the latest theological revelations from Cosmic Central .
What my experiments demonstrate -- what all such experiments throughout history have demonstrated -- is simply that our models of " reality " are very small and tidy , the universe of experience is huge and untidy , and no model can ever include all the huge untidiness perceived by uncensored consciousness .
I think , or hope , that my data also demonstrates that neurological model agnosticism -- the application of the Copenhagen Interpretation beyond physics to consciousness itself -- allows one to escape from certain limits of mechanical emotion and robot mentation that are inescapable as long as one remains within one dogmatic model or one imprinted reality tunnel .
Personally I also suspect , or guess , or intuit , that the more unconventional of my models here -- the ones involving Higher Intelligence , such as the Cabalistic Holy Guardian Angel or the extraterrestrial from Sirius -- are necessary working tools at certain stages of the metaprogramming process .
That is , whether such entities exist anywhere outside our own imaginations , some areas of brain functioning cannot be accessed without using these " keys " to open the locks .
I do not insist on this ; it is just my own opinion .
Some people seem to get through this area of Chapel Perilous without such personalized " Guides . "
I know of one chap who did it by imagining a super - computer in the future that was sending information backwards in time to his brain .
More clever people may find even less " metaphysical " metaphors .
Ten years after the point at which this book ends , I do not care much about such speculations .
Our lonely little selves can be " illuminated " or flooded with radical science - fiction style information and cosmic perspectives , and the source of this may be those extraterrestrials who seemed to be helping me at times , or the Secret Chiefs of Sufism , or the parapsychologists and / or computers of the 23rd Century beaming data backward in time , or it may just be the previously unactivated parts of our own brains .
Despite the current reign of our New Inquisition , which attempts to halt research in this area , we will learn more about that as time passes .
Meanwhile , agnosticism is both honest and becomingly modest ....
In this connection , I am often asked about two books by other authors which are strangely resonant with Cosmic Trigger -- namely VALIS by Philip K. Dick and The Sirian Experiment by Doris Lessing .
VALIS is a novel which broadly hints that it is more than a novel -- that it is an actual account of Phil Dick 's own experience with some form of " Higher Intelligence . "
In fact , VALIS is only slightly fictionalized ; the actual events on which it is based are recounted in a long interview Phil gave shortly before his death ( see Philip K. Dick : The Last Testament , by Gregg Rickman . )
The parallels with my own experience are numerous -- but so are the differences .
If the same source was beaming ideas to both Phil and me , the messages got our individual flavors mixed into them as we decoded the signals .
I met Phil Dick on two or three occasions and corresponded with him a bit .
My impression was that he was worried that his experience was a temporary insanity and was trying to figure out if I was nutty , too .
I 'm not sure if he ever decided .
I interviewed Doris Lessing a few years ago for New Age magazine .
She takes synchronicities very seriously , but was as agnostic as I am about the possibility that some of them are orchestrated by Sirians .
I heartily recommend all three volumes -- VALIS , The Last Testament and The Sirian Experiments -- to readers of this book .
Unless you are locked into a very dogmatic reality - tunnel , you will have a few weird moments of wondering if Sirians are experimenting on us , and a few weird moments can be a liberating experience for those who are n't scared to death by them .
What is more important than such extra-mundane speculation , I think , are practical and pragmatic questions about what one does with the results of brain change experience .
It is quite easy , I have discovered by meeting many New Age people , to use the techniques in this book and go stone crazy with them .
Paranoid and schizophrenic cases are quite common among those who experiment in this area .
Less clinical , but socially even more nefarious , are the leagues of self - proclaimed gurus and their equally deluded disciples , who have discovered , as I did , that there are many realities ( plural ) , but have picked out one favorite non-Occidental reality - tunnel , named it Ultimate Reality or True Reality , and established new fanaticisms , snobberies , dogmas and cults around these delusions .
There is a great deal of lyrical Utopianism in this book .
I do not apologize for that , and do not regret it .
The decade that has passed since the first edition has not altered my basic commitment to the game - rule that holds that an optimistic mind - set finds dozens of possible solutions for every problem that the pessimist regards as incurable .
Since we all create our habitual reality - tunnels , either consciously and intelligently or unconsciously and mechanically , I prefer to create for each hour the happiest , funniest , and most romantic reality - tunnel consistent with the signals my brain apprehends .
I feel sorry for people who persistently organize experience into sad , dreary and hopeless reality tunnels , and try to show them how to break the bad habit , but I do n't feel any masochistic duty to share their misery .
This book does not claim that you " create your own reality " in the sense of total ( but mysteriously unconscious ) psychokinesis .
If a car hits you and puts you in the hospital , I do not believe this is because you " really wanted " to be hit by a car , or that you " needed " to be hit by a car , as two popular New Age bromides have it .
The theory of transactional psychology , which is the source of my favorite models and metaphors , merely says that , once you have been hit by a car , the meaning of the experience depends entirely on you and the results depend partly on you ( and partly on your doctors ) .
If it is medically possible for you to live -- and sometimes even if the doctors think it is medically impossible -- you ultimately decide whether to get out of the hospital in a hurry or to lie around suffering and complaining .
Most of the time , this kind of " decision " is unconscious and mechanical , but with the techniques described in this book , such decisions can become conscious and intelligent .
The last part of this book deals with the worst tragedy of my life .
I want to say , without self - pity ( a vice I despise ) that my years on this planet have included many other terrible and punishing experiences , starting with two bouts of polio when I was a child and including dozens of other things I do n't want to complain about in public .
When I write of creating a better and more optimistic reality - tunnel , of transcending ego - games , and of similar matters , it is not because I have lived in an ivory tower .
It is because I have learned a few practical techniques for dealing with the brutal conditions on this primitive planet .
People at my lectures and seminars usually ask me if I am still optimistic about civilian space programs and life extension .
I am more optimistic than ever .
Despite the seemingly terminal case of rigidicus bureaucraticus at NASA , I have reason to believe certain European countries will soon jointly launch the kind of space migration effort advocated here ; and Reagan 's SDI , for all its jingoism , means that more money will be spent on basic research than at any previous time in history .
On the life extension front , there have been several best - sellers on the subject since this book first appeared ; there is interest even in the most intellectually backward part of U.S. society ( namely , the Congress ) ; and scientiests in the longevity field whom I have met recently all cheerfully say they are getting more money for research than in the 70s .
The breakthrough can not be far away .
Finally as a matter of some entertainment value , not all the mail I have received about this book has been intelligent and thoughtful .
I have recieved several quite nutty and unintentionally funny poison - pen letters from two groups of dogmatists -- Fundamentalist Christians and Fundamentalist Materialists .
The Fundamentalist Christians have told me that I am a slave of Satan and should have the demons expelled with an exorcism .
The Fundamentalist Materialists inform me that I am a liar , a charlatan , fraud and scoundrel .
Aside from this minor difference , the letters are astoundingly similar .
Both groups share in the same crusading zeal and the same total lack of humor , charity , and common human decency .
These intolerable cults have served to confirm me in my agnosticism by presenting further evidence to support my contention that when dogmas enter the brain , all intellectual activity ceases .
- Dublin 1986 Cosmic Trigger II - Cosmic Trigger III
A Maryland scientist who once worked in varying capacities for the Department of Energy , the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been arrested for attempted espionage , David Kris , Assistant Attorney General for National Security , Channing D. Phillips , Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia , and Joseph Persichini , Jr. , Assistant Director for the FBI ’s Washington Field Office , announced today .
A criminal complaint unsealed today in the District of Columbia charges Stewart David Nozette , 52 , of Chevy Chase , Maryland , with attempted espionage for knowingly and willfully attempting to communicate , deliver , and transmit classified information relating to the national defense of the United States to an individual that Nozette believed to be an Israeli intelligence officer .
The complaint does not allege that the government of Israel or anyone acting on its behalf committed any offense under U.S. laws in this case .
Nozette was arrested earlier today by FBI agents and is expected to make his initial appearance tomorrow in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia .
If convicted , he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison .
" The conduct alleged in this complaint is serious and should serve as a warning to anyone who would consider compromising our nation ’s secrets for profit , " said David Kris , Assistant Attorney General for National Security .
" Those who would put our nation ’s defense secrets up for sale can expect to be vigorously prosecuted , " said Channing D. Phillips , Acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia .
" This case reflects our firm resolve to hold accountable any individual who betrays the public trust by compromising our national security for his or her own personal gain . "
" The FBI is committed to protecting the nation ’s classified information and pursuing those who attempt to profit from its release or sale , " said Joseph Persichini , Jr. , Assistant Director for the FBI ’s Washington Field Office .
According to an affidavit in support of the criminal complaint , Nozette received a Ph.D. in Planetary Sciences from MIT in 1983 , and worked at the White House on the National Space Council , Executive Office of the President , in 1989 and 1990 .
He developed the Clementine bi-static radar experiment that purportedly discovered water on the south pole of the moon .
Nozette also worked at the Department of Energy 's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory from approximately 1990 to 1999 where he designed highly advanced technology .
At the Department of Energy , Nozette held a special security clearance equivalent to the Defense Department Top Secret and Critical Nuclear Weapon Design Information clearances .
Department of Energy clearances apply to access to information specifically relating to atomic or nuclear - related materials .
Nozette was also the President , Treasurer and Director of the Alliance for Competitive Technology ( ACT ) , a non-profit corporation that he organized in March 1990 .
Between January 2000 and February 2006 , Nozette , through his company ACT , entered into several agreements to develop advanced technology for the U.S. government .
Nozette performed some of this research and development at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , D.C. , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency in Arlington , Virginia , and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Maryland .
From 1989 through 2006 , Nozette held security clearances as high as Top Secret and had regular , frequent access to classified information and documents related to the U.S. national defense .
According to the affidavit , on Sept. 3 , 2009 , Nozette was contacted via telephone by an individual purporting to be an Israeli intelligence officer , but who was in fact an undercover employee of the FBI ( UCE ) .
During that call , Nozette agreed to meet with the UCE later that day at a hotel in Washington D.C. According to the affidavit , Nozette met with the UCE that day and discussed his willingness to work for Israeli intelligence .
Nozette allegedly informed the UCE that he had , in the past , held top security clearances and had access to U.S. satellite information .
Nozette also allegedly said that he would be willing to answer questions about this information in exchange for money .
The UCE explained to Nozette that the Israeli intelligence agency , or " Mossad , " would arrange for a communication system so that Nozette could pass information to the Mossad in a post office box .
Nozette agreed to provide regular , continuing information to the UCE and asked for an Israeli passport
According to the affidavit , Nozette and the UCE met again on Sept. 4 , 2009 , in the same hotel .
During the meeting , Nozette allegedly informed the UCE that , although he no longer had legal access to any classified information at a U.S. government facility , he could , nonetheless , recall the classified information to which he had been granted access , indicating that it was all still in his head .
In the meeting , Nozette allegedly asked when he could expect to receive his first payment , specifying that he preferred to receive cash amounts " under ten thousand " so he did n’t have to report it .
At the conclusion of this meeting , Nozette allegedly informed the UCE , " Well I should tell you my first need is that they should figure out how to pay me . . . they do n't expect me to do this for free . "
On or about Sept. 10 , 2009 , undercover FBI agents left a letter in the designated post office box for Nozette .
In the letter , the FBI asked Nozette to answer a list of questions concerning U.S. satellite information .
The undercover agents also provided a $ 2,000 cash payment for Nozette .
The serial numbers of the bills were recorded .
Nozette retrieved the questions and the money from the post office the same day .
On or about Sept. 16 , 2009 , Nozette was captured on videotape leaving a manila envelope in the designated post office box in the District of Columbia .
The next day , FBI agents retrieved the sealed manila envelope that Nozette had dropped off and found , among other things , a one - page document containing answers to the questions posed by the undercover agents and an encrypted computer thumb drive .
One of answers provided by Nozette contained information classified as Secret , which concerned capabilities of a prototype overhead collection system .
In addition , Nozette allegedly offered to reveal additional classified information that directly concerned nuclear weaponry , military spacecraft or satellites , and other major weapons systems .
Also on or about Sept. 17 , 2009 , undercover FBI agents left a second letter in the post office box for Nozette .
In the letter , the FBI asked Nozette to answer another list of questions concerning U.S. satellite information .
The FBI also left a cash payment of $ 9,000 in the post office box .
Nozette allegedly retrieved the questions and the money from the post office box later that same day .
On or about October 1 , 2009 , Nozette was filmed on videotape leaving a manila envelope in the post office box .
Later that day , FBI agents retrieved the manila envelope left by Nozette and found a second set of answers from him .
The answers contained information classified as both Top Secret and Secret that concerned U.S. satellites , early warning systems , means of defense or retaliation against large - scale attack , communications intelligence information , and major elements of defense strategy .
This investigation was conducted by the FBI ’s Washington Field Office with assistance from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations .
The prosecution is being handled by Trial Attorneys Deborah A. Curtis and Heather M. Schmidt , from the Counterespionage Section of the Justice Department ’s National Security Division , and Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Asuncion , from the U.S. Attorney ’s Office for the District of Columbia .
The public is reminded that a criminal complaint contains mere allegations and that every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty .

It 's pretty sickening , but Limbaugh is a racist thug , and so is the Conserva - hack named Ken Rogulski -- a lowbrow reporter miscreant who uses the pain and suffering that the people of Detroit are experiencing and turns it into a racist giggle fest for RushBo 's audience .
Is there no decency in the world of conservative talk radio ?
Obviously not .
( photo via Detroit News )
King Crimson writes :
It was Wednesday when Rush Limbaugh received an .MP3 from the Desk of WJR Detroit 's Ken Rogulski , the white - haired beat reporter , who also occasionally anchors certain top hour newscasts in the conservative talk station 's broadcast day .
The audio gift would be the gavel with which Rush would pound out hate and bigotry , revelry in personal suffering , and twisting of words and ideas for the rest of the week .
Earlier , Rogulski scurried down to the Cobo Convention Center , locally referred to as Cobo Hall to see what kind of audio he could bring back from the huge crowd developing as the applications for federal aid for the poor and destitute were being handed out .
It was to be a brief windfall of assistance to one of the hardest hit cities in the country , where bankrupt auto companies and massive home foreclosure have helped define a new level of pain and suffering for these innocent human beings .
But you could hear the hope in their voices flapping in a breeze of unsureness like an untethered sail in a storm , these proud , innocent residents .
The conservo - talk reporter cherry picked through the audio booty until he found the absolute best soundbite that would most perfectly frame the city as one filled with Obama - fawning morons , black Sambos , and greedy welfare grabbers - precisely , as Limbaugh would later argue , the kind of rank idiots who would vote for someone like America 's first black president .
Surely Ken 's heart must have been pounding as he attached the audio to his corporate email and double checked the top - secret " To " address that would land the .MpP3 directly onto the desk of Rush 's long time producer , Kitt Carson .
JACKPOT !
Carson fast - tracked the audio to the OXYmoron , and by noon it was airing live .
" Where 's the money coming from ? ! "
Rogulski quickly quizzes .
" Obama ! , " the giddy resident chirps , confident the day will end in a bill being paid , or a week 's worth of groceries to stuff into the old fridge .
" And where does Obama get it from ? ! "
Rogulski follows up .
To the more politically refined in the conservative talk world , the answer is loud and clear - TAXPAYERS .
But Rogulski knows full well these " Motown simpletons " will not be so cynical as to believe he 's recording them with intentions of caricaturing them later as thigh - slapping morons .
" I dunno !
His stash , I dunno .
But he givin ' to us !
We love him ! "
Thursday , Rogulski , a small time nobody in comparison to his conservative mentor , decided to use this opportunity and momentum , and keep the mentions of his unimportant name ratta - tatting over the world - famous EIB Network going and sent another one .
This one even more sensational than the first .
Rogulski gently pushes the " save " button on his MP3 recorder and slickly slides it into his pocket .
Mission accomplished .
Limbaugh does n't poll affiliate stations daily to see if there 's any news he needs to know about .
He has a team of producers scouring the net daily .
So when an affiliate sends something to the Golden Microphone ... it 's because the sender knows Rush will want it , and knows precisely how he will use it .
And Rush could not have been happier .
No editing necessary for his staff , no double checking , it was packaged , edited and air ready .
And for three straight days , the AM Shock Talker pounded the audio candy like he had just been told the funniest joke this week .
Listen to how the first audio soundbite is edited to end with a laugh , which to the racist 's ear is a dog- whistle .
To a bigot , it is the laugh of bug - eyed Jemima .
But to the rest of America , it is the innocent guffaw of a child holding out her hands for a cool drink of water in one of the hottest economic downturns in a century .
Note how Limbaugh allows the sound of her laugh to hang in the air for a moment , to let it be the last thing you hear , to let it resonate with the comedic timing of George Burns before going on to the next soundbite .
A pause so small and so seemingly insignificant .
but silence is a moment as important as a word , that has been practiced and mastered by comedians and even broadcast greats like the similarly conservative late Paul Harvey .
Rush Limbaugh , and the affiliates who support his message of bigotry are not just racists .
They are the worst kind of racists .
They are the ones who can say the " N " word in code publicly , laugh out loud and hearty , and then argue that you are missing some bigger message if you think it 's meant as anything but good , clean fun .
What Is Shingles ?
You can think of shingles as a one - two punch of infections .
Anyone who gets it had a case of chickenpox first , often decades earlier .
Video Transcript CDC : “ Shingles ( Herpes Zoster ) . ” ; NIH Senior Health : “ Shingles . ” ; AudioJungle ; Image Source Pink ; Troels Graugaard ; itsmejust [ MUSIC PLAYING ]
These two conditions come from the same virus , called varicella zoster .
Chickenpox causes itchy blisters that might start on your back , chest , and face and spread to the rest of your body .
Shingles is a rash with shooting pain .
It usually shows up on one side of your body .
The rash turns into red , fluid - filled blisters .
They usually dry out and crust over within 7 to 10 days .

The nation of Hungary has taken a step forward granting marriage rights to same - sex couples .
While this is historic there still is a gap of inequality that must be changed .
" These life partnerships will be guaranteed the same tax , employment , social and immigration benefits as heterosexual marriages .

Hungarian LGBT organizations Hatter and Labrisz will continue to strive for full equality under the law .
27.5 million people in the United States ( 8.5 % of the US population ) do not have health insurance .
Among the 91.5 % who do have health insurance , 67.3 % have private insurance while 34.4 % have government - provided coverage through programs such as Medicaid or Medicare .
Employer - based health insurance is the most common type of coverage , applying to 55.1 % of the US population .
The United States is the only nation among the 37 OECD ( Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ) nations that does not have universal health care either in practice or by constitutional right .
Proponents of the right to health care say that no one in one of the richest nations on earth should go without health care .
They argue that a right to health care would stop medical bankruptcies , improve public health , reduce overall health care spending , help small businesses , and that health care should be an essential government service .
Opponents argue that a right to health care amounts to socialism and that it should be an individual ’s responsibility , not the government ’s role , to secure health care .
They say that government provision of health care would decrease the quality and availability of health care , and would lead to larger government debt and deficits .

Pro & Con Arguments
Pro 1
The founding documents of the United States provide support for a right to health care .
The Declaration of Independence states that all men have “ unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness , ” which necessarily entails having the health care needed to preserve life and pursue happiness .
The purpose of the US Constitution , as stated in the Preamble , is to “ promote the general welfare ” of the people .
According to former Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , as part of efforts to “ promote the general welfare , ” health care “ is a legitimate function of government . ”
Pro 2
Instituting a right to health care could lower the cost of health care in the United States .
According to a study from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst , under a single - payer system , in which all citizens are guaranteed a right to health care , total public and private health care spending could be lowered by up to $ 1.8 trillion over the next 10 years due to lowered administrative and prescription drug costs .
The American Medical Association reports that private health insurance plans spend 11.7 % of premiums on administrative costs vs. 6.3 % spent by public health programs .
According to data by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development ( OECD ) , Canada and the United Kingdom , two countries that provide universal health coverage , spend 47 % and 42 % of what the United States did per capita in 2017 .
South Korea , also with universal coverage , spent just 28 % .
Pro 3
A right to health care could save lives .
According to a study from Harvard researchers , “ lack of health insurance is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths per year , ” which translates into a 40 % increased risk of death among the uninsured .
Another study found that more than 13,000 deaths occur each year just in the 55 - 64 year old age group due to lack of health insurance coverage .
A Commonwealth Fund study found that due to a lack of timely and effective health care , the United States ranked at the bottom of a list of 16 rich nations in terms of preventable mortality and a further study published in the Lancet ranked the United States 29 out of 195 countries and territories in terms of preventable mortality .
In Italy , Spain , France , Australia , Israel , and Norway , all countries with a right to health care , people live up to five years longer than people in the United States .
Pro 4
The right to health care is an internationally recognized human right .
On Dec. 10 , 1948 the United States and 47 other nations signed the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
The document stated that “ everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well - being of oneself and one ’s family , including … medical care . ”
In 2005 the United States and the other member states of the World Health Organization signed World Health Assembly resolution 58.33 , which stated that everyone should have access to health care services and should not suffer financial hardship when obtaining these services .
According to a peer - reviewed study in the Lancet , “ [ r ] ight - to - health features are not just good management , justice , or humanitarianism , they are obligations under human - rights law . ”
The United States is the only OECD nation which does not have universal health care either in practice or by constitutional right .
According to the Comparative Constitutions Project , as of 2019 , over 130 countries have a right to health care in their national constitutions .
Pro 5
A right to health care could make medical services affordable for everyone .
According to a Gallup Poll , paying for health care is the biggest financial problem for US households .
A 2018 survey published by Becker ’s Healthcare found that 22 % of Americans found paying their deductible was “ very difficult ” or “ impossible ” and 64 % reported that they delayed or did not seek medical care due to cost .
The cost of US family health insurance premiums increased 80 % in the United States between 2003 and 2013 .
The cost of health insurance premiums for people who do not get coverage through work increased 105 % between 2013 and 2017 .
Pro 6
Providing all citizens the right to health care is good for economic productivity .
When people have access to health care , they live healthier lives and miss work less , allowing them to contribute more to the economy .
A study by researchers at the Universities of Colorado and Pennsylvania showed that workers with health insurance miss an average of 4.7 fewer work days than employees without health insurance .
According to an Institute of Medicine report , the US economy loses $ 65 - $ 130 billion annually as a result of diminished worker productivity , due to poor health and premature deaths , among the uninsured .
In a speech , World Bank President Jim Yong Kim stated that all nations should provide a right to health care “ to help foster economic growth . ”
Pro 7
A right to health care could improve public health .
According to a study in the Lancet that looked at data from over 100 countries , “ evidence suggests that broader health coverage generally leads to better access to necessary care and improved population health , particularly for poor people . ”
In the United States , people are 33 % less likely to have a regular doctor , 25 % more likely to have unmet health needs , and over 50 % more likely to not obtain needed medicines compared to their Canadian counterparts who have a universal right to healthcare .
According to a 2008 peer - reviewed study in the Annals of Internal Medicine , there were 11.4 million uninsured working - age Americans with chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes , and their lack of insurance was associated with less access to care , early disability , and even death .
Pro 8
Because the United States is a very wealthy country , it should provide health care for all its citizens .
Many European countries with a universal right to health care , such as France , Germany , Italy , and the United Kingdom , have a lower Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) per capita than the United States , yet they provide a right to health care for all their citizens .
As of 2017 , 28.5 million people ( 8.8 % of the US population ) did not have health insurance and , according to a study by the Congressional Budget Office , as many as 35 million people will be uninsured by 2028 .
The United States spent $ 10,209 per person on health care in 2017 , over 2.5 times the average spent by member countries of the OECD ( $ 3,992 per person ) .
With that level of spending , the United States should be able to provide a right to healthcare to everyone .
Pro 9 Providing a right to health care could benefit private businesses .
If the United States implemented a universal right to health care , businesses would no longer have to pay for employee health insurance policies .
As of 2017 , 56 % of Americans were receiving health insurance through their employer .
According to the Council on Foreign Relations , some economists believe the high costs of employee health insurance place US companies at a “ competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace . ”
According to the Business Coalition for Single - Payer Healthcare , a right to healthcare under a single - payer - system could reduce employer labor costs by 10 - 12 % .
Pro 10 A right to health care could encourage entrepreneurship .
After the introduction of Obamacare , which increased access to health insurance for Americans , the number of self - employed Americans increased 150,000 between 2014 and 2016 .
6.1 % percentage of job - seekers started their own businesses in 2016 , marking a four - year high .
A study published in Contemporary and Economic Policy found that providing universal health care in the United States could increase self - employment by 2 to 3.5 percent .
Pro 11 A right to health care could stop medical bankruptcies .
According to the National Bankruptcy Forum , medical debt is the # 1 reason people file for bankruptcy in the United States .
In 2017 , about 33 % of all Americans with medical bills reported that they “ were unable to pay for basic necessities like food , heat , or housing . ”
If all US citizens were provided health care under a single - payer system medical bankruptcy would no longer exist , because the government , not private citizens , would pay all medical bills .
Pro 12
A right to health care is a necessary foundation of a just society .
The United States already provides free public education , public law enforcement , public road maintenance , and other public services to its citizens to promote a just society that is fair to everyone .
Health care should be added to this list .
Late US Senator Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) wrote that providing a right to health care “ goes to the heart of my belief in a just society . ”
According to Norman Daniels , PhD , Professor of Ethics and Population Health at Harvard University , “ healthcare preserves for people the ability to participate in the political , social , and economic life of society .
It sustains them as fully participating citizens . ”
Con 1
The founding documents of the United States do not provide support for a right to health care .
Nowhere in the Declaration of Independence does it say there is a right to health care .
The purpose of the US Constitution , as stated in the Preamble , is to “ promote the general welfare , ” not to provide it .
The Bill of Rights lists a number of personal freedoms that the government cannot infringe upon , not material goods or services that the government must provide .
According to former Congressman Ron Paul ( R - TX ) , “ you have a right to your life and you have a right to your liberty and you have a right to keep what you earn in a free country …
You do not have the right to services or things . ”
Con 2
A right to health care could increase the US debt and deficit .
Spending on Medicare , Medicaid , and the Children ’s Health Insurance Program , all government programs that provide a right to health care for certain segments of the population , totaled less than 10 % of the federal budget in 1985 , but by 2012 these programs took up 21 % of the federal budget and are predicted to reach 30 % of federal spending by 2028 .
According to former US House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan ( R - WI ) , government health care programs drive “ the explosive growth in our spending and our debt . ”
Research from George Mason University concludes that providing government funded health care to all could increase federal spending by $ 32.6 trillion over the first ten years of implementation .
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculates that universal health care coverage would result in an additional $ 19 trillion of federal debt “ causing debt to rise from 74 percent of GDP in 2015 … to 154 percent of GDP by 2026 . ”
Con 3
A right to health care could increase the wait time for medical services .
Medicaid is an example of a federally funded single - payer health care system that provides a right to health care for low - income people .
According to a Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) report , 9.4 % of Medicaid beneficiaries have had trouble obtaining necessary care due to long wait times , versus 4.2 % of people with private health insurance .
Countries with a universal right to health care have longer wait times than in the United States .
In the average wait time to see a specialist in Canada was 60 days , versus 24 days in the United States .
In the United States , only 25 % of patients had to wait at least four weeks to see a specialist compared to 59 % in Canada , 56 % in Norway , and 43 % in the United Kingdom – all countries that have some form of a universal right to health care .
Con 4
Implementing a right to health care could lead the United States towards socialism .
Socialism , by definition , entails government control of the distribution of goods and services .
Under a single - payer system where everyone has a right to health care , and all health care bills are paid by the government , the government can control the distribution of health care services .
According to Ronald Reagan , “ one of the traditional methods of imposing statism or socialism on a people has been by way of medicine , ” and once socialized medicine is instituted , “ behind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom . ”
In Aug. 2013 , when Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) was asked if Obamacare is a step towards a single - payer universal health care system , he answered “ absolutely , yes . ”
The free market should determine the availability and cost of health care services , not the federal government .
Con 5
Providing a right to health care could raise taxes .
In European countries with a universal right to health care , the cost of coverage is paid through higher taxes .
In the United Kingdom and other European countries , payroll taxes average 37 % – much higher than the 15.3 % payroll taxes paid by the average US worker .
According to Paul R. Gregory , PhD , a Research Fellow at the Hoover Institution , financing a universal right to health care in the United States would cause payroll taxes to double .
Con 6
Providing a right to health care could worsen a doctor shortage .
The Association of American Medical Colleges ( AAMC ) predicts a shortfall of up to 104,900 doctors by 2030 .
If a right to health care were guaranteed to all , this shortage could be much worse .
Doctor shortages in the United States have led to a 30 % increase in wait times for doctors appointments between 2014 and 2017 .
Con 7
A right to health care could lead to government rationing of medical services .
Countries with universal health care , including Australia , Canada , New Zealand , and the United Kingdom , all ration health care using methods such as controlled distribution , budgeting , price setting , and service restrictions .
In the United Kingdom , the National Health Service ( NHS ) rations health care using a cost - benefit analysis .
For example , in 2018 any drug that provided an extra one year of good - quality life for about $ 25,000 or less was generally deemed cost - effective while one that costs more might not be .
In order to expand health coverage to more Americans , Obamacare created an Independent Payment Advisory Board ( IPAB ) to make cost - benefit analyses to keep Medicare spending from growing too fast .
According to Sally Pipes , President of the Pacific Research Institute , the IPAB “ is essentially charged with rationing care . ”
According to a Wall Street Journal editorial , “ once health care is nationalized , or mostly nationalized , medical rationing is inevitable . ”
Con 8
A right to health care could lower the quality and availability of disease screening and treatment .
In countries with a universal right to health care certain disease treatment outcomes are worse than the United States .
The US 5 - year survival rate for all cancers is 67 % , compared to 60 % in Canada and 54 % in the United Kingdom .
Annually , there are fewer cancer deaths per 100,000 people in the United States than in Australia , France , Germany , Norway , and the United Kingdom .
Out of OECD nations , the United States is ranked at number two for breast cancer survival , behind only Sweden , and at number three for stroke survival , behind only Japan and South Korea .
Statistics show that US cancer screening rates for cervical and colorectal ( bowel ) cancer are higher than those in Australia , Canada , and the United Kingdom .
Con 9
A right to health care could lower doctors ’ earnings .
The Medicare system in the United States is a single - payer system where government pays for health care bills , and between 1998 and 2009 it reduced physician payments in three different years .
In 2017 , the Congressional Budget Office reported that private insurance payments were , on average , 200 % higher than payments made by Medicare for certain treatments such as radiation therapy or MRI scans and 89 % higher for hospital admissions .
In Canada and the United Kingdom , where there is a universal right to health care , physicians have incomes 15 - 51 % lower than US doctors .
In the United States , the average physician income is $ 299,000 compared to $ 256,062 in Canada , and $ 147,778 in the United Kingdom .
Con 10 A right to health care could cause people to overuse health care resources .
When people are provided with universal health care and are not directly responsible for the costs of medical services , they may utilize more health resources than necessary , a phenomenon known as “ moral hazard . ”
According to the Brookings Institution , just before Medicaid went into effect in 1964 , people living below the poverty line saw physicians 20 % less often than those who were not in poverty .
But by 1975 , people living in poverty who were placed on Medicaid saw physicians 18 % more often than people who were not on Medicaid .
A study published in Science found that of 10,000 uninsured Portland , Oregon residents who gained access to Medicaid , 40 % made more visits to emergency rooms , even though they , like all US residents , already had guaranteed access to emergency treatment under federal law .
Since Medicaid provides a right to health care for low - income individuals , expanding this right to the full US population could worsen the problem of overusing health care resources .
Con 11
People should pay for their own health care , not have it given to them by the government .
Under a single - payer system , the right to health care is paid for through taxes , and people who work hard and pay those taxes are forced to subsidize health care for those who are not employed .
In the United States , people already have a right to purchase health care , but they should never have a right to receive health care free of charge .
Health care is a service that should be paid for , not a right .
Introduction
Hi all , today we are going to learn to create another thumbnail effect with fading and transparent caption .
It 's simple and obviously I have running out of ideas in jQuery tutorial because this is similar to jQuery Thumbnail with Zooming Image and Fading caption .
If you have any suggestion about tutorial , please contact me
1. HTML
Before we begin , I have already made different effect for thumbnail , you can check it out :
First of all , HTML .
it 's easy to understand , all your caption / description of the thumbnail should put inside the caption class .
< div class = " item " > < a href= " # " >< img data - src= " image.gif " alt =" title " title= " " width = " 125 " height =
" 125 " /></a> < div class=" caption " > < a href= " " >
Title </a> < p>Description </p> </div> </div >
2. CSS
I have put comment on each important CSS .
However , if you want to learn more about CSS , you can visit my following posts :
body { font - family : arial ; } .item { width : 125 px ; height : 125 px ; border : 4 px solid # 222 ; margin : 5 px 5 px 5 px 0 ; /* required to hide the image after resized */ overflow : hidden ; /* for child absolute position */ position : relative ; /* display div in line */ float : left ; } .item .caption { width : 125 px ; height : 125 px ; background : #000 ; color : # fff ; font - weight : bold ; /* fix it at the bottom */ position : absolute ; left:0 ; /* hide it by default */ display : none ; /* opacity setting */ filter:alpha( opacity=80 ) ; /* ie */ -moz-opacity :0.8 ; /* old mozilla browser like netscape */ - khtml- opacity : 0.8 ; /* for really really old safari */ opacity : 0.8 ; /* css standard , currently it works in most modern browsers like firefox , */ } .item .caption a { text - decoration : none ; color : #0cc7dd ; font - size : 16 px ; /* add spacing and make the whole row clickable */ padding : 5 px ; display : block ; } .item .caption p { padding : 5 px ; margin : 0 ; font - size : 10 px ; } img { border : 0 ; /* allow javascript moves the img position */ position : absolute ; } .clear { clear : both ; }
3. Javascript
I have declared two variables called move and zoom .
Move variable is for the top and left value of the thumbnail , if you mouse over the image , the image will move according to the value you have set ( i make it move to left , so after the zooming , it 'll always display in center ) .
And for the second variable - zoom , it 's the value you need to set if you want to enable the zooming effect .
Currently , it 's set to 1.2 which will enlarge the image to 120 % .
Simple , and for the rest of the code I have added comments above it .
If you have any question , please drop me a comment .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { // move the image in pixel var move = - 15 ; // zoom percentage , 1.2 =120 % var zoom = 1.2 ; // On mouse over those thumbnail $ ( '.item ' ) .hover ( function ( ) { //
Set the width and height according to the zoom percentage width = $ ( '.item ' ) .
width ( ) * zoom ; height = $ ( '.item ' ) .
height ( ) * zoom ; // Move and zoom the image $ ( this ) . find ( 'img ' ) .
stop ( false , true ) .animate ( {' width ' : width , ' height ' : height , ' top ' : move , ' left ' : move} , { duration : 200} ) ; // Display the caption $ ( this ) .find('div.caption ').stop ( false , true ).fadeIn( 200 ) ; } , function ( ) { // Reset the image $ ( this ) .find ( 'img ' ) .stop ( false , true ) .animate ( {' width ' :$ ( '.item ' ) .
width ( ) , ' height ' :$ ( '.item ' ) .
height ( ) , ' top ' : ' 0 ' , ' left ' : ' 0'} , { duration : 100} ) ; // Hide the caption $ ( this ) .find('div.caption ').stop ( false , true ).fadeOut( 200 ) ; } ) ; } ) ;

The appliances depend on new home electric meters , in development by some local utilities , that contain a cellphone chip or other long - distance transceiver to download citywide energy - use information .
The meters route this info to home refrigerators , washers and microwaves outfitted with shorter - range transceivers , such as low - power radio chips .
The appliances can then run at full blast during the cheapest periods and ramp down , or even turn off , during expensive periods ; customers can override the settings if they really need to nuke dinner .
GE is now conducting trials with Louisville Gas and Electric .
Look for Demand Response appliances , as well as widespread time - of - use pricing , in 2011 or 2012 .

Greeting all , it ’s spring and our hearts are jumping out of our chests to get into the woods and hunt the elusive morel .
The time is now to have a good discussion on naming convention and common names , and the edibility of the false morels and what one should responsibly say about them .
Earlier today I followed a Facebook thread , in which several people argued over the common name of one of the Gyromitra species .
It was n’t amusing seeing the same argument between three sets of different people , one calling the Gyromitra by its sometime used common name “ Beefsteak ” and someone else claiming that the common name “ Beefsteak ” applied to Fistulina hepatica .
Again , this same argument went on several times , and was confusing to the person requesting an identification .
And worse yet , had that person looked up “ Beefsteak ” and gone to the Fistulina hepatica link they ’d have seen it was edible and choice .
The main problem with common names is that they vary regionally and often within the same region there are several common names for one fruiting body , and sometimes there are several fruiting bodies with the same name .
All the confusion could be solved with some type of naming convention !
And has been .
For 300 years .
When Linnaeus wrote Systema Naturae
I ’ve read there was already much argument within the Royal Society of Britain , Hooke and Boyle up late nights arguing naming convention , defining scientific method , attempting to create a standard where none existed , they had it done for them by Linnaeus .
There is certainly no cause to re-argue the ultimately worthless arguments that Boyle and Hooke had , when Linnaeus solved them for us and them 300 years ago .
The use of Latin names for fungi clears up many of problems ; there is only one species of mushroom to each name , this takes the guess work out , the regionality , and in fact the Latin name is used internationally .
You can walk up to a Russian or Belgian or a Korean and they ’ll know what you ’re talking about when you mention G. frondosa but will be dumbfounded when you speak of “ Sheepshead ” mushroom .
Several years ago I was hunting Maitake ( G. frondosa ) and an old timer came up to me in the woods , my bags were almost full , and his were about empty .
I offered him some , and let him choose which he wanted .
He managed to explain the difference between a “ Hen of the Woods ” , a “ True Sheepshead ” and a “ Sheepshead mushroom ” .
I bit my tongue and out of respect for my elders kept my mouth shut .
One of the main problems that many of us ( myself especially ) have with using the Latin name may be two fold , we were brought up – archaic knowledge given to us secretively by our experts , and we simply were n’t trained to use the terminology , and also I personally have a problem pronouncing Latin names , as do most mycologists I know .
And you know what ?
Seldom has someone corrected my Latin .
It ’s kind of like going to a foreign country and attempting to order in their language , and mangling the order terribly , they ’re so happy you ’ve even attempted to learn how to pronounce something that they ’re appreciative and happy , and strive even harder to help .
We certainly do n’t need to constantly use Latin nomenclature , but when we ’re in a public forum , and the possibility of confusion is prevalent , we should make that attempt .
That takes us to the responsibility you must have when you ’re writing in public forums there is a serious danger that someone that has less experience than you have will take your opinion as gospel .
This certainly is n’t a problem when one has misidentified L. cincinnatus for L. sulpureus , but certainly becomes a concern when what your beliefs are and what you ’ve been taught goes directly against science .
Specifically , since it ’s morel season , I ’m speaking of the edibility of Gyromitra sp. and Verpa sp .
Many folks are traditionalists , they were taught that “ False morels ” are delicious and safe , and have been eating them all their lives .
In reality the science is n’t perfect on the vector of poisoning from Gyromitra and Verpa , but it is clear .
Both contain toxins that could build up in your body to toxic levels .
When that occurs that could be deadly .
2 - 4 % of fatal mushroom poisonings are due to these to species of false morels .
UW La Crosse Professor Tom Volk states :
“ Gyromitrin is a hemolytic toxin ( i.e. it destroys red blood cells ) in humans , other primates , and dogs .
It is toxic to the central nervous system and damages the liver and gastrointestinal tract .
It may act by interfering with transaminases , particularly those having a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor .
Vitamin B 6 is used in the treatment .
As in cyclopeptide poisoning , a relatively long latent period ensues ( 6 to 12 hours ) between ingestion and symptoms .
The symptoms include nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , cramps , distention , weakness , lassitude , and headache ; if the condition is severe , these may develop into jaundice , convulsions , coma , and death .
Methemoglobinuria and very low blood sugar are found in laboratory tests . ” ( http://botit.botany.wisc.edu/toms_fungi/may2002.html)
We ’re talking about a family of mushrooms of which it is assumed that all contain some amounts of a toxin , though some G. caroliniana for example , assumedly has lower concentrations of gyromitrin ( N - methyl - N - formylhydrazine ) which your body synthesizes into monomethylhydrazine , a component in rocket fuel , but now all of them have been tested , and test certainly have n’t been run regionally .
In Michigan in 2012 53 people were sick enough to call poison control from eating Verpas and Gyromitras . 11 of them were hospitalized .
While we are free to make our own choices , to gamble with our health , to spin the barrel until we get to the chamber with the bullet , telling a new comer that it ’s safe to do is disingenuous .
( http://www.mlive.com/news/kalamazoo/index.ssf/2011/05/morel_mushroom_lookalikes_lead.html)
Our society of foragers and mushroom hunters are repositories of knowledge need to not only welcome the new person , but ensure that they are given the best information , without expecting them to hold the barrel of the gun to their head without knowing that one of the chambers has a bullet .
When we impart knowledge that is new to someone it ’s important to give them the whole of the knowledge .
It ’s up to them to suffer the consequences .
Experienced mycologists and mushroom hunters would never attempt to have a new comer to hunt above they ’re experience level .
Without knowing the specific characteristics of the mushroom that they ’re about to trying to identify , and have a handle on look - alikes it ’s like throwing a chicken to the wolves .
“ Michael Kuo , who runs the website http://www.mushroomexpert.com, used to have a line up on there that said “ If you hear someone brag about how heavy their morel was , you are talking to an idiot . ” writes Leon Shernoff at “ Mushroom ; the Journal of Wild Mushrooming ” .
( http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/bestof/firstmorel.html)
But , of course , as I write this piece the chime on my Facebook goes off , and I quote , ” I ’ve been eating them for 25 years and I ai n’t been sick one time . ”
13 Ways to Spot Lies and Omissions in Due Diligence
We all do due diligence .
Some of us do it in mergers and acquisitions ( M& A ) .
Some of us do it when we ’re getting ready to make a major purchase like a house or a car , or when we ’re getting ready to sign a contract for major home repair .
Due diligence is the research you do to make sure that what you buy is what you think you ’re buying .
It ’s verifying that the “ facts ” are correct as represented by the seller .
When witnesses are sworn in before their testimony in a court of law , they swear to tell “ the truth , the whole truth and nothing but the truth . ”
It ’s the “ whole truth ” part that ’s usually the problem .
The whole truth means that they have revealed all aspects of the truth — they have n’t just answered a question in a truthful but deceitful way .
This is also the primary area of concern in due diligence : someone may answer a question truthfully , yet they ’ve held back the information that you really need to hear .
President Bill Clinton ’s famous statement , “ I did not have sex with that woman , ” is an example of the truth but not the whole truth .
He interpreted the words the way he wanted to , and told the truth as he wanted you to see it .
And in due diligence that ’s exactly the same thing that sellers are likely to do .
From my own experience in M&A due diligence for over twenty acquisitions , here is my list of ways to spot lies and omissions :
13 Ways to Spot Lies and Omissions
Less detail in one area
When information is provided to you , there ’s a consistent amount of detail provided in most areas , but less detail is provided in a few areas .
There ’s usually a reason they do n’t want to go into detail in those few areas , and it ’s in your best interest to find out why .
Too much detail in one area
This is the opposite of # 1 , but the intent is the same .
When you ’re getting too much information about one area , you tend to pay less attention to the areas where the real concern is .
They may be using a red herring approach — distracting you from the real problem areas .
Or they may be concealing the problem area by overwhelming you with other information in the same area so that finding the truth will be like looking for a needle in a haystack ( worse , actually , since you do n’t know that it ’s a needle you ’re looking for ) .
They keep changing the subject
Whenever the discussion gets around to a certain area , somehow the subject gets changed and the area never gets covered .
People in one area do n’t ever seem to be available
Is n’t it interesting that the experts you really need in an area never seem to be available ?
There ’s probably a reason .
Discussion on one area keeps getting pushed to the end of the agenda
When the seller knows you have a time constraint ( like a scheduled flight ) , they keep pushing the problem area to the end of the agenda , hoping that you wo n’t take the time to do a thorough job .
Accomplishments and plans blur together
This is particularly common when you ’re discussing the capabilities of a system or process .
The seller talks about planned capabilities as if they ’re available today .
This overstates the capabilities and gives you the impression that you ’re getting more than you really are .
The verb tense keeps changing
This is usually a tipoff that the seller is doing # 6 .
Sometimes the seller says “ the system will do something ” and sometimes the seller says “ the system does do something . ”
Or perhaps different people talk about the same capability : some using current or past tense , and some using future tense .
Make sure you know exactly what capabilities exist today .
Conflicting answers from different people
If different people give different answers to the same question , then the answers are suspect .
Some sellers avoid this problem by making sure that all of your contacts stay in the room for all of the questions .
That ’s why it ’s better to break up your due diligence into smaller groups for some of the detailed questioning .
Physical cues : speech , tone , body language
Listen to the seller ’s answers , but also notice how the seller is answering .
In particular , look for differences in physical cues when certain subjects are being discussed .
Sellers often exhibit stress when they ’re talking about a subject where they know there are some concerns .
The stress is visible when they act differently during discussions on those subjects .
Web site and advertising do n’t match what they ’re telling you
If the seller is telling customers one thing and potential acquirers something else , then there ’s probably a problem .
Denial without explanation
The seller denies certain things , but makes no attempt to explain , probably because there is n’t a good explanation .
Do n’t take “ no ” at face value — ask why , and ask for examples to clarify the issue .
Everything is perfect
I do n’t mean to be cynical here , but the reality is that all acquisitions and purchases involve trade - offs .
If your due diligence shows that everything is exactly as you would like it to be , then look closer , because something is wrong .
I ’ve never been involved in due diligence where everything was perfect ; in all cases we had to decide whether the weaknesses we saw were outweighed by the strengths .
Lost in translation
When doing due diligence in a non-English - speaking country , the discussions usually have to be done through a translator .
It ’s best ( although more expensive ) to use your own translator in addition to the one provided by the seller .
If your translator is part of the due diligence team and committed to your success , then your translator should be able to listen for differences between what the seller says and what their translator tells you .
Your translator should also be able to pick up on foreign - language discussion among the selling team participants .
Often this discussion can reveal seller weaknesses or issues that the seller is hiding .

Sidebar : 7 Types of M&A Seller Behavior that Do n’t Point to Lies
If you ’re new to M&A due diligence , then some of the things on this next list may look suspicious .
They ’re normal , and perfectly acceptable in most cases .
The seller wants to meet offsite , away from the office
This is normal .
They probably do n’t want employees to know , and they do n’t want to start rumors .
This is particularly true for M&A of public companies , where insider trading rules are extremely strict .
Seller wants a confidentiality agreement signed before any discussion
This makes sense , and it goes both ways .
If the deal falls through , then neither the seller nor the buyer want a lot of press , and they do n’t want their secrets used against them .
Seller wants you to destroy your notes if the deal falls through
This is reasonable , especially if the buyer and seller are competitors , since trade secrets may be revealed .
It ’s extremely important if the buyer or the seller is a public company .
The seller hesitates in including certain people in the discussion
Most sellers want to keep the possible M&A deal on a need - to - know basis .
The more people they include , the more likely it is that news of the deal will leak out .
Note , however , that this conflicts with # 4 in the first list .
If you really need to know about a certain area , then you should insist on getting the answers you need .
The seller does n’t want its people to be seen in public with you
Again , this is to keep the potential deal a secret .
Code names for the buyer and seller are used
This is common .
On the M&A deals I was involved in , we made it a habit to never refer to the seller except by code name — even in private conversations or emails among ourselves .
You never know who might be listening in .
And make sure that the code names ca n’t be used to figure out the real name of the company ( e.g. , Redmond for Microsoft ) .
Pick a name that has nothing to do with the company , their location or the business they ’re in .
Hint : Some companies who do a lot of M&A make up a long list of code names in advance , then for each transaction they just use the next code name on the list .
If a site visit is needed , then the seller wants to use a cover story
Again , this is common .
You might be introduced to employees as potential customers doing some background work before making a major purchase .
Technically , you ’re lying to the employees , but it ’s closer to acting — you ’re playing the role of a customer to get the answers you need to be a different sort of customer .

Over the next decade , systems which create and store digital records of people 's movements through public space will be woven inextricably into the fabric of everyday life .
We are already starting to see such systems now , and there will be many more in the near future .
Here are some examples you might already have used or read about :
Monthly transit swipe - cards
Electronic tolling devices ( FastTrak , EZpass , congestion pricing )
Cellphones
Services telling you when your friends are nearby
Searches on your PDA for services and businesses near your current location
Free Wi-Fi with ads for businesses near the network access point you 're using
Electronic swipe cards for doors
Parking meters you can call to add money to , and which send you a text message when your time is running out
These systems are marvellously innovative , and they promise benefits ranging from increased convenience to transformative new kinds of social interaction .
Unfortunately , these systems pose a dramatic threat to locational privacy .
What is " locational privacy " ?
Locational privacy ( also known as " location privacy " ) is the ability of an individual to move in public space with the expectation that under normal circumstances their location will not be systematically and secretly recorded for later use .
The systems discusssed above have the potential to strip away locational privacy from individuals , making it possible for others to ask ( and answer ) the following sorts of questions by consulting the location databases :
Did you go to an anti-war rally on Tuesday ?
A small meeting to plan the rally the week before ?
At the house of one " Bob Jackson " ?
Did you walk into an abortion clinic ?
Did you see an AIDS counselor ?
Have you been checking into a motel at lunchtimes ?
Why was your secretary with you ?
Did you skip lunch to pitch a new invention to a VC ?
Which one ?
Were you the person who anonymously tipped off safety regulators about the rusty machines ?
Did you and your VP for sales meet with ACME Ltd on Monday ?
Which church do you attend ?
Which mosque ?
Which gay bars ?
Who is my ex-girlfriend going to dinner with ?
Of course , when you leave your home you sacrifice some privacy .
Someone might see you enter the clinic on Market Street , or notice that you and your secretary left the Hilton Gardens Inn together .
Furthermore , in the world of ten years ago , all of this information could be obtained by people who did n't like you or did n't trust you .
But obtaining this information used to be expensive .
Your enemies could hire a guy in a trench coat to follow you around , but they had to pay him .
Moreover , it was hard to keep the surveillance secret — you had a good chance of noticing your tail ducking into an alley .
In the world of today and tomorrow , this information is quietly collected by ubiquitous devices and applications , and available for analysis to many parties who can query , buy or subpoena it .
Or pay a hacker to steal a copy of everyone 's location history .
It is this transformation to a regime in which information about your location is collected pervasively , silently , and cheaply that we 're worried about .
Threats and opportunity
Some threats to locational privacy are overt : it 's evident how cameras backed by face - recognition software could be misused to track people and record their movements .
In this document , we 're primarily concerned with threats to locational privacy that arise as a hidden side - effect of clearly useful location - based services .
We can't stop the cascade of new location - based digital services .
Nor would we want to — the benefits they offer are impressive .
What urgently needs to change is that these systems need to be built with privacy as part of their original design .
We can't afford to have pervasive surveillance technology built into our electronic civic infrastructure by accident .
We have the opportunity now to ensure that these dangers are averted .
Our contention is that the easiest and best solution to the locational privacy problem is to build systems which do n't collect the data in the first place .
This sounds like an impossible requirement ( how do we tell you when your friends are nearby without knowing where you and your friends are ? ) but in fact as we discuss below it is a reasonable objective that can be achieved with modern cryptographic techniques .
Modern cryptography actually allows civic data processing systems to be designed with a whole spectrum of privacy policies : ranging from complete anonymity to limited anonymity to support law enforcement .
But we need to ensure that systems are n't being built right at the zero- privacy , everything - is - recorded end of that spectrum , simply because that 's the path of easiest implementation .
Location Based Services That Don't Know Where You Are
Surprisingly , modern cryptography offers some really clever ways to deploy road tolls and transit tickets and location searches and all the other mobile services we want , without creating a record of where you are .
This is n't at all intuitive , but it 's really important that policymakers and engineers working with location systems know about it .
This section lists just a few examples of the kinds of systems that are possible .
Automated tolling and stoplight enforcement
In many metropolitan areas , drivers are encouraged to use small electronic transponders ( FastTrak , EZpass ) to pay tolls at bridges and tunnels .
As momentum builds behind nuanced usage tolling and congestion pricing schemes , we expect to see an explosion of such devices and tolling methods .
For simple point tolls ( e.g. bridge tolls ) , protocols that cryptographers call electronic cash are an excellent solution .
In its cryptographic sense , electronic cash refers to means by which an individual can pay for something using a special digital signature which is anonymous but which guarantees the recipient that the can redeem it for money ; it acts just like cash !
See this paper for the details of a modern implementation .
Thus , a driver " Vera " would buy a wad of electronic cash every few months and " charge up " her transponder .
As Vera drives over bridges and through tunnels , the tolling transponder would anonymously pay her tolls .
For more complicated tolling systems ( in which the price depends on the specific path taken ) , a somewhat more involved implementation can be used ( discussed in detail in this technical paper ) .
Straightforward but privacy - insensitive implementations of congestion - pricing systems simply track drivers and use the tracking information to generate tolls .
For instance , you might have all of the cars using a little radio gadget to report their location all the time .
As Vera drives throughout the congestion pricing area ( e.g. down a street in central London ) , the gadget says " Hi , this is Vera 's car . "
That creates a record of everywhere Vera went .
Equivalently , one might put cameras everywhere which record Vera 's license plate as she drives and keeps track of everywhere she goes to subsequently compute his tolls .
Both of these solutions violate Vera 's locational privacy .
The less obvious but much better way to run such tolls is to have Vera 's gadget commit to a secret list of " dynamic license plates " — a long list of random - looking cryptographic numbers .
This commitment takes the form of a digital signature given to the tolling authority .
As Vera drives through the tolling region , her gadget cycles through these numbers rapidly , sending the current number to the monitoring devices she passes .
None of those numbers actually identifies Vera , and since they keep changing there 's no way to string them together to track her .
But , at the end of the month , Vera has to pay her road toll by plugging the gadget in her car into her computer .
The computers execute a fancy cryptographic process called a " secure multi- party communication " .
At the end , her computer proves that she owes $ 17.00 in road tolls this month , without revealing how she acumulated that total .
The committment exchanged at the beginning ensures that Vera can't cheat : she can't prove a lower total if she actually drove across a bridge with the gadget active .
This kind of approach can be used to solve various automated traffic enforcement needs , as well .
For instance , every time Vera passes a traffic light a monitoring device can collect the current " dynamic license plate " .
Although again , the collected data can't be used to track Vera around , if Vera runs a red light the system can detect this and issue Vera a ticket .
Location - based search
A location - based search on a mobile device is another important example .
Phones are starting to be able to locate themselves based on the signal strength or visibility of nearby wireless networks or on GPS data .
Naturally , companies are also racing to provide search tools which use this data to offer people different search results depending on where they are at any given moment .
The naive way to do mobile location search is for the device to say " This is Frank 's Nokia here .
I see the following five WiFi networks with the following five signal strengths " .
The service replies " okay , that means you 're at the corner of 5th and Main in Springfield " .
Then your device replies , " What burger joints are nearby ?
Are any of Frank 's friends hanging out nearby ? " .
That kind of search creates a record of everywhere you go and what you 're searching for while you 're there .
A better way to do location - based services and search is something like this : " Hi , this is a mobile device here .
Here is a cryptographic proof that I have an account on your service and I 'm not a spammer .
I see the following five wireless networks . "
The service replies " okay , that means you 're at the corner of 5th and Main in Springfield .
Here is a big list of encrypted information about things that are nearby " .
If any of that encrypted information is a note from one of Frank 's friends , saying " hey , I 'm here " , then his Nokia will be able to read it .
If he likes , he can also say " hey , here 's an encrypted note to post for other people who are nearby " .
If any of them are his friends , they 'll be able to read it .
( An excellent and detailed discussion of a related approach via secure multi-party computation is presented in this paper . )
Transit passes and access cards
Another broad area of application is for passcards and devices allowing access to protected areas ; for instance , passcards which allow access to bike lockers near train stations , or cards which function as a monthly bus pass .
A simple implementation might involve an RFID card reporting that Bob has checked his bike into or out of the storage facility ( and deducts his account accordingly ) , or equivalently that Bob has stepped onto the bus ( and checks to make sure Bob has paid for his pass ) .
This sort of scheme might put Bob at risk .
A better approach would involve the use of recent work on anonymous credentials .
These give Bob a special set of digital signatures with which he can prove that he is entitled to enter the bike locker ( i.e. prove you 're a paying customer ) or get on the bus .
But the protocols are such that these interactions can't be linked to him specifically and moreover repeated accesses can't be correlated with one another .
That is , the bike locker knows that someone authorized to enter has come by , but it can't tell who it was , and it can't tell when this individual last came by .
Combined with electronic cash , there are a wide - range of card - access solutions which preserves locational privacy .
Privacy concerns and anonymized databases
We should note that even the existence of location databases stripped of identifying tags can leak information .
For instance , if I know that Vera is the only person who lives on Dead End Lane , the datum that someone used a location - based service on Dead End Lane can be reasonably linked to Vera .
This problem is widely acknowledged ( and studied ) in the context of epidemiological data as well : it turns out to be relatively easy to deduce the identity of individual disease victims from " anonymized " geographic information about the location of cases .
Generally speaking , one solution to this problem is to restrict the use of location - based services to high density areas .
There are more complicated cryptographic solutions that are also possible .
See this paper for a discussion ( and proposed solution ) to this problem in the context of collection of aggregate traffic statistics , and this paper for discussion of " differential privacy " , a formalization of ideal privacy guarantees in the face of the existence of databases .
For more information
Safely and correctly implementing such modern cryptographic protocols can be a substantial engineering challenge .
And implementing them efficiently takes work .
But it can be done — this is exactly the kind of cryptographic software that protects the security of our financial network ( e.g. ATMs ) , makes it safe for us to buy things online , and encodes our phone calls .
Big software contractors ( e.g. IBM and Siemens ) maintain large staffs of cryptographers .
We 've linked to some of the sources that would be useful for engineers who want to understand how these protocols work .
But , if you 're a policymaker or an engineer and you have questions about how these methods work , do n't hesitate to contact us : we can point you at literature and connect you with experts to answer your questions .
Why Should Private Sector Firms Prioritize Locational Privacy ?
We believe that governments have a civic responsibility to their citizens to ensure that the infrastructure they deploy protects locational privacy .
But there are also financial reasons for the private sector to go to some length to design privacy into the locational systems they build .
Avoid legal compliance costs
If a corporation retains logs that track individuals ' locations , they may be subject to legal requests for that information .
Such requests may come in different forms ( including informal questions , subpoenas or warrants ) and from different parties ( law enforcement or civil litigants ) .
There are complex legal questions as to whether compliance with a particular request is legally required , optional , or even legally prohibited and a liability risk .
This legal complexity may even involve international law .
For instance , US corporations which also have operations in the European Union might be subject to European data protection laws when EU citizens visit the United States and use the US company 's services .
Corporations with large locational datasets face a risk that lawyers and law enforcement will realize the data exists and begin using legal processes to obtain it .
The best way to avoid this costly compliance risk is to avoid having identifiable location data in the first place .
Obtain a competitive edge
The public is slowly becoming aware of the potential downsides of having their location tracked on a continuous basis .
The ability to demonstrate reliable privacy protections will increasingly offer firms a competitive edge if they can persuade individual customers — or government clients — that their product offers more robust and trustworthy privacy protections .
Is n't there an easier / different alternative ?
Using cryptography and careful design to protect location privacy from the outset requires engineering effort .
So it 's important to ask whether there are other adequate ways to preserve privacy in these systems .
Unfortunately , we believe the alternatives are unreliable or harder to implement and enforce .
Data retention and erasure
One kind of protection you might hope for is that your location records will be deleted before your adversary gets to them .
If the company that 's offering you a fancy location search on your cell phone does n't need to remember your history a week later , perhaps they can be persuaded to forget it quickly .
Perhaps they promise that they will .
Unfortunately , there is n't much basis for optimism on the data retention front .
Search companies have incentives to keep extensive records of their users ' queries , so that they can learn how to improve their results ( and sell more effective advertisements ) .
Storage space is cheap and getting cheaper .
Tolling agencies have incentives to keep extensive records of toll usage , to settle complaints and provide aggregate statistics and accounting data .
Even if the collecting outfit does promise to delete the data after a set interval , there 's no guarantee that they 're actually going to do that properly .
Firstly , secure deletion tools are necessary to make sure that deleted data is really gone ; many sys admins will fail to use them correctly .
Secondly , all it takes is the flip of a switch to suddenly change policies from deletion to retention .
To make matters worse , there 's no guarantee that a government wo n't suddenly pass a law requiring such companies and government agencies to keep all of their records for years , just in case the records are needed for " national security " purposes .
This last concern is n't just idle paranoia : this has already happened in Europe , and the Bush administration has toyed with the same idea .
And as for government agencies , experience so far with data retention has not been reassuring .
An interesting example is provided by automated tolling data ( records from FastTrak and EZpass ) .
Different states have made different promises about how long they keep the data , and there have been varying degrees of effectiveness in carrying out these promises .
Data has often remained available for subpeona after a number of years .
Legal penalties for the violation of these promises are currently minimal .
Limiting data retention is an important protection for privacy , but it's no substitute for the best protection : not recording that information in the first place .
Opting out
Sometimes people respond to these sorts of worries with the claim that the free market will solve this problem .
" People who are worried about privacy should n't use these services , " they say .
" If people really care , a company offering privacy as an explicit feature will arise . "
We do n't believe this is an acceptable viewpoint — there is too much coercion in play .
Often , there 's no adequate replacement for the service in question , and it is or will soon be a dramatic hardship to avoid its use .
Suppose that parts of the United States began to adopt mandatory " pay as you drive " insurance , or congestion pricing , that was based on location tracking .
In most parts of the United States , it 's not really reasonable to suggest that people who are worried about privacy should n't drive ( or should n't drive to their religious institution of choice ) .
And in the case of location - based services , it 's clear that the deck is stacked against people choosing to take inconvenient measures to protect themselves : it 's too hard to know what is being recorded by whom , too hard to know what options there are to avoid being recorded , and too hard to keep researching these questions as you interact with new pieces of technology .
In this environment , people simply have n't adjusted to the potential for the loss of the reasonable expectation of privacy in public places , and our standard intuitions have n't kept up with advances in technology .
Cell phones and credit cards already create a trail
It 's true that most cell phones provide some amount of tracking information to the carriers as long as they 're on , and that credit card records provide a pervasive trail of activity .
This is no reason to surrender further locational privacy , but rather a reason to fight for better practices or laws for cell phone technology and credit card data .
The problems we 're having now with identity theft make it clear how problematic the handling of sensitive personal data is .
Law - abiding citizens do n't need privacy
Another common response to worries about locational privacy is to say that law - abiding citizens do n't need privacy .
" I do n't commit adultery , I do n't break the law , " people say ( and tacitly , " I 'm not in the closet , and I do n't belong to any non-majority religious or political groups " ) .
One answer to this concern is a reminder that there are more subtle reasons for needing privacy .
It 's not just the government , or law enforcement , or political enemies you might want to be protected from .
Your employer does n't need to know things about whether , when , and where you went to church .
Your co-workers do n't need to know how late you work or where you shop .
Your sister 's ex-boyfriend does n't need know how often she spends the night at her new boyfriend 's apartment .
Your corporate competitors do n't need to know who your salespeople are talking to .
Preserving locational privacy is about maintaining dignity and confidence as you move through the world .
Locational privacy is also about knowing when other people know things about you , and being able to tell when they are making decisions based on those facts .
Suppose that an insurance company manages to obtain a record of Alice 's movements over the past year , and decides that there is some aspect of that record which is grounds for raising her premiums or denying her coverage .
The problem with that decision is not just that it is unfair , but that Alice may have no ability to dispute it .
If the insurance company 's reasoning is misinformed , will Alice have a practical way of knowing that and disputing it ?
The " I 've got nothing to hide " argument against privacy is criticized at greater length in this article .
Conclusion
In the long run , the decision about when we retain our location privacy ( and the limited circumstances under which we will surrender it ) should be set by democratic action and lawmaking .
Now is a key moment for organizations that are building and deploying location data infrastructure to show leadership and select designs that are responsible and do not surrender the locational privacy of users simply for expediency .

More than any other game to date , Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune seems to define the PlayStation 3 .
Naughty Dog 's 2007 jungle romp starring the one and only Nathan Drake gave gamers a taste of what it would be like to play as an acrobatically - inclined Indiana Jones .
With stunning visuals ( that still rank amongst the best in gaming today ) , a fantastically told story , great puzzles and high - octane gunplay , it 's easily one of the best titles of this console generation .

Click +the+image+to+watch+our+in-depth+video+review .
The +graphics .+Holy+crap ...+ the+graphics .
Now Naughty
Dog returns to the spotlight with Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves .
Both expectedly and amazingly , Naughty Dog has indeed bested Nate 's first adventure and has created a sequel that is not only bigger and better in practically every way , but also packs a multiplayer component that could be released as its own separate , full - priced game and people would stand in line to hand over their cash .
Yes , Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves
Trying to remain as spoiler - free as possible , I 'll just say that the story starts off about a year or so after the events of the first game and begins with Nate and a few fellow thieves working on finding Marco Polo 's lost treasure fleet .
Of course , things are n't quite that simple and the cast winds up going on a much grander adventure , one that takes them half - way around the world .
That 's about as far as I want to go with the storyline , though some of the trailers out there actually reveal a little more than that .
The important part here though is that this game does n't just take place on a single island and instead changes locales a handful of times over the course of the adventure .
The result is that the pacing feels better and faster , and even though you 're technically doing the same sort of shooting , climbing and puzzle solving throughout the game , the different ways the scenes are presented gives Among Thieves a greater sense of gameplay variety than the original .
The great storytelling extends to the character development , which has been turned up a good notch or two .
Almost everyone with more than two lines of dialogue has an interesting reason for doing what they 're doing ( though the main bad guy is just bad ) , and the way that everyone interacts with one another is realistic and interesting .
Almost every character is unpredictable in some way , but not in a forced or unnatural manner .
The story itself twists and turns throughout the course of the game , as you might expect , and for the most part it 's a solid tale .
Nate and his pals go through a lot , so it does a good job of reeling you in and keeping you hooked until the end .
While I 'd say the story is quite good overall , I would n't say that it 's perfect .
Without giving anything away , while most of the story has solid footing in real - world lore and legend , it does start to veer away from this at some point in a way that could have been handled better .
Still , it 's told very , very well through the use of fantastic cutscenes and acting , and will keep you guessing at what 'll happen until the very end .
As for the gameplay itself , Uncharted 2 -- like the original Drake 's Fortune -- tasks you with gunfights , environmental navigation or puzzle solving .
While a lot of the mechanics are identical to the first title , everything has been blended together a little better , especially the combat and navigation .
This is in large part due to the settings that you 'll fight in .
Whereas the first game generally had you walk into an area with lots of cover , set up behind a wall and then take guys out as best you could , Uncharted 2 offers a lot more variety and options in how these sequences play out thanks to the fantastic level design .
Rather than fighting on flat ground , almost every battle scene features multiple levels and areas to use to your advantage .
If you want to stay on the ground and take guys out the old fashioned way , you 're more than welcome to .
But you can also climb to higher ground and use height to your advantage , or flank the enemy by moving from cover to cover and changing your tactics as the battle unfolds around you .
While the game is still very much a linear tale , taking you from point to specific point , you 're offered many more options in how you approach and deal with battles .
ACORN on Wednesday sued the duo who shot hidden - camera videos that are damaging the organization ’s reputation and the Web site that aired them , as the Internal Revenue Service broke off its partnership with the liberal community activist group .
The lawsuit accuses James O’Keefe and Hannah Giles of violating Maryland law that requires two - party consent for electronic surveillance .
It also names as a defendant the news Web site Breitbart.com , which first posted the video .
The pair posing as a pimp and underage prostitute videotaped ACORN workers in Baltimore advising them how to cheat on taxes and loan applications .
The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) is seeking a court order to prohibit further distribution of the videos and payment for compensatory and punitive damages .
“ Although we do not condone what our former employees did , no matter how entrapped they were , we are also committed to our 500,000 members that we will hold the defendants civilly and criminally responsible for their violations of Maryland laws and for the damages inflicted upon ACORN ’s reputation , ” ACORN CEO Bertha Lewis said .
MORE TWT STORIES :
• Security Council passes nuclear - free - world resolution
• Zazi indicted on bomb conspiracy charge
• EXCLUSIVE : Congress flies tattered flags over buildings
• Senate spurns wildland fire funds for D.C .
Andrew Breitbart , who runs the “ news portal ” that aired the videos and is a columnist for The Washington Times , declined to comment .
Mr. O’Keefe and Miss Giles could not be reached for comment .
Mrs. Lewis had threatened to sue Fox News Channel , which first broadcast the sting videos , but the network is not named in the lawsuit .
The legal action puts ACORN back on an offensive footing after waging a largely unsuccessful public relations campaign to repair its image by firing employees caught in the sting , temporarily closing offices to retrain staff and enlisting independent investigators to review its operations .
The moves did little to preserve support in Washington .
The group announced Tuesday that former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger would lead an independent inquiry into its social services programs to address problems revealed by the sting video .
The IRS was the latest agency to distance itself from ACORN .
The IRS said it would eject ACORN from the agency ’s volunteer tax assistance program , which provides tax - preparation help to about 3 million low - income workers .
The Obama administration also canceled plans for the group to help with the 2010 census two weeks ago when the videos surfaced .
ACORN has scrambled to regain Democratic support after the Senate and House last week voted overwhelmingly to block federal funding of the organization .
In the past , Democrats steadfastly defended the group against conservative charges it skirts tax laws , violates election rules and commits other crimes while heavily supporting Democratic candidates and liberal causes .
The Justice Department ’s independent inspector general plans to review ACORN ’s grant funding from the department , and Republicans are pressing for similar probes in at least six other agencies and an investigation by the Government Accountability Office .
The videos that battered ACORN ’s fortunes were shot by Mr. O’Keefe , who appeared in the footage posing as a pimp and was accompanied by a female colleague , Miss Giles , posing as an underage prostitute .
The pair received counseling at ACORN offices in Baltimore , Washington , New York and San Bernardino , Calif. , to obtain a home loan for property where they could conduct a prostitution business , which they said also would employ girls from El Salvador .
At the Baltimore ACORN office , a female worker advised them to conceal their illegal activities when applying for a loan or filing taxes .
ACORN officials said Mr. O’Keefe attempted similar stings at ACORN offices in several other cities - including San Diego , Los Angeles , Miami , New York and Philadelphia - where workers turned him away or called the police .

This is the niqab , Canada 's most controversial article of clothing .
Rana , a petite 21 - year - old with bright brown eyes , has worn it for two years .
The neighbours still stare .
Rana seems unfazed by their glances , though she says she knows what their looks imply .
" People think you are oppressed , that you are n't from here and that you are forced to wear it , " she said .
Rana confounds those assumptions .
She was born in Toronto , attended a local public high school , studies at the University of Toronto and , two years ago , chose to wear the niqab despite the wishes of her family .
Over time , she has managed to win over her loved ones .
But for her and other local Muslim women who wear the niqab , overcoming negative public perceptions is significantly more difficult .
In part , this is because of the ongoing public debate that plays out in courtrooms , political arenas and in the press every few months , questioning the presence of a small – some say growing – number of Muslim women who cover their faces in accordance with their devout Islamic beliefs .
It is a practice many Canadians – including some Muslims – consider to be oppressive , offensive and an outright rejection of the West .
" In Canada we recognize the equality of men and women .
The burqa marginalizes women , " said Salma Siddiqui , a member of the outspoken and secular Muslim Canadian Congress .
In Canada , few women wear the burqa , a gownlike garment that covers the head and has mesh in front of the eyes .
This month , the MCC called upon the government to ban the niqab and burqa in Canada .
France , Italy and the Netherlands are seriously considering such legislation .
Yet in Canada , some academics , activists and Muslims say such a move is perhaps more un-Canadian than the niqab itself .
" There are many people who do n't agree or like the niqab , " said Alia Hogben , executive director of the Canadian Council of Muslim Women .
" But they are totally opposed to the idea that the government should have a say in how women dress , " she said .
THE MCC'S call comes on the heels of an incident this month in which the head of the Al - Azhar University in Egypt , whom many consider to be Sunni Islam 's foremost spiritual authority , asked a young woman to remove her niqab in her all - girls classroom when she stood up to ask him a question .
According to media reports , he then told her the niqab was a cultural practice not founded in Islam .
The comments of the university 's Sheikh Mohammed Tantawi quickly reverberated around the world .
His opinions sparked intense debate within the community about the religious basis for the niqab and its place in modern society .
Many local scholars adopt the stance that the niqab has a religious basis , but is not compulsory for women .
Others discourage women from wearing it in Canada altogether , for practical reasons .
But Tantawi's comments especially strengthened the stance of progressive Muslim groups who say the niqab is a cultural practice and a symbol of more conservative Islam .
But in Canada , the debate is not merely about religion .
At its core it is about the fight to protect two fundamental Canadian values : gender equality and freedom of religion .
The Charter of Rights and Freedoms espouses both equality rights and fundamental freedoms , which include the right to practice one 's religion as one sees fit .
The MCC says the Charter of Rights and Freedoms should n't apply in the case of the niqab , because it is n't a requirement of the faith .
" People have always argued that wearing the niqab is a religious practice , but here is this sheikh clearly saying it is n't in the religion , " said Siddiqui .
" Now they can't use that religious argument to defend a cultural practice that is harmful to women . "
But academics say the law cannot be used to solve religious debates within communities .
Nor should the courts wade into what exactly a religion prescribes , or how people choose to practise .
" The niqab may not be a religious requirement for you , but that is not really relevant in this debate , " said Natasha Bakht , a law professor at the University of Ottawa .
" The fact of the matter is that the Supreme Court of Canada has said that what is a religious requirement is a personal belief and as long as it is sincerely held , that is all that matters .
" Can you imagine what would happen if the courts had a debate between imams as to what the religious requirements were ? "
Bakht said .
" That would be a real problem . "
BUT AS WOMEN CONTINUE to don the niqab , the question remains :
In a society where women have all the freedoms in the world , why are they making such a choice ?

Some say they see it as a path to piety , a physical manifestation of their faith , and a symbol of their devotion to God .
Others consider it a rejection of the West 's obsession with beauty and a way to maintain their faith in a world where women 's bodies are overly sexualized .
Those who choose to wear it are not shy to say why they do .
But they also acknowledge that there are women forced to wear the niqab by family members or strict religious and cultural interpretations .
" For me , it comes down to my relationship to God , and my commitment to my faith , " said Rana .
" Nothing else matters to me at this moment in my life . "
TINA ASEFFA decided to don the niqab a few months ago , knowing it was her choice to make .
" It is something I feel is Canadian , because the Charter tells me that I am able to express my religion in the way that I see fit , " the single mother said .
It has n't been easy .
There have been taunts , insults , and " a lot of hate " along the way , she said .
" People always say , ' Go back to where you came from , ' " she said , her voice cracking .
" It 's hurtful .
I am from here . "
For the time being , Aseffa has little to worry about .
The government has n't responded or even acknowledged the MCC 's call for an outright ban on the niqab .
But Ottawa 's feelings on the niqab are no secret .
In 2007 , the government pushed for legislation that would have made veiled women show their faces when voting .
" If there are security or identity issues , we have always lifted our veil temporarily .
We have no problem with it , " Aseffa said .
Like other women who wear the niqab , Aseffa says she is tired of being sidelined and ignored in debates about her .
" Our voices are not heard .
If there are women who are marginalized and oppressed , they should be talked to and helped , not further isolated , " she said .
Such sentiments have led to the organization of the first rally for veiled women at Queen 's Park on Nov. 6 .
The rally has been spearheaded by Cheryfa MacAulay Jamal , the outspoken wife of former terror suspect Qayyum Abdul Jamal , accused of being a Toronto 18 member before charges were stayed against him in 2008 .
Aseffa , still deciding whether she will attend , said the rally will be a peaceful march to " remind people that we are here . "
" Right now , we are the foreign guys in Canada , " she said .
" But really , we are just as Canadian as anyone else .
My daughter plays hockey .
My neighbours borrow eggs from me .
" No matter what people say , this is where we belong . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Visitors to London always have to be on the look out for pickpockets , but now there ’s another , more positive phenomenon on the loose -- putpockets .
Aware that people are suffering in the economic crisis , 20 former pickpockets have turned over a new leaf and are now trawling London ’s tourist sites slipping money back into unsuspecting pockets .
Anything from 5 pounds ( $ 8 ) to 20 pound notes is being surreptitiously deposited in unguarded pockets or open handbags in Trafalgar Square , Covent Garden and other busy spots .
The initiative , which runs until the end of August in London before being rolled out countrywide , is being funded by a broadbrand provider , which says it wants to brighten up people ’s lives in unusual ways .
“ It feels good to give something back for a change -- and Britons certainly need it in the current economic climate , ” said Chris Fitch , a former pickpocket who now heads TalkTalk ’s putpocketing initiative .
“ Every time I put money back in someone ’s pocket , I feel less guilty about the fact I spent many years taking it out . ”
London ’s police have been briefed about the plan , which will see at least 100,000 pounds given away .
Made out of what looks like a bunch of kitchen utensils , this stainless steel skull sculpture , by Subodh Gupta , is one of the weirdest artworks I ’ve seen recently .
I ’m sure it has some kind of meaning , but so far I have n’t been able to figure it out .

Now that I have customised my emacs extensively , the default configuration is quite uncomfortable for me to use .
I have a file called my - defaults.el which is the bare minimum I need to make using emacs a pleasant experience .
If I have to sit down at your emacs session , I will probably need to cut and paste these into a temp buffer and call M-x eval - region .
I ’ve mentioned some of these modifications before .
I always always use ido and uniquify .
Ido makes it so nice for finding files and switching buffers , I now find the default behaviour surprising and sometimes even catch myself waiting for the options to appear .
( require ' ido ) ( require ' uniquify )
flex - matching is a given of course , and I do n’t like being prompted unnecessarily for new buffers – I ’m always creating them .
( ido - mode t ) ( setq ido - enable - flex - matching t ) ( setq ido - create - new - buffer ' always )
The way emacs deals with identically named files by default is poor , but it is great that it is so easy to fix .
( setq uniquify - buffer - name - style ' reverse ) ( setq uniquify - separator " | " ) ( setq uniquify - after - kill - buffer - p t ) ( setq uniquify - ignore - buffers - re " ^\\ * " )
Since emacs23 , fonts now look great .
This is from my windows config .
Other folks have written about beautifying emacs for other OSes .
I summarised those posts here .
( set - default - font " - outline-Consolas-normal-r-normal - normal-14-97-96-96-c-*-iso8859-1 " )
It should be obvious what most of these do .
The most important ones are setting yes - or - no - p to accept y or n rather than forcing me to type yes < RETURN > and removing the toolbar .
Actually no , scratch that , these are all important .
( Emacs23 has some of these set by default ) .
( global - font - lock - mode 1 ) ( setq inhibit - splash - screen t ) ( setq font - lock - maximum - decoration 3 ) ( setq use - file - dialog nil ) ( setq use - dialog - box nil ) ( fset ' yes - or - no - p 'y - or - n - p ) ( tool - bar - mode - 1 ) ( show - paren - mode 1 ) ( transient - mark - mode t ) ( setq case - fold - search t ) ( blink - cursor - mode 0 )
It took me ages to figure out how to prevent emacs converting a bunch of spaces into tabs .
And of course , the scrollbar should always be on the right .
( custom - set - variables '( scroll - bar - mode ' right ) '( indent - tabs - mode nil ) )
Where am I ?
( line - number - mode 1 ) ( column - number - mode 1 )
Keep emacs backup files in one place .
This is from my windows config again .
( push '( " . " . " c:/home/jared/.emacs-backups " ) backup - directory - alist )
And make it so that when I copy a region , that gets sent to the OS clipboard .
( setq x- select - enable - clipboard t ) ( setq interprogram - paste - function ' x - cut- buffer-or - selection - value )
Somehow a Taiwanese Web site got its hands on all the posters for the Left 4 Dead 2 - and if these are real , that means the names of the final two are known : " Dead Center " and " Hard Rain . "

Dead Center - " Prices Are n't the Only Things Getting Slashed " - appears to be a shopping mall setting .
Has that ever been done with zombies ?
Hard Rain - " Come Hell and High Water " - looks to be set in some kind of refinery and the knee deep water suggests what you 'll be slogging through in it .
The full size posters are after the text .
I 've emailed Doug Lombardi to ask if Valve would like to comment .
A tipster told us that an L4D2 playtester had seen these and pronounced them accurate .
But if Team Fortress 2 has taught us anything , there are plenty of artists out there who love to make up stuff using Valve IP .

A Tempe bookkeeper had herself a hell of a year .
She traveled , founded a basketball team , and got herself some new ta -tas .
One problem -- she was using her bosses money to do it .
Tempe police spokesman Steve Carbajal says 36 - year - old Tamarom
In stole more than $ 200,000 from the company she was working for and used it to travel , get breast implants , and found a non-profit children 's basketball team .
For the last year , Tempe police have been investigating the Gilbert woman , who worked as the sole bookkeeper for Home Career Services , a Tempe air - conditioner - supply distributor .
For the last 20 months , police say , In stole the money by applying for credit cards in the companies name , forging checks to herself , and altering company records to hide what she was doing .
However , explaining where $ 200,000 came from , as well as a nice new rack , can be tricky , so In founded the Arizona Warriors , a non-profit children 's basketball team .
Police say
In flew the team all over the country and used the team to launder the money she had been stealing .
In was arrested yesterday morning and charged with embezzlement , fraudulent schemes , money laundering , and aggravated identity theft , all felonies .
Products and companies whose names are accidentally ( hopefully accidentally ) totally offensive .
With all the money that companies dump into research and marketing and focus groups , I ’ll never understand how things like this slip through the cracks .
I ’ve tackled the hilarity of inadvertent corporate racism twice before on 11 Points , once with 11 Photos Where Black People Were Awkwardly Photoshopped In or Out and once with 11 Unbelievably Insensitive ( and Often Racist ) Holiday Advertisements .
Today ’s my third installment of The Man making stupidly un -PC decisions : 11 glorious accidental racist product names and racist company names .
Because there ’s nothing that makes me want to buy a product like racism !
1 | i. Beat Blaxx
TrekStor makes a whole line of i.
Beat mp3 players .
In 2007 , they unveiled their newest model : i. Beat Blaxx .
What ’s shocking to me is that , apparently , no one in the company EVER said this name out loud before the product went to market .
At least in their product photos below the i.
Beat Blaxx are n’t playing Devo ’s Whip It or Britney ’s I ’m a Slave 4 U .
2 | Moolatte
I ’ve got to give Dairy Queen credit .
MooLattes hit the market five years ago .
In the half - decade since , hundreds of articles have been written about the fact that the inspiration for those must have been the word Mulatto .
And yet … they still hold strong , keeping these things on the menu to this day .
And you know what ?
I ca n’t be outraged .
Because when I went to the DQ website to track down that link , all I could think about is how I ’d kill a man for a Blizzard right now .
And there ’s no way the company that made Blizzards can be considered anything but wonderful .
3 | Beaner ’s Coffee
Feels like an innocent mistake .
Coffee is made of beans , so the people who have mastered those beans are beaners .
I mean … if I was starting a Scuba suit company , and I called my products Wetback Prevention Scuba Suits , that ’d be totally logical .
And yet …
Beaner ’s caved to pressure and , after 12 years , changed its name to Biggby Coffee .
I do n’t know .
I ’m still not changing the name of my wetsuits .
4 | IHOP Whites Only
I took this photo a few months ago , when my girlfriend and I went to IHOP .
We both ordered Garden Scrambles and both asked for egg whites .
( Yes , they ’re $ 7.99 in Los Angeles , and yes , I realize that ’s exorbitant .
No , I do n’t only take my girlfriend to IHOP , I take her nice places too , but there are a shockingly limited number of good late night dining options in this city . )
Here ’s how IHOP chose to denote that customized product on our receipt .
5 | Audi’s White Power
It ’s never good when a German car company names one of its models “ White Power . ”
According to Avus Performance , which made this custom version of the Audi , something was lost in translation from the German here .
I remain wholly unconvinced .
6 | Jig-A - Loo
A few years back , when I used to work in the radio business , I was at our big annual morning show convention .
Every year at the convention , lots of companies give away their products to radio people , in the hopes that those people will then try their products , like their products and discuss their products on the air free of charge .
At this particular year ’s convention , we all got free Jig - A - Loo .
I do n’t know if it got them any free plugs on the radio back then , but its name ’s similarity to the slur “ Jigaboo ” clearly stuck in my mind .
And now , three full years later , here ’s the free plug they dreamed about when deciding to go with the borderline - racial slur product name .
So good job , Jig - A - Loo .
I look forward to your next business venture : A Capri Sun competitor called Money Grubbin ’ Juice .
7 | Nigaz Oil and Nigaz the drug
Hey , two different companies that , out of all of the made - up words in the world , both settled on naming their company Nigaz .
One is the product of a Russian - Nigerian oil deal … it ’s actually supposed to be NiGas , and pronounced nye - gaz , to show the cooperation between the Nigerian government and Gazprom energy company .
The other one is a Thai drug company , selling anti-inflammatory drugs under the Nigaz brand .
Again , it ’s supposed to be pronounced nye - gaz .
And in both of those cases …
I just do n’t see people guessing that pronunciation .
8 | Permachink
I know that there ’s a non-racist meaning to the word “ chink . ”
Fag also means cigarette .
Colored also means “ possessing color . ”
Jew can be used normally or offensively , depending on context .
But if I start a tobacco company I ’m not calling it “ Sam ’s Smokable Fags . ”
If I start a line of body paint , my slogan ’s not going to be “ Make Yourself a Colored Person . ”
And if I start an auction company it ’s not going to be called “ Jew ‘ Em Downaby’s . ”
( Although that would be a better competitor to Christie’s . )
So … um … yeah , they should n’t have gone with Perma - Chink .
9 | Oreo Barbie
I get the feeling that , if this nice black Barbie has been hanging out with Skipper and dating Ken , she ’s heard the word “ Oreo ” tossed around before .
In the ’90s , Mattel made a deal with Oreo to make Oreo Barbie .
The white one was innocent enough … just another sellout version of Barbie .
The black one … that was not such a good call .
Anyway , according to The Internet , the black Oreo Barbie is a big seller on eBay because it ’s so rare and such a big error in judgment .
10 | Nigro , Nigro and White
Real .
And such an optimistic note of unity !
It ’s like the United Colors of Benetton as an accounting firm !
11 | The black kid ’s computer desk
And I bet the teacher would have the gall to put this in the back of the classroom .

Entre 2004 et 2008 , trente millions d’euros ( dix - neuf milliards de francs CFA ) au minimum ont été détournés au sein du bureau de la Banque des Etats de l’Afrique Centrale ( BEAC ) à Paris .
Une enquête exclusive de la rédaction de Jeune Afrique révèle les dessous de ce scandale .
Dans une enquête exclusive à paraître lundi Jeune Afrique explique comment , depuis 2004 , des fonds injectés depuis le siège de Yaoundé , au Cameroun , sur les comptes parisiens du bureau extérieur de Paris ( BEP ) ont été détournés et met en lumière les dysfonctionnements du BEP .
« De 2004 à juillet 2008 , 2400 chèques frauduleux ou suspects ont été émis , 38 virements suspects ont été repérés , 1298 retraits en liquides non reversés et non enregistrés dans le livre de caisse ont été effectués » précise l’hebdomadaire .
Jeune Afrique dévoile également , à partir d’audits et de rapports internes , la liste des personnes concernées par l’affaire , les présumés responsables et bénéficiaires .
«
Les affinités nationales gabonaises ont joué un rôle clé dans les dérives coupables du bureau de Paris » , constate le média .
Jeune Afrique revient par ailleurs sur la réaction de Bercy , le ministère français de l’Economie et des Finances , qui participe directement à la gestion et au contrôle de la BEAC : « Estimant sa propre garantie engagée par le scandale , le Trésor français veut que toutes les responsabilités , y compris en plus haut lieu , soient établies ».
Après les placements toxiques qui ont fait perdre 238 milliards de francs CFA ( 500 millions d’euros ) à la Beac , dossier également révélé par Jeune Afrique en février dernier , cette nouvelle affaire devrait avoir des conséquences politiques sur la sous-région .
Selon l’hebdomadaire : « Obiang Nguema Mbasogo , Paul Biya , Idriss Déby
Itno sont bien décidés à profiter de l’occasion pour faire sauter le consensus de Fort - Lamy qui attribue depuis trente - cinq ans le fauteuil - clé de gouverneur à un ressortissant gabonais » .

The Microsoft Store stole plenty of ideas from Apple , but you definitely wo n't find services for gamers in the Apple Store .
Destructoid 's Conrad Zimmerman was close by for the Microsoft Store 's grand opening yesterday , and he scoped out a few features for Xbox 360 and Games for Windows customers .
The neatest thing he found was on - demand printing of PC games .
It works exactly like it sounds :
Use a touch screen kiosk to browse Microsoft 's PC software catalog , toss the ones you want into a virtual kart and alert one of the store 's roving , Apple - esque minions .
All the printing 's done in the back , and four minutes later , you 've got a disc and box , complete with labels , cover and instruction manual .
The system allows Microsoft to carry an unlimited stock , and , well , it sounds kind of fun .
I wish there was a similar system for Xbox 360 games , but unfortunately the store is sticking with boxes on a shelf for those ( though Zimmerman says the selection is healthy ) .
Another service that should be appreciated , but not loved , is the ability to bring in your Xbox 360 for repairs .
If it 's a basic problem , such as a faulty power brick , Microsoft 's service techs will repair it on - site .
Otherwise , you 're at least saved the hassle of finding or paying for an appropriate shipping vessel when suffering the Red Ring of Death .
The store also has five demo stations for Xbox 360 games , with their video projected onto the walls .
Not revolutionary , but essential .
Zimmerman wrote that roughly 15 percent of the store is dedicated video games .
So I guess only 85 percent of the Microsoft Store is an Apple Store clone .
This story , " For Gamers , the Microsoft Stores a Rip ( and a Mend ) " was originally published by Technologizer .
President Obama 's planned Sept. 8 speech to the nation 's students has sparked what I 'd call an automated controversy .
The controversy is n't that Obama has announced something controversial , but rather than he 's announced something .
Full stop .
He would like to speak to children about " the need to work hard and stay in school , " according the AP , and conservatives are screaming as though playing the tape backward will unveil the subliminal message " Capitalism is deeeaaddd " or " Organize your communityyyy " or something .
I 'm sorry , I 've recently pledged to avoid offering caricatures of the opposition , but this time I 'm really struggling to find an opposition that does n't caricature itself .
Gary Bauer , American Values leader and former undersecretary of Education under Reagan , concluded in his daily email ( via Dave Weigel ) :
Once again , the Obama Administration is using its power in unprecedented ways , this time injecting itself into the nation 's classrooms .
Tuesday may be a good day to sit in on your child 's classes .
To do what exactly , one can only guess .
Distract the children with nagging ?
Bauer asks what I suppose is a fair question : " How would the media have reacted if President Bush had been beamed into classrooms coast - to - coast ? "
If he 's means the first President Bush , the answer is " They did nothing . "
George H. W. Bush made a similar speech to the nation 's students in 1991 , and all reports indicate that we withstood the agitprop .
If Bauer means the second President Bush , my guess is that liberal hosts would make some utterly predictable , somewhat off - color joke like " Is n't Bush telling kids to study hard like Barry Bonds broadcasting nationally about fair play in sports ? " and then they 'd move on , knowing full well that the speech would n't be played in most schools north of the Mason - Dixon line anyway .
A TOPIC FOR JEFF SESSIONS TO AVOID ….
The irony is rich .
Republicans came out firing at this morning ’s confirmation hearings for Sonia Sotomayor , as Sen. Jeff Sessions ( R - Ala . ) , the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee , accused Sotomayor of being prejudiced .
Citing a controversial racial bias case in which a fire department discarded the results of a qualifying test when black firefighters scored too low , Sessions said Sotomayor was biased in favor of the minority employees . [ … ]
But Sessions ’s attack was n’t confined to the Ricci v. DeStefano case .
The Alabama Republican indicted Sotomayor ’s entire philosophy as based on non-judicial factors .
“ Call it empathy , call it prejudice , or call it sympathy , but whatever it is , it is not law .
In truth it is more akin to politics .
And politics has no place in the courtroom , ” Sessions said .
He can go through the motions if he likes , but to hear Jeff Sessions accuse anyone of “ prejudice ” is pretty ridiculous .
All it does is offer a chance to revisit Sessions ’ own lengthy record .
As a U.S. Attorney in Alabama , Sessions ’ most notable effort was prosecuting three civil rights workers , including a former aide to Martin Luther King Jr. , on trumped up charges of voter fraud .
Also during his illustrious career in Alabama , Sessions called the NAACP “ un - American ” because it , among other groups , “ forced civil rights down the throats of people . ”
A former career Justice Department official who worked with Sessions recalled an instance when he referred to a white attorney as a “ disgrace to his race ” for litigating voting rights cases on behalf of African Americans .
Sessions later acknowledged having made many of the controversial remarks attributed to him , but claimed to have been joking .
What ’s more , Thomas Figures , a former assistant U.S. Attorney in Alabama and an African American , later explained that during a 1981 murder investigation involving the Ku Klux Klan , Sessions was heard by several colleagues commenting that he “ used to think they [ the Klan ] were OK ” until he found out some of them were “ pot smokers . ”
Sessions once again acknowledged making the remark , but once again claimed to have been kidding .
Figures also remembered having heard Sessions call him “ boy , ” and once warn him to “ be careful what you say to white folks . ”
The fight scene is the single most important and meaningful expression in cinema .
Without it , the inspirational montage would not exist , " I know karate " would not be the playground 's Neutron Bomb , and Rocky would just be another mentally diminished meathead from Philadelphia ( which is like being a teardrop in an ocean of sadness ) .
But while nobody can dispute the value of the fight scene , the great tragedy is that the best are not always the brightest :
Here are the most epic fight scenes in the history of film ... that you 've never seen :
3 Hard Ticket to Hawaii
The Setup :
It is a beautiful , peaceful sunny day , and everything that 's wrong with the 90s jogs down the beach together .
But their fun is quickly brought to a halt by one of the terrorists from Die Hard on his lunch break :

The Fight :
" Who 's this ? "
He demands of the woman .
" He 's just a thrower , " she responds , after struggling and ultimately failing to remember what a Frisbee is called .
" We 're just throwing , " the man reaffirms , in the same way you might reply " you too " to a waiter who asks you to enjoy your meal ; he is immediately filled with shame , regret and confusion .
" Oh yeah ? " the postal worker retorts , clearly disbelieving that a man so stupid is capable of moving his arms laterally , " let 's see you throw one . "

That 's right :
This game of Frisbee is the fight scene .
No punches are thrown , no kicks are unleashed , no heads are locked -- these two dual like true gentlemen of the 90s : as gaily as humanly possible .
The only way this could be more emblematic of the era is if they were both on rollerblades and one of them was Will Smith .
But , unbeknownst to our hero , this particular elite guardsman has sunk all of his skill points into dual - wielding and Frisbee manipulation ( you 're welcome , nerds ) , and the protagonist is in for the match of his life .
He can't be blamed , though :
How the hell was he supposed to know that he's up against Vincent Frisbee , long - lost heir to the Discus Fortunes ?
The Aftermath :
Faced with the impending Frisbee apocalypse , the woman jogs away in mincing fear .
Our protagonist , ever the gentleman , wishes her a good day by virtue of her ass .
What , did you think the game was a metaphor ?
No , this is how all true Frisbee games end : in death and embarrassment .
Oh , but there is no regret for John Frisbee .
No , he died as he lived : guarding an empty stretch of beach and recklessly entering discus throwing competitions during work hours .
And to the victor , as always , go the spoils :
The right to subtly fist - pump .

Jamie
Foxx got his start going for laughs , then proved that he was serious about acting .
Now , the Academy Award winner ( Ray ) is paired with Gerard Butler in the riveting drama Law Abiding Citizen .
The flick raises troubling questions about the justice system .
Foxx gave Parade.com ’s Jeanne
Wolf his frank opinion about taking the law into his own hands .
Passing judgment on Roman Polanski .
“ If it had been my daughter who was barely a teenager–my daughter is 15 – Roman Polanski would be missing . . . period .
It would n’t even get to the court case .
But , that ’s me and I would n’t want anyone else to follow that because you should let the justice system work it out .
On the other hand , I do n’t know Roman Polanski , but maybe if I had a relationship with him my answer would be different .
I just think this whole issue is bigger than Roman Polanski . ”
Jamie Foxx : ‘ I Was Scared of Losing My Mind ’
Where do you draw the line ?
“ Revenge is a tough thing .
When it comes to someone bringing harm to your family , it ’s hard to think about turning the other cheek .
When I hear about things that we allow to go on in our society where women are harmed , I just knee - jerk .
I ’ve said some things publicly that my publicist keeps telling me I should keep to myself .
I do n’t know if that ’s my Texas upbringing , but there comes a point where you just say , ‘ OK , that would be my tipping point .
What would I do ? ’
Some of things I ’ve said I ’d do to sexual perpetrators were pretty graphic .
But I also read some stories of people taking the law into their own hands , which is bad too .
So it ’s tough to know how far you ’d go . ”
Trying not to get left behind with his choices as a singer .
“ I ’m just going to stay current .
It ’s like all my R&B cohorts are out of jobs right now .
Nobody wants to hear R&B .
It ’s sad .
If you want to be on the radio you got to stay young .
My daughter always goes , ‘ Dad you sound old .
You sound 50 .
Why do n’t you have a machine on your voice ?
They ’re not going to like that .
You gotta sound young . ’
Then when she heard me sing ‘ Blame It , ’ she went , ‘ That ’s it .
That ’s real music . ' ”

The real appeal of R&B .
“ When you sing R&B songs in front of an audience , you look out and there ’s 85 % women .
I think R&B music is sort of designed for a man singing to a woman .
I do n’t sing it like the sexy thing , but sort of pseudo - sexy .
We rally the women together because it ’s about being independent and things like that . ”

The celebrity challenge .
“ It ’s hard to be a celebrity nowadays .
It ’s not about your track record anymore .
If you have a great movie , you ’re good .
If not , people are ready to write you off .
I think the only ones who are really winning are people like Will Smith .
People go , ‘ Oh , it ’s Will Smith .
I ’ve got to see him , whatever he ’s in . ’
It ’s tough because the lines have been blurred .
I was watching that reality show with Jon and Kate .
They ’re huge , and I do n’t even know what they ’re huge for .
They somehow crossed over because they ’re just as popular as Brad Pitt . ”
Beware of YouTube .
“ If you ’re somewhat successful , you can keep on doing your thing .
But do n’t get caught out there looking goofy .
It ’s weird .
When you do something that stinks , it ’s going to last forever on the Internet .
There ’s always someone in the audience with a camera phone and if you ’re not 100 % , you ’re going to be watching yourself on YouTube . ”
Coburn staffer : Porn makes you gay
Dave Weigel , the intrepid Washington Independent reporter , was at the Omni Shoreham last week for the Value Voters conference , when Tom Coburn 's chief of staff , Michael Schwartz embarked on a rambling explanation of the perils of homosexuality .
Schwartz , a longtime conservative activist who has been with Oklahoma Republican for 15 years , first claimed that homosexuality is wrong because most 10 - year - old boys have an innate hatred for it .
Then he began discoursing on the evils of pornography , echoing a friend who once told him that all porn was gay porn because it turned men " inwards . "
His conclusion :
If you told 10 - year - old boys that looking at naked pictures of women would make them gay , then they would n't be buying Playboy .
“ Pornography is a blight ...
It is a disaster .
It is one of those silent diseases in our society that we have n’t been able to overcome very well .
Now , I may be getting politically incorrect here .
And it ’s been a few years , but not that many , since I was closely associated with pre-adolescent boys , boys around 10 years of age .
But it is my observation that boys of that age have less tolerance for homosexuality than just about any other class of people .
They speak badly about homosexuality .
And that ’s because they do n’t want to be that way .
They do n’t want to fall into it . ”
Schwartz told the crowd about Jim Johnson , a friend of his who turned an old hotel into a hospice for gay men dying of AIDS .
“ One of the things he said to me , ” said Schwartz , “ that I think is an astonishingly insightful remark … he said ‘ All pornography is homosexual pornography , because all pornography turns your sexual drive inwards . ”
There were murmurs and gasps from the crowd .
“ Now , think about that , ” said Schwartz .
“ And if you tell an 11 - year - old boy about that , do you think he ’s going to want to get a copy of Playboy ?
I ’m pretty sure he ’ll lose interest .
That ’s the last thing he wants !
You know , that ’s a good comment , it ’s a good point , and it ’s a good thing to teach young people . ”

FUMICINO , Italy ( CNN ) --
Under a canopy of elegant Italian pines , the foundations of a mini Roman Coliseum are at once unmistakable and exhilarating .
The intricate statue head archeologists unearthed while excavating the site at Fumicino , Italy in early 2009 more photos »
The structure at " Portus , " the Romans ' ancient Mediterranean port , has remained undiscovered for eighteen centuries until now .
University of Southampton archaeologists have just this summer uncovered the remains of an amphitheater , a Roman warehouse and the ruins of an Imperial palace even though archaeologists have been digging at this site since the 19th Century .
" It 's true I think also to say that we have kind of rediscovered it because the great Italian archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani reported the discovery of a theater in the 1860s but nobody could actually find it , " says Professor Simon Keay , a leading expert on Roman Archaeology at the University of Southampton .
Watch a report on the site 's discovery »
" There is only one imperial Rome , and Rome only had one imperial port and Portus is that port .
In a sense it is trying to give an idea not only of the importance by virtue of that but also because the archaeological potential of it is huge , " adds Keay .
The site is a feast for the eyes in the true Roman sense .
Excavations have unearthed priceless treasures apart from the foundations of the amphitheater .
See images of the site »
An exquisite white marble head of a statue was found close to the site of the amphitheater .
Experts believe it could be a bust of Ulysses or possibly a Greek sailor .
Rare and finely carved fragments of columns have also been found .
" When we first started the project , everything you would have seen here was grass , a couple of trees , " explains Keay .
" We very nearly fell into a hole because we could n't actually see what we were doing .
Clearly we have completely exposed this area and because these buildings are so big it is only by uncovering large areas of them that we can actually understand their function and their development , " says Keay .
The site is ironically less than a mile from Rome 's modern transport hub , Fumicino International Airport , and this discovery owes more than a nod to modern technology .
Using modern sensors , ground - penetrating radar and probes , researchers complied computer images of what lay beneath .
They were dazzled by what modern technology revealed about the ancient past .
" So we then played around with it on the computer screen , we did a virtual reconstruction of it and amphitheater shape grew out of the screen and we knew that we were on to something very special , " says Keay .
The excavations in Fumicino , Italy , just outside Rome , continue in a joint project named " Portus " with the University of Southampton , the British School at Rome , The Italian Archaeological Superintendency for Ostia and the University of Cambridge .
What ’s a date picker ?
A date picker is an easy way to introduce a date / time into an input field .
It definitely gives a professional look to your forms by simplifying the process of selecting a specific date or a range of dates .

Good on the catwalk but not on the shop floor , workers are told Union members have voted to take a stand against the risks of wearing high heels in the workplace in favour of more " sensible shoes " .
Delegates at the TUC congress in Liverpool backed a motion requiring some employers to carry out risk assessments about workers ' footwear .
The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists says lower limb injuries cost two million working days a year .
But some unions say individuals should be allowed to wear what they want .
TUC delegates heard some workers were forced to wear high heels as part of their dress code .
' Glamming up ' Lorraine Jones , of the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists , said women shop workers , cabin crew and other employees had to wear high heels as part of a dress code , but this did not apply to men .
She said such shoes put seven times as much pressure on the ball of the foot as flat - soled options .
This well - meant motion will see the union movement portrayed in the media as the killjoy fashion police .

University and College Union
This could cause long - term knee injuries , she warned , adding : " We are not trying to ban high heels .
They are good for glamming up but they are not good for the workplace .
" Women should have a choice of wearing healthier , more comfortable shoes . "
But Loraine Monk , a University and College Union delegate , opposed the move , saying : " This well - meant motion will see the union movement portrayed in the media as the killjoy fashion police .
" Why is it only aimed at women ?
Has n't anyone heard of Berlusconi ?
" Who decides what is appropriate when it comes to dress codes ?
My union previously fought a successful campaign against a college that demanded women lecturers had to have their arms covered at all times .
Who thought that one up ?
A man .
" We should list all inappropriate dress in the workplace , not pick on something that is symbolic of a much wider debate about gender roles and is something that many women have a particular view about - both for and against . "
The motion stated that all firms which promote high heels should examine the risks that employees wearing them face and , where they are found to be hazardous , they should be replaced with sensible and comfortable shoes .

BMW packed the new 7 - Series sedan with optional gadgets ranging from radar - assisted cruise control to blind spot detection .
There 's even a heads - up display .
Pick all the high - tech options and you 'll add $ 26,000 to the car 's already hefty price tag .
But the coolest feature is the new night - vision system that likens a twilight drive to a Special Forces recon mission .
The Night Vision with Pedestrian Detection system significantly advances the first - gen system found in the last 7 - series by adding people - spotting technology that distinguishes between animals and humans .
The system was developed by the Swedish firm Autoliv Electronics .
It is the latest evolution of technology that Lexus and Mercedes - Benz also have offered since Cadillac brought it to the automotive sector in the 2000 Deville sedan .
Since then , thermal imaging has made way for far - and near - infrared cameras that detect even the smallest changes in temperature .
BMW 's passive system uses far - infrared technology to scan for heat , whereas Mercedes ' near - infrared system illuminates the road with projected infrared light .
The BMW system stands apart for its extreme depth , clarity in rain and ability to minimize extraneous information .
Despite the added safety such systems offer , Cadillac and Lexus dropped them because few people bought them .
But BMW , like Mercedes , still sees a market for it .
The system does a great job of helping you see in the dark , but it is not without flaws .
BMW is n't suggesting drivers switch off their headlights .
The $ 2,600 option compliments the 7 - Series ' adaptive headlights , which follow your steering inputs to help you see around that turn .
The system provides a crisp , clear picture of 1,000 feet of pavement ahead of you , a distance Autoliv says is twice the range of the headlights .
That can mean the difference between avoiding that deer and totaling your $ 110,000 Beemer Bimmer .
" The new system is like an extra set of eyes – a very complex processing unit is constantly monitoring video of the road ahead , " says Stuart Klapper , night vision business director at Autoliv .
A silver dollar - size far - infrared camera in the grille detects the temperature of everything ahead .
A computer converts the data into an image ( shown at right ) that appears on the dashboard 's i-Drive navigation display .
Warmer objects like a pedestrian or moose are white , while cooler objects like a parked car are black .
The pedestrian - detection feature kicks in when the car exceeds 25 mph , scanning the road 10 to 100 yards ahead of you .
Pedestrians appear with a yellow tint , helping you figure out if that dark shape is a kid on a bike or a dog in the road .
The system also monitors your speed and trajectory to warn you if you 're on a collision course .
BMW designed the system to account for country and city driving conditions .
When driving at slower speeds in the city , where higher pedestrian traffic is expected , the system monitors a smaller area ahead of you so it is n't warning you about the drunk staggering across the street three blocks ahead .
We tested the system during a weekend in Manhattan and the Berkshire Mountains , about 150 miles from the Big Apple .
We did more than 500 miles behind the heated , leather - wrapped steering wheel of the big Beemer Bimmer and have mixed feelings about the system 's execution .
The system is remarkable for the crisp , clear picture that it projects .
It 's like watching a black and white movie on a nice TV .
The more time you spend with it , the more you appreciate how well it highlights everything from a couple walking down the street to an oncoming car .
Things you could n't see through the windshield appear clearly and vibrantly on the screen .
This was particularly helpful driving a tight country road .
A motorist had pulled over on the side of the road and , thanks to the bright image on the screen , was easily spotted .
That might have prevented an accident .
That said , the system provided a few false warnings on the run from Sandisfield , Massachusetts , to Becket on Route 8 , a winding road with plenty of tight turns and blind corners .
It 's exactly the kind of road where you 'd want the system to work flawlessly , yet it continued to warn of dangers that were n't there .
We suspect that , as the car rounded a corner and its nose pointed ever - so - briefly away from the road , the sensors detected something at the side of the road .
" It is possible that an animal or another warm object may have triggered the alert .
In the 7 - series , a false warning can occur , " Klapper says .
" In the new 5 - series , we have fine - tuned the warning algorithms to eliminate most false warnings . "
That 's all well and good , but the one time a deer did cross our path , there was no warning because we were n't going fast enough to activate the pedestrian / animal warning .
But we did find that the system is far more effective – and useful – in the city .
The biggest problem is that you have to take your eyes off the road to use it .
You have to wonder why the display was n't mounted closer to the driver 's line of sight as it is in Mercedes S - Class models with Night View Assist Plus .
Klapper says BMW wanted to take advantage of its high - resolution iDrive navigation display .
That may be , but it detracts from any safety advantage the system might provide .
BMW 's done a good job advancing in - car night vision , but it remains to be seen whether consumers will embrace it with the same fervor as navigation systems and voice - activated controls .
The technology 's future is n't as clear as the image on the screen in the car .

You would n't want to hit that .
A celebrated Goldman Sachs partner , Gus Levy , coined the maxim that long defined the bank , the savviest and most influential firm on Wall Street : “ Greedy , but long - term greedy . ”
But these days that old dictum is being truncated to just “ greedy ” by some Goldman critics .
While many ordinary Americans are still waiting for an economic recovery , Goldman and its employees are enjoying one of the richest periods in the bank ’s 140 - year history .
Goldman executives are perplexed by the resentment directed at their bank and contend the criticism is unjustified .
But they find themselves in the uncomfortable position of defending Goldman ’s blowout profits and the outsize paydays that are the hallmark of its success .
For Goldman employees , it is almost as if the financial crisis never happened .
Only months after paying back billions of taxpayer dollars , Goldman Sachs is on pace to pay annual bonuses that will rival the record payouts that it made in 2007 , at the height of the bubble .
In the last nine months , the bank set aside about $ 16.7 billion for compensation  on track to pay each of its 31,700 employees close to $ 700,000 this year .
Top producers are expecting multimillion - dollar paydays .
Bajaur Taliban leader Faqir Mohammed .
Unmanned aircraft operated by the US attacked a meeting of the Bajaur Taliban , killing 27 Islamist extremists .
The attack came close to killing one of the senior - most Taliban commanders in Pakistan .
The strikes , likely carried out by Predators or Reapers , struck underground bunkers in Damadola in the Mamond region in the northern tribal agency of Bajaur .
The Taliban were holding a regional shura , or council , with members from Dir , Swat , and Mohmand in attendance .
Al Qaeda members were also present .
The attack killed 17 Taliban members and 11 “ foreigners , ” according to The Nation .
At this time , no senior al Qaeda or Taliban leaders have been reported killed .
Faqir Mohammed , the leader of the Taliban in Bajaur and the deputy leader of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , was at the meeting but left 10 minutes prior to the strike , according to a report at Dawn .
Two of Faqir ’s relatives are thought to have been killed in the strike .
A US intelligence official involved in the covert program confirmed Faqir ’s presence at the meeting .
The official , who wished to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the program , said that he believes Faqir was tipped off about the strike , just minutes before it was executed , by pro-jihadi elements within Pakistan ’s Inter - Service Intelligence agency .
“ We ’ve seen Taliban and al Qaeda leaders leave meetings minutes before the hit far too often for this to be a coincidence , ” the official said .
Damadola and the Mamond region are known Taliban strongholds in Bajaur .
Al Qaeda is known to have operated a command and control center in Bajaur for directing operations in northeastern Afghanistan .
Since January 2006 , the US has struck four times in Bajaur ; all of the attacks have hit targets in the Mamond region .
Two of the attacks targeted Ayman al Zawahiri , al Qaeda ’s second in command .
Zawahiri is known to be close to Faqir .
Today ’s attack takes place as the Pakistani military is conducting operations against the Taliban in the Mamond region in Bajaur .
Earlier this year , the military claimed the Taliban were “ defeated ” in Bajaur and in the neighboring Mohmand tribal agency during operations in the area that ended in March , but the Taliban have remained entrenched .
Bajaur airstrike is first outside Waziristan in six months
The US airstrike in Bajaur is the first outside the Waziristan tribal agencies since the April 1 attack that targeted a high - level meeting at a compound in Arakzai run by Hakeemullah Mehsud .
Among the 12 extremists killed in the strike was Abdullah Hamas al Filistini , a senior al Qaeda trainer .
Since April , the US has focused much of its efforts on the networks run by Baitullah Mehsud and Mullah Nazir in South Waziristan and the Haqqani Network and Abu Kasha al Iraqi in North Waziristan .
The US succeeded in killing Baitullah , the former leader of the Movement of the Taliban in Pakistan , in an early August strike in South Waziristan .
Today ’s attack is the third this month , and the ninth since the beginning of September .
Seven of the nine strikes have taken place in North Waziristan .
The US has carried out 45 airstrikes inside Pakistan so far this year .
In all of 2008 , 36 strikes were carried out .
Since the US ramped up cross - border attacks in 2008 , 15 al Qaeda and Taliban leaders have been killed [ see LWJ report , “ US airstrikes alone cannot defeat al Qaeda ” ] .
The US is considering switching from a counterinsurgency - centric strategy aimed at defeating the Taliban in Afghanistan to a counterterrorism strategy targeting al Qaeda ’s network in Pakistan using unmanned airstrikes and covert operations by special operations commandos [ see LWJ report , “ Counterterrorism at the expense of counterinsurgency will doom Afghanistan and Pakistan : US officials ” ] .
Background on US strikes against al Qaeda and Taliban networks in northwestern Pakistan
US intelligence believes that al Qaeda has reconstituted its external operations network in Pakistan ’s lawless , Taliban - controlled tribal areas .
This network is tasked with hitting targets in the West , India , and elsewhere .
The US has struck at these external cells using unmanned Predator aircraft and other means in an effort to disrupt al Qaeda ’s external network and decapitate the leadership .
The US also has targeted al Qaeda - linked Taliban fighters operating in Afghanistan , particularly the notorious Haqqani Network .
As of the summer of 2008 , al Qaeda and the Taliban operated 157 known training camps in the tribal areas and the Northwest Frontier Province .
Al Qaeda has been training terrorists holding Western passports to conduct attacks , US intelligence officials have told The Long War Journal .
Some of the camps are devoted to training the Taliban ’s military arm ; some train suicide bombers for attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan ; some focus on training the various Kashmiri terror groups ; some train al Qaeda operatives for attacks in the West ; some train the Lashkar al Zil , al Qaeda ’s Shadow Army ; and one serves as a training ground for the Black Guard , the elite bodyguard unit for Osama bin Laden , Ayman al Zawahiri , and other senior al Qaeda leaders .
There were 36 recorded cross - border attacks and attempts in Pakistan during 2008 , according to numbers compiled by The Long War Journal .
Twenty - nine of those attacks took place after Aug. 31 .
From 2004 through 2007 , there were only 10 recorded strikes .

There have been quite a few articles recently on some new numbers showing that French speakers in public schools are no longer the majority ( but just barely ) , and everyone involved in language policy in Quebec is having a say .
Here 's most of one article from La Presse that quotes the president of the Société Saint - Jean - Baptiste and his fears that Quebec may be heading to a state like that of Louisiana today .
" If we do n't modify linguistic policies we 'll be going towards a louisianization of Quebec " , said the president of the Montreal Société Saint - Jean - Baptiste ( SSJB ) , Mario Beaulieu .
Mr. Beaulieu said yesterday that allophones are now the majority in public schools in Montreal .
At present , 39 % of Montreal students in public schools have French as a mother tongue .
They have been surpassed in number by those that have a language neither English nor French as a mother tongue ( 39.5 % ) .
The president of the SSJB is not surprised by this .
" We 've been prepared for years .
But it demonstrates the importance of teaching French to new arrivals . "
Mr. Beaulieu explained that 52.4 % of citizens in Montreal spoke French at home , but that only 45 % of students at school say they use French at home , showing a decline in schools compared to the population in general .
Mr. Beaulieu believes that government efforts to preserve French in school have not been sufficient .
According to him , Law 101 should be extended to cégep ( community colleges ) as well , and universities should not be aloof .
" English universities recieve 25 % of the financing given to Quebec while only 10 % of the population is anglophone .
French speakers are being pushed to English universities , " he denounced .
The current president of Impératif français , Jean - Paul Perreault , added that schools should ensure that French is spoken all the time , and not just in classes .
" English is often the language most spoken in the corridors and in the schoolyard .
There 's a problem there .
It 'll be difficult to impose French , but it must be done " , he said .
...
The Parti Quebecois is preparing strategies to improve the state of French in Montreal .
" One must not blame or penalize people .
But we note that there is a strong tendency towards anglicization in Montreal .
We will present our solutions to our national council which will take place on October 24th and 25th " , said Mr. Curzi .
The strategy they need to adopt is quite a simple one : as noted here , French has barely fallen to second place in schools as the language used at home , but first place is not English , but rather every other language but French and English .
The numbers are : 39.5 % - Other languages besides French and English39 % - French22 % - English
The reason for this change in the numbers is due to immigration , as immigrants now make up 20 % of students .
Since vastly larger numbers of people grow up learning English to a certain extent compared to French , this means that a lot of the 39.5 % feel more comfortable with English , which added together with the anglophone population swings the pendulum towards that language when students are talking together .
So the strategy needs to be focused on immigrants , since this is the section of the population that can be most easily affected by government strategy .
Immigrants very often have a hard time finding the time to learn the language of their adopted country / region due to simply having no time to do much but work , or living in a part of town quite far from where the language is taught - the local education centre may be more than an hour away by bus , for example , making it a pretty tough slog after work .
Some easy ways to implement this ( among many others ) include teaching the language over the phone / Skype , and perhaps the creation of something like Deutsche Welle 's Deutsch - Warum Nicht ? ( a very impressive German course ) , but in French and focused on Montreal .
Almost without exception , immigrants love the idea of becoming fluent in the language of where they have chosen to live ( being fluent in another language is super cool , after all ) , so whatever makes this easy as possible is the strategy most likely to succeed .

The banking crisis was avoidable , says Islamic scholar Sheikh Hussain Hussan London has become one of the biggest centres for Islamic finance in the world , with five Islamic banks , and many others in the high street offering Islamic financial products , or " windows " as they are known .
The growth of Islamic finance has been an unexpected outcome of the attacks on the World Trade Center of 11 September 2001 .
Islamic finance is based on rules from Islam 's holy texts - the Koran .
Scholars claim the fundamental difference to conventional banking is that Islamic finance is more ethical .
First it bans any form of " riba " or interest , preventing consumers being exploited by high rates of borrowing .
' Sinful ' Secondly , it regards speculative trading as sinful .
One of the world 's leading experts on Islamic finance , Sheikh Hussain Hassan , argues the whole crisis in Western banking could have been avoided if these basic sharia principles had been followed .
He said : " $ 600 trillion were wasted on options , futures and derivatives , all gambling .
Sharia prohibited these kind of risks 14 centuries back . "
We have a policy of no obstacles , no special favours , towards Islamic banking or indeed any new financial company
Financial Services Authority Some Muslims regard ordinary mortgages as sinful .
The idea is for the lender and the borrower to share the risk .
There are now more products on the market which help Muslims buy a house without paying interest .
The most common form of Islamic home purchase loan works like this :
When a couple wants to buy a house , instead of borrowing the money , the Islamic bank buys 80 % of the house for them .
The couple puts down a deposit for the other 20 % and then pays the bank rent , plus regular portions of the capital .
During the fixed period , ownership gradually passes from the bank to the buyer .
The rent charged by the bank is how it makes its money .
If the borrower loses his job and defaults on the payments , under sharia law it is very difficult for the family to be thrown out of their home , as that would be seen as a creditor exploiting a debtor .
These interest - avoiding transactions can work on a bigger scale as well .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
The old Chelsea Barracks in London was bought by the Qatari government for nearly £ 1bn - the biggest residential property deal in the UK .
The entire transaction was done under sharia pinciples , with contracts drawn up by lawyers at Norton Rose .
Farmida
Bi , one of the law firm 's partners , explained that London has attracted this kind of investment because the British government wooed Islamic money in the wake of 9/11 , at the expense of the US .
" It was really September 11th that made being a Muslim a political statement and not just a matter of personal faith , " she said .
" And with the Patriot Act , which made investments in the US difficult for many Islamic investors , there was a significant increase in Islamic investors choosing to invest in Islamic institutions and Islamic products . "
So while groups in the US were investigating terrorist connections with Islamic banks , Muslim investors pulled their money out of America .
Some of the money got diverted to London , which had traditionally been a banking centre .
The British government then helped further by changing regulations to give sharia - compliant funds a level playing field with conventional ones .
Salaam Insurance offers Europe 's first sharia - compliant car insurance A spokesperson for the Financial Services Authority , the body which regulates UK financial services , said : " We have a policy of no obstacles and no special favours towards Islamic banking , or indeed any new financial company . "
The desire of British Muslim consumers to affirm their identity is also leading to a growth in new consumer services .
Salaam Insurance has launched Europe 's first sharia - compliant car insurance aimed at Britain 's 700,000 Muslim drivers .
Bradley Brandon - Cross , its non-Muslim chief executive , finds most Muslims do not yet understand the profit and loss sharing principles of " takaful " that it is based on .
" There 's clearly an education campaign we are undertaking for British Muslims , to help them understand what Islamic finance is and what it means for them , " he said .
Critics say the Islamic character of the products is merely window dressing to lure in Muslim customers .
And others argue the scholars who authorise them are a narrow group whom financial institutions choose to support their new services .
But this scepticism is unlikely to halt the inexorable growth of Islamic finance - as big investors and growing numbers of Muslim consumers demand it .

The two prime ministers have agreed to separate talks on the border
Slovenia says it is ready to lift its block on Croatia 's bid to join the European Union .
The announcement came after talks between Prime Minister Borut Pahor and his Croat counterpart Jadranka Kosor .
They also said they had agreed that a continuing 18 - year - old border dispute would not prejudice Croatia 's accession talks with the EU .
Slovenia had blocked Croatia 's EU negotiations since December because of the border dispute .
Prime Minister Pahor said the government would immediately propose to parliament that " Slovenia removes restraints for Croatia 's EU negotiating process " .
For her part , Croatia 's prime minister said she had faxed a letter to the Swedish EU presidency saying they had " reached an agreement on the continuation of talks with the EU and continuation of the border talks " .
" No document can be prejudicial to the final border solution , " Ms Kosor added .
Croatia had hoped to complete accession talks with the EU this year , and become the 28th member of the bloc by 2010 or 2011 .
International mediation
The border row dates back to 1991 , when the two countries declared independence from the former Yugoslavia .
The dispute centres mainly on the small bay of Piran in the Adriatic Sea .
Croatia has wanted the border to be drawn down the middle of the bay .
But Slovenia , which has a much shorter coastline than its neighbour , fears this would deny its ships direct passage to the high seas .
Last December , Slovenia vetoed a large chunk of the talks , saying Croatia had provided maps and documents in the EU negotiations that would have prejudged a solution to the border dispute .
The two prime ministers said on Friday talks on the border issue would continue with international mediation , Reuters news agency reports .
The Toronto woman who was stranded in Kenya for months after Canadian officials mistakenly voided her passport is finally on her way home .
Suaad Hagi Mohamud was due to board a flight that will take her back to Canada at about 3 p.m. EST , her lawyer told CTV News Channel Friday afternoon .
Raoul Boulakia said his client had a " definite sound of relief in her voice " as she headed to the airport .
She should be home and able to finally see her 12 - year - old son again Saturday afternoon , Boulakia added .
Earlier on Friday , a judge in Kenya dropped false identity charges against Mohamud and Canada 's embassy in Nairobi issued her a new passport .
The Somalia - born woman was detained in Nairobi because officials did n't believe her lips matched the photo in her four - year - old passport .
The Canadian High Commission agreed and pulled the passport .
Canadian officials initially called Mohamud an impostor -- voiding her passport and turning her over to Kenya for prosecution .
She spent eight days in jail , which her lawyer called " a horrible place to be looked up . "
" Sleeping conditions were extremely bad , so her health is something we are going to have to figure out when we get her home , " Boulakia said .
Officials maintained she was n't who she claimed to be , even though Mohamud handed over numerous pieces of identification and offered fingerprints .
But a DNA test confirmed her identity and cleared her way home .
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said an increasing number of global threats make cases such as Mohamud 's more common and more difficult .
" There are more and more Canadians who have challenges when they are abroad of very different kinds , " he said from Chelsea , Que. Friday .
" The Department of Foreign Affairs does what it can to aid people , but we always advise people to be cautious when they 're travelling .
The government of Canada does not control affairs in other countries . "
Saying " it 's not an easy case , " Harper has promised the federal government will investigate why she was stranded .
" Our first priority as a government is obviously to see her get on a flight back to Canada , " he said in Kitchener , Ont. , on Thursday .
Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan said the government will review the actions of the Canada Border Services Agency and has asked for a " full accounting " of how it handled Mohamud 's case .
Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff has criticized Ottawa 's handling of the file .
" Holding a Canadian passport must mean the Canadian government will protect you -- no matter where , no matter when , " he said in a news release .
" Instead , the Harper government handed Suaad Mohamud 's passport over to Kenyan officials to aid in her prosecution .
She 's only the latest Canadian endangered abroad by a government that picks and chooses which citizens it wants to protect . "
Lawsuit ?
Boulakia said his client should come home to rest and reflect on her situation before she considers filing any lawsuits .
" Everybody is talking about a lawsuit and its obvious why , " he said .
" But I do n't really believe in making that kind of declaration before having time to reflect . "
However , her Kenyan lawyer said that Mohamud will sue Kenya , Canada and Dutch airline KLM for damages and is demanding about $ 1.3 million in compensation .
Lucas Naikuni said his Somali - born client was discriminated against .
" Basically , Somalis are viewed as terrorists or security risks .
They did n't want to go the extra mile to verify her identity " Naikuni said .

UCLA View Enlarged Image REACTION
Sangji's lab notebook reveals that she planned to react vinyl bromide with tert - butyllithium as the first step of a larger synthesis .
Text Size A A
On Jan. 16 , Sheharbano ( Sheri ) Sangji , a 23 - year - old chemistry research assistant , died from injuries sustained in a chemical fire on Dec. 29 , 2008 , in a laboratory at the University of California , Los Angeles ( C&EN Online Latest News , Jan. 22 ) .
The incident has trained a spotlight on safety practices in academic labs , with researchers highlighting the need for awareness of risks and regular hazard assessments , while cautioning against developing an adversarial relationship with campus environmental health and safety officials .
Before researchers can learn from what went wrong , however , they must first understand what happened .
Sangji had started work in the lab of Patrick Harran , a chemistry professor at UCLA , on Oct. 13 .
According to copies of Sangji ’s lab notebook obtained from UCLA through a California Public Records
Act request , Sangji planned in December to scale up a reaction she ’d run once before , on Oct. 17 , to produce 4 - hydroxy - 4 - vinyldecane from either 4 - undecanone or 4 - decanone — the structure and molecular weight written in her lab notebook are inconsistent with the named reagent .
The first step of that reaction was to generate vinyllithium by reacting vinylbromide with two equivalents of tert - butyllithium ( tBuLi ) , a pyrophoric chemical that ignites spontaneously in air .
That ’s an acceptable way to approach the synthesis Sangji was doing , says E. J. Corey , a Nobel Laureate and chemistry professor at Harvard University .
A Grignard reagent could be used instead of vinyllithium to do the addition to the ketone , Corey says , but side reactions would reduce the yield .
And the best way to generate a clean lithium reagent , Corey says , is to use two equivalents of tBuLi ( J. Am. Chem . Soc. 1972 , 94 , 7210 ) .
When Sangji had done the reaction in October , she added 28 mL of anhydrous ether to a flame - dried 200 - mL flask .
Next , she added 3.0 mL of vinyl bromide and stirred the mixture for 15 minutes at – 78 ºC .
She then charged the flask with 53.79 mL of 1.67 M tBuLi in pentane .
She further stirred the mixture for two hours , then moved it to a 0 ºC bath for 30 minutes , and finally took it back to – 78 ºC .
Separately , she added 6 mL of ether and 3.90 mL of 4 - undecanone to another flame - dried flask and cooled the mixture .
She then used a double - tipped needle to transfer the material to the tBuLi flask .
She stirred the reaction at – 78 ºC for two hours , then warmed it to – 10 ºC before quenching the reaction with 80 mL of NaHCO 3 .
Her crude yield was 3.60 g of 4 - hydroxy - 4 - vinyldecane , or 86.75 % .
At the end of December , Sangji ’s goal was to generate three times that amount of material — a “ moderate ” scale reaction , Harran said , according to a transcript of his interview with Joel E. Aplin and Maurice S. Jurado , deputy fire marshals at UCLA , that was obtained by C&EN through a public records act request .
Using information from the notes and reports from the UCLA fire marshal , UCLA Fire Department , UCLA Police Department , UCLA Environmental Health & Safety Office ( EH&S ) , Los Angeles City Fire Department , and California Division of Occupational Safety & Health ( Cal / OSHA ) , also obtained through public records requests , C&EN has tried to put together as detailed an account as possible of what happened to Sangji that day .
Sangji was working on a nitrogen manifold in a fume hood in a lab on the fourth floor of UCLA ’s Molecular Sciences Building .
She had titrated the tBuLi twice to determine its concentration — 1.69 M — and needed 159.5 mL of the reagent to react with 9.0 mL of vinyl bromide .
She was drawing up the tBuLi in roughly 50 - mL aliquots in a 60 - mL plastic syringe equipped with a 1.5 - inch , 20 - gauge needle .
For unknown reasons , the syringe plunger came out of the barrel and the tBuLi was exposed to the atmosphere .
Although it was n’t part of her experiment , an open flask of hexane was also in the hood and Sangji knocked it over .
The tBuLi ignited and the solvent caught fire , as did Sangji ’s clothes .
She was wearing nitrile gloves , no lab coat , and no one remembers if she was wearing eye protection .
Although there was a safety shower in the lab , Sangji did not use it .
Instead , Wei­feng Chen , a postdoctoral researcher in Harran ’s group who was cleaning up one of the lab ’s benches , wrapped a lab coat around Sangji to try to put out the fire .
“ She was screaming and was moving around and I was attempting to wrap her tightly , ” Chen told Cal / OSHA Investigator Ramon Porras .
Chen abandoned the lab coat when it started burning .
He then started pouring water on Sangji from a nearby sink , while she sat on the floor .
Hui Ding , a postdoctoral researcher in an adjacent lab , heard Sangji screaming .
He went into the lab and saw Chen trying to put out the fire .
Ding also saw that “ the tip of the reagent bottle was positioned sideways and was also on fire , ” he told Porras .
Ding returned to his lab and called 911 , then checked on Chen and Sangji again before going to get Harran from his office on the floor above .
When Ding returned to the lab with Harran , Harran saw that Sangji ’s hands , torso , and neck were burned .
“ Her clothing from the waist up was largely burned off and large blisters were forming on her abdomen and hands — the skin seemed to be separating from her hands , ” he told Porras in an e-mail .
Sangji was conscious , asking for more water , where emergency responders were , and for someone to call her roommates .
When Harran heard sirens , he went down to the road to tell the emergency personnel where they needed to go .
UCLA police dispatch recorded the 911 call at 2:54 PM as an “ unknown type chemical fire . ”
Emergency crews were dispatched at 2:57 PM , and Christopher Lutton , a UCLA deputy fire marshal ; a fire engine ; and emergency medical personnel arrived at the building at 3:01 PM .
Lutton donned full protective gear and went up to the lab to assess the situation , with dispatch recording at 3:06 PM that the fire was out upon arrival .
Lutton cleared the other emergency responders to go up to the lab .
Once medical personnel arrived , Sangji was put on a rolling chair and moved under the safety shower for decontamination .
She was then transported to UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center .
From there she was transferred to Grossman Burn Center , in Sherman Oaks , Calif. , where she died on Jan. 16 .
Harran told Cal / OSHA and fire marshal investigators that the lab generally follows Aldrich Technical Bulletin AL - 134 for handling air - sensitive reagents .
The bulletin first recommends heating glassware in an oven to eliminate any adsorbed moisture , then cooling it in an inert atmosphere .
Sangji refers in her notebook to using flame - dried flasks and the syringe found at the scene was plastic .
Additionally , if a researcher is using a syringe to transfer the reagent , the bulletin says to use a 1 - to 2 - foot - long needle .
The Cal / OSHA report says that Sangji ’s was 1.5 inches .
The Aldrich bulletin also recommends pressurizing the reagent bottle with high - purity dry nitrogen such that the pressure in the bottle pushes out the syringe plunger .
“ The plunger should not be pulled back since this tends to cause leaks and create gas bubbles , ” the bulletin says .
But Harran told fire marshal investigators that he prefers not to pressurize the bottle to push out the material .
“ I find that a little dangerous because then it can jump on you , ” he told Aplin and Jurado .
Harran said that he favors using a nitrogen line with a bubbler , under enough N 2 pressure so that as he withdraws the syringe plunger to pull in reagent , the bubbler keeps going .
“ Aldrich recommends regulating the inert gas to about 3 to 5 psi to pressurize the bottle , ” says Mark Potyen , a R&D scientist at Sigma - Aldrich .
“ Through a 16 - gauge needle , the largest Aldrich recommends , the movement of the plunger is manageable and is a safer technique than pulling the plunger of the syringe to use the reduced pressure in the syringe to draw up the material . ”
This is partially why Aldrich recommends glass rather than plastic syringes , Potyen says , because pressure at 3 to 5 psi cannot push up a plastic syringe plunger .
Aldrich also recommends using a syringe that is twice the volume that you intend to deliver and advises against reusing syringes for multiple transfers , Potyen says , since a dirty syringe could result in a locked - up barrel .
For amounts larger than 50 mL , Aldrich advocates that researchers transfer the reagent by cannulating , or using a double - tipped needle to transfer the reagent under pressure from the bottle into a sealed graduate cylinder , then again from the cylinder into the reaction flask .
“ I would have preferred that [ Sangji ] had done the cannula technique , ” Harran told Aplin and Jurado .
“ We use both methods in the laboratory . ….
I do n’t know if she had done the cannulation technique previously , so she may have been repeating the procedure that she had done simply on a larger scale . ”
Although Harran told Cal / OSHA
Investigator Porras that he talked with Sangji on the morning of Dec. 29 about what she planned to do that day , he did not indicate whether they discussed specific experimental procedures .
Looking at what actually went wrong with Sangji ’s experiment , there is not enough information available to say for certain .
In the materials obtained by C&EN , no one documented the state of the hood immediately after the accident .
And although Fire Marshal Lutton took photographs of the scene , he did so after fire officials asked Harran to shut down the experiment to ensure that the hood was safe .
Postdoc
Ding noted that , when he first entered the lab , a reagent bottle was sideways and on fire — but he did not say whether that was the tBuLi bottle or the hexane flask .
If it was the tBuLi bottle , and it was not clamped as specified by the Aldrich bulletin , it could have been a clue that perhaps Sangji , using a needle too short for the reagent bottle , had upended the bottle in one hand while trying to handle a 60 - mL syringe with the other , and things went awry from there .
Alternatively , although Harran told C&EN in an interview in May that he remembered that the bubbler on the nitrogen manifold was active when he later returned to the lab and shut down the experiment , he could n’t recall if the port to the tBuLi bottle was open .
Perhaps Sangji had simply forgotten to turn on the gas to the bottle , then pulled too hard on the syringe plunger , not realizing that she was fighting a lack of pressure in the bottle .
Other possibilities include that the tBuLi reacted with moisture in the undried syringe , or with air that got into the syringe while Sangji was pulling up the reagent .
Or Sangji was on her second or third transfer with a used syringe , it locked up , and she tried to release it .
Last but not least , since she was using a 60 - mL syringe for 50 mL or more of tBuLi , perhaps she simply overshot while pulling out the plunger .
Los Angeles Fire Department investigators were able to speak briefly with Sangji at the emergency room , where she told them that “ she pulled the plunger out too far , the plunger came out of the housing of the syringe , and the chemical spilled out and flashed . ”
She also told them about the spilled hexane .
But UCLA fire marshal investigators never spoke with Sangji , despite being told on Jan. 6 that she could be interviewed .
Sangji ’s family also did not discuss the incident with her while she was in the hospital , says her sister , Naveen Sangji , because they were trying to stay focused on the positive and “ we thought we had all the time in the world to get to the unpleasant stuff . ”
Whether Sangji should have been doing the experiment under closer supervision is an open question .
Both Harran and Kevin S. Reed , UCLA ’s vice chancellor for legal affairs , have said in written statements that Sangji was an experienced chemist .
Sangji graduated from Pomona College in May 2008 with a bachelor ’s degree in chemistry .
While at Pomona , she spent three years working for chemistry professor Daniel O’Leary doing peptide chemistry .
Neither of her published papers involves alkyllithium or similarly hazardous reagents ( Org. Lett. 2005 , 7 , 5721 ; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006 , 128 , 7754 ) .
After graduating from Pomona , Sangji went to work at Norac Pharma , in Azusa , Calif .
Daniel Levin , president of Norac Pharma , says that , although he can’t disclose the specific chemistry Sangji did for the company , she did not work with pyrophoric materials .
He adds that , although he thought Sangji had more research experience than average for a chemist with a bachelor ’s degree , she was still closely supervised in both the planning and execution of her experiments at the company .
Lab workers “ have to have the mind - set that something can always go wrong . ”
At UCLA , Harran told Aplin and Jurado that Sangji had trained with an unnamed postdoctoral fellow who had done the tBuLi procedure multiple times .
Sangji “ had executed it successfully , I think three times , previously , ” Harran said .
But UCLA has no evidence that Sangji used tBuLi more than once before the day of the incident , says university spokesperson Carol Stogsdill .
“ However , her résumé and work history show that she was familiar with pyrophorics — and , importantly , the techniques we use to handle t- butyllithium are common to those employed when handling a wide range of air - and / or moisture - sensitive chemicals , ” Stogsdill says .
Sangji “ had prior experience with those techniques and was further trained in them in Dr. Harran ’s lab . ”
Because Sangji was an employee rather than a graduate student , Cal / OSHA investigated the incident ; as a result of the investigation Cal / OSHA fined the university $ 31,875 ( C&EN , May 11 , page 7 ) .
The agency cited the UCLA chemistry and biochemistry department for lack of training ; failure to document training ; failing to correct unsafe laboratory conditions and work practices identified in an Oct. 30 , 2008 , inspection of Harran ’s lab ; and failing to ensure that employees wore appropriate personal protective equipment ( PPE ) , such as lab coats .
On the training front , prior to the incident , the UCLA EH&S office conducted general laboratory safety training at the beginning of every quarter , while principal investigators provided laboratory - specific training .
Having started in mid-October , Sangji missed the EH&S training and would have been expected to attend in January , says James Gibson , director of EH&S .
Neither Chen nor Ding had received general safety training from EH&S , either — Chen started at UCLA on Oct. 10 , 2008 , and Ding told Cal / OSHA investigator Porras in January that he had been at UCLA for four months .
Harran and UCLA maintain that all researchers had the laboratory - specific training needed to perform their work safely .
EH&S now provides general safety training monthly , and researchers cannot receive keys to their labs until the training is complete , Gibson says .
UCLA has also now purchased flame - resistant lab coats for researchers using flammable reagents .
The October laboratory inspection was the first for the Harran lab since the group had moved to UCLA from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center on July 1 , 2008 .
Several of the violations described in the inspection report involve things that could be due to differences in Texas versus California law .
The report notes that gas cylinders were not properly restrained , for example , and California requires that gas cylinders have two straps whereas Texas requires only one .
Other violations flagged in the inspection include keeping more than 10 gal of flammable solvents outside of the flammable storage cabinets , and that lab researchers were not wearing PPE .
UCLA ’s standard practice is to correct such deficiencies at the time of the inspection and in a Nov. 5 , 2008 , e-mail to Harran , UCLA Chemical Safety Officer Michael Wheatley says that the lab “ was able to correct some deficiencies on the spot , ” although he does n’t specify what those were .
But in the aftermath of the incident Cal / OSHA investigators again flagged flammable solvent storage and PPE issues , noting that photos of the lab taken after the incident showed approximately 14 gal of flammable liquids inside a hood , and Sangji was not wearing a lab coat .
Generally , UCLA rules at the time gave Harran 30 days to correct the deficiencies .
In that Nov. 5 e-mail , Wheatley asked Harran to set up a time to go over the report .

Harran replied on Nov. 12 , asking if the meeting could wait until his group moved out of their temporary labs and into their permanent location , which was still under construction .
“ Our labs on four are overcrowded and disorganized , ” Harran wrote .
“ I was n’t planning to be in temporary space for this long .
We should be moving soon . ”
“ That should be no problem , ” Wheatley responded .
The labs did not relocate until early January .
Gibson says that UCLA historically has inspected labs once a year , and new labs were simply added to the cycle without necessarily getting additional support from EH&S officers during the setup period .
UCLA is considering how to remedy that gap , Gibson says .
Gibson also says that , although the incident occurred over the winter holiday for the university and administrative offices were closed , UCLA expects that research labs will generally be open 365 days per year .
The California State Fire Marshal Arson Bomb Investigation Division reviewed the information collected by UCLA fire marshal investigators and concluded that the incident was an accident and closed the case .
Although UCLA requested that the California Office of the State Fire Marshal review the Aldrich - recommended syringe procedure to see whether it meets the fire - code requirements for a closed system for a solid or liquid hazardous material , the state fire marshal declined to consider the matter , says Ernie Paez , chief of the South Fire & Life Safety Division of the Office of the State Fire Marshal .
Cal / OSHA is reviewing the incident , as is standard for a case involving a fatality , to determine whether to forward its findings to the Los Angeles district attorney ’s office to evaluate whether criminal prosecution is warranted .
UCLA has withdrawn its appeal of Cal / OSHA ’s citations ( C&EN , June 29 , page 30 ) .
Sangji ’s family has been very unhappy with how the various investigations have gone , Naveen Sangji says .
She notes that , except for Cal / OSHA Investigator Porras , everyone else directly involved in investigating the incident was a UCLA employee .
She also questions Cal / OSHA ’s thoroughness , given that the Cal / OSHA report says Sangji was syringing 20 mL of tBuLi , not three 50 - mL aliquots .
“ We feel like we ’ve gotten nowhere with the state agencies and the university , ” Naveen says .
“ We think it ’s time for the district attorney to step in and figure out what ’s going on .
We want to know who was responsible and who failed in their duties to make sure Sheri was safe at work , and those people should answer for their failures . ”
The family wrote to the American Chemical Society on July 6 , asking the society to issue a public statement reprimanding Harran for disregarding the safety of his researchers , and to demand full disclosure of the events of the day .
In her July 17 response to the letter , Madeleine Jacobs , executive director and chief executive officer of ACS , which publishes C&EN , writes that “ issuing a rebuke to a specific individual or individuals is not an option consistent with our role .
There are entities , such as Cal / OSHA , which investigate and apportion blame in these circumstances , and we are obliged to respect their oversight role . ”
Jacobs adds that “ there may be an opportunity for ACS to develop a statement that highlights the tragedy of deaths such as Sheri’s as compelling examples of the need for stronger safety practices in academic laboratories . ”
Anna Davis , who is approaching her first anniversary as a research scientist working on catalyst discovery for water - soluble polymers at Dow Chemical , agrees that academic lab safety could be improved .
She says that safety at Dow is generally much more a part of the laboratory culture than in the academic institutions at which she ’s worked .
Davis received her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley and did postdoctoral research at Northwestern University .
“ I was fortunate to work for professors that took safety seriously , ” Davis says , “ But I think that the culture varies too much from one research group to another ” in academia , and consequences are minimal when something bad happens .
In contrast , at Dow it ’s emphasized from day one that , no matter what your job is or where you work , safety is a job expectation and is a critical part of your job performance , Davis says .
When asked whether the emphasis on safety is a deterrent to being open and honest when things go wrong in the lab , Davis responds : “ You ’re certainly going to get in trouble if you ’re lax about safety here .
But I think that if you do an earnest job of trying to follow safety practices , then no , I would n’t say that you ’re afraid to discuss a near miss or an accident . ”
Sangji ’s death has inspired at least some members of the academic chemistry community to take stock of the safety procedures in their labs .
Robert M. Waymouth , a chemistry professor at Stanford University , works in the area of organometallic chemistry and catalysis .
Although Waymouth typically spends part of every group meeting discussing safety issues that come up in his group , news of the UCLA fire inspired a meeting devoted entirely to talking about what was known about the incident and whether any lab procedures should be changed , Waymouth says .
In keeping with federal OSHA lab standards , certain things in his lab have always had trigger points — for example , using more than 500 mL of an extremely flammable solvent like diethyl ether — that require an explicit risk assessment .
In those cases , the researcher doing the experiment must fill out a form and go over it with someone else , to explain what they ’re doing and why and to review the appropriate safety procedures if something goes wrong .
And everyone in the lab is informed of the experiment so the group knows what ’s going on .
That protocol now applies to any reaction involving tBuLi .
The group ’s lab - safety manual has also been revised to contain more explicit directions regarding use of PPE , Waymouth says .
Waymouth emphasizes that evaluating safety risks needs to be a constant and ongoing thing .
Safety should n’t be something done at a training seminar and then forgotten , he says .
Faculty “ need to make sure that there ’s an awareness in the real day - to - day environment about what ’s the best way to do things safely , ” he says .
“ You need to establish a safety environment where people can encourage others to have safe practices and not be embarrassed about it . ”
And just as essential , lab workers “ have to have the mind - set that something can always go wrong , ” Waymouth says .
“ If you have thought about it beforehand , you will be more prepared to deal with it .
If you ’re surprised , then it is more difficult to respond rationally .
A prepared mind is the most important safety attitude that you can have . ”
Tom Welton , head of the department of chemistry at Imperial College London , would agree .
Risk assessments in the U.K. started to become part of the research culture there about 20 years ago — when Welton was a postdoctoral researcher — after an incident at the University of Sussex .
A third - year graduate student at Sussex was distilling a triacetylene under nonstandard conditions , says Anthony McCaffery , a Sussex chemistry professor who was head of his department at the time .
The apparatus exploded , blowing out a window and embedding a large piece of metal in the student ’s abdomen .
The researcher lost a foot or two of his intestine , if McCaffery recalls correctly , and returned to the school to finish his Ph.D. after recovering from his injury .
The U.K. government had recently created the country ’s Health & Safety Executive to prevent death , injury , and ill health in workplaces .
The Sussex incident was the first case the agency decided to prosecute .
“ I was required to appear in the local Magistrate ’s Court and the County Court to defend the indefensible , since they charged us with failure to carry out a proper risk assessment , which was not a widely accepted procedure in university research at the time , ” McCaffery says .
The university pled guilty and was fined .
The end result for academic chemistry research in the U.K. was that risk assessments have become an integral part of experiments .
The assessments do n’t apply just to chemical reactions but also to equipment such as lasers .
The initial assessments were “ much like some kind of legal record where if we got sued we could say we ’d done this , ” Welton says , but the paperwork has evolved over the years into a simple table that is printed on one side of every page spread in his department ’s lab notebooks — risk assessment on the left , experimental notes on the right .
“ Twenty years ago , it was very much about a legal defense should it be necessary , ” Welton says .
“ Now it is about making the person engage in the risk management of what they ’re doing . ”
Chemistry students in the U.K. start doing risk assessments in their very first undergraduate lab , so the process is second nature by the time they get their bachelor ’s degree , Welton says .
He adds that the training is critical not just from a safety perspective , but also for future employment .
“ If we do n’t train students in risk management and safety procedures , then we ’re not training them for employment in modern industry , ” Welton says .
“ If we want someone to turn up in a job and be productive , they ca n’t do that if they ’re not safety aware . ”
UCLA has made significant changes to its health and safety program in the aftermath of Sangji ’s death , beyond fixing the specific issues identified by Cal / OSHA .
UCLA laboratory safety inspections have been standardized and expanded .
Items identified as critical — for example , missing or inoperable fire extinguishers or eyewash stations , or lack of PPE — must be corrected within 48 hours ; other deficiencies , within 30 days .
Gibson ’s office is working to develop a computer system that will streamline much of the inspection process .
University research labs are also now required to quantify chemical , biological , and other hazards ; to assess risks based on laboratory activities ; specify appropriate PPE ; and train all lab personnel in the appropriate use of PPE for their experiments .
And if a lab balks at any point ?
Chancellor Gene Block “ has made it very clear in his communications that EH&S has the authority to shut down labs , and we take that responsibility very seriously , ” Gibson says .
If a lab is shut down , it ca n’t reopen until the professor appears before the university ’s newly formed safety committee and provides an action plan to improve safety in the lab .
The safety committee recently issued its first report to the chancellor .
It said that UCLA still has more to do to develop a top - down culture of safety consciousness and suggests that reward systems should be developed to encourage compliance with safety procedures in labs .
It also says that the university needs to increase accountability and oversight , improve and expand outreach and training , improve laboratory design , and improve inventory and record keeping .
As UCLA works to develop a new safety culture on campus , it needs to watch that an adversarial relationship does n’t build up between researchers and EH&S officers , says Rick L. Danheiser , a chemistry professor and chair of his department ’s safety committee at Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
MIT has twice won the ACS Division of Chemical Health & Safety ’s College & University Health & Safety Award , in 1991 and again in 2005 .
In Danheiser ’s opinion , the key to his department ’s success in developing a safe laboratory environment is that the department recruited graduate students and postdocs to help develop the policies and procedures that they would be expected to follow .
“ Everything is done in groups that involve the faculty and graduate student or postdoctoral researchers so that all regard it as an enterprise that we are all involved in , ” Danheiser says .
“ In my experience that ’s really important in ensuring that there ’s full compliance . ”
This approach includes having faculty and student members of the safety committee participate in unannounced laboratory inspections twice a year .
Having that self - inspection component also helps prevent adversarial relationships from developing between researchers and safety officials , Danheiser says .
When Danheiser talks to new students and postdocs joining his lab , he emphasizes to them that it is their responsibility to evaluate whether or not they are comfortable performing an experiment .
“ I expect them to be able to make the determination whether they are certain they have enough knowledge and experience to do an experiment safely , ” Danheiser says .
If not , then they need to seek assistance from others in the group , him , the department safety coordinator , or even from MIT EH&S .
Danheiser adds that one issue of concern at MIT has involved postdocs who were trained in other countries and thus are used to a different laboratory culture .
“ It ’s sometimes more difficult to retrain them to follow the rules we have , as compared to a beginning graduate student , ” Danheiser says .
In those cases , it ’s not only important to have the faculty adviser make the rules clear , but also to have a culture that reinforces them through peer pressure in the lab , Danheiser says .
“ If the great majority of people enthusiastically comply with the safety program and support it and understand why all of the rules are in place to protect people , then they can police themselves . ”
One of the challenges in lab safety is that the lab setting becomes very familiar to people who work in it day in and day out .
“ When you do something over and over , your perception of the risk may change even though the risk itself does n’t change , ” says Lawrence M. Gibbs , associate vice provost for EH&S at Stanford .
His department tries to use information about incidents to remind researchers not to get too comfortable .
In that way , hopefully something positive can come out of Sangji ’s death .
“ It was a tragic , tragic incident , ” Gibbs says .
“ We all have to learn from it and use it as reinforcement to help people understand the potential risks of working with high - hazard materials in this environment .
( CNN ) -- Elizabeth McCutchen and a friend were walking to book club two weeks ago in quaint Farmville , Virginia , when they strolled by a home on First Avenue .
" Something smells dead , " her friend said .
Richard Samuel McCroskey has been arrested in connection with the killings of four people in Virginia .
They were thinking animal .
A dog , a cat , something like that .
They never imagined they were smelling the remains of massacred humans .
It was Thursday , September 17 .
But another 24 hours would pass before police made the gruesome discovery .
Richard Samuel McCroskey III -- a 20 - year - old rapper in the underground genre of " Horrorcore " who sang of chopping people into pieces -- has been arrested in connection with the slayings .
The crime scene was so horrifying police would not even describe it , saying only that the victims died of blunt force trauma .
The victims were Mark Niederbrock , 50 , the beloved pastor at Walker 's Presbyterian Church ; his 16 - year - old daughter , Emma Niederbrock ; Melanie Wells , Emma 's 18 - year - old friend from West Virginia ; and Niederbrock 's estranged wife , Debra Kelley , 53 , a professor at Longwood University .
McCroskey has been charged only in the killing of Mark Niederbrock .
Police and the prosecutor 's office did not return repeated phone calls from CNN .
But in late September , authorities said more charges are pending .
Emma was described as a fan of Horrorcore and had met McCroskey through their mutual affection for the little - known music genre .
Police said she invited McCroskey to fly from his northern California home , stay with her in Virginia and then attend the Strictly for the Wicked Festival , a Horrorcore fest in Michigan featuring bands with names like Dismembered Fetus and Phrozen Body Boy .
Nobody saw what would come next .

The latest on the investigation into the Virginia murders on AC360 .
Wednesday , 10 pm ET see full schedule »
The slayings have been the talk of Farmville , a town of 7,000 that is home to Longwood University and nearby Hampden - Sydney College .
Senseless is the word you hear most .
It 's not just the macabre nature of the killings that has people talking .
It 's the grotesque lyrics of the Horrorcore singer ; it 's that it happened under their noses .
McCroskey is a young man with no criminal record who took delight in the blend of horror hip - hop that celebrated macabre killings .
He went by the name Syko Sam .
In one YouTube video , he holds a hatchet and sings about killing people and putting their remains in black bags : " Last night I was the murderous rage .
Now , I gotta get rid of the bodies before the corpses start to get to rotting . "
' Stinkiest rascal I 've ever smelled '
Authorities have not specified when the Virginia killings occurred , but at 4 a.m. on Friday , September 18 , tow - truck driver Elton Napier was called out to Poor House Road to help McCroskey , whose car was stuck .
Napier said McCroskey was wearing a black - hooded sweatshirt and " was really smelling bad , like real bad .
I ca n't describe it . "
McCroskey was driving Mark Niederbrock 's Honda .
Napier said two sheriff 's deputies were at the scene and McCroskey was ticketed for driving without a license .
At the time , authorities did n't know the pastor had been slain .
When McCroskey hopped into Napier 's flatbed , the tow - truck driver said he started gagging from the odor and immediately rolled down the windows .
" I just held my head out the window so the wind would hit me in the face , " he said .
" That was the stinkiest rascal I 've ever smelled . "
Napier drove McCroskey about four miles to a convenience store .
McCroskey told Napier he was visiting his girlfriend and her father lent him the car .
McCroskey fetched a black bag from the Honda before they parted .
Napier went inside to get a cup of coffee .
According to police , McCroskey eventually caught a cab to Richmond International Airport .
By mid-afternoon that same day , police found the bodies at the home on First Avenue .
McCroskey was arrested the next day at the airport , where he had spent the night .
When he was being led to jail , McCroskey told reporters , " Jesus told me to do it . "
Suspect 's family , community grieve
Sarah McCroskey of California told CNN - affiliate WWBT that her brother had been looking forward to his visit to Virginia for weeks .

Europe Banking and Financial System on the Brink of Collapse
We have avoided Armageddon , at least for now .
The cost to the US taxpayer has been a few trillion .
Some in the media are loudly announcing the end of the recession .
But we are not out of the woods yet .
There are a few more bumps in the road .
Actually , some of them are quite steep hills .
As big as the subprime problem ?
Maybe .
When asked a few weeks ago what was my biggest short - term concern , I quickly replied , " European banks have the potential to create significant risk for the entire worldwide system . "
This week we will glance " over the pond " to see what gives me cause for concern .
Then we briefly look at a few of the bumps I mentioned , which are likely to stretch out any recovery , and maybe even dip us back into recession .
But first , a quick announcement .
We are making dramatic changes to my free Accredited Investor E - Letter and service , and will have a new web site and much improved content in a month or so .
But in the meantime , I have just finished a new letter ; and if you sign up at the current site , you will of course get all the new services and benefits when we make the changes , as well as this new letter .
Basically , this service is for accredited investors ( net worth of $ 1.5 million or more ) who are interested in learning more about and investing in alternative funds like hedge funds , commodity funds , and so on .
You will get a call from one of my worldwide partners ( Altegris Investments in the US , Absolute Return Partners in Europe , Nicola Asset Management in Canada , Plexus Asset Management in Africa , and Fynn Capital in Latin America ) and gain access to a lot of information and an easy way to preview what I think is a great line - up of quality funds and managers .
You can go to www.accreditedinvestor.ws and sign up today .
Do n't procrastinate !
And for those of you in the US who are on your way to becoming accredited investors ( but not there yet ) , my friends at CMG have a platform of alternative managers that can be tailored to your specific needs .
You really owe it to yourself to see the managers on their platform .
The link to their form is http://www.cmgfunds.net/public/mauldin_questionnaire.asp.
And now , let 's jump into the letter .
Europe on the Brink
Globalization is a two - edged sword .
On balance , it has brought prosperity to those who have embraced it , with rising lifestyles , better health , longer lives , and more .
The more we need each other , the less likely it is that we 'll shoot each other .
Shooting your customers is not a good business strategy .
And while the growth has not been even or smooth , only a Luddite would want to return to the early 1800s or 1900s , or even 1975 .
The other edge of that sword ?
We are connected in so very many ways , far more than most of the world suspected .
Who thought that insane lending policies at US mortgage banks would bring the world financial system to its knees , increasing unemployment and leading to a global recession ?
World trade is down 20 % or more .
US railroad shipments are down more than 20 % year - over - year .
Chinese ( and Asian ) factories have seen their orders drop , as US consumers have gone on strike .
The US trade deficit was just $ 25 billion last month ; and while our exports are still dropping , our imports are dropping more .
Oil is becoming a bigger and bigger share of imports , and that does not come from Asian exporters .
The US is far and away the country with the largest gross domestic product ( GDP ) .
California would be the 7th largest country , but few think of California in such terms .
For this letter , at least , I would like to think of Europe as a whole rather than as 27 countries .
From that perspective , Europe is as economically important to the world as the US .
What happens in Europe makes a difference in the US .
Last week we looked at the precarious position of Japan , the second largest economy ( or third if you think of Europe as a whole ) .
It was a sobering letter .
When you realize the extent to which Japan has funded Asian expansion , what is happening there cannot be good for the world .
But Europe 's banks have been much more aggressive in funding emerging - market expansion than US or Japanese banks .
Western European banks have lent $ 4.5 trillion to various emerging - market countries , businesses , and consumers .
Many Eastern European businesses borrowed in low - interest - rate euros .
New homeowners in Hungary and the rest of Eastern Europe borrowed in Swiss francs and euros , and as their currencies have collapsed they now find they owe more on their homes than they 're worth .
And here 's the problem .
Europe 's banking system is in far worse shape than the US system .
The losses may be bigger , and their capital to meet those losses is certainly less .
Let 's look at some charts .
Remove sharp objects or pour another adult beverage .
As I noted last week , one of the real benefits of writing this letter is that I get to see a lot of really interesting information from readers and meet with very savvy investment professionals .
I recently had the privilege of sitting with a team of analysts from Hayman Capital here in Dallas .
Hayman runs a global macro hedge fund , so they spend a lot of time thinking about how all the different aspects of the global markets fit together .
This week we again look at some of their analysis .
There was a lot of work ( as in months ) done here ; and Kyle Bass , the founder of the firm , graciously allowed me to share some of it with you ( and kudos to Wes Swank , who pulled this together ) .
The graphs are theirs , and my discussion about them is certainly informed by our meeting ; but I am using the material as a launching point , so they are not responsible for my conclusions and interpretations .
And Then There Was Leverage
In the first few years of the G.W. Bush administration , the banking authorities decided it would be OK to allow five banks to increase their leverage from 12:1 up to 30:1 .
Which five banks , you ask ?
Bear Stearns , Lehman , Merrill Lynch , JPMorgan , and Goldman Sachs .
How did that work out , just five years later ?
Three are gone and two survived with large dollops of taxpayer money .
( Sidebar :
Is it really any surprise that Goldman and JPMorgan are making record profits on the underwriting and trading side of the business ?
Hell , if I could eliminate 50 % of my competition , my profits would grow too !
JPMorgan 's consumer credit , credit card , and other business groups are losing money big - time . )
Thirty times leverage means that if you lose 3.3 % , you wipe out all your capital .
And we watched as banks too big to fail were bailed out with taxpayer dollars .
Slowly , banks are buying time , writing down assets .
Remember , this month is the second anniversary of the onset of the credit crisis .
I wrote back then that the strategy would be to stretch this out as long as possible .
Time heals a lot of bad debts , especially at a 0 % Fed Funds rate .
Banks that are reporting so far this quarter seem to be saying that the write - offs will start to level off in about two quarters , although banking expert Chris Whalen says that the level may stay higher than we think for longer than we think .
There are a lot of assets to write off , and they are just now getting to the commercial real estate problems .
This is going to take time .
( For an interesting interview on CNBC with Maine fishing buddy Chris Whalen , click here : http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/07/christopher-whalen-banking/.)
The point , before we get to Europe , is that here there was a central bank and a government that not only could step in but was willing to .
I know former Treasury Secretary Paulson had his critics , but I am not one of them .
Did he do some things that in hindsight he might like to take a " mulligan " on ?
Sure .
But he dealt with the problems in the best manner he could .
The time to have taken action was when we were making liar and no-doc loans and calling then AAA , or allowing banks to go to 30:1 leverage .
Paulson had to deal with eggs that were already broken .
That the system did not crater is to his credit .
Securitizing what he and everyone else should have known would be garbage while he was head of Goldman Sachs is not to his credit .
But I digress .
I am going to give you four charts showing the leverage of banks in the US , the United Kingdom , the Eurozone , and Switzerland .
The bottom , blue portion is assets to common and preferred stock ; the red is assets to common equity , which can include good will ; and the purple is assets to tangible common equity .
Tangible common equity is all the rage , and that is what the recent " stress tests " measured , as opposed to tier 1 capital , which includes preferred stock ( which would basically be the blue portion . )
TCE only includes common shares .
Now , let 's start with the US .
These graphs show leverage .
The average leverage of tier 1 capital of the five largest banks is in the range of 12:1 , and is actually down from ten years ago .
( By the way , a very good and simple explanation of all this can be found at http://baselinescenario.com/2009/02/24/tangible-common-equity-for-beginners/.)
While the TCE has obviously been rising and taking total leverage to rather lofty levels in the mid-40s , banks are raising capital , and over time leverage will come back down .
It helps if you can borrow money at almost nothing and lend it out at much higher rates .
Now , let 's turn to the United Kingdom .
This is uglier .
Regulators in the UK allowed 20:1 leverage on a regular basis .
It is now almost 40 : and with TCE is around 55 .
The assets of UK banks are about five times as large as UK GDP .
By comparison , for the US the ratio is barely 2:1 .
Think about that for a second .
The UK has banking assets which are five times as large as the annual domestic output of the country .
They also had a housing bubble .
They have their own bailouts to deal with , which are massive and will potentially get much larger .
But at least they have a central bank and government that can try to fix the problems .
But as the commercial says , " But wait , there 's more ! "
Let 's look at the Eurozone .
Leverage is now 35:1 and with TCE is almost 55 .
How did 35:1 work out for the US ?
Given the massive credit problems that Eurozone banks have with emerging markets ( plus Spain 's housing bubble , which is every bit as bad as that of the US ) , will this not end up in wailing and weeping ?
Too Big To Save
And here 's the real issue .
They have no Paulson and Bernanke .
Now some of my Austrian - economist friends will say , " Good , they should all be allowed to die ; " but that is a very cavalier attitude when you start talking about actually increasing the unemployment rate to something like 20 % .
I agree that management should be changed ( as well as the regulators : 35:1 to 1 - really ?
What were they thinking ? ) and shareholders wiped out , but I do not want the system to collapse .
And this is a global risk , not just localized to Ireland or Spain or Austria .
Sure , the pain might be worse in the local region , but we will all feel it .
The European Central Bank , at least as of now , cannot step in and start saving individual banks .
How do you save a Spanish bank and not an Austrian bank ?
Austria 's banks have made large loans to Eastern Europe , in euros and Swiss francs , and are going to have large losses , far more than 3 % , which would wipe out their capital .
But bank assets in Austria are 4 times GDP .
What we have are banks that are too big to save for relatively small Austria .
And for Italy , Spain , Greece , et al .
More on this below .
For now , let 's turn our eyes to Switzerland .
Those Wild and Crazy Swiss
We think of Switzerland as a stodgy , by - the - numbers , clockwork type of banking country .
I have done business with Swiss private bankers , and they are conservative .
But somewhere , somehow , UBS and Credit Suisse ran up a little leverage .
Before the crisis , they were over 40:1 .
And now they 're nearly at a nosebleed - high 70 !
As an aside , I was in Switzerland about two years ago , meeting with some very well - known Swiss , let 's call them dignitaries .
In a very off - the - record conversation , they told me UBS was technically bankrupt .
As it turns out , there were a lot of banks around the world that were technically bankrupt .
Now , the next graph underscores the problem of " too big to save . "
Let 's say the US will eventually pump $ 1 trillion into the banking system ( in taxpayer losses ) .
That is about 7 % of US GDP .
We may not like it , but it does n't stop the game .
US bank assets are only twice US GDP .
Switzerland and Ireland are over 7 times , the UK is over 5 , and the Eurozone is at 4 times .
And so it goes .
Eurozone banks are already reeling from losses from US subprime - related problems .
They are now getting ready to deal with even deeper losses from their own lending portfolios .
If the losses were just 5 % of the portfolio ( an optimistic assumption ) , it would be 20 % of Eurozone GDP .
But each country is responsible for its own banks .
While it is thought Germany will be able to handle its problems , the prognostication for Austria and Italy is not so sanguine .
Italy is already running a massive deficit , and has no central bank to monetize its debt .
The same goes for Portugal , Spain , Greece , and Ireland .
5 % loan losses in Ireland would be 40 % of GDP , the equivalent for my fellow US citizens of about $ 5 trillion .
Where does Europe find a few trillion dollars ?
I was writing in late 2006 that the subprime lending market would end in tears .
And I think the European banking crisis that is on the horizon has the potential to be every bit as big a problem as subprime loans .
The world depended on Europeans banks for much of the lending that allowed for growth and development .
Like their counterparts in the US , they are going to have to reduce their loan portfolios .
Deleveraging is not fun .
It takes time to build up a banking infrastructure that can raise the capital necessary to make and process loans .
A lot of time .
Europe is a big customer of the US and Asia .
Their businesses are going to be hit hard by the lack of capital , which is of course no good for employment , etc .
We are all connected .
What happens in Rome no longer stays in Rome .
Let me reprint a graph from last week .
Burn it into your mind .
The world is going to need to find $ 5 trillion to finance government debt issuance .
And we need to fund private business and consumer debt .
Where is all this money going to come from ?
" If you lend me $ 5 trillion today , I will gladly repay you Tuesday . "
A Positive Third Quarter ?
Those who are calling for the end of the recession are shouting that the third quarter may be positive in terms of GDP .
And that is possible .
But only for statistical and not for fundamental reasons .
For instance , lower imports are a net positive for GDP .
But lower imports mean a weaker economy .
Government spending adds to GDP .
Normally , if the government spends too much , then we get inflation , which is subtracted from nominal GDP to give us real ( after - inflation ) GDP .
But inflation is low and getting lower , so there is not going to be much to subtract from nominal GDP .
Are government spending and massive deficits a sign of fundamental strength ?
It is quite usual for there to be a positive quarter in the middle of a recession .
Watch the fundamentals : industrial production , unemployment , capacity utilization , tax receipts , etc .
When those turn up , or at least level off , the recession is over .
Then we get to the long recovery .
Quick point .
As I have noted , unemployment is at 9.5 % and going to 11 % and hopefully no higher .
Average hours worked per week is at an all - time low .
The number of people working part - time but wanting full - time work is another 7 % !
And that part - time number is rising very rapidly .
When the recovery actually does begin to manifest itself , and it eventually will as we find the New Normal , what do you think employers are going to do ?
Hire new workers ?
Or give their current employees more hours ?
The latter , of course .
This is going to be a long , slow , painful , jobless recovery .
Unemployment is going to remain stubbornly high .
And this Congress wants to raise taxes on small business .
75 % of the " rich " are small businesses .
How do you expand your business in California or New York , where taxes will be over 60 % by the time you add in local taxes ?
We will talk about this next week ; but as a preview , from an economic viewpoint , massively raising taxes in the middle of a recession is about as dumb as you can get .
But it looks like we are headed there .
Green shoots , my foot .
New York and Maine
I 'll head to Maine in early August with youngest son
Trey to fish with my friends and talk economics .
Meanwhile , # 2 daughter Melissa will soon have to have her gall bladder removed .
Amanda gets married next month .
Two more grandchildren ( in addition to the one I had last month ) in the next five months .
Watching # 2 son struggle with a budding family , and getting fewer hours as even the health - care business slows down .
UPS is giving # 1 son fewer hours than he needs .
Life is always interesting with seven kids .
I can remember really struggling as a young entrepreneur in my 20s and 30s .
There were many nights I could n't sleep as I worried about payroll or a bill coming due .
No one gave me a course in basic business .
I had to learn it " on – the – job , " as they say .
It was n't always pretty .
It was a struggle starting out in the ' 70s , but you got up every morning and did your best .
It was not easy .
And now , I watch my kids do the same thing .
It is a struggle for them , too .
It is a reminder how just lucky I am .
I truly feel I am one of the most blessed of men .
Have a great week , and remember that the world will not come to an end .
It is important to find the good in life and enjoy it , even in the midst of the fight .
Somehow , we will all figure out how to Muddle Through together .

22 Jul 09 , 09:04 European Banking and financial system on the brink of collapse
I can only imagine how all these investors and their financial managers can live with themselves , knowing full well that what Abraham Lincoln said : “ I see in the near future a crisis that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country … Corporations have been enthroned , an era of corruption will follow , and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed . ” has actually become a reality .
In another hand the " almost every ecological and social disruption our world currently faces stems ultimately from corporate rule .
In the face of overwhelming corporate power that elects governments which protect corporate interests , we citizens have become profoundly alienated from our own democratic processes .
In our hearts and minds , most of us have abandoned the idea of taking our nation back from the corporations .
Our hopelessness runs deep and wide . "
- Paul Cienfuego
My question to you all owners of the universe is : " Where will your families go once the planet is destroyed , as thousands of species go into extinction ?
Just pondering ...
The researchers took measurements from the fault over two decades
The major 2004 earthquake in Sumatra may have weakened the San Andreas fault , 8,000 km away in California .
This is according to scientists who took measurements from the fault over two decades .
Reporting in the journal Nature , the team found that small " repeating earthquakes " became more frequent as the San Andreas Fault weakened .
This pattern , they say , could help to forecast earthquakes in the future , something that is currently impossible .
The team , led by Taka'aki Taira , of the University of California at Berkeley , studied a section of the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield , which is sometimes called the " earthquake capital of the world " .
The area has long been studied by earthquake researchers and it contains a fixed array of seismometers called the high resolution seismic network .
Dr Taira , who was based at Washington DC's Carnegie Institution when he carried out the work , used measurements from these highly sensitive seismometers , some of which are several kilometres below the Earth 's surface .
It is possible that the strength of faults and earthquake risk is affected by seismic events on the other side of the world
Fenglin Niu , Carnegie Institution
Into Japan 's earthquake zone " The equipment is at depths where the noise level is very low , so it collects very good data , " explained Dr Taira .
He and his team studied repeating earthquakes because they provided a " background frequency " against which changes in the fault could be compared .
" These events happen regularly and the size of the event is about the same , " he told BBC News .
" But after Sumatra , the frequency changed - it increased - but the magnitude decreased .
" That is a signal of the fault weakening ; you only have to push a little bit and the fault fails . "
Fenglin Niu from Carnegie , who also took part in the research , said : " So it is possible that the strength of faults and earthquake risk is affected by seismic events on the other side of the world . "
The 2004 Sumatran earthquake was magnitude 9.3 - one of the strongest on record - and triggered the tsunami that killed more than 220,000 people .
The 30 September 2009 earthquake along the same fault line was measured at magnitude 7.6 .

Who : Margot Tohn of Park It !
NYC : Complete Guide to Parking Garages
What : Comprehensive guide to Manhattan parkingWhere : New York CityWhen : Released in December 2006 Startup Costs : Five figuresWhen Margot Tohn decided to drive her visiting family to a show in New York City , she was n’t expecting to have such a difficult time finding parking .
Being unfamiliar with garage locations was a hassle for them that day , and Tohn knew she could n’t be the only one frustrated with the city ’s notorious parking situation .
“ I thought , ‘ They have books on bathrooms in Manhattan ; there has to be a book on parking , ’ ” says Tohn , 45 .
After spending 21 days researching and personally visiting all 1,100 parking garages in Manhattan , Tohn released the first edition of Park It !
NYC : Complete Guide to Parking Garages in December 2006 .
Now in its third edition , the guide covers everything drivers need to know about parking in the Big Apple , with maps and information about hourly rates , accepted credit cards , clearance height and even the number of spaces in each garage .
Tohn , who worked in corporate marketing for 15 years , runs her business primarily on her own .
And even in the down economy , Park It ! thrives because of the steps
Tohn took early on .
Working from home kept her overhead low , and Tohn was careful to avoid spending on anything that would n’t generate revenue .
In addition , she kept her sample giveaways to a minimum and only hired additional help when doing something herself was too expensive .
Tohn has also successfully packaged Park It !
in other ways , including creating custom editions for businesses to personalize and give out as gifts .
With upcoming plans for an online version and a book for at least one other city , Tohn projects 2009 sales of nearly $ 500,000 .

Ernest Hemingway Was a KGB Spy
According to a new book published by Yale University Press last week called " Spies : The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America , " Ernest Hemingway was a spy on the KGB 's payroll during the 1940s , working in Cuba under the codename " Argo . " " Spies , " cowritten by John Earl Haynes , Harvey Klehr , and Alexander Vassiliev , is based on Vassiliev 's notes as a former KFB officer that he made after getting access to Stalin 's intelligence records in the 90s .
While Hemingway took Soviet money and promised to do his best , he never managed to give the Russians any significant information and was cut from the Soviet ranks by the end of the decade after failing to turn over any " political information " ( help them find higher placed people who could be turned ) or become " verified " ( kill anyone or commit treason ) .*** Here 's the KGB summary on " Argo , " taken from the " Spies " excerpt on Hemingway reprinted in the National Review " Argo " - Ernest Hemingway ( Ernest Hemingway ) , year of birth : 1898 , born in Duke Park , Illinois ( USA ) , American citizen , secondary education , a writer .
During the First War of Imperialism , he was a correspondent in the French and Italian armies ' medical units .
Our meetings with " Argo " in London and Havana were conducted with the aim of studying him and determining his potential for our work .
Throughout the period of his connection with us , " Argo " did not give us any polit .
information , though he repeatedly expressed his desire and willingness to help us .
" Argo " has not been studied thoroughly and is unverified .
We have a material password for renewing ties with " Argo .
"
In 1937 , while in Spain , " Argo " wrote in defense of the Popular Front in his articles and appealed for help for Republican Spain , sharply criticizing isolationists in Congress and the U.S. State Department .
" Argo " insisted that the U.S. lift the embargo on the importation of arms into Repub .
Spain ... In 1941 , before he left for China , " Argo " was recruited for our work on ideological grounds by " Sound . "
Contact was not established with " Argo " in China .
In Sept. 1943 , when " Argo " was in Havana , where he owned a villa , our worker contacted him and , prior to his departure for Europe , met with him only twice .
In June 1943 , the connection with " Argo " was once more renewed in London , where he had gone as an Amer. correspondent with the Allied Army in the field for the magazine " Colliers . "
This connection was soon interrupted , b/c " Argo " left for France .
When " Argo " returned to Havana from France in April 1945 , we met with him once .
We could not maintain a connection with " Argo " in view of our worker 's urgent summons out of the country .
Since then , there have been no attempts to establish a connection with " Argo . " *** Tense negotiations are currently underway with the Cuban government to make Hemingway 's moldering Cuban archives available online , including a rejected epilogue to " For Whom the Bell Tolls , " coded letters about hunting for U - boats off the Cuban coast during WWII , and love letters to Marlene Dietrich .
Revelations that Hemingway was working for Stalin may curtail turning his farm at Finca Vigia into a national landmark for either country .
Curiously , during the last Presidential election , both Barack Obama AND John McCain listed Hemingway 's " For Whom the Bell Tolls " as their favorite novel Ernest Hemingway : still making headlines , still playing both sides .
Noticed this a few days ago :
It ’s in China .
A ) How the Hades did they build themselves what appears to be a Nimitz - class super carrier ?
B ) Why , um , did they build it in a pond ?
James McAllister , a 56 - year - old Lutheran minister in the midwest , was working on his sunday sermon one Thursday afternoon last summer .
It was n't going well .
The reverend was n't suffering from writer 's block — in fact , he was crafting quite an elegant parable about " the importance of making our whole lives a prayer . "
No , the problem was bigger than that .
The sermon skated around a private truth that McAllister could no longer deny .
McAllister has learned that you can tell inspirational stories , grounded in social justice and tolerance and peace , without having to bring God into the picture — and this sermon was a masterful case in point .
A woman in his congregation had recently dropped everything to care for her cancer - stricken daughter , and that selfless commitment was sacred in its way .
" You can see how I cook the books a little bit to make it easier to look in the mirror , " he says of his sermons .
" But there are times when I get that sort of empty feeling in my stomach , like I 'm a fraud . "
Months ago , McAllister , who is presented pseudonymously here , took his crisis to the bishop .
He 'd lost the faith , he explained , and he wanted out .
" Oh you 're not quitting , " she said , waving her hand dismissively .
" You have n't lost your faith . "
" Um , yeah I have , " McAllister said .
" This is for real . "
The bishop shook her head .
For the church elders , McAllister 's revelations simply did not compute .
" They 're either in complete denial , " he says , " or they 're completely comfortable with the idea that they have a pastor who 's a fraud , as long as he puts asses in the seats . "
McAllister took the issue up with his psychiatrist .
" It emerged that she was a devout Christian herself , " he says .
" To her credit , she tried to be professional . "
Where she had once begun and ended their sessions with prayer , she stopped when he asked her to .
" But I could see she was squirming .
You know , she was sitting with a man of the cloth who had lost it .
She had problems with that . "
To be a clergyman struggling with God in modern times is to reside at the center of a great battle .
At a time when the tension between faith and doubt arguably defines the distance between people more than does or race or even , the Doubting Priest bears witness for the defense and the prosecution .
( Mother Teresa 's grave doubt , as revealed last fall in her letters , means one of two things :
Either the closest thing to a modern saint was a phony , or her trials actually make her religious life more meaningful , a poignant example of faith not as a certainty but as a required test that leads to a more profound commitment . )
The spiritual struggles of ministers and priests and rabbis remind us that , amid encroaching fundamentalism , atheism is also on the rise .
The neo - atheist movement is fueled by outspoken academics and intellectuals including Richard Dawkins , Christopher Hitchens , and others who bombard the airwaves and bestseller lists with their calls for deconversion .
You can now send your kid to an atheist summer camp or get yourself certifiably " de- baptized . "
( Britain 's national Secular Society offers the service : " Liberate yourself from the original mumbo jumbo that liberated you from the original sin you never had . " )
There are hundreds of college - campus groups devoted to secular humanism .
The Atheist Alliance International reports " so many speaking requests that leaders of national atheist groups can't keep up . "
Even amid the neo - atheist din , a clergy member 's crisis of faith stands out .
The natural order of things is upset when those entrusted with the protection of souls lose the plot .
Because the clergy 's livelihood and public are intimately bound up with their faith , practical considerations can be just as pressing as theological doubt .
And the split between private beliefs and public sermons can leave religious leaders feeling deeply inauthentic , a source of psychic that most laypeople will never know .
Many soul - searching clergy never leave the church , making the ranks of ordained agnostics and atheists impossible to tally .
But the raw numbers are n't much on the minds of clergy actually in the throes of deconversion .
Their doubt is as real and immediate as a cloud over the sun .
And somewhere in the nest of questions is a simple one : How did this happen ?
McAllister had been raised Catholic , then drifted into a 25 - year interregnum where he stopped going to church and called himself an atheist .
A spiritual restlessness nudged him into chaplaincy training years ago .
A second - minister — for most of his life he was a graphic designer and a fine artist —
McAllister approaches the Big Questions more in the manner of a scholar than of a monk .
( Even as a Catholic grade - school kid , he recalls , he hungered for real evidence .
" Why , " he would ask the nuns , " did this stuff all happen so long ago before there were cameras and TVs ?
Why are n't there prophets and holy people and miracles now ? " )
Frustrated with his denomination but by no means ready to bail out , he picked up Sam Harris 's book The End of Faith .
He found he " agreed with about 98 percent of it . "
He picked up other books in the neo - atheist canon .
He read Richard Dawkins 's The God Delusion , and then the one - two punch of Christopher Hitchens 's mega - bestselling God Is Not Great and Sam Harris 's Letter to a Christian Nation .
He closed the latter book and found himself saying , aloud , " Amen . "
He had to face his misgivings .
" I realized , it is n't just that I 'm hurt by the way I was treated at synod , and it is n't just that the senior pastor that I work with was an asshole .
It 's that I do n't believe in this anymore .
And that was terrifying . "
McAllister is not just scared for himself .
" I know that my parishioners look to me for comfort , " he says .
" They 're coming to the end of their life and they want some assurance that it 's all going to be OK .
I have sat at the deathbed of people in my congregation and told them what I regard as lies — or , at least — just to give them comfort .
I 'm willing to do that up to a point , but not for the rest of my working life . "
Then there 's the practical dimension .
McAllister owes the church $ 18,000 for his schooling , at the same time as he 's trying to put his last son through college .
" I 'm 56 , which is n't a real good age to be pounding the pavement , and I 've got a master 's of divinity , not the most marketable degree in the world . "
Richard Dawkins is convinced that McAllister 's situation is common ; in fact , he hopes one day to address it through " clergyman - retraining scholarships , " set up through his charitable foundation , to " bridge the gap between living a lie and getting a new life , " as he puts it .
McAllister 's dilemma is familiar to Dan Barker , who coheads the Madison , Wisconsin - based Freedom From Religion Foundation ( FFRF ) .
The group spreads the word about atheism and fights legal battles to keep church and state separate .
It is a soft place to land for the doubters who find it .
Barker daily receives e-mails and letters from people who are wrestling with issues of faith , and he always writes back promptly and cheerily .
E-mails from clergy are a very small part of the mix .
But of all the stories he hears , these are the ones that resonate most — because they are his story , too .
Barker was a religious prodigy .
Raised attending a Pentecostal church near Disneyland , he received " the call " at age 15 , and wasted no time spreading the good news .
He converted his high - school Spanish teacher .
He became part of an evangelical team that went door - to - door holding revival meetings .
He penned and performed popular Christian jingles .
But after a milestone birthday , number 30 , came and went in 1979 , Barker found himself agitated .
Creatively , he was stalled ; he was having trouble working on a Christian musical about a lost lamb , " because , " he explains , " my views were changing while I was trying to write it . "
The restlessness , he determined , was spiritual .
" It was as if there was a little knock on my skull and somebody was saying , ' Hello !
Anybody home ? '
I was starving and did n't know it , like when you work hard on a project and forget to eat and do n't know you are hungry until you are really hungry . "
He began reading widely outside the Christian canon : science magazines , psychology , .
It was the liberal - arts he never had , and what followed was " a slow but steady migration across the theological spectrum " that took about five years .
( Among the deeply faithful , doubt is often first stoked with exposure to the " outside world . " )
As he carried on a secret life of secular reading , Barker phased out the fire - and - brimstone sermons .
" But even then I felt hypocritical , often hearing myself mouth words about which I was no longer sure , but words that the audience wanted to hear . "
The confirmation , as Barker interpreted it , came one night in November , as he lay on a burlap cot in a church in a Mexican border town where he'd come to give a guest sermon .
As he peered out at a splash of stars , Barker had a sudden profound sensation that had nothing to do with intellect , the kind of deeply felt moment more commonly associated with finding God than losing Him .
He was , Barker understood , utterly alone here .
" For my whole life there had been this giant eyeball looking at me , this god , this holy spirit , this church history , and this Bible .
And not only everything I did but everything I thought was being judged : Was God pleased ?
I realized that that was n't there anymore .
It occurred to me , ' I own these thoughts .
Nobody knows what I 'm thinking right now .
There 's no of hell , no fear of judgment , I do n't have to be right or wrong , I can just be me . ' "
It felt as if charges had been dropped for a for which he had been falsely accused .
It was exhilarating and frightening all at once .
" When you 're ready to jump out of an airplane to skydive , you can be terrified but excited at the same time , " he says .
" There 's a point where you go , all right , let 's do this . "
Says Barker : " we surveyed our members some years ago , asking them : " If you were raised religious , why did you change your mind ? "
There was no one answer .
Some people gave social reasons : the way the church treats women .
Some people gave reasons like , ' the fear of hell — I just could n't live with that . '
But the answer people gave more often than any other was that it was intellectual : Religion eventually just did not make sense . "
Looking back , Tom Reed , a former Roman Catholic priest from Mississippi , can pretty clearly identify his own moment of truth .
It followed a quick succession of historical events : the 1968 Vatican statement upholding opposition to birth control and the death of Martin Luther King Jr .
The two events finished off Reed 's faith in the church and his faith in God .
For Reed , deconversion was almost as quick and binary as the flick of a switch .
At a certain point , he says , " it was suddenly clear that the courageous thing to do was to just admit that this is all made up .
" I remember waking up one day saying , I 'm going to practice being an atheist , just move through the day with that in mind .
It had become a part of my being , the idea that God was ultimately responsible for everything that was happening .
Now I proceeded from the assumption that there was no God in the picture . "
It sounds like a coolly rational process , a Jesuitical internal debate tipping forward into certainty .
It was n't .
" It was scary as hell , " Reed says .
" I realized , ' I 'm not going to see my mother and father again . ' "
The sense of cold finality , the impression that one 's prayers are just so many tennis balls served into the ocean :
Such existential issues are a big part of anybody 's crisis of faith .
But for religious leaders , the stakes are raised even further , for faith is no longer a private matter .
" As a clergyman your livelihood is not just a job — it 's a whole theological system that you 'd better be on board with , " says Dick Hewetson , a former Episcopal minister from Minnesota who left the church to do secular work and soon called himself an atheist .
" It hit me during those last couple of years in the pulpit that everything coming out of my mouth was being taken as gospel , " he says .
" I began to think , This is crazy .
If I tell these people something , they believe me .
Remember Jonestown ?
People asked , How could that happen ?
Well , I know how .
I was n't the Jim Jones type , and my people were n't the Jonestown type .
But I was the shepherd and they were the sheep , for sure . "
Charles Templeton , the late Canadian evangelist - turned - journalist , argued that a disjunction between what clergymen say publicly and what they believe privately is so common that serious comes with the territory .
" Most intelligent clergymen preach to the right of their theology , " Templeton wrote in his memoir Farewell to God .
" They are more conservative in the pulpit than they are in private conversation or when a parishioner . "
What eventually happens , as it did for James McAllister , is that sermons become cooler and less dogmatic .
The clergyman , stated Templeton , " is likely to settle for what might best be described as an , do - goodest Christian philosophy . "
Krista
Wren [ name changed ] , who never became a minister only because doors were quietly closed in front of her , tells a tale of spiritual disaffection with an ironic twist .
A minister 's wife from Atlanta and " a flailing Christian for 23 years , " Wren worked with her husband on Pat Robertson 's ministry before leaving to do missionary work in Africa .
She thought of herself as a missionary ; unfortunately for her , no one else did .
At one fund - raising meeting prior to the couple 's African departure , three dozen people gathered around her husband , Tom [ name changed ] , and one said a prayer : " God , anoint Tom to bring forth your word with power !
Let him see miracles as he prays for the people of Africa .
May he lead many to Christ as you empower his words ... "
Then the crowd gathered around her .
She held her breath in anticipation .
" And Dear God , " a woman 's voice said , " please give Krista creative ways to do laundry . "
It was a decisive moment and in a way a portent of the end .
" Maybe I 've not gotten past it because it sums up the mind of many churches and even so many scriptures , " Wren wrote in a recent e-mail to Dan Barker , with whom she had been corresponding .
" Men do great things for God — and women wash their shorts . "
Wren is currently a hairsbreadth away from throwing it all over the side and coming out as an atheist .
But here is the twist :
Her husband became a pastor only because , many years ago , she converted him .
( " And with a great deal of effort . " )
Now she 's heading back across the bridge the other way .
She is virtually certain he wo n't make the trip with her .
What is certain is that their will be tested .
Her disaffection is a subject so delicate she handles it with tongs .
" I 'm hesitant to say too much , but the things that I have said have caused him to look as though his dog just died .
When he learned I was corresponding with Dan — he looked over my shoulder in the middle of an e-mail — the color drained from his face .
He shook his head and said , as he walked out of the room , ' This is just sad . '
Well , part of me thinks it 's sad , and part of me thinks it 's about damn time . "
Barker 's own marriage did not survive his spiritual U - turn .
( His wife , who remains faithful , remarried a Baptist minister . )
And their four children ?
" We both agreed that the children should never have to be in a position where they had to choose sides . "
One son has announced that he does n't believe in God .
One daughter " was going to a Unitarian church for a while , and I think she might be a nominal believer . "
A second daughter " has been a New Agey believer for a while . "
The third daughter is patently , traditionally religious .
Barker seems pleased by the way the kids landed all across the spectrum of belief / disbelief , pixels in a snapshot of .
Religious conversion is often explained in part as an effort to relieve the tension of uncertainty ( " If the decision could be made conscious , " psychiatrist M. Scott Peck once wrote , " I think it would be as if that person said to himself or herself , ' I am willing to do anything — anything — in order to liberate myself from this chaos . ' " )
But letting faith go , in the end , can bring relief , too .
" We tend to ignore how much cognitive effort is required to maintain extreme religious beliefs , which have no supporting evidence whatsoever , " says the evolutionary biologist David Sloan Wilson .
He likens the process to a cell trying to maintain its osmotic pressure .
" You 're trying to pump out the mainstream influences all the time .
You 're trying to maintain this wall , and keep your beliefs inside , and all these other beliefs outside .
That 's hard work . "
In some ways , then , at least for fundamentalists , " growing out of it is the easiest thing in the world . "
In Dan Barker 's journey from fundamentalism to atheism , there were two stages of disillusionment .
First came the loss of faith in the religion ( that is , the loss of faith in the literal word ) , and then came the loss of faith in faith itself .
" The first step is hardest , " he says .
" Because as a fundamentalist , there is no middle ground .
" I remember a pastor telling me that he had a couple of congregants who did n't believe in the historical truth of Adam and Eve .
They thought that Adam and Eve were a metaphor .
I was shocked .
I thought , ' How can you even let them be in your church ?
If parts of the Bible can be allegorized , then anything goes !'
" But I made the leap : OK , the fact that I disagree with these Christians should not be grounds for disfellowshipping them .
That was a hard thing for me to do .
But once I did it , the later flying leaps that I made were easier to take , psychologically , because I 'd already admitted some gray . "
A number of the clergy who have contacted Barker tell of a similar spiritual arc .
It 's as if a kind of psychological algorithm begins to work , with the shedding of illusions proceeding in inevitable , sequential steps , until an outdated belief is pitched with last night 's coffee grounds .
We wake up , if we 're lucky : case closed .
And yet it is not so simple as that .
Carlton Pearson is an example of a clergyman whose spiritual about - face need not end up where neo - atheists say it should .
In the 1980s and early 1990s , Pearson , then a Pentecostal bishop , was among the most prominent and beloved fundamentalist preachers in the American South , heading up a megachurch in Tulsa , Oklahoma , with a loyal congregation 5,000 strong .
But something happened to Pearson as he and his church nosed toward the millennium .
He stopped believing in hell and sin and the literal interpretation of the scriptures .
He was eating dinner in front of the TV with his baby daughter .
On the news , Peter Jennings was revisiting Rwanda , investigating the fallout from that country 's civil war .
The scene was nightmarish : tiny infants , flies in their eyes and hair red from malnutrition groping at the empty breasts of their skeletal mothers .
Carlton looked over at his own plump - faced child , then back at the TV .
These African kids would soon be gone .
Gone where ?
According to his own formal belief system , they were bound for hell .
Somebody , he thought , needs to preach the gospel to these kids right now .
To save them .
And then another thought formed .
" You think I 'm sucking them into hell ?
Carlton , look .
They 're already there . "
This , he thought , is where the pain comes from , all the weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth .
We do it to each other , and to ourselves .
" I saw emergency rooms and courts and jails , " Pearson recalls .
" For the first time in my life , I did not see God as the inventor of hell . "
It was a very different Carlton Pearson who returned to the pulpit .
A lot of things he had been preaching , he told his congregation , were wrong .
The central premise of their faith , the idea , " as my dad used to put it , that ' You gonna be cookin , ' but you ai n't never gonna get done ! ' " was bogus .
There is no eternal damnation .
Almost all of the flock abandoned Pearson , who was officially declared a heretic by the College of Pentecostal Bishops .
Like Dan Barker , Carlton Pearson made a big leap away from literalism .
And that leap set a chain - reaction of new perceptions :
He became much less judgmental , more receptive to people and ideas he had dismissed or discounted .
Unlike Barker 's leap , Pearson 's did not land him in a godless place .
Throughout his trials the transmission signal of the divine , a felt thing , an inarticulable but absolutely bet - the - farm certainty persisted .
And so instead of abandoning God he invented a new theology that he calls the " gospel of inclusion , " and he hung out a new shingle for a church he calls New Dimensions .
It 's a theology that gives everyone , not just avowed Christians , hope of salvation — and spares everyone the eternal fire of hell .
" I believe the logic of God is inerrant , " he says .
" I do n't believe that the letter is .
The logic of God would be love ; the letter of God would be law . "
That Pearson is nominally a Christian seems almost a trivial point .
After he was officially declared a heretic by the College of Pentecostal Bishops , the Unitarian Church of Christ opened its arms to him ; and since it preached an inclusiveness he appreciated , the denomination seemed as good a place as any to hang his hat .
The Unitarian Church is a haven for many an atheist and agnostic , offering the comforting ritual ( hymns are often rewritten with nontheistic lyrics ) and esprit de corps of religion , without the dogma .
Suzanne Paul , a minister to the New Hope Unitarian Universalist congregation in the suburbs of Detroit , was raised Roman Catholic , but could not stop questioning the " logic " of the Bible , and concluded that she was an atheist at age 20 .
She became involved in Judaism through her husband and finally found a niche in New Hope , where she leads holiday celebrations she sorely missed .
" We celebrate Passover , Easter , Yom Kippur , asking , ' What can we learn from this holiday ? '
Yom Kippur , for example , is about and atonement .
We are naturally social animals and like to be with like - minded people .
I enjoy the community aspect of religion but not the theistic end of it . "
It took Suzanne some three decades to openly declare herself an atheist .
" I recognized early that you can clear a room if you say you 're an atheist .
I prefer to identify myself as a humanist . "
Pearson , too , has struggled with when and how to characterize his beliefs .
" I do n't always say this publicly but I 'm starting to feel more free to do so : I do n't necessarily believe in a god , or the God ; I just believe in God . "
Since his new direction , Pearson 's fortunes have plummeted .
Only about a hundred people hear him preach on Sundays at 1 p.m. because they have to wait until the Episcopalians finish their service .
" We 're in a foster - care program , " he says .
And when people approach him and say , " Bishop Pearson , I 'm losing my faith , " he now has a better answer .
" We spend our lives impersonating who we think others want us to be , " he says .
" And we end up as living impostors .
So , when someone comes to me and tells me they 're losing their faith , I congratulate them .
You 're starting to embrace your own thinking self — the essential , immutable , immortal self — as opposed to the accidental criminal you have been made to think you are . "
Doubt , for Carlton Pearson , is n't a sign that one 's faith is evaporating ; it 's just a sign that it 's going underground and changing .
And so there emerges , in the literature of spiritual self - transformation , a kind of parallel canon between the religious conversions and the Dawkins - style deconversions .
It is the idea of the full circle , or the nun-turned - religious scholar Karen Armstrong 's so - called " spiral staircase , " wherein we eventually come back around to our old spiritual position , but at a higher level , from which we see a wider landscape .
It 's the story of the young .
Growing up in Geneva , he watched his parson father become tormented by religious doubt .
This made him reject conventional religious practice , but it sharpened his sense of the importance of some sort of personal spiritual quest , which he regarded as the main issue in the life of everyone over 35 .
The desertion of priests and nuns from the Catholic church since the 1960s seems to be the story of an en masse loss of faith .
" But it can also be seen as a strengthening of faith , " says John Portmann , a professor of religious studies at the University of Virginia , who is working on a book on " cultural Catholicism . "
( By far the most - cited reason for leaving was unrelated to God : It was church policy on celibacy and marriage . )
" If some semblance of faith can persist in spite of all [ the church 's missteps and scandals ] , you know your faith is real , you were n't in it for the trappings of the church or the comfort of the rituals . "
Dan Barker has now been an atheist longer than he was a believer , and he is at peace with his decision .
But for the more recent deconverts , some struggles remain .
Perhaps chief among them is finding a substitute for the very real consolations that faith provided .
When you 've lost God , how do you fill the void ?
" That 's what I 'm wrestling with now , " says James McAllister .
" I do n't have anyone to talk to in my heart .
The prayers I used to say , I simply do n't bother anymore .
I obviously regard prayer to be silly , even .
But it was a comforting place that I could go .
I 've let that go .
And there is a void .
And hopefully it can be replaced just by appreciating being alive . "

And new concept art reveals another thing we 'll see in Season Four : a new leading lady .
Rick Lacy , a character designer and storyboard office for The Venture Bros. , posted this concept art , which he describes as a " female lead in season 4 . "
The images are labeled " Nikki mid-30s " and " Nikki nightgown . "
So will this Nikki be friend , foe , or just another incredibly screwed up character from the Venture universe ?

Note : this is not seasonally adjusted .
There is a very distinct seasonal pattern for imports , but not for exports .
Sometimes port traffic gives us an early hint of changes in the trade deficit .
The following graph shows the loaded inbound and outbound traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in TEUs ( TEUs : 20 - foot equivalent units or 20 - foot - long cargo container ) .
Although containers tell us nothing about value , container traffic does give us an idea of the volume of goods being exported and imported .
Click on graph for larger image in new window .
Inbound traffic was 14.5 % below August 2008 .
Outbound traffic was 16.2 % below August 2008 .
There has been a clear recovery in U.S. exports ( the year - over - year comparison was off 30 % from December through February ) .
And export traffic , at the LA area ports , is at the August 2007 level .
However , for imports , traffic is at the August 2003 level , and 2009 will probably be the weakest year for import traffic since 2002 .
Note : Imports usually peak in the August through October period ( as retailers import goods for the holidays ) and then decline in November .

Yamaha Motor Begins Second Research on ‘ The Relationship between Motorcycle Riding and Brain Stimulation ’ ‏
Yamaha Motor has announced the start of a second joint research project on the subject of the relationship between motorcycle riding and brain stimulation with Ryuta Kawashima Laboratory of the Department of Functional Brain Imaging , Institute of Development , Aging and Cancer at Tohoku University .
The project began in September 2009 and is planned to continue until December 2010 .
The focus of this research will be the measurement and analysis of the cause and effect relationship involved in the operation of various types of vehicles and brain stimulation and measuring the changes in such stimulation over time by means of data gathered from a long - term mass survey in the market .
The reason for Yamaha Motor ’s participation in this project is to further research on the relationship between motorcycle riding and brain stimulation in the context of the Ryuta Kawashima Laboratory ’s studies in the area of “ Smart Aging Society ” and hopefully connect it to vitalization of the motorcycle market .
The findings of the first research project in 2008 included :
When riding a motorcycle , the brain of the rider is stimulated ; Differences in brain use and level of brain stimulation can be observed in motorcyclists who ride regularly and in motorcyclists who have not ridden for extended periods ;
Incorporating motorcycle riding into daily life improves various cognitive functions and has positive effects on mental and emotional health such as stress reduction .
The second research project now begun will be divided into a Sept – Oct 2009 and Oct 2009 – Dec 2010 test .
In Test 1 , research will survey the differences in the conditions of brain stimulation related to the type of vehicle and riding conditions and the motorcycle riding operations .
Test 2 will focus on measuring the changes in this brain stimulation over time related to conditions involved , and the survey will involve a larger subject base .
Yamaha Motor ’s participation in the new project will include providing vehicles for the research ( motorcycles , etc. ) , making its test courses available for tests , soliciting test participants ( test subjects ) and providing test staff .

The TARDIS Console Room Gets a Facelift
A few weeks ago I mentioned that Matt Smith ’s TARDIS looked brand new from the outside .
I even speculated whether the inside might have been updated .
Well , rumor is the inside will be different when Matt Smith takes over .
From io9 ( and they got it from a Gallifrey Base poster ) :
A poster at Gallifrey Base claims to have gotten a good look inside the new TARDIS set , which we ’ll see in 2010 .
Supposedly , the interior of the TARDIS will have two different levels , joined by a spiral staircase , and we ’ll be seeing a console room , a lab area , a sitting room , a long corridor , and “ numerous other little nooks and crannies . ”
The set is designed to be modular , so that pieces of the set can be moved around and double as other parts of the ship , when we visit other rooms inside the TARDIS .
The console room itself is a shaped like a hexagon attached to a square rather than being circular , the color theme is mostly silver and gold , and the coral finish has been replaced with marble .
The roundels decorating the walls are now inverted hemispheres , and while they appear throughout the set , they do not appear on every wall .
The roundels have different color schemes for each room : gold in the console room , silver , gray , and blue in the lab , and brown in the sitting room .
You should , of course , take this with several truckloads of grains of salt .

Doctor Who Ranks # 2 on io9 ’s Top 100 Science Fiction / Fantasty Shows
Last week io9 ran a listing of what they consider to be the Top 100 Science Fiction / Fantasy Shows of all time .
Doctor
Who came in at # 2 ( just behind Star Trek ) .
They described it as , “ One of the most iconic shows on television – period – let alone science fiction TV ” .
That ’s pretty cool !
Additionally , while reading through the list I discovered that Terry Nation ( the creator of the Daleks ) worked on MacGyver !!!
Turns out that Nation was a producer on MacGyver for six episodes .
Doctor Who & MacGyver – two great tastes that taste great together !!!

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday banned cigarettes with fruit , candy or clove flavors .
Authorized by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act enacted in June , the ban represents an effort to reduce an easy entry point for youth into smoking and tobacco addiction .
Some cigarette makers favored and others opposed giving the FDA this new authority .
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. , the government says .
The FDA also is considering bans on menthol cigarettes and other flavored tobacco .

“ Almost 90 % of adult smokers start smoking as teenagers .
These flavored cigarettes are a gateway for many children and young adults to become regular smokers , ” said FDA Commissioner Margaret A. Hamburg .
“ The FDA will utilize regulatory authority to reduce the burden of illness and death caused by tobacco products . ”
The FDA said studies have shown that 17 - year - old smokers are three times as likely to use flavored cigarettes as smokers over age 25 .

Republican candidate for governor Robert Bentley today proposed an amendment to the state constitution that would make it a crime for anyone to cause or participate in an abortion , with some exceptions .
Exceptions would be allowed if the life of a mother was threatened by a pregnancy or for rape or incest .
' ' I care about the life of unborn children .
We need people who will stand up for unborn children in this country , '' said Bentley , 66 , who is a retired physician and a state representative from Tuscaloosa County .
The proposal would become part of the state constitution if passed by the Legislature and then by voters in a state referendum .
Bentley predicted the amendment , if passed , would be challenged in federal court .
He said he hoped the challenge would move all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and cause the justices to reverse the Court 's Roe v.
Wade decision of 1973 , which said women have a constitutional right to abortion .
Bentley said he thinks that ruling was wrong .
I have been following a number of unemployment charts showing just how bad the current recession is .
Click on any chart to see a sharper image .
Job Loss Recovery
The last three recessions are unlike the eight preceding recessions .
For numerous reasons described below we are heading for another job loss recovery .
Job Loss Recovery Detail

If the pattern holds , unemployment will rise until 2011 or beyond .
Moreover , take a look at the first chart again .
Odds of a double dip recession similar to 1980 - 1982 are high after whatever inventory rebuilding and bottom fishing in housing ends .
Consumer Confidence About Jobs
The Following is by permission from Contrary Investor
Contrary Investor writes :
" The jobs hard to get response is pushing up against 30 year highs seen in the last few months .
Likewise the jobs easy to get component of the survey has hit a new low for the current cycle .
We 'll just have to see how hard the folks at the Bureau of Labor stats can goose the headline payroll numbers for July with further Birth / Death model estimates .
We 'll be surprised at nothing .
But consumers are telling us labor market conditions have worsened , despite the government numbers .
And without question this has driven their consumption behavior . "
Decade For Lost Jobs
Please consider the following chart from Lost Decade For Jobs by Michael Mandel of BusinessWeek .
Record Number See Benefits End
The following chart is courtesy of David Rosenberg .
Take a good look at that chart .
It 's 50,000 now .
The expectation is 500,000 by September and 1.5 million by the end of the year .
What are the odds Obama creates 1.5 million jobs by the end of the year ?
Can he really create any ?
For how long ?
While on the subject of claims please consider the following four charts courtesy of Chris Puplava at Financial Sense .
I asked him to chart Data from Moodys .
Continuing Claims Since 2000
Continuing Claims Since 1970
Continuing Claims as % of Population Since 2000
Continuing Claims as % of Population Since 1980
Chris notes
" The EUC and the extended benefits come out with a lag as Moody ’s had data for them only up to 07/11/09 while the continuing claims data is up to 07/18/09 .
The charts above are through 07/11/09 . "
I commented on the above series of charts in Weekly Unemployment Claims Portend Disaster .
Here is a snip .
Unparalleled Continuing Claims
On a percentage of population basis this recession is unparalleled .
Making matters worse , the US consumer was nowhere near as leveraged to real estate in 1980 or 1982 as now .
Also note that boomers are heading into retirement now , undercapitalized and looking for jobs , in effect competing against their kids and grandkids for jobs .
Look at the average age of baggers in grocery stores or greeters at Walmart .
These people are not working because they want to ; they are working because they have to .
Demand for jobs is at an all time high while the number of available jobs and the pay scales of those jobs have both collapsed .
The employment situation is not only an unmitigated disaster , things are about to get worse with pending state cutbacks .
Because of expiring claims , continuing claims data will soon start looking better .
The reality however , is things will get worse for another year as unemployment soars into double digits .
My forecast in January was 10.8 % in 2010 while the Fed 's was 8.5 % .
I see no reason to change mine , but the Fed upped theirs .
The implications for housing and especially commercial real estate are ominous .
Part Time Employment
The following graph from Calculated Risk shows the unemployment rate and the percent of the civilian labor force that is working part time for economic reasons .
New figures come out on Friday but here is the June count of Part - Time Employment .
Table A - 5 Part Time Status
click on chart for sharper image
The chart shows there are 9 million people are working part time but want a full time job .
A year ago the number was 5.5 million .
Exhausted Benefits
The following graph on the number of workers who have exhausted their regular benefits is also courtesy of Calculated Risk :
Calculated Risk writes :
" The blue line is the number of workers unemployed for 27 weeks or more .
The red line is the same data as a percent of the civilian workforce .
According to the BLS , there are almost 4.4 million workers who have been unemployed for more than 26 weeks ( and still want a job ) .
This is 2.8 % of the civilian workforce .
Right now very few workers have exhausted their unemployment benefits , but there is tidal wave coming .
The Law Project estimates 0.5 million workers will have exhausted their extended benefits by the end of September , and close to 1.5 million by the end of 2009 .
Unless the unemployment rate starts to decline , the numbers will continue to grow rapidly in 2010 . "
Incredible Shrinking Boomer Economy
Before many companies start hiring full - time workers , they will first put part - timers back to work full time .
This will add significant delays to the hiring process in this " recovery " .
Indeed , by the time " stimulus " wears out ( and it will ) , the economy will be slipping back into a double - dip recession .
Note that there is no driver for jobs other than inventory replenishment and various stimulus measures .
The latter does nothing but push demand forward .
Meanwhile Wages and Salaries Fell 4.7 % , Most On Record .
Finally , I want to leave you with a thought from the Incredible Shrinking Boomer Economy .
In his Town Hall Meetings Bernanke said :
" It takes GDP growth of about 2.5 percent to keep the jobless rate constant .
But the Fed expects growth of only about 1 percent in the last six months of the year .
So that 's not enough to bring down the unemployment rate . "
Inquiring minds might be asking :
Why does it take 2.5 % growth to keep the jobless rate constant ?
The answer is the first 2.5 % +- of GDP is based on hedonics and imputations .
In plain English , the first 2.5 % +- of GDP ( if not much more ) is fictional .
When the economy is growing at 2 % it feels like a recession because it probably is , even though no one will admit it .
Now consider the implications of a 2.4 % GDP forecast for three decades .
If Bernanke is correct that it takes 2.5 % GDP growth just to keep the unemployment rate constant , and McKinsey is also correct in its 2.4 % forecast , we will be stuck with 10 % unemployment for decades .
No Driver For Jobs
The current assumption is that the post - crisis political economy will reflect the rising influence of China , probably of India , and of other large emerging economies .
Supposedly , the United States , the epicentre of the financial crisis , will see its economic power and influence diminish .
There are good reasons for this perception .
China has responded strongly to the crisis , both in terms of stimulus and monetary policies , and it seems to have a deep treasure chest to back up its first moves .
China has enjoyed a rapid recovery , which has assisted others , underscoring China 's growing influence .
Indeed , today , China acts as a stabilising force in the global economy .
Together , China and India account for 8.5 per cent of world output .
They and other developing countries are growing substantially more rapidly than developed countries .

And yet China 's future is not yet determined .
Its rapid recovery in 2009 was fuelled by an expansion of credit of 26 per cent of GDP in the first eight months of this year .
This flood is now easing , and authorities are likely to limit it further for fear of effects on asset prices , asset quality , and eventually general inflation .
China still faces big uncertainties in 2010 .
China 's leaders recognise these risks , including the continued dependence of China and other emerging economies on export - led growth .
It will not be easy for China to shift to increasing reliance on domestic demand , especially to greater consumption that could help balance world growth while contributing to China 's goal of a more " harmonious society " .
China 's protected service sector , including financial services , limits opportunities for entrepreneurs and increases in productivity .
The US , in turn , has been hit hard by the crisis .
But America has a culture of resilience to set - backs , adapting to new circumstances and remaking itself .
The future for the US will depend on whether and how it will address large deficits , recover without inflation that could undermine its credit and currency , and overhaul its financial system to preserve innovation while adding to safety and soundness .
Taken from a speech by the President of the World Bank to John Hopkins University on Monday
What are the odds that intelligent , technically advanced aliens would look anything like the ones in films , with an emaciated torso and limbs , spindly fingers and a bulbous , bald head with large , almond - shaped eyes ?
What are the odds that they would even be humanoid ?
In a YouTube video , produced by Josh Timonen of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science , I argue that the chances are close to zero ( www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKAXrmkx12g).
Richard Dawkins himself made this interesting observation in a private communication after viewing it :
I would agree with [ Shermer ] in betting against aliens being bipedal primates , and I think the point is worth making , but I think he greatly overestimates the odds against .
[ University of Cambridge paleontologist ]
Simon Conway Morris , whose authority is not to be dismissed , thinks it positively likely that aliens would be , in effect , bipedal primates .
[ Harvard University biologist ]
Ed Wilson gave at least some time to the speculation that , if it had not been for the end - Cretaceous catastrophe , dinosaurs might have produced something like the attached [ referring to paleontologist Dale A. Russell ’s illustrated evolutionary projection of how a bipedal dinosaur might have evolved into a reptilian humanoid ] .
I replied to Dawkins that if something like a smart , technological , bipedal humanoid has a certain level of inevitability because of how evolution unfolds , then it would have happened more than once here .
In his 2001 book Nonzero : The Logic of Human Destiny , Robert Wright argues that our existence precludes other terrestrial intelligences of our level from arising .
But Neandertals were as close as one can get to a counterfactual experiment : they had hundreds of thousands of years to themselves in Europe without our interference and showed nothing like the technological and cultural progress of the modern humans who displaced them .
Dawkins ’s rejoinder to me is enlightening :
But you are leaping from one extreme to the other .
In the film vignette , you implied a quite staggering rarity , so rare that you do n’t expect two humanoid life - forms in the entire universe .
Now you are ... pointing out , correctly , that a certain inevitability would predict that humanoids should have evolved more than once on Earth !
So , yes , we can say that humanoids are fairly improbable , but not necessarily all that improbable !
Anything approaching “ a certain inevitability ” would mean millions or even billions of humanoid life - forms in the universe , simply because the number of available planets is so huge .
Now , my guess is intermediate between your two extremes ...
I suspect that humanoids are not so very rare as to justify the statistical superlatives that you permitted yourself in the vignette .
Good point .
But of the 60 to 80 phyla of animals , only one , the chordates , led to intelligence , and only the vertebrates actually developed it .
Of all the vertebrates , only mammals evolved brains big enough for higher intelligence .
And of the 24 orders of mammals only one — ours , the primates — has technological intelligence .
As the late Harvard evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr concluded : “ Nothing demonstrates the improbability of the origin of high intelligence better than the millions of phyletic lineages that failed to achieve it . ”
In fact , Mayr calculated that even though there have evolved perhaps as many as 50 billion species on Earth , “ only one of these achieved the kind of intelligence needed to establish a civilization . ”
The late astronomer Carl Sagan , in a Planetary Society debate with Mayr ( Bioastronomy News , Vol. 7 , No. 4 , 1995 ) , noted that technologically communicating species “ may live on the land or in the sea or air .
They may have unimaginable chemistries , shapes , sizes , colors , appendages and opinions .
We are not requiring that they follow the particular route that led to the evolution of humans .
There may be many different evolutionary pathways , each unlikely , but the sum of the number of pathways to intelligence may nevertheless be quite substantial . ”
Thus , the probability of intelligent life evolving elsewhere in the cosmos may be very high even while the odds of it being humanoid may be very low .
I strongly suspect that we are blinded by Protagoras ’ bias ( “ Man is the measure of all things ” ) when we project ourselves into the alien Other .
About 600 Bridgestone employees have been told the company 's tyre - making plant at Salisbury in Adelaide will be closing within six months .
The company says international competition is behind its decision , not the global financial crisis .
Senior executive director Andrew Moffatt says Bridgestone has been reviewing its operations for many years and the Salisbury plant 's operations are no longer viable .
" We 've been working with the employees and the management and we 've made significant investment in these factories over a number of years to improve their cost competitiveness , to improve the fact that those factories can survive in the long term , " he said .
" Unfortunately we 've not succeeded in this . "
Employee Darren Iron was told of the closure this afternoon .
" The actual managers told us to go home and we 'll be paid what we should be for the rest of this day , " he said .
South Australian Premier Mike Rann says he is disappointed that the decision was made by management in Japan .
In 2007 , Bridgestone became a private company , wholly owned by its Japanese parent .
Mr Rann says he was only told about the closure by a staff member at 1:00 pm today .
" It 's a similar thing to what happened to Mitsubishi , " he said .
" Here we 've got companies that in my view were less than frank with people .
The bottom line for me is helping these workers . "
The Opposition 's employment participation spokesman , Andrew Southcott , says it is a blow for the region .
" These jobs are located in northern Adelaide , which is already an area of high unemployment , it 's already an area of social disadvantage , " he said .
" That 's why it 's important that both the South Australian and Federal Government look at providing a structural adjustment package . "
Union shocked
The company says all employees will receive their full entitlements .
South Australia 's secretary at the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union , John Camillo , says Brigestone 's announcement came without warning .
" It is a sudden shock , we knew they were doing it tough over the last few years but my concern now is there 's no way we can save the company , " he said .
" But [ we need to ] seriously sit down with the company , with the state and federal governments , to look at training these people . "
Mr Camillo says it has been difficult for union members to swallow the company 's decision .
" My main focus now is to see what we can do for these people , told now , who will go home and talk to their families about not having full - time employment and what they need to do to continue , " he said .
" While there is a redundancy package already negotiated , we just have to be mindful that these people find employment elsewhere . "
A plant in Christchurch in New Zealand which employs about 275 workers will also close at the end of this year .
Bridgestone says more than 1,500 other employees working in its distribution , customer service and retail networks will not be affected by the closures .
Citizens for Tax Justice point out what I was saying just the other day :
We only hear all this crying and moaning about the deficit when it 's something for regular working people , and not a powerful lobby .
And of course , the Republican 'ts are right out there in front of the Hypocrisy Parade :
And yet , many of the lawmakers who argue that the health care reform legislation is “ too costly ” are the same lawmakers who supported the Bush tax cuts .
Their own voting record demonstrates that health care reform is not a matter of costs , but a matter of priorities .
It ’s difficult to see how the Bush tax cuts could provide us with two and a half times the benefits of health care reform .
In 2010 , when all the Bush tax cuts are finally phased in , a staggering 52.5 percent of the benefits will go to the richest 5 percent of taxpayers .
President Bush and his supporters argued that these high - income tax cuts would benefit everybody because they would unleash investment that would spark widespread economic prosperity .
There seems to be no evidence of this , particularly given the collapse of the economy at the end of the Bush years .
The tax legislation enacted under President George W. Bush from 2001 through 2006 will cost $ 2.48
trillion over the 2001 - 2010 period .
This includes the revenue loss of $ 2.11 trillion that results directly from the Bush tax cuts as well as the $ 379 billion in additional interest payments on the national debt that we must make since the tax cuts were deficit - financed .
[...]
Over the upcoming decade ( 2010 - 2019 ) , the costs of the health care proposals approved by three committees in the U.S. House of Representatives are projected to be around $ 1 trillion .
( One committee trimmed the costs of its health care bill below that amount , but an official estimate of the cost reductions was not available at the time of this writing . )
The chairmen of the three House committees have explicitly stated that their goal is a final bill that
is deficit - neutral in the decade following enactment .
It ’s unclear if they have accomplished this yet , since the Congressional Budget Office has not yet issued final cost estimates of the bills , and the legislation is likely to change before the full House votes on a final bill .
But President Obama and
Democratic leaders have also committed to ensuring that health care reform will not increase the budget deficit .
Under the House bills , roughly half of the costs would be offset with savings in our existing health care programs , while the other half would be offset with a surcharge on the incomes of wealthy taxpayers .
In contrast , President Bush and his allies in Congress never even attempted to replace the revenue lost as a result of their enormous tax cuts .
The Bush tax cuts were deficit - financed , which increased the national debt and resulted in greater interest payments on that debt , as already explained .
These figures make clear that costs cannot be the real concern of lawmakers who oppose the House health care legislation and yet supported the Bush tax cuts .
Their position seems to be that showering benefits on the wealthiest five percent of taxpayers and leaving the bill for future generations is preferable to making health care available for all at a much lower cost and paying that cost up front .
That demonstrates a different set of priorities than most Americans have , but it does n’t demonstrate much concern about costs .
A large body of studies have focused on the potential health risks , both physical and mental , caused by heavy gaming .
But the vast majority of these studies have focused on the young and adolescents , which makes a new study of gamers released by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine exceptional : its average participant was over 35 .
The research has made headlines as the media has interpreted it as indicating that gamers are " fat " and " depressed , " but the research itself is too limited to support such generalizations .
One of the most obvious problems with such generalizations is that the study is based on survey data gathered online back in 2006 .
For whatever reason , it sat unused for two years before being analyzed in 2008 , but it 's important to note ( given the conclusions about weight ) that the Wii did n't hit the market until the end of that year .
The scope is limited , as well .
The survey relied on an Internet - sourced panel maintained by e-Rewards Marketing Research .
The authors selected participants in the Seattle area and , given an 18 percent response rate , wound up with 562 individuals , 249 of whom were gamers ranging in age from 19 to 90 years old .
This limited sample is not a definitive representation of gamers in general , and mainstream reports have ignored the study 's own admission to this :
" The fact that the sample was drawn from a population concentrated in western Washington State and from an Internet - based panel may limit generalizability of the results . "
Indeed , western Washington has a climate that 's rather unique within the US , one that may influence decisions on indoor vs. outdoor activities .
Also , the survey population was demographically distinct from the general US population , having achieved higher levels of education and having a correspondingly higher average income .
The survey data was also completely dependent on self - assessment .
Participants were asked to answer a variety of questions regarding their gaming and Internet habits , as well as their physical and mental health .
Someone saying that they feel depressed some days and someone being clinically depressed are not the same thing .
Furthermore , the standard deviation of the depression numbers in gamers was quite a bit larger than it was for nongamers , suggesting some outliers may be skewing the numbers here .
What few correlations are apparent in the data — a high Body Mass Index and an increased number of poor mental health days — the authors appropriately caution against inferring causality in the discussion , as well .
According to the self - reported gamer assessments , depression was higher in females than in males , while the potential weight issues were more likely to be seen in males ; in both sexes , gamers were more likely to view Internet communities as part of their extended social support networks than nongamers .
The authors note that other studies have shown correlations with a sedentary lifestyle and weight problems in younger gamers as well , which may simply mean that this problem is n't age - specific .
They also suggest that , among the depressed , gaming may be a form of what they term " digital self - medication , " a way to keep their mind off the issues that are associated with the depression .
This would seem in keeping with studies of EverQuest user data , which suggests a fraction of hardcore users rely on the game as part of an escape mechanism from a society in which they are marginalized .
The correlations are curious and more study is needed .
For instance , the paper does not address the amount of time gamers spend gaming , nor is there any rigorous clinical backing to self - assessed claims about mental or physical health .
None of this is to say that gamers are " fat , " " depressed , " or anything but gamers .
As with other behaviors which are often the subject of " self - medicating " theories , the what that someone is doing does n't always point to the same why .
Alcohol consumption , for instance , is routinely correlated with depressed populations , but this does not mean that all people who consume alcohol are depressed .
All in all , there 's nothing radical about the paper 's findings .
The caveats are important to keep in mind ; the study population was atypical , and comes entirely from a small geographic area .
Although , on average , the population might self - report weight and depression problems , the standard deviations on these numbers were large , and easily overlapped with the average of the non-gaming population .
Of course , that list of caveats does n't fit neatly into a typical headline .

This article was first published by Vice magazine .
It was a hot day , still 98 degrees at 6 PM , as I zoomed through gridlock on my freshly fixed 1979 Kawasaki KZ - 400 , squeezing between the monster trucks and lifted SUVs clogging one of Victorville ’s main drags , pouring sweat into my helmet and leather jacket on my way to an anti-Obamacare “ town hall ” meeting at the local community college .
I thought I knew what to expect when I got there .
Like everyone else in this country , I had been watching the packs of deranged tea bagger types and their astroturfing overlords dominate the healthcare reform debate like a pack of retarded howler monkeys in heat .
But TV had n’t quite prepared me for the reality of it .
You ca n’t really appreciate how fucked this country really is until you see , as I did , hundreds of blue collar Americans sync up their primitive brains in a paranoid racist - hick seance , channeling White Power ideals through Reagan ’s damned soul .
This Obama - bashing meeting was brought to the people of the High Desert courtesy of the Representative from California ’s 41st District , Mr. Jerry Lewis .
No , not the “ Great Balls of Fire ” guy .
This one was a different type of performer : a great wads of cronyism political scam artist .
In the two decades Lewis has served as this district ’s rep , he ’s made quite a name for himself as one of the most corrupt members of Congress , using his position as a ranking Republican member of the House Appropriations Committee ( one of the most powerful committees out there ) to “ steer hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks to family and friends in direct exchange for contributions to his campaign committee and political action committee . ”
But as I was about to find out , Lewis ’ constituency was so crazed they made him look less like an uber - successful used car salesmen and more like Mr. Mackey .
Mr. Lewis in front of Congress ’ Corruption Hall of Fame portrait
My motorcycle did n’t help me get to the town hall any faster than my car would ’ve — it was impossible to get around the lifted trucks with monster tires that barely fit into their own lanes — so I got there 30 minutes too late , and the auditorium had already filled up .
“ Sorry , sir .
We have to wait until someone comes out to let you in .
We ’re at maximum fire safety capacity , ” a college kid tasked with manning the doors told me and pointed me deeper into the lobby , where a TV and some chairs had been set up for the overflow crowd .
There were about 30 people assembled around the television set .
Most of them were old , liver - spotted zombies .
A few of them were in wheelchairs , others were sitting with canes between their knobby knees .
Two vets had set themselves up on a bench right in front of the TV .
One of them was wearing a brand - new “ Do n’t Tread On Me ” T - shirt while his buddy had the words “ Bubba Stick ” etched into his wooden cane .
Was this the front line of the anti-healthcare reform revolution ?
I tried to make smalltalk with an old man wearing a blue “ Korean War Veteran ” hat , who was standing next to me .
I tried to be chummy , saying something about the organizers not letting us in because we looked suspicious .
But he would have none of it .
Without saying a word , the vet gave me a slow cagey glance and hobbled away from me closer to the TV .
I thought maybe gramps was hard of hearing .
But there were mean vibes coming off the old man that could n’t be ignored .
Only later — when I finally made it into the auditorium and took a good look around — did I understand what it was all about .
Inside , the demographic was even more skewed towards the white and the old .
Other than a couple of college students and one black guy , the 400 - person auditorium was a sea of flabby , wrinkled white punctuated by handle bar mustaches and the occasional oxygen nose - tube glistening in the fluorescent light .
But that oxygen had obviously come too late .
People were queued up and down the aisles waiting for their turn to speak .
And judging by what they were saying , brain damage had already taken its toll long ago .
A wheelchair - bound grandma with sunken in eyeballs and translucent skin the color of a sardine was so overtaken by Lewis ’ generic Republican free market / invisible - hand - knows - best sermon that she was ready to leap out of her wheelchair .
Her “ amens ” were getting louder every time Lewis uttered one of the many permutations of that night ’s mantra — ” government keep your hands off my healthcare ” — that I half - expected her to start speaking in tongues .
I spied an long - haired dude wearing a “ Public Option is the Only Option for Health Care Reform ” button .
But while the rest of the living dead cheered their rep ’s “ health care reform is a slippery slope to Communism ” argument , he sat quietly mumbling under his breath .
And he was doing the right thing .
Wearing that button was brave enough , and he was already getting bad looks from some of the surlier dudes in the audience .
You do n’t want to start a confrontation in a room filled with venomous redneck grandmas and Harley - ridin ’ , goatee - braidin ’ Vietnam vets hanging out with their Korean War dads while they are soaring high on American Patriotism .
These people were itching to lynch a liberal .
Itching real bad .
Finally , Rep. Lewis opened the floor up to questions .
Some hag from Apple Valley started off with a long screed about how illegal immigration was ruining our country and how the government was going to force her to pay the medical fees of illegal immigrants , union members , ACORN , and the rest of the treasonous Commie / Muslim groups Obama brought in .
Then she switched gears : “ And on page 59 of HR 3200 it states , ‘ The federal government will have direct , real - time access to all individual bank accounts for electronic transfers , ' ” she said , convinced that the health care plan was a diabolical plan by Obama ’s Commie masters to take money away from honest white people like herself and redistribute it to blacks , spics , chinks and of course those damn kikes .
“ The government will take our savings , ” she said , her voice quivering .
“ I am not willing to give my savings to the government ! ”
The whole place went wild in support , the applause kept on roaring and people gave her a standing ovation .
It was like she just scored a touchdown .
There were a couple of 50 - something blue collar workers and their wives sitting behind me .
One of the men , who was sitting about a foot away from my left ear , kept saying “ yeah , ” “ yeah , ” “ that ’s right , ” to every point the woman — and just about everyone else who took the mic—made .
He sounded like Beavis at a super church .
A woman who was extremely worried about the sovereignty of America took the mic .
She heard that China was going to be one of the half - dozen countries manufacturing the Swine Flu vaccine .
And she was convinced that those Commie bastards were going to use the vaccine as a Trojan horse to destroy America from the inside .
“ I hope we are going to be protecting our sovereignty .
I hope that America does not import the vaccine from China , ” she screamed into the mic .
“ And I better damn hope we know what they are putting in these vaccines ! ”
The idiots in that room got to their feet and cheered her on , whooping , yelping and whistling .
Some guy took it even farther .
He was convinced the World Health Organization had fabricated the Swine Flu pandemic so that the UN could take over the whole world and start running that One World Government they had been planning for so long .
Not only had these people not changed in half a century , it seems like they had regressed .
As long as we ’re keeping score : The Enlightenment : 0 , Rednecks : 1 .
On and on it went .
“ I ’m sick and tired of having people up there comparing us to other countries .
If you do n’t like it here , go back to Africa ! ” a stringy woman with a meth - head physique yelled into the mic , goading her own ten - year - old daughter into health care - related illegal immigrant bashing .
“ How come we who work have to pay for people who do n’t pay any taxes ? ” the girl said , clearly not knowing what the hell she was talking about .
Another guy went on a tear about how illegal immigrants are actually flush with cash , but do n’t spend it .
Instead , they use credit cards that they never bother to pay , forcing us to foot the bill .
“ Who ’s gonna pay for that when they disappear ?
We are ! ”
“ Yeah , I took an oath to protect and serve my country .
Not piddle it away to immigrants and unions , ” a vet chimed in .
Jesus Christ .
These people really are the perfect slaves .
Their brain structure is n’t equipped to handle the complicated ripoff schemes pushed on them by greedy corporations , corrupt politicians or perverted pastors .
It was clear that for the majority , racism and violence were about the only concepts they could understand with any certitude .
It was a weird , scary thing to behold .
And it was clearly making Rep. Jerry Lewis uncomfortable .
He tried to play down some of the more paranoid and racist statements , but he knew he was walking a thin line .
Any attempt at reason would be viewed as nothing less than outright betrayal of the American Way he was elected to preserve .
And some of it backfired .
He tried to reassure the crowd that the UN was not going to take over America and that Obama was not going to get full access to their savings accounts , but the people did n’t like that one bit .
One guy threatened Lewis straight up , saying that he better not see him support those union lovin’ , ACORN - funding Dems .
“ You better not .
Or… I ’ll be watching you , ” the said , his voice menacingly flat and terse .
This was n’t deadpan liberal comedy .
The man meant it , and Jerry Lewis knew it , able to muster only a nervous laugh and attempting to redirect the bad vibes coming his way in the direction of a grotesquely obese heckler in the back , who was drunk and spewing out incomprehensibly slurred grievances for the better part of an hour .
“ You know , we ’ve had a heckler like this at just every town hall meeting I ’ve hosted .
Last time , there was a man trying to ruin our civil discussion .
I did n’t know it at the time , I read it in a newspaper , but it turned out this guy was working for the Democratic opponent that ran against me .
He had been fired a little earlier because he was selling kiddie porn , ” Lewis told the crowd , delivering the anecdote Jay Leno style .
He knew how to work his audience back into a good mood .
Even the heckler had a laugh .
It seemed all had been forgiven .
As the meeting went on , it became clear that the crowd was composed of three distinct groups .
The first , largest and dumbest was made up exclusively of racist hicks , who were convinced that any regulation was a secret attack on the Founding Fathers , the Constitution and the God- fearing Ways of White America .
The second group , heavily overlapping with the first and probably just as big , was was made up of old people .
They were pensioners and veterans who were opposed to government - run health care — the very health care plans they were on — because they feared their benefits would be cut .
The third town haller type was stealthier and smarter .
They did n’t ask questions or voice concerns , they made point - by - point policy demands lifted straight off the health insurance lobby , but wrapped in the bi-partisan rhetoric of astroturf organizations like FreedomWorks .
But the evil corporate shills did n’t bother me as much as the old people with their old - person smells .
There they were , barely moving and ignorant as all hell .
They are part of “ sun revolves around the moon ” demographic , but they are not stupid , survival instinct - wise .
The joke of this is that they ’re all living on government healthcare plans — the very thing they had been mobilized to this auditorium to fight !
But they were not ignorant or hypocritical .
They were fighting to protect a limited resource .
Consider these fun Baby Boomer facts :
Right now , there are about 75 million of them .
By 2020 , there will be one baby boomer for every five Americans .
As they age , they ’ll siphon off more and more money from Medicare , spending more to keep themselves alive than they ever put into the system .
You can be sure that when the Baby Boomers are done with it , Medicare will be sucked dry with nothing left for us youngin’s .
And they know it .
They want to maximize socialism for themselves while they can , and leave none for the next generation .
On some primitive level , the old people around me understood what I had not : the fight for healthcare reform is not just pitting the average American against giant health insurance vampires .
It is also a fight between the young and the old , between the giant , aging Baby Boomer generation and the rest of us .
They understand that we want to have some of what they have .
But they are greedy , self - centered geriatric vampires and they do not want to share .

And the burden on households from cap and trade depends on what ’s done with the rents .
In the original Obama plan , the rents would be used to pay for middle - class tax cuts ; in Waxman - Markey , many of the permits are initially granted to utilities — but since these utilities ’ profits are regulated , many of the rents would end up being passed on to consumers through lower prices .
In discussing climate change legislation over at his blog , Paul Krugman says something that I believe to be correct , but he does not fully draw out the logical implications of what he says .
Here what Paul writes
In my view , that is a bug , not a feature , of the Waxman - Markey bill .
From the standpoint of economic efficiency , the price of carbon emissions should be passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices , so that consumers can make optimal decisions regarding energy consumption .
Consumers should be compensated for paying these higher prices via cuts in income or payroll taxes .
Those tax cuts would be financed by the revenues received from the auctioning of carbon rights ( or , better yet , a carbon tax ) .
To promote an efficient allocation of scarce resources , relative prices should reflect true social costs .
Shielding consumers via the regulatory process , rather than through tax cuts , fails to achieve that goal and , as a result , makes environmental protection more costly than it needs to be .
Ms. Bacall , is that you ?
I ’m intensely skeptical , but someone claiming to be movie / stage legend Lauren Bacall has an account on Twitter and is doing a pretty good job of sounding like the woman born Betty Joan Perske .
Well , some of the time , anyhow .
For those of you who may not be familiar with her , Bacall ’s status is entirely earned .
A born entertainer , she became one of the screen ’s sexiest young sirens playing opposite the substantially older Humphrey Bogart , whom she married .
After starring with Bogie , and stealing all her scenes , in Howard Hawks ’
“ To Have and Have Not ” and “ The Big Sleep , ” she graduated to more mature roles over the years and she became a Broadway star and occasionally popped up in great movies like “ The Shootist , ” and TV shows like “ The Rockford Files . ”
Now nearing her mid-eighties , she continues to work and be terrific in movies like Paul Shrader ’s political thriller , “ The Walker . ”
She even allowed herself to be robbed and mistreated by Christopher Moltisanti ( Michael Imperioli ) on an episode of “ The Sopranos . ”
As Karina Longworth points out , her posts do have a Betty Bacall like cadence , so if you ’d like to think that ’s actually her , I ca n’t stop you and I might be tempted to join you .
I ’m in awe to even think it might be for real .
It ’ll be sometime before we find out the truth behind these Tweets .
In the meantime , a great Bacall moment or two .
We ’ll start with her most memorable scene from “ The Big Sleep , ” which was actually added to boost her role after the success of “ To Have and Have Not ” and their marriage made Bogart and Bacall one of Hollywood ’s hottest couples .
After the flip , I ’ve got a couple of iconic clips with Lauren Bacall in her way , way pre-Twitter days .
Two years before and not even twenty years old , she costarred with Bogart for the first time in another terrific
Hawks film , “ To Have and Have Not . ”
It ’s almost too obvious to say that the two minute scene below made her an instant star , but I suspect that ’s what happened .
You ’ll see why .
As details continued to emerge about Jaycee Lee Dugard ’s alleged kidnapper , questions intensified Monday over how Phillip Garrido could have served only 11 years in prison after a 1976 rape and kidnapping for which he had been given a 50 - year federal sentence as well as a life term in Nevada .
Garrido was convicted of kidnapping in federal court for abducting Katherine Callaway in South Lake Tahoe on a November night nearly 33 years ago and driving her -- handcuffed and hogtied -- to Reno .
He then pleaded guilty to a Nevada state rape charge for assaulting her in a storage unit .
Former Assistant U.S. Atty .
Leland Lutfy , who prosecuted the kidnapping case , said Monday that he was “ amazed ” because , at the time , he believed that defendants convicted of federal crimes were required to serve two - thirds of their sentences -- in this case , 33 years .
That would have kept him safely away from Dugard , who was snatched from her quiet street in 1991 .
“ It makes no sense to me , ” he said in an interview .

Michael Malloy , who prosecuted the rape case in Washoe County , Nev. , said the system “ let everyone down , especially Jaycee Dugard .
It does n’t seem an adequate sentence for the violent crime he committed in 1976 . ”
Callaway , who has since married Jim Hall and goes by her married name , thought that Garrido would n’t be paroled until at least 2006 , she said during an appearance on CNN ’s “ Larry King Live . ”
But a little more than a decade after she was assaulted , she was approached at a Lake Tahoe casino by a man who resembled Garrido .
She called prison officials and learned that he had been paroled to California .
“ In many ways , the capture of Phillip Garrido has closed a chapter in my life , ” she wrote on the show ’s blog .
“ I do n’t have to hide anymore .
I do n’t have to live every day of my life wondering if he is looking for me .
I am finally free from the fear I have lived with since the day I learned he was paroled . ”
A spokesman for the U.S. Parole Commission did not return a call for comment about why Garrido was set free in 1988 .

Loyola Law professor Laurie Levenson said that barring an extraordinary situation , “ there is no way on a 50 - year sentence he should have been out . ”
Garrido , 58 , and his second wife , Nancy , 54 , were charged last week with 29 counts of rape and kidnapping in Dugard ’s nearly two - decade disappearance .
The couple allegedly abducted Dugard when she was an 11 - year - old and held her in the backyard of their Antioch - area home , where she gave birth to Garrido ’s two girls .
They called her Allissa .
Nearly 33 years ago , on Nov. 22 , 1976 , Garrido walked up to Callaway ’s car at a South Lake Tahoe market and asked for a ride , according to court documents .
She had planned to cook dinner for her boyfriend and had just bought groceries .
She said yes , and they headed off toward Stateline .
Before they hit the California - Nevada border , Callaway pulled to the side of the road to let Garrido out .
He grabbed the keys , turned off the engine , handcuffed Callaway and then tied her up “ like one of those calves in a rodeo , ” Lutfy said .

“ He talked to her on the way from California to Nevada , took LSD and told her in graphic detail what he was going to do to her when he got her to Nevada , ” Lutfy said .
“ This was a sicko . ”
And he blamed Callaway for his actions , telling her , according to court documents , “ that it was n’t intentional that he had taken her , but that it was her fault because she was attractive . ”
Garrido headed to a storage unit he rented in an industrial neighborhood in Reno .
Because Garrido transported Callaway across state lines , the kidnapping became a federal case and went to trial in February 1977 .
A jury found him guilty , and he was sentenced to 50 years in federal prison .
He appealed the decision to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals and lost .
According to documents filed in the appeal , Garrido testified that “ he had used LSD , marijuana , cocaine , downers , uppers and hashish since 1968 , ” when he was still attending Liberty Union High School in the Northern California city of Brentwood .

Garrido ’s father , Manuel , now 88 , said his friendly , well - adjusted son , who played electric guitar in a band and helped his parents around the house , began to slip away during adolescence .
He got mixed up with the “ wrong crowd , ” the father said , and began using and dealing LSD .
About the same time , he injured his head in a motorcycle accident .
“ After surgery , ” the father said , “ he would talk funny and do funny things . ”
The two men have been estranged since the rape , and Manuel said he has not seen his son for more than five years .

One of the last times they spoke , Manuel recalled , Phillip was babbling about talking to God .
“ I would tell him , ‘ We ’ll see , we ’ll see , ’ ” the father said .
“ You could n’t tell him anything else .
If you tried to , he would get mad . ”
For at least the last decade , Garrido has run a printing business called Print for Less out of the gray cinder - block house on Walnut Avenue in the Antioch area where authorities believe he held Dugard and their two daughters in a squalid warren of tents and sheds in the backyard .
Garrido ’s printing customers knew nothing about the 1976 rape and kidnapping , but they had heard plenty from Garrido about God , especially in recent years .
Cheyvonne Molino , 35 , and her husband James own JM Enterprises , an auto wrecking yard .
They hired Garrido over the last decade to print a wide variety of business paperwork .
Advertisement
His prices were better than chain stores , she said , he had a knack for personalizing work , and he often threw in free extras , like notepads .
Garrido ’s own early business cards , Molino said , included a picture of a girl he described as his eldest daughter , Allissa .
“ He would say , ‘ Is n’t she beautiful like a model ?
She ’s an angel , ’ ” Molino recounted .
Garrido , she said , was a loving father , who would bring his two youngest daughters , Starlet , 15 , and Angel , 11 , to the auto yard .
Just last week , Molino asked them about back - to - school plans and the church they attended .
They said they were home - schooled , and Angel added that “ we have church in my dad ’s basement . ”
Advertisement
Although Garrido became increasingly “ eccentric ” in his religious beliefs over the last several years , “ there was no indication that there was a problem until last week , ” she said , when the Garridos were arrested and Antioch and its environs learned that Allissa was really Jaycee .
Molino -- who now believes that Garrido is a “ monster ” -- rejects the notion that he held the young girls ’ prisoner .
When Molino ’s daughter celebrated her sweet 16 last month , he dropped them off at the party .
They wore strappy , brightly colored sundresses .
They smiled a lot .
Angel marveled at the party soundtrack : “ So this is what rap music sounds like ! ”
“ We ’ve seen them all summer , ” she said in an interview .
“ They ’ve never been hidden . ”
Tim Allen , president of East County Glass and Window Inc. , noticed a similar change in Garrido , whom he described as “ kind of a weird character ” but a dependable businessman .
Recently , he said , Garrido started having money troubles and showing off a “ box he claimed he could talk to God through . ”
Advertisement
“ He brought in the two young girls , ” Allen said .
“ He introduced me to them as his daughters .
Nothing ever looked weird to me .
They called him dad .
They were smiling and happy little girls .
There was no sign this guy was a weirdo or a maniac or anything . ”

Black holes are invading stars , providing a radical explanation to bright flashes in the universe that are one of the biggest mysteries in astronomy today .
The flashes , known as gamma ray bursts , are beams of high energy radiation – similar to the radiation emitted by explosions of nuclear weapons – produced by jets of plasma from massive dying stars .
The orthodox model for this cosmic jet engine involves plasma being heated by neutrinos in a disk of matter that forms around a black hole , which is created when a star collapses .
But mathematicians at the University of Leeds have come up with a different explanation : the jets come directly from black holes , which can dive into nearby massive stars and devour them .
Their theory is based on recent observations by the Swift satellite which indicates that the central jet engine operates for up to 10,000 seconds - much longer than the neutrino model can explain .
Mathematicians believe that this is evidence for an electromagnetic origin of the jets , i.e. that the jets come directly from a rotating black hole , and that it is the magnetic stresses caused by the rotation that focus and accelerate the jet 's flow .
For the mechanism to operate the collapsing star has to be rotating extremely rapidly .
This increases the duration of the star 's collapse as the gravity is opposed by strong centrifugal forces .
One particularly peculiar way of creating the right conditions involves not a collapsing star but a star invaded by its black hole companion in a binary system .
The black hole acts like a parasite , diving into the normal star , spinning it with gravitational forces on its way to the star 's centre , and finally eating it from the inside .
" The neutrino model cannot explain very long gamma ray bursts and the Swift observations , as the rate at which the black hole swallows the star becomes rather low quite quickly , rendering the neutrino mechanism inefficient , but the magnetic mechanism can , " says Professor Komissarov from the School of Mathematics at the University of Leeds .
" Our knowledge of the amount of the matter that collects around the black hole and the rotation speed of the star allow us to calculate how long these long flashes will be – and the results correlate very well with observations from satellites , " he adds .
The research is published in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society and funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council in the UK .
ETS to increase New Zealand ’s emissions 5 %

ETS to increase New Zealand ’s emissions 5 %
Under the new Emissions Trading Scheme , ( ETS ) , the Government will pay just one company , Methanex , over a billion dollars to increase New Zealand 's total emissions by 5 % over the next ten years , the Green Party said today .
“ The Government is subsidising the growth of New Zealand ’s biggest polluters , and asking the taxpayer to cough up for the costs , ” Jeanette Fitzsimons , Green Party Climate Change Spokesperson said .
“ A giveaway of free credits , without a limit , means big polluters can reach into the Treasury cookie jar as often as they like , and send the bill to the taxpayer . ”
The Government admitted last night that their proposed changes will amount to hundreds of millions in new costs to the taxpayer over a few short years .
“ It is unthinkable that the taxpayer will not only pay for a full upgrade of the Methanex factories , it will continue to pay Methanex to pollute for the next 70 years , ” Ms Fitzsimons said .
“ This is not protection of an existing industry so it can carry on .
This is a huge subsidy for a major polluter to increase its production and its pollution .
“ A properly designed ETS would encourage business to begin reducing emissions , not pay them to increase emissions .
“ This makes a mockery of the Government ’s emissions reduction target of ten percent by 2020 .
It does exactly the opposite .
“ Paying polluters to pollute more is not ‘ doing our part ’ to tackle climate change , ” Ms Fitzsimons said .

Analysts think the worst could be over World stocks have risen , boosted by encouraging manufacturing figures and solid earnings results .
The Standard and Poor 's 500 index tipped beyond 1,000 for the first time since November and the Nasdaq hit above 2,000 - the first time since October .
The three major US indexes all added 1.25 % or more by close of trade after a manufacturing survey rose in July .
European indexes rose with London 's FTSE closing at its highest since October and the pound rising .
France 's Cac 40 rose 1.5 % and Germany 's Dax added 1.78 % ' Growth expectations '
The shift in growth expectations that has occurred during the last two weeks has occurred with the subtlety of a sledge hammer
Kent Engelke , Capitol Securities Management
World markets took heart after brighter UK economic data and a rally in financial stocks following profits from banking giants HSBC and Barclays .
Later in the day the US Institute of Supply Management said its index of manufacturing activity reached a reading of 48.9 last month from June 's reading of 44.8 - beating expectations .
" We 're past the worst of it on the manufacturing side , and we could even be getting back to growth by the third quarter of this year , " said Jill Evans , co-portfolio manager , Alpine Dynamic Dividend Fund .
Ryan Sweet at Moody 's Economy.com said the results were " consistent with our forecast for both manufacturing and ( the overall economy ) to rebound this quarter . "
Analysts think investors are accepting the idea that the economy could be over the worst and a recovery better than has been previously thought .
" The shift in growth expectations that has occurred during the last two weeks has occurred with the subtlety of a sledge hammer , " said Kent Engelke at Capitol Securities Management .
Risers in the US included Ford , which added more than 4 % after seeing sales climb 2.3 % in July from a year earlier .
We are forecasting for sterling to continue to gain against the greenback , particularly if banks and blue - chip stocks show renewed strength

Is real recovery on its way ?
See the pound vs the dollar FTSE 100 Also higher was Apple , boosted after Google chief Eric Schmidt left Apple 's board of directors because of conflict of interest concerns .
And safe - haven investments including Treasuries and the US dollar fell , while more volatile stocks - such as oil and other commodities - climbed .
The price of sweet crude added $ 2.13 to settle at $ 71.58 a barrel on New York 's Mercantile Exchange .
Optimism Sterling rose as high as $ 1.6965 against the dollar and hit a one - month high against the euro of 84.63 p .
The FTSE 100 index ended at its highest level since early October , soon after Lehman Brothers collapsed , at 4,682.46 .
Earlier it reached an intra-day trading high of 4,710.23 .
Shares in Barclays climbed 6.7 % after reporting an 8 % rise in half - year profits , while HSBC rose 5 % after it made better - than - expected profits of $ 5 bn .
Oil prices also rose to a one - month high above $ 71 a barrel , as an economic recovery should lead to greater demand for crude .
Lift for pound
The pound got a lift after data showed the UK manufacturing sector expanded for the first time in more than a year .
Manufacturing activity rose last month for the first time since March 2008 , as new orders came in , according to a survey by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply ( CIPS ) and Markit .
" The manufacturing sector has clearly pulled out of the nosedive it was in earlier this year and is no longer plummeting , " said David Noble , chief executive of CIPS .
While still a long way below the $ 2 levels seen in July last year , the pound has rebounded 25 % from the 23 - year low of $ 1.35 it hit in January this year .
" Over the medium - term we are forecasting for sterling to continue to gain against the greenback , particularly if banks and blue - chip stocks show renewed strength , as Barclays did today , " said David Clements , senior analyst at Caxton FX .
The UK economy is viewed as being particularly reliant on the banking sector so evidence of any upturn benefits sterling .

According to an official report released today by Israel ’s Central Bureau of Statistics , legal construction inside West Bank settlements declined somewhat over 2008 .
The report showed a 5.8 % drop in the number of housing projects completed , and a considerable drop in the number of new starts , 33.8 % .
The report does n’t include illegal construction done inside the West Bank , such as the housing units the government is reported considering making retroactively legal .
There is a considerable backlog of approved housing construction which has yet to begin as well .
But perhaps the most misleading aspect of the report is that it does n’t include settlement activity inside East Jerusalem , which peace group Ir Amim reported last week had been dramatically accelerating this year .
The Israeli government has sought to disconnect the construction in East Jerusalem from the rest of the West Bank , insisting that East Jerusaelm is part of the eternal , undivided capital of Israel .
East Jerusalem was occupied by Israel in 1967 .
The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) has sent a cease and desist notice to a committee member of the Australian Web Industry Association ( AWIA ) over his publication of photos he took at the Beijing Olympics on Flickr .
The IOC is demanding that Richard Giles , who as well as being in charge of communications for AWIA is also the founder of Australian web startup Scouta , remove the images because under the terms of entry into the Olympics , photos taken “ may not be used for any purpose other than private . ”
The C&D ( pictured below ) even goes as far as suggesting that Richard ’s use of the word “ Olympic ” is also illegal because it cannot be used without “ prior written consent . ”
The pictures on Richard ’s Flickr account ( at the time of writing still available online here ) include a mix of photographs taken in public places and of Olympic events Richard saw while he was in Beijing at the time .
The legal issues raised by the C&D are mixed on a couple of fronts .
The IOC has zero standing in demanding that Richard remove photographs outside of Olympic venues .
It would also have a very slim to zero claim over the use of the term Olympic in Richard describing pictures he has taken , for example a description on this shot stating “ Beijing Olympics Water Cube ” is a factual description of the shot , as opposed to any effort to hijack the Olympic trade mark .
The publication of the pictures on Flickr could be argued to constitute private use , but although the IOC does not specify the issue in their letter , their problem may lie with the fact that Richard has a creative commons license attached to the images .
It should be noted that the IOC makes no copyright claim over the images because it can’t : the copyright of the images belongs to Richard under US and Australian law ( Techdirt has an interesting article on the topic here . )
What it comes down to is an argument about the enforceability of the terms and conditions of the tickets Richard purchased to attend Olympic events , specifically relating to the pictures he took at those events ( as opposed to pictures taken outside venues . )
Solution Journalism explains the US situation :
“ … once you take the pictures of a public sporting event , you ( or your employer ) own the copyright of the picture , even if the pictures were taken in violation of a contractual agreement ( such as the terms on your ticket stub ) .
It is not possible to own “ the event . ”
This was legally decided in the 1997 case of NBA v. Motorola Inc . ”
There ’s also the question as to whether the photographs were taken on private property , a consideration in the enforcement of the terms and conditions in this case .
The law in the United States and Australia is clear on this point : people are usually free ( with some exceptions ) to take photographs on public property .
The Olympic infrastructure was publicly owned in China , so the ability to enforce T&C on non-privately held grounds becomes thin .
But all of this may be moot , because we have to consider where the pictures were taken , and in this case they were taken in China .
Would the terms and conditions of a ticket sold for an event in China be enforceable in Australia ?
Although the photos are hosted in the United States , the issue is n’t one of copyright , so there is no grounds for a takedown notice , instead it is a dispute between Richard personally in Australia and the IOC .
My bet is that it would be difficult for the IOC to get an Australian court to enforce the terms and conditions imposed on an event in a stadium in China , let alone events held in stadiums that were publicly owned .
If it was me , I ’d drop the CC licensing because that ’s a front that would be more difficult to fight on .

David Davis , who stunned the Conservative leadership last year by quitting as shadow Home Secretary , today signalled he wanted to return to the political frontline .

He told a fringe meeting organised by The Independent that he would be prepared to accept a Cabinet post under David Cameron as long as it was “ a proper job ” .
He also backed a future referendum on Britain ’s relationship with the European Union and backed limited tax cuts to help restore growth to the economy .
Mr Davis left the shadow Cabinet in June 2008 , forcing a by - election , in an attempt to push the issue of civil liberties up the political agenda .
His surprise departure provoked anger within the party leadership which regarded it as a futile gesture .
Mr Davis was unrepentant about his resignation , but said he would be ready to serve in government under Mr Cameron , who defeated him for the party leadership four years ago .
He said he would be interested in a Cabinet post as long as it was not a “ cosmetic ” appointment playing on his working - class background .
Mr Davis told the meeting : “ I do n’t want to be just an adornment .
If there ’s a proper job to be done , an issue to be dealt with , then sure , of course .
“ But that ’s not my call , and incidentally – just to make sure we do n’t put any pressure on David in that direction – I ’m also easy the other way . ”
“ I am very happy to be a backbencher because you can achieve all sorts of things from the backbenches . ”
He added , to laughter : “ There ’s not going to be any proper opposition if we win this election properly so I have some interest there too . ”

Mr Cameron has said he wants to bring more experienced faces into his top team and as a former minister Mr Davis , who has a following on the Tory right , would fit the bill .
But the Cameron team is likely to be wary of his advances , and might risk leaving him as a backbench troublemaker if the Tories win the election .
Mr Davis said he had “ not one regret ” over his decision to trigger a by - election in his Haltemprice and Howden constituency in east Yorkshire , even though neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats contested it .

He described the move as “ shock treatment ” to focus public attention on moves to lock up terrorist suspects for up to 42 days , introduce identity cards and expand the DNA database .
“ I think I was not a bad shadow Home Secretary , but I was not able by conventional methods to make people think long enough about the issues of liberty and freedom for them to see what the Labour party was actually up to . ”
Mr Davis , a former Europe Minister , said he was “ entirely comfortable ” with Mr Cameron ’s call for a referendum on the Lisbon treaty while it remains to be ratified by the Czech and Polish government , and refused to speculate beyond that moment .
But he said public opinion might still have to be tested on Britain ’s position within the EU .
“ At some point I think there will be another referendum , and it may not be about yes / no to Lisbon if Lisbon is already signed – it may be about something else . ”
He made clear he did not favour a vote on EU membership .
Asked if he meant a referendum on a new relationship between Britain and the EU , he replied : “ That sort of thing ” .
Mr Davis said the nation ’s huge deficit could not be tackled by spending cuts alone and called for targeted tax reductions to boost the economy .
He criticised corporation tax , which he said was driving foreign companies at its current rate , the proposed 50 p top rate of income tax and increased National Insurance contributions on employers .
“ There are some elements of taxation where the return for reducing the rate of tax is that you actually end up getting more tax , ” Mr Davis said .
GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday endorsed a U.N. report that accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza , passing a resolution that singled it out for censure without referring to wrongdoing by Hamas .

The report by South African jurist Richard Goldstone accuses both sides of war crimes in Gaza but is most critical of the Jewish state .
Up to 1,387 Palestinians and 13 Israelis were killed in the war last December and January .
In a special session proposed by the Palestinians , 25 states including China and Russia endorsed the resolution .
Six including the United States voted against , and 11 abstained .
Four , including France and Britain , did not vote .
Palestinian officials promptly called for further U.N. inquiries into Israel ’s actions .
“ The international community should make sure that the decision will become a precedent that will ensure the protection of the Palestinian people from any aggression , ” said Nabil Abu Rdaineh , aide to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas .
Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal said the decision was a victory for the Palestinian people and for rights and justice .
“ We tell all the countries in the world and the international community to try Israel and its political , security and military leadership for their crimes against our people , in domestic and international courts , ” Meshaal told al - Jazeera television .
But Israel , which has rejected the charges in the report , said the vote would impair the Middle East peace process .
“ This resolution provides encouragement for terrorist organizations worldwide and undermines global peace , ” the Israeli government said in a statement .
Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said he did not think the resolution would harm Israel .
“ I do n’t think that this vote today and any resolution or any reference of this Goldstone report will have any consequences in the future because Israel , like other decent countries that are under attack , will do what we need to do to defend ourselves , to defend our civilians , ” he told Israeli media .
The resolution endorsed all Goldstone ’s recommendations regarding Israel , including that the war crimes issue should be referred to the U.N. Security Council if the two sides failed to conduct credible domestic investigations with six months , and possibly then the International Criminal Court .
It did not mention Hamas , which was also criticized by Goldstone .
FRANCO -BRITISH LETTER
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sent a joint letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday urging him to initiate an “ independent and transparent ” inquiry into the conflict .
They also called for a stop to any expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and demanded greater access to Gaza , especially for humanitarian convoys , saying such moves would help relaunch the peace process .
U.S. charge d’affaires Douglas Griffiths said the United States had voted against the resolution because of its one - sided approach and “ sweeping conclusions of law , ” which could unsettle the fragile peace process .
In addition to slamming Israel ’s lack of cooperation with the Goldstone inquiry , the text “ strongly condemns all policies and measures taken by Israel , the occupying power , including those limiting access of Palestinians to their properties and holy sites particularly in Occupied East Jerusalem . ”
It also called for the U.N. General Assembly to consider the findings and for U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon to report back on Israel ’s adherence to them , moves that could keep Israel in the international spotlight .
The Human Rights Council had postponed discussion of the Gaza report under pressure from Washington aimed at getting the peace process back on track .
But Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas came under criticism at home for agreeing to the delay , leading to the request for a special session .
One of the most extraordinary features of Barack Obama 's victory over John McCain was his capture of 78 % of the Jewish vote .
To be sure , there was nothing extraordinary about the number itself .
Since 1928 , the average Jewish vote for the Democrat in presidential elections has been an amazing 75 % — far higher than that of any other ethno - religious group .
Yet there were reasons to think that it would be different in 2008 .
The main one was Israel .
Despite some slippage in concern for Israel among American Jews , most of them were still telling pollsters that their votes would be strongly influenced by the positions of the two candidates on the Jewish state .
This being the case , Mr. McCain 's long history of sympathy with Israel should have given him a distinct advantage over Mr. Obama , whose own history consisted of associating with outright enemies of the Jewish state like the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and the historian Rashid Khalidi .
Nevertheless , Mr. Obama beat Mr. McCain among Jewish voters by a staggering 57 points .
Except for African Americans , who gave him 95 % of their vote , Mr. Obama did far better with Jews than with any other ethnic or religious group .
Thus the Jewish vote for him was 25 points higher than the 53 % he scored with the electorate as a whole ; 35 points higher than the 43 % he scored with whites ; 11 points higher than the 67 % he scored with Hispanics ; 33 points higher than the 45 % he scored with Protestants ; and 24 points higher than the 54 % he scored with Catholics .
These numbers remind us of the extent to which the continued Jewish commitment to the Democratic Party has become an anomaly .
All the other ethno- religious groups that , like the Jews , formed part of the coalition forged by Franklin Delano Roosevelt in the 1930s have followed the rule that increasing prosperity generally leads to an increasing identification with the Republican Party .
But not the Jews .
As the late Jewish scholar Milton Himmelfarb said in the 1950s : " Jews earn like Episcopalians " — then the most prosperous minority group in America — " and vote like Puerto Ricans , " who were then the poorest .
Jews also remain far more heavily committed to the liberal agenda than any of their old ethno- religious New Deal partners .
As the eminent sociologist Nathan Glazer has put it , " whatever the promptings of their economic interests , " Jews have consistently supported " increased government spending , expanded benefits to the poor and lower classes , greater regulations on business , and the power of organized labor . "

“ HILLARY : The Movie ” broke no box - office records .
Nor , for that matter , is it believed to have played much of a part in the failure of its subject , Hillary Clinton , to become president — though the documentary , released in early 2008 , cannot have helped .
( Among its many claims was that the former First Lady was “ no Richard Nixon , she 's worse ” . )
Even so , this White House of Horrors flick may forever change American politics , and the role of business within it , depending on the outcome of a special hearing before the Supreme Court on September 9th .
At issue is a decision by America 's Federal Election Commission ( FEC ) to ban television screenings of the movie , or even trailers of it , within 30 days of Democratic primary elections , on the grounds that Citizens United , the group behind the movie , had received donations from companies .
That , ruled the FEC , made them subject to campaign - finance regulations prohibiting public endorsements ( or denigrations ) of specific candidates by companies — or , for that matter , by trade unions .
Citizens United
Lawyers for Citizens United argue that companies have a constitutional right to use their economic power to play whatever role they want to in the political process , under the same constitutional right to free speech enjoyed by every American citizen .
The Supreme Court seems to be taking this claim seriously .
It first heard arguments in the case on March 23rd but John Roberts , the chief justice , then took the unusual step of ordering the case to be reargued on September 9th .
He specifically asked for both sides to address the legitimacy of the two main precedents that currently restrain — at least to some extent — the involvement of firms in politics .
Until 1978 companies and unions had been subjected to increasing regulation of their political activities , a trend that the Supreme Court seemed happy to go along with .
That year , however , in First National Bank of Boston v Bellotti , it voided a Massachusetts law restricting corporate spending on state referendums on the grounds that it interfered with a corporate right of free speech .
To justify this , the Supreme Court cited what appears to be its only previous comment on the matter , during a railway company 's tax - assessment case in 1886 .
The then chief justice stated ( in what reads as an aside ) that : “ The court does not wish to hear argument on the question whether the provision in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution , which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws , applies to these corporations .
We are all of opinion that it does . ”
This ruling was later clarified by the Supreme Court under Chief Justice William Rehnquist , who had dissented from the Bellotti ruling , noting that a “ state grants to a business corporation the blessings of potentially perpetual life and limited liability to enhance its efficiency as an economic entity .
It might reasonably be concluded that those properties , so beneficial in the economic sphere , pose special dangers in the political sphere . ”
In 1990 , in Austin v Michigan Chamber of Commerce , the Supreme Court ruled that a state could prohibit a company from spending corporate funds in support of a political candidate .
In 2003 it threw out a challenge to the newly introduced McCain - Feingold act 's restrictions on corporate donations , ruling in McConnell v Federal Election Commission that “ issue advertisements ” paid for by companies could also be restricted if they were the “ functional equivalent ” of “ electioneering communications ” .
It is the Austin and McConnell precedents that Justice Roberts has asked to be debated on September 9th .
“ The idea that corporate and union speech is somehow inherently corrupting is nonsense , ” wrote Ted Olson in a recent op - ed in the Wall Street Journal .
“ Most corporations are small businesses , and they have every right to speak out when a candidate threatens the welfare of their employees or shareholders , ” said Mr Olson , a former Solicitor - General under George W. Bush .
“ Any decision that determines that corporations have less protection than individuals under the First Amendment would threaten the very institutions we depend upon to keep us informed . ”
Mr Olson will argue on behalf of Citizens United before the Supreme Court .
“ It is scarcely conceivable that the drafters of the constitution had anything resembling corporate entities in mind when they drafted the Bill of Rights ”
Yet the word “ corporation ” appears nowhere in the constitution or Bill of Rights .
“ It is scarcely conceivable that the drafters of the constitution had anything resembling corporate entities in mind when they drafted the Bill of Rights , ” argue Robert Monks , a veteran corporate - governance activist , and Peter Murray , in a recent essay .
All the individuals with a stake in a company have the right to express their views freely , the argument goes , so there is no need for the legal fiction of the corporate person to have such rights .
Besides , the two authors point out , even under the current regulations , corporate influence has been growing rapidly in Washington , DC .
The number of registered lobbyists in the capital increased from 3,400 in 1977 to almost 34,000 in 2006 .
In the 2008 House and Senate races $ 400 m was raised and spent for candidates by political - action committees , mostly linked to businesses .
“ Sadly , it appears that our judicial tradition of constitutional restraint with respect to issues affecting politics may be out the window when an opportunity arises to increase the power and influence of America 's corporate entities , ” they write .
In recent years the Supreme Court has made a growing number of rulings that seem to reflect a “ pro-business ” bias .
Throwing out restrictions on corporate speech would certainly confirm that impression , and some .
This tendency to favour business is widely regarded as originating under Lewis Powell , who was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1971 by President Nixon , and who wrote the majority ruling in the Bellotti case .
Shortly before he was appointed Powell wrote a private letter to the head of the US Chamber of Commerce ( a business lobby that is supporting Citizens United on September 9th ) , calling on corporate America to play a bigger role in politics .
As he put it , “ One should not postpone more direct political action , while awaiting the gradual change in public opinion to be effected through education and information .
Business must learn the lesson , long ago learned by labour and other self - interest groups .
This is the lesson that political power is necessary ; that such power must be assidously ( sic ) cultivated ; and that when necessary , it must be used aggressively and with determination — without embarrassment and without the reluctance which has been so characteristic of American business . ”
How ironic it would be if Powell 's strategy were to come to fruition at a moment when the public standing of business is arguably at its lowest since the era of the Robber Barons a century ago .
After all , it was then that progressives such as President Theodore Roosevelt tapped into public anger to introduce the first regulations on the use of corporate funds to influence politics .
Bernie Madoff had little to lose by confessing to masterminding the world ’s biggest Ponzi scheme — he ’s dying of cancer , sources told The Post .
Madoff , who is serving 150 years at a North Carolina federal lockup after pleading guilty to swindling more than $ 65 billion , has been telling fellow inmates he does not have much longer to live .
“ He ’s been taking about 20 pills a day for his cancer , ” said one inmate .
“ He talks about it all the time .
He ’s not doing very well . ”
There ’s been much speculation as to why Madoff took the entire fall for the scheme — and rumors of his suffering from pancreatic cancer surfaced many months before he arrived at the Butner , NC , complex in June .
The prisoners did not confirm that ’s the form of cancer he ’s suffering .
His lawyer did not return messages yesterday but , when previously asked by The Post , would neither confirm nor deny his client has cancer .
A lawyer for his wife , Ruth , also did not return messages .
Meanwhile , a bare - chested Bernie has been killing time at the prison participating in Native American religious purification ceremonies held at an on - grounds “ sweat lodge , ” other sources said .
He accepted invitations from Native American inmates to join them at their weekly prayer services .
The ceremonies involve praying , using heated rocks to induce sweat and smoking from a ceremonial pipe .
It is unclear whether the 71 - year - old Madoff checked out the ceremony because of health reasons .
For centuries , Native Americans have used sweat lodges to help detoxify the body mentally , spiritually and physically .
Inmates who participate are usually shirtless , and Madoff was no exception earlier this month during the first ceremony he attended , according to the prisoners .
Madoff is also making new friends at the prison complex through another unlikely clique — the homosexual posse , although the relationships are purely platonic , according to the sources .
“ In prison , you stick to your own kind , but he ’s doing the exact opposite by hanging with the Indians and [ homosexuals ] — so who is going to have his back ? ” wondered one jailbird .
Another inmate said various “ gangs ” at the prison are trying to recruit Bernie to their crews .
Some prisoners are also bending over backward trying to satisfy his hearty appetite by regularly cooking sandwich wraps for him back at their cells .
“ They ’re trying to kiss his butt , ” said one source .
Madoff was quickly assigned a job in the prison ’s engraving section when he first arrived , but last month he was transferred to a job painting fences .

There is no doubt that there is a huge amount of resource in place - between 1.7 and 2.5 trillion barrels , according to the Oil Sands Discovery Centre 's Oil Sands Story .
Of this , 173 billion barrels ( about 10 % ) is considered producible with current technology at 2006 prices ( $ 66 barrel for WTI ) .
Production to date has been relatively low , though - - only 1.2 million barrels a day in 2008 , according to Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers ( CAPP ) .
In Part 2 of this post , I provide some additional thoughts to help the reader come to his / her own conclusions about the future of the oil sands .
I talk a little about how Canada 's oil sands production fits in with its other sources of supply , and how this in turn relates to Canada 's exports .
I also look a little at some political issues and how these fit in with environmental issues .
A closely related post is this recent post .
This is a follow - up to Part 1 , which tells about my recent trip to Canada 's oil sands , on a trip sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) .
A big part of the reason that Canada can export oil to the United States is the fact that it is importing oil on its East Coast for its own use .
When one looks at oil sands in relationship to its other oil sources ( including imports ) , oil sands oil is only about one quarter of the total .
The non-oil sands portion is expected to decrease in the future , so a significant increase in oil sands production is needed simply to offset expected decreases elsewhere .
See my earlier post about this .
Unless oil prices rise above today 's level , and stay higher , it seems unlikely that there will be a major increase in oil sands production .
Don Thompson from the Oil Developers Group told us that in order to justify new development , the cost of West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) crude must be at least $ 80 a barrel .
CERA indicates in a new report ( free with registration ) that more than 70 % of proposed Oil Sands expansion projects were postponed , after the drop in oil prices in 2008 .
CERA quotes a needed WTI price of $ 65 to $ 85 barrel to justify Oil Sands expansion -- but based on a rate of return of 10 % -- which is probably not high enough .
Even beyond high oil prices , a major ramp up would also require a huge amount of investment funds .
For example , if one wanted to add 1 million barrels a day of upgraded oil by adding new mines and upgraders , it would require an investment of roughly $ 126 billion dollars , based on a CERA estimate of $ 126,000 per flowing barrel .
It would also require a huge amount of credit availability and a veritable army of workers .
In the absence of a major improvement in technology ( or perhaps even with one , since a big change in technology often takes a long time to implement ) , my estimate of the ramp up in oil sands production to 2020 is given below :
My rough estimate of Canada 's future oil sands production , other oil production , and overseas imports to their East Coast as shown in this post .
I am forecasting that oil sands production will approximately double by 2020 ( from 1.2 million barrels per day in 2008 , to 2.4 million barrels a day in 2020 ) .
This forecast , in part , reflects Tony Eriksen 's ( " ace's " ) calculation that projects already approved and in construction are expected to bring production up to 1.94 million bpd .
Growth beyond that is expected to be constrained for a number of reasons , including difficulty in obtaining sufficient investment funds , need for a high price of oil to justify new construction , difficulty in obtaining enough diluent , and the possibility that royalties will be higher as governments discover that oil companies are among the few companies from whom higher taxes might be extracted .
Note that even with this increase in oil sands production , the total supply of oil available to Canada ( including imports ) dips somewhat , and exports are likely to decline .
My forecast for oil sands production to 2020 is similar to the average of CERA 's two lower production forecasts , taken from the new CERA report .
CERA forecast of Oil Sands production , from report cited above .
Even in CERA 's " Barreling Ahead " forecast , the ramped up production will barely make a dent in the four or six Saudi Arabias of new oil production that Fatih Birol of the IEA has said will be needed if new production is to offset declines .
How much Canadian oil will the United States import ?
Canada 's exports to the United States , if it exports everything that is left over to the United States
Based on the forecast I made for oil sands production , the amount of imports to the United States are likely to drop somewhat , even if the United States continues to receive virtually all of Canada 's oil exports .
Will oil actually be exported to the US ?
But how likely is this scenario ?
When one reads Canadian material , it becomes clear that many Canadians would very much like to diversify the countries it exports to , even if currently nearly all pipelines lead from Canada to the United States .
With the US as its only export partner , Canada has little leverage in bargaining over price .
Also , there are details such as the US charging less for gasoline than Canada -- why should Canadians be taxed to keep their consumption down , and the same time Americans can buy Canadian oil and sell it for less ?
NAFTA limits changes right now , but over the long term , that can be changed .
Canada is already working on an approach that will allow it to export oil in directions other than the US , to help diversify its exports .
The approach is a rail link that acts like a pipeline , and can be implemented quite quickly .
China and others with few environmental concerns are particularly favored as export partners .
Canadian National ( CN ) also has tracks going East , so this approach could also be used to bring oil from western Canada to eastern Canada .
CN 's revolutionary pipeline on rails
The Canadian National Railway has developed a transformative strategy it calls the “ Pipeline on Rail ” which can move oil sands production quickly and cheaply to markets in North America or Asia . . .
CN could gear up its capacity to ship by rail up to four million barrels a day of oil at less cost and more quickly , bypassing the need to finance huge pipelines .
By the end of this year , the company will be shipping 10,000 barrels daily from producers whose reserves are now stranded .
Oils sands : Canada to China , Japan , India not US
This project , in its early stages , will eliminate three barriers to the development of Canada ’s vast oil sands : the cost , delays and financial risks involved in building multi-billion dollar pipelines ; the politics of obstruction south of the border from environmentalists and the danger of selling oil to monopoly buyers in the U.S. which has , in the past , resulted in contracts being ripped up when times were tough .
It also allows Canada to decouple from the American economy when it comes to its most important commodity which is oil products .
This is because all the oil sands production can be routed to the west coast for shipment to Asia or anywhere , thus avoiding monopoly pricing and bullying by the Americans .
Besides that advantage , oil sands are the national trump card in the future and the American economy , now sputtering , will never be as robust as before .
China is interested in investing in the oil sands .
Just today we read that China is paying C$ 1.9 billion for an oil sands investment .
Alberta will ramp up oil sands , to the best of its ability
Alberta is very dependent on the oil sands industry , both for jobs and revenue .
A report by Canadian Energy Research Institute ( CERI ) indicates
. . .every dollar spent on big oil projects stokes nearly $ 2.50 in further spending in Alberta , plus another roughly $ 2.50 in the rest of Canada .
In other words , a $ 10 - billion decrease in energy spending translates into about $ 60 - billion in lost economic activity across the country .
These revenues translate to tax revenues as well , so I find it difficult to believe that Alberta will cut back oil sands production voluntarily , or even limit new production .
If the US wants to cut back on imports because it is unhappy about CO2 or other environmental issues , I do n't see that as a huge problem to Canada .
Canada will sell its oil elsewhere .
Potential Impact of Loss of Oil Sands Production on US
From the US point of view , the potential loss of oil sands oil could be problematic .
Pipelines that feed the oil sands oil feed directly to the Midwest .
If oil sands oil is cut off , the ones likely to be hit the hardest hit are Midwestern American farmers .
We know from experience that when there is a shortage of oil , it is the folks at the end of the pipeline that are hit .
If the US decides it does n't want Canadian oil , or if Canada cuts us off , it is likely the folks at the end of the pipelines , away from Chicago and the Midwest that would be hit most -- places like North and South Dakota .
We could theoretically import more oil ( perhaps from OPEC ) to one of our coasts , and pipe it to the Midwest .
This might or might not be successful .
We do n't have a rationing plan to work around shortages of diesel fuel in the Midwest at this point -- maybe we should be thinking about such a plan .
How big an issue is environmental considerations ?
Oil sands oil has a number of environmental issues .
The one which is most obvious is the clearing of forests and taking up layers of overburden , storing them for many years , and then putting them back .
This is an issue primarily with mining , rather than in place ( in situ ) production .
Mining also tends to produce tailings ponds that are polluted with bitumen which is missed in the extraction process and with naphthenic acid .
There is concern that water from this tailings water will escape , or will harm birds that happen to land in it .
Companies use scarecrows and noise makers to attempt to keep birds away , but sometimes these precautions fail .
There is also concern about the amount of water use , especially if production of bitumen from the oil sands should scale up .
There are other concerns with the extracted sulphur , and whether it gets into the air , as sulphur dioxide gas .
As far as I know , the biggest issue with this is with upgrading operations , where the sulphur is separated out from the bitumen , such as that of Syncrude .
There are also metals that are found with the oil sands oil .
This can be both good and bad .
Bad because they could potentially be another source of pollution , and good , if they can be used as a source of rare earth minerals .
We read :
It has been found that the tailings are a unique and rich source of titanium ( 5 - 10 % on solids ) , zirconium ( 2 - 5 % ) and iron and rare earth minerals ( 8 - 12 % ) .
These valuable minerals are at present not being recovered .
The quote relates to a patent for a method of extraction of these minerals , by applying centrifuge methods to tailings ponds .
I expect we will see more centrifuge methods used in the future , both because of the possibility of financial gain , and because of a desire to reduce the amount of water stored in tailing ponds .
In situ production has much less direct environmental issues than mining , because it disturbs the soil much less , and because it leaves some of the potential pollutants underground .
In situ results in far less tailings ponds .
Most of the problems from in situ mining result simply from the fact that it is a low EROEI process , and uses a lot of natural gas in its production .
As a result , its carbon footprint is quite high .
While there are quite a few environmental issues , I think that what we hear may be exaggerated .
Scale - up Confusion
I think the issue of " scale up " is a matter of huge confusion to environmental groups .
How much worse will the environmental impact be , 10 or 20 years from now , if oil sands production continues to grow as forecast ?
Will the scale up have 20 times the current environmental impact of the worst company , or will the impact be quite small , as production is shifted more and more to in situ ( in place ) facilities , that do n't disturb the ground except to lay underground pipelines to heat the bitumen , and as new environmental laws begin to have more impact ?
Suppose that production actually grows to the extent forecast by the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers ( CAPP ) in its " growth case " .
( This is more of an increase than I am showing in my forecast earlier in the post . )
CAPP " Growth Case " forecast for Western Canada , including conventional as well as oil sands production , from June 2009 Report .
With this forecast , mining will roughly double between 2008 and 2025 , and in place production will triple .
Mining is the problematic one , in terms of land disturbance , water use , and tailing ponds .
At worst , it would seem to me that there will be double the amount of pollution issues in 2025 that we have now , based on the forecast increase in mining .
But even this estimate is high -- companies will be getting rid of legacy technology that holds them back environmentally , and recent law changes ( such as one passed in 2009 requiring much more rapid retirement of tailing ponds ) will further reduce the impact of increased production .
The amount of surface area that is currently covered by oil sands mines amounts to about 200 square miles ( 518 square kilometers ) , according to the CERA report .
This corresponds to a square 14 miles ( 23 kilometers ) on its side , which is smaller than the footprint of many cities .
What we are talking about , based on the CAPP mining forecasts , is , at worst , is doubling this footprint .
The equivalent square would have an area of 400 square miles , so would measure 20 miles ( 32.2 kilometers ) on a side .
Likely Area to be Disrupted by Mining
The confusion about scale up has led to very strange statements .
For example , I recently got an e-mail from the Sierra Club that said ( regarding the recent approval of the Alberta Clipper Pipeline ) :
This decision is deeply distressing because tar sands development in Alberta , Canada is creating an environmental catastrophe , with toxic tailings ponds so large they can be seen from space and plans to strip away the forests and peat lands in an area the size of Florida .
The entire area where oil sands deposits are located is the size of Florida .
But the mines themselves are tiny in comparison -- the size of a not very large city .
Perhaps we are talking about doubling this by 2025 .
The tailing ponds are contained within this area .
The percentage of this area covered by tailing ponds is now about 10 % .
This percentage may very well decrease , as new technology and new stricter laws are implemented .
When trees are cut , we were told that the trees are sold to the logging companies in the area , and thus offset other trees that would have been logged elsewhere .
The peat moss is stored for later reuse , according to the Province of Alberta .
Carbon Dioxide Emissions
Another question is how to measure carbon emissions .
Do you look at emissions during their whole life cycle , or only during extraction and refining ?
One would expect emissions to go up with the cost of producing oil ( or decline in EROEI ) , and that is generally what a CERA study shows .
The majority of the emissions relate to burning the oil that is produced , and these remain unchanged regardless of how low the EROEI of producing the oil is .
CERA 's comparison of Greenhouse Gas emissions , on a well to wheel basis .
Also , in terms of absolute level , if one compares CO2 emissions from oil sands operations to those of coal fired power plants , the coal fired power plants seem to be a much bigger problem .
If Alberta 's oil sands emissions were doubled ( as might possibly occur by 2025 ) , they still would be less than the coal fired electricity emissions of many US states .
Comparison of Oil Sands Emissions with Coal Fired Power Plant Emissions , from Setting the Record Straight presentation by Don Thompson .
Athabasca River Pollution
Another source of confusion is pollution of the Athabasca River .
The Athabasca River has been polluted for many years , and will continue to be polluted , because the river runs right through the oil sands area .
In fact , the oil sands deposit was discovered because of water pollution .
Oil Sands Natural Leakage to Athabasca River .
The health of rivers in the area is being monitored by Regional Aquatics Monitoring Program ( RAMP ) , a multi- stakeholder committee which includes representatives from oil companies , Ft. McMurray First Nation , Ft. McKay First Nation , Health Canada , Alberta Pacific Forest Industries , Fisheries and Oceans Canada , and many others .
Each year , RAMP issues a scientific report .
The indications of these reports seem to show little problem with water pollution or overuse , except for a general mercury pollution problem , which I understand is quite widespread , extending throughout the US and Canada .
Air Pollution
With all of the pollution problems I had heard about , I assumed air pollution would be a real problem .
Instead , the air was very clear .
Don Thomson of the Oil Sands Developers Group told us the air in Ft. McMurray tests better than that in any other major city in Canada for air pollution , on almost any common pollutant .
This may be in part because Ft. McMurray is several miles away from the mines .
I do n't have many details on air pollution , except that this is one of the areas regulated by the province of Alberta .
For example , Syncrude has undertaken a project called Syncrude 's Emissions Reduction Project ( SERP ) , designed to reduce stack emissions of sulphur compounds by 60 % from current approved levels by 2011 , under an agreement with the province .
Political Football Game
It seems to me that the Oil Sands are a huge political football game , and a good percentage of the environmental stories we hear are related to the posturing going on to win this football game .
Eastern Canada vs. Western Canada
First , Eastern Canada knows that it is likely to losing its imports from the East , due to peak oil .
It needs the oil from Alberta , but as long as Alberta regulates the oil sands and exports the oil from the oil sands to the United States , ( or to China ) , the East Coast is out of luck .
So if Eastern Canada can show that Alberta is not doing a good enough job of regulating the oil sands , then it can perhaps get control through new Federal regulation of the oil sands .
With that control , the Eastern part of Canada can be assured of getting oil .
Also , if they want to raise taxes , it will be helpful to them .
So we have reports like the one by Ecojustice , advocating additional Federal regulation .
US vs. Canada / China / Far East
Second , the US is the current recipient of the oil from the oil sands .
If the United States can be convinced that we do n't want it , because of environmental problems , that makes it all the easier for Eastern Canada to get it , or for Western Canada to export to China .
Western Canada really would prefer not to sell to the United States , since the price it gets from the US is perceived to be not the best , and the US is viewed as a bully .
Consultants / Think Tanks / Environmental Reports
Because of the political situation , there is a big " market " for reports by consultants and think tanks that show huge environmental problems .
There are also all kinds of ways one can legitimately show that there might be a problem .
For example :
Undermining the Report Card : The Oil Sands Report Card by WWF and the Pembina Institute .
This report compares the various oil sands projects against one another on a number of different variables , and makes statements such as , " If all companies had as low emissions as [ lowest company ] , there would be a savings of __________ in emissions . "
That is interesting , but does n't tell you whether there is a problem in the first place .
Statements like " Toxic tailing ponds filled with liquid mine wastes already cover more than 50 square kilometers , " also from Oil Sands Report Card .
Fifty square kilometers corresponds to a square a little over 7 kilometers ( 4.4 miles ) on a side .
Having so many tailings ponds is not great , but it is not as huge a problem as it is made out to be .
In the future , the amount is n't likely to grow much , with more in - situ production , and with recent changes in regulations regarding tailing ponds that require much quicker ends to the ponds .
Environmental Commissioner Renner told us that the oldest tailings pond ( which is the one with by far the most leakage issues ) is expected to be retired in 2010 .
Photos with captions like , " Oil sands operations remove rivers , forests , and wetlands in order to access the oil sands beneath , " also from Oil Sands Report Card .
The angle of the picture makes it look like a huge area is involved , and the way the caption is worded makes it sound like there are no steps being taken to put the pieces back in place according to current views of best environmental practices .
Statements by aboriginal groups that they have some cancer above normal levels .
Any of us who have studied probability know what the issue is here .
There are all kinds of little aboriginal groups with population of around 1,000 .
So if you look at enough of these groups , some of the groups will have a handful of people with one or another kind of cancer .
There is pollution in the area -- there always has been , because the river naturally runs through the oil sands .
The background pollution level may raise the probabilities of cancer a bit higher .
But there does n't seem to be any study showing an overall problem .
Not for Profit Issues
Not for Profit organizations are almost certainly under funding pressures .
If they want donations , it is to their advantage to make things sound as dire as possible .
If the leaders of the organizations truly do n't understand the size of scale up issues , these organizations can easily make statements that inadvertently overstate how bad the future will be , relative to today .
Also , needless to say , their analyses are not of the nature of a cost / benefit analysis .
They just tell you that there might be environmental costs involved , not that the oil eventually produced might provide benefits .
These organizations also do n't tell you about the likely environmental consequences , if the replacement oil were extracted in a much more heavily populated area , such as one of the OPEC countries .
The environmental impacts on the population would likely be worse -- but a lot less reported , and a lot less regulated .
People trust Not for Profits .
After all , they are " do good " organizations .
A person might think that someone is looking over the shoulder of Not for Profits to see that what they say is adequately supported by facts , but I can't see that that is happening at all .
This is complicated " stuff " to understand .
If these organizations miss the boat , or slant things in a way to get more donations , no one is likely the wiser .
How the Politics Will Work Out
No one really knows the answer to this -- but we certainly have a lot of people who are willing to take reports at face value , without considering the possibility that political maneuvering may be distorting what we see .
Since peak oil is not in the newspapers , even Oil Drum readers assume " higher - ups " do n't know about peak oil .
That is simply not true .
They know that imports may be declining in the future , and find Trojan horses in which to hide their causes .
There is one thing I am pretty sure of .
No politician in Canada really has any intention of stopping oil sands production based on environmental concerns , although a few may want to make certain it does n't grow too rapidly .
Mostly what politicians want is the oil , or the profits from the oil , for themselves .
If it takes an exaggeration or two about environmental issues to reach this end , so be it .
Note : Oil sands vs Tar sands .
The province of Alberta and CAPP prefer oil sands , so that is the terminology I have used .
Oil sands is also far more commonly used , according to Google .

Now is the winter of our discontent
Date and time Other phrases about :
What 's the meaning of the phrase ' Now is the winter of our discontent ' ?
' Now is the winter of our discontent ' express the idea that we have reached the depth of our unhappiness and that better times are ahead .
What 's the origin of the phrase ' Now is the winter of our discontent ' ?
' Now is the winter of our discontent ' , is the first line of Shakespeare 's Richard III , 1594 .
It needs to be read together with the second line of the play ' made glorious summer by this sun of York ' .
Shakespeare was using the summer / winter weather as a metaphor for the fortunes of tthe English House of York and its rivalry with the Plantagenets for the English throne .
The ' sun of York ' was n't of course a comment on Yorkshire weather but on the ' son of York ' Edward IV .
So , what Richard is saying is that we are now at the depth of the winter but the son of York ( Edward ) is like the sun of Summer and good times are on the way .
In this play Shakespeare presents an account of Richard 's character that , until the late 20th century , largely formed the popular opinion of him as a malevolent , deformed schemer .
Historians now view that representation as a dramatic plot device - necessary for the villainous role that Shakespeare had allocated him .
It is n't consistent with what is now known of Richard III , who in many ways showed himself to be an enlightened and forward - looking monarch .
The discovery of Richard 's skeleton under a car park in Leicester has provided precise evidence of the extent of his deformity .
While being somewhat curved Richard 's spinal deformity has now been shown to have been exaggerated and deliberately faked in some portraits .
' Sun of York ' , not ' son of York ' .
" Now is the winter of our discontent " are the opening words of the play and lay the groundwork for the portrait of Richard as a discontented man who is unhappy in a world that hates him .
Later Shakespeare describes himself as " Deformed , unfinished , sent before his time into this breathing world , scarce half made up " .
He says that as he " cannot prove a lover " he is " determined to be a villain " .
Whether Shakespeare believed the propaganda against Richard or whether he was happy to use it for dramatic effect is n't clear .
It is clear that brooding malevolence that Shakespeare has Richard personify mirrors the playwright 's view of the state of the English nation during the Wars of the Roses .
GLOUCESTER :
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York ;
And all the clouds that lour 'd upon our house
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried .
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths ;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments ;
Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings ,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures .
Grim - visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front ;
And now , instead of mounting barded steeds
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries ,
He capers nimbly in a lady 's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute .
But I , that am not shaped for sportive tricks ,
Nor made to court an amorous looking - glass ;
I , that am rudely stamp'd , and want love 's majesty
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph ;
I , that am curtail'd of this fair proportion ,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature ,
Deformed , unfinish'd , sent before my time
Into this breathing world , scarce half made up ,
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them ;
Why , I , in this weak piping time of peace ,
Have no delight to pass away the time ,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity :
And therefore , since I cannot prove a lover ,
To entertain these fair well - spoken days ,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days .
Plots have I laid , inductions dangerous ,
By drunken prophecies , libels and dreams ,
To set my brother Clarence and the king
In deadly hate the one against the other :
And if King Edward be as true and just
As I am subtle , false and treacherous ,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up ,
About a prophecy , which says that 'G '
Of Edward 's heirs the murderer shall be .
Dive , thoughts , down to my soul : here
Clarence comes .

With so much news lately about Google Voice , those who have n't kept up on every tiny development have found themselves lost .
What exactly is Google Voice ?
Is it a phone redirecting service ?
VoIP ? Voicemail ?
All of the above ?
None of the above ?
Even some of our staff members are confused about what Google Voice offers and why people would want to use it , so we thought it would be helpful to offer a guide to Google Voice for those just tuning in .
Google Voice originated as GrandCentral , an independent company that hit the scene in 2005 .
GrandCentral allowed users to register a new phone number and direct it to ring multiple phones ; it could also collect messages and act as your personal switchboard operator .
This sounds boring on the surface , but it provided a number of cool features , such as the ability to listen in on voicemail messages as they were being left or to tell a specific number that your phone number is no longer connected ( great for stalkers and crazed PR people , who are kind of like stalkers ) .
Google acquired GrandCentral in 2007 , and promptly sat on the project for nearly two years before it relaunched the service as Google Voice in March of 2009 .
Google did n't just take GrandCentral and slap a colorful logo on it , though .
The search giant made a number of improvements on the already nifty service , and it has become a must - have for the handful of early adopters who were lucky enough to get in either as a grandfathered GrandCentral user or through an invite .
Let 's look at what you can get out of the ( currently ) free service .
Calls
Users can register phone numbers in practically any area code they want , choosing local or faraway destinations .
Under Google , the service now allows you to choose words or witty phrases that your phone number spells out ( not present under GrandCentral ) , so have fun and good luck trying to grab ( 312 ) 55 - BALLS .
You cannot port an existing number of yours to Google Voice , however , which may be viewed as a downside to those who are married to a longtime cell number or the like .
( Update : Some readers have written in to say that it is possible to port a number . )
After that , the most basic service that Google Voice offers is call forwarding .
Forward calls to as many or as few numbers as you like , and you can even forward them to different phones based on who 's calling .
This is helpful if you 're like me and do n't want check - ins from the boss going to your cell phone , but you do want calls from dear ol ' mom and dad .
You can also set certain groups ( or individuals ) to be sent directly to Voicemail , to the Spam folder , or block the call altogether .
Another useful feature is the ability to screen callers — you can either have the calls sent directly to your phone with no filtering , or you can have Google ask them to say their name first .
The service will ring you , tell you who 's calling , and give you the option to take the call or send them to voicemail .
This is nice for numbers that you do n't recognize , as you would n't know who they 're from otherwise .
You can also change this behavior depending on a group ( Friends , Family , Work , etc. ) or an individual basis .
So it 's possible to always screen unknown numbers , for example , and always forward your friends directly .
This is where the service gives you the ability to listen in on voicemails as they are being left , too .
Receiving calls is just the beginning .
Through Google Voice , you can also make free calls to any US number .
These will appear to originate from your Google number even when you 're calling from your cell or your home line — the receiver 's caller ID will show your Google number ( therefore not giving away your other numbers ) .
You can also record phone calls that you 've received , although this functionality does not work with outgoing calls you make .
But if someone dials in , it 's possible to record interviews , catch important details for transcription later , or come up with some other nefarious plan for your Google Voice recordings .
It 's very helpful , although it would be more helpful if these recordings were transcribed like voicemails are ( read on ) .
Voicemail
By far the coolest feature of Google Voice 's voicemail is that the service automatically transcribes the voice messages left by callers and then sends the transcription to you through a variety of mediums .
For example , I receive my voicemails via text message and e-mail when they come in .
Not only is this faster than listening to the message a few times to get all the details , but it also gives me a written record that is easily stored for future reference .
Keep in mind , however , that the transcription is not always 100 percent accurate — from experience , I find that it 's about 80 percent , though you can usually fill in the blanks by looking at the context .
In any case , you can always listen to the voice recordings online .
Additionally , you can download an audio file of the recordings for your records , or grab some embed code for putting embarrassing postings on the Internet ( nota bene : people will usually be unhappy if you do this without their permission ) .
Or , if your voicemail is better suited for someone else — another family member , a coworker , etc. — you can forward the message onto that person .
SMS and miscellaneous features
When people SMS your Google Voice number , the message will go directly to one or more ( however many you have set up ) mobile phones .
You can respond to those SMSs directly from the phone , and that response will appear to come from your Google Voice number .
The cool part , though , is that you can also send and receive SMSs right from the Google Voice Web interface , meaning that you do n't have to whip out your phone every time you want to text your friend to ask why he 's late picking you up — assuming you 're in front of a computer already , that is .
Google Voice lets you archive your SMS logs too so that you can reach them anytime from the website .
For those worried about wasting mobile phone minutes , Google Voice lets you transfer your calls to another phone , right in the middle of the call .
When you 're on a phone call and press the * button , your other phones listed on the account will ring .
When you pick up the phone you want to use ( say , your home landline ) , you can hang up on the original phone and your call will still be in progress .
There are a handful of other features that Google Voice offers , but those are most of the big ones .
Those of us at Ars who have been using Google Voice since the GrandCentral days are really pleased with the changes Google has made thus far , and we have begun using it for everyday things like our work - related calls and routing calls between phones .
Whether all of these services will remain free forever is still up for debate .
But , given Google 's usual patterns , it 's unlikely that the company will begin charging regular users for the service .
Based on their other services , Google probably has some plan up its sleeve to offer a version of Google Voice for businesses that it will charge for ( similar to its already - existing Google Apps package ) .
If you can get access to Google Voice , give it a try , if only for the call filtering and voicemail transcribing features .

REUTERS / Lucy Nicholson
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - U.S. judges on Tuesday told California to prepare to release more than 40,000 of its 150,000 inmates to reduce overcrowding in state prisons , which suffer from massive healthcare problems .
The cash - strapped state already plans to release ailing and short - term inmates for budget issues .
That would clear up to 37,000 beds over two years , estimated California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Secretary Matthew Cate .
But he said an order from federal judges would set a “ dangerous precedent ” and argued at a news conference that California had cleaned up prisons and hired medical professionals to fill chronic gaps that had left prisoners without adequate physical or mental care .
The federal three - judge panel in February made a tentative ruling pointing toward release .
On Tuesday the judges ordered the state in 45 days to prepare a plan to cut overcrowding to 137.5 percent of capacity .
That would amount to a cut of 40,591 inmates in its 33 prisons , it said .
But officials intend to appeal a release order , which would follow Tuesday ’s order for a plan .

Below normal monsoon rains have been responsible for the drought
More than a quarter of India 's districts have been affected by drought , the country 's finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has said .
But the minister insisted that the government had a contingency plan and said there was " no point in pressing the panic button . "
Officials say that 161 of out of approximately 600 districts in India have been declared drought - affected .
Lower monsoon rainfall than normal is responsible for the drought .
Northern Bihar and Haryana are the worst affected states , reports say .
The deficient rainfall is likely to result in a 20 % drop in the sowing of summer crops , Mr Mukherjee said .
Food security
" This country managed the century 's worst drought in 1987 .
We transported drinking water through the railways .
We organised fodder for the cattle , " he said .
" This country has the experience of handling the situation and I will advise not to press the panic button " .
Mr Mukherjee insisted that the economy would grow by more than 6 % despite the drought .
Though many of the affected districts are not major crop - producing areas , the drought is likely to hit farm output and lead to food inflation , analysts say .
Reports say Prime Minister Manmohan Singh convened a meeting of state chief ministers on Monday to discuss food security in light of the drought .
The leader of a delegation of businessmen who met Mr Singh on Tuesday said the prime minister was confident of containing food inflation .
" He was quite confident that given the buffer stock , it would be able to handle the food inflation , " Amit Mitra told reporters .
Monsoon rains are critical to India 's farm prospects , which account for a sixth of its economic output .
Up to 70 % of Indians are dependent on farm incomes , and about 60 % of India 's farms depend on rains .
Irrigation networks are dismissed by critics as inadequate .
The summer rains are crucial to crops such as rice , soybean , sugarcane and cotton .

I shall surely acquire the capacity to do it ,
even if I may not have it at the beginning . ”

Maybe life is n’t exactly what you want it to be .
Life could be like a soft drink that has lost its fizz .
Life could be like a river that has lost its way .
Life could be driving on an empty tank of gas .
Life could be like standing in the fog .
Life could be like being a bird unable to fly .
Life could be singing a song without a voice .
Life could be like walking in the mud .
Life could feel like something is missing and maybe it is , but it does n’t have to be that way .
What does your life feel like ?
It is too quiet , is it too loud , is it too hard , is it too heavy , is it too dark , or is it missing something ?

Only around 500 copies were printed
A student who auctioned off his rare first edition of a Harry Potter book for £ 7,200 to fund his university degree has been found dead in his room .
Toby Rundle , 21 , from Somerset , sold his hardback copy of JK Rowling 's Harry Potter and The Philosopher 's Stone .
He was studying Classics and English at Oxford University 's Lady Margaret Hall and was discovered by a fellow student on Thursday .
The university said it was " deeply saddened " by his death .
Dr Frances Lannon , principal of Lady Margaret Hall , said : ' We were deeply saddened by the death of Toby Rundle , a third - year undergraduate at Lady Margaret Hall .
" Toby was a student of Classics and English and was well liked by everyone in college .
" Our condolences and thoughts are with his family and friends at this very difficult time . "
A spokeswoman said the university 's counselling service is offering additional support to students at Lady Margaret Hall .
The book Mr Rundle , of Wilton , sold was given to him by his mother while he was at boarding school .
It was one of only 500 published by Bloomsbury in 1997 , which was auctioned at Bonhams ' Books , Maps , Manuscripts and Photographs Sale in London in June 2007 .
Hilarious .
And now comes U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson , who dynamited that model , calling Republicans knuckle - dragging obstructionists who want the sick to " die quickly . "
If this fits the definition of unstable and unhinged , it certainly seems to have served a very lucid purpose .
The Republicans are cowering in knock - kneed terror .
Potential challengers are dropping out with comical regularity .
The last credible challenger standing is former state Sen .
Dan Webster , who is so conflicted he can't say yes and he can't say no .
Dan Webster is no longer standing .
Former state Sen. Dan Webster -- to no one 's surprise -- has issued a statement saying he 's not running against freshman U.S. Rep.
Alan Grayson , D - Orlando .
But Webster is just the latest in a long string of GOP recruitment failures in the district , as Orlando Sentinel columnist Mike Thomas so entertainingly catalogs :
The Republicans look like a bunch of Chihuahuas yapping at the Rottweiler behind the fence .
But this Rottweiler not only is snarling and frothing at the mouth , it also went to Harvard .
It is a crazy and smart Rottweiler .
So there is lots of yapping , but nobody is about to open the gate and take him on .
Consider state Rep. Steve Precourt .
Last week he boldly announced that Grayson was an " egomaniacal , socialist , loose cannon . "
Then he announced someone else would have to do something about it because he was n't running .
Yap .
Yap . Yap .
Orange Mayor Rich Crotty once was considered the Republicans ' best hope .
In June , Grayson released a seven - page letter explaining in detail how he would gut Crotty over Crotty 's leadership of the expressway authority .
In early July , Crotty said he had made a decision and would announce it shortly .
Days turned to weeks , weeks turned to months — until finally , the mayor gave us his verdict .
He could beat Grayson " handily . "
But he was n't going to run .
Pretty slick .
He declared victory and bowed out of the race .
The Republicans also tried and failed to recruit Florida House Speaker Larry Cretul of Ocala .
At one point , CNL Financial Group President Tim Seneff seemed like a perfect choice .
He had no political record to attack , and he had deep pockets to offset what is expected to be a lackluster fundraising cycle .
Seneff did n't dawdle like the politicians .
A couple days after his name surfaced , he opted out .
The GOP is down to what , their sixth or seventh choice ?
After years of DLC / Third Way - style Democrats , they 're not used to facing the fighting kind .
They are completely lost , without a clue what to do .
The Bush in Obama :
Meet the new boss , same as the old boss
By Naomi Wolf
Hearings are underway in the US Senate to assess what to do with the 240 detainees still behind bars at Guantanamo Bay , and what will become of the military tribunals and detention without trial that the administration of former US president George W. Bush and a compliant Congress put into place .
The US Congress is also debating what will happen to the detention camp itself , which was established in 2002 to house men who were allegedly “ the worst of the worst , ” in a setting deliberately framed by Bush attorneys as “ legal outer space . ”
But are those Senate hearings actually window dressing on a new reality that is just as bad as the old one — and in some ways worse ?
Military tribunals without due process are up and running again .
While US President Barack Obama has released a few prisoners , notably Chinese Uighurs , and sent another for a real trial in New York City , he is now , chillingly , signaling that he is about to begin “ preventive detention , ” which would empower him to hold forever an unspecified number of prisoners without charges or trials .
On a visit to Guantanamo , Department of Defense spokesman Joe DellaVedova told me that a series of panels were reviewing the detainees ’ files , a process that will take until the end of this year .
The review will sort the detainees into three categories : those who will be tried in criminal courts in the US ; those who will be released and sent to other countries ; and those who “ ca n’t be released and ca n’t be tried and so have to be held indefinitely … what is being called ‘ preventive detention . ’”
I was stunned .
DellaVedova ’s comment suggested that the review process was merely political theater .
If there is to be a genuine review of the accusations against these detainees , how can it be known in advance that the third category will be required ?
Indefinite preventive detention is , of course , the foundation of a police state .
Human rights organizations knew that Obama had prepared the way , in public - relations terms , for some criminal trials — talking up the “ supermax ” security of some US prisons , and noting that other terrorists have successfully been tried by the US ’ justice system .
( Other democracies , such as the UK and Spain , always try terrorism suspects , including alleged al - Qaeda members , in ordinary criminal trials . )
But , six months after he ordered an end to torture and CIA “ black sites , ” and promised to close Guantanamo within a year , Obama seems to be re-branding Bush ’s worst excesses .
He has brought in planeloads of journalists to Guantanamo Bay to show them a “ safe , transparent and humane ” facility that now offers fresh baklava and video viewing from a shackled loveseat .
But the roughly 240 detainees remain incarcerated without having been charged with any crime , and will still not get a fair trial , even under Obama ’s proposed military commissions .
After all , the prosecutor , the judge and the “ panel ” are all to be US government employees .
Furthermore , Obama ’s Justice Department has invoked Bush ’s argument that the State Secrets
Act bars evidence about torture from being disclosed , which means that anyone who was tortured can never appear in court .
Moreover , Obama has sought to suppress hundreds of photographs depicting sexual assault in US - run prisons , and has done nothing to roll back the Patriot Act .
Why should Obama , who has carefully studied the Constitution , be backtracking this way ?
First , he does not dare appear to be “ soft on terror . ”
Second , perhaps he needs to be able to try the Guantanamo detainees in a rigged setting , or even keep them from trial forever : Lawyers claim that torture , including sexual torture , was so endemic in the CIA and the military that Obama could be holding scores , if not hundreds , of prisoners whose bodies are crime scenes .
Wells Dixon , a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights who represents some of the detainees , said the Obama administration cannot risk calling the torture practices crimes , so it calls them “ classified sources and methods ” that can not be revealed in court .
“ I ca n’t even tell you about the way my clients were tortured or I will be prosecuted , ” he says .
In fact , even the explanation of why this material is classified cannot be reproduced , because the explanation itself is privileged .
Nor has the access of lawyers to their Guantanamo clients improved under Obama .
“ We are subject in all detainee cases to a protective order , ” Dixon says .
“ Under this order , everything the detainee says is classified , ” unless the Department of Defense “ Privilege Team ” decides otherwise , he says .
Dixon then told me a revealing story of one of his clients , Majid Khan , a so - called “ high - value detainee ” who was held for three years in CIA “ black sites . ”
Khan was tortured , Dixon said , though “ the government would say that what happened to him is an ‘ intelligence source or method . ’ ”
Because Dixon has a security clearance , he cannot discuss those classified “ sources and methods . ”
On the other hand , Dixon continued : “ When the government does something to [ Khan ] that they say is classified , they have disclosed to him classified information .
But since he does n’t have a security clearance , there is nothing that prevents him , unlike me , from saying to the outside world : ‘ This is what they did to me . ’
Nothing prevents that — except for the fact that he is physically in custody . ” ’
The “ logical conclusion , ” Dixon says , is that Khan “ must be detained for the rest of his life — regardless of whether he is ever charged with a crime — because if he was ever released , nothing would prevent him from disclosing this information .
Majid Khan — and there are many more like him — is a classic product of the Bush administration ’s disregard for the fundamental principles of the rule of law .
Unfortunately , Obama ’s administration , for all its lofty rhetoric , appears too willing to perpetuate it .

Like most people , I was initially confused by EMI ’s decision to release remastered versions of all 13 albums by the Liverpool pop group Beatles , a 1960s band so obscure that their music is not even available on iTunes .
The entire proposition seems like a boondoggle .
I mean , who is interested in old music ?
And who would want to listen to anything so inconveniently delivered on massive four - inch metal discs with sharp , dangerous edges ?
The answer : no one .
When the box arrived in the mail , I briefly considered smashing the entire unopened collection with a ball - peen hammer and throwing it into the mouth of a lion .
But then , against my better judgment , I arbitrarily decided to give this hippie shit an informal listen .
And I gotta admit — I ’m impressed .
This band was mad prolific .

It is not easy to categorize the Beatles ’ music ; more than any other group , their sound can be described as “ Beatlesque . ”
It ’s akin to a combination of Badfinger , Oasis , Corner Shop , and everyother rock band that ’s ever existed .
The clandestine power derived from the autonomy of the group ’s composition — each Beatle has his own distinct persona , even though their given names are almost impossible to remember .
There was John Lennon ( the mean one ) , Paul McCartney ( the hummus eater ) , George Harrison ( the best dancer ) , and drummer Ringo Starr ( The Cat ) .
Even the most casual consumers will be overwhelmed by the level of invention and the degree of change displayed over their scant eight - year recording career , a span complicated by McCartney ’s tragic 1966 death and the 1968 addition of Lennon ’s wife Yoko Ono , a woman so beloved by the band that they requested her physical presence in the studio during the making of Let It Be .

There are 217 songs on this anthology , many of which seem like snippets of conversation between teenagers who spend an inordinate amount of time at the post office .
The Beatles ’ “ long play ” debut , Please Please Me , came in 1963 , opening with a few rudimentary remarks from Mr. McCartney : “ Well , she was just 17 / If you know what I mean . ”
If this is supposed to indicate that the female in question was born in 1946 , then yes , we know exactly what you mean , Paul .
If it means something else , I remain in the dark .
These young , sensitive , genteel - yet - stalkerish Beatles sure did spend a lot of time thinking about girls .
Virtually every song they wrote during this period focuses on the establishment and recognition of consensual romance , often through paper and quill ( “ P.S. I Love You ” ) , sometimes by means of monosyllabic nonsense ( “ Love Me Do ” ) , and occasionally through oral sex ( “ Please Please Me ” ) .
The intensely private Mr. Harrison asks a few coquettish questions two - thirds of the way through the opus ( “ Do You Want To Know A Secret ” ) before Mr. Lennon obliterates the back door with the greatest rock voice of all time , accidentally inventing Matthew Broderick ’s career .
There are a few bricks hither and yon ( thanks for wasting 123 seconds of my precious life , Bobby Scott and Ric Marlow ) but on balance , I have to give Please Please Me an A , despite the fact that it does n’t really have a proper single .
Things get more interesting on With The Beatles , particularly for audiences who feel the hi-hat should be the dominant musical instrument on all musical recordings .
Only one track lasts longer than three minutes , but structurally , it would appear that the Beatles were more musical than any songwriters who had ever come before them , even when performing material that had been conceived for The Music Man .
It ’s hard to understand why the rock press was n’t covering the Beatles during this stretch of their career ; one can only assume that the band members ’ lack of charisma and uneasy rapport made them unappealing to the mainstream media .
Still , the music itself has verve — With The Beatles earns another A .

A Hard Day ’s Night provided the soundtrack for a 1964 British movie of the same name , a film mostly remembered for its subtle advocacy of euthanasia .
The album initiates like the Pixies ’ “ Here Comes Your Man , ” and never gets any worse .
These Beatles were doomed to a career in the cut - out bin of record stores , but they were clearly learning lessons about life :
Though they ’d covered “ Money ( That ’s What I Want ) ” just one year before , they had now reached the conclusion that money cannot purchase love .
It was a period of inner growth and introspection — they wanted to know why people cry and why people lie , and they embraced the impermanent pleasure of dance .
They also experimented with the harmonica , but that turned out okay .
I was originally going to give Hard Day ’s Night an A- , but then I heard the middle eighth from “ You Ca n’t Do That ” ( “ Ev’rybody ’s greeeeeen / ’ Cause I ’m the one who won your love ” ) , so I ’m changing my grade to A .
I assume the accompanying movie is on hulu or something , but I do n’t feel like searching for it .

The Beatles get darker and ( I guess ) cheaper on Beatles For Sale , now fixating on their insecurities ( “ I ’m A Loser ” ) and how difficult it is to waltz a girl into bed when her ex is a corpse ( “ Baby ’s In Black ” ) .
There are a bunch of unexpected covers on this album , so it ’s kind of like Van Halen ’s Diver Down .
It only warrants a B , despite the tear - generating mondo- pleasure of “ I ’ll Follow The Sun . ”
More importantly , Beatles For Sale nicely sets the supper table for Help ! , a mesmerizing combination of who the Beatles used to be and who they were about to become .
The signature track is “ Yesterday ” ( the last song Mr. McCartney recorded before his death in an early - morning car accident ) , but the best cut is “ You ’re Going To Lose That Girl , ” a song that oozes with moral ambiguity .
Is “ You ’re Going To Lose That Girl ” an example of Mr. McCartney ’s fresh - faced enlightenment ( in that he threatens to punish some dude for being an unresponsive boyfriend ) , or an illustration of Mr. Lennon ’s quiet misogyny ( in that he views women as empty , non-specific possessions that can be pillaged from male rivals ) ?
Each possibility seems both plausible and impossible .
What makes Beatles lyrics so wonderful is not that they can be interpreted to mean whatever the listener wants ; what makes them wonderful is the way they seamlessly adopt contradictory ( yet equally valid ) interpretations as the listener matures .
It ’s unfathomable how a couple of going - nowhere guys in their early 20s could be this emotively sophisticated , but that ’s why the little - known Help ! gets an A .
After Mr. McCartney was buried near Beaconsfield Road in Liverpool , Beatles bass - playing duties were secretly assigned to William Campbell , a McCartney sound - alike and an NBA - caliber smokehound .
This lineup change resulted in the companion albums Rubber Soul and Revolver , both of which are okay .
Despite its commercial failure , Rubber Soul allegedly caused half - deaf Brian Wilson to make Pet Sounds .
( I assume this is also why EMI released a mono version of the catalogue — it allows consumers to experience this album the same way Wilson did . )
If you like harmonies or guitar overdubs or the sun or Norwegian lesbians or taking drugs during funerals , you will probably sleep with these records on the first date .
Rubber Soul gets an A - because I do n’t speak French .
Revolver gets an A+ , mostly because of “ She Said She Said ” and “ For No One , ” but partially because I hate filing my taxes .

1967 proved to be a turning point for the Beatles — the overwhelming lack of public interest made touring a fiscal impossibility , subsequently forcing them to focus exclusively on studio recordings .
Spearheaded by the increasingly mustachioed Fake Paul , the four Beatles donned comedic Technicolor dreamcoats , consumed 700 sheets of mediocre acid on the roof of the studio , and proceeded to make Sgt. Pepper ’s Lonely Hearts Club Band , a groundbreaking album no one actually likes .
A concept album about finding a halfway decent song for Ringo , Sgt. Pepper has a few satisfactory moments ( “ Lovely Rita ” totally nails the experience of almost having sex with a city employee ) , but this is only B+ work .
It mostly seems like a slightly superior incarnation of The Rolling Stones ’ Their Satanic Majesties Request , a record that ( ironically ) came out seven months after this one .
Pop archivists might be intrigued by this strange parallel between the Beatles and the Stones catalogue — it often seems as if every interesting thing The Rolling Stones ever did was directly preceded by something the Beatles had already accomplished , and it almost feels like the Stones completely stopped evolving once the Beatles broke up in 1970 .
But this , of course , is simply a coincidence .
I mean , what kind of bozo would compare the Beatles to The Rolling Stones ?

After the humiliating public failure of Pepper , the Beatles returned to form with Magical Mystery Tour , an unsubtle compilation of the trippiest ( “ Blue Jay Way ” ) and kid-friendliest ( “ Your Mother Should Know ” ) material they ever made .
“ I Am The Walrus ” seems like sarcasm , but “ Penny Lane ” makes me want to purchase a digital camera and apply to barber college .
Will history ultimately validate Magical Mystery Tour as the band ’s signature work ?
Only time will tell .
A . Now hitting on all 16 cylinders , the Beatles bolted back to the woodshed for The Beatles , a blandly designed masterwork that could inspire any reasonable citizen of California to launch a race war .
To this day , we do n’t know much about the four men who comprised the Beatles , but listening to this exceedingly non-black album makes one detail totally clear — these guys truly loved each other .
How else could they make such wonderful music ?
In fact , they adored and trusted each other so much that they did n’t even feel the need to perform some of the songs together .
It must have been a great era to be in this band .
Amazingly , they even wrangled a cameo from noted blues musician Eric Clapton ( still best known for his contributions to John Mayhall ’s Bluesbreakers ) .
The Beatles is almost beyond an A+ ; in retrospect , they probably should have made this a triple album .
If nothing else , they could have simply included the five Pepper -y songs from Yellow Submarine ( C- ) , which I think might have been a Halloween record .
Let It
Be comes next ( or last , depending on how you view the universe ) , and it ’s a wholly confusing project — it ’s often difficult to tell who is playing lead guitar , and many of the songs could either be about having sex or dropping out of society , which might be the same thing .
Fake Paul ’s beard looks tremendous , and his ( increasingly less - lilting ) songs are still beautiful , but his focus feels askew ; he seems like a guy who wants to make a record with his wife ( which is what Mr. Lennon was already doing , although for totally different reasons ) .
“ I ’ve Got A Feeling ” is my preferred track , but it ’s also the first time I really do n’t believe what these fellows are trying to tell me .
I give Let It Be a B- , although The Replacements get an A and the cast of Sesame Street gets an B +.

Though the artwork for Abbey Road seems eerily familiar ( that ’s actually my car in the photo ’s background ) , the music it symbolizes is vaguely alien — I do n’t know why they wrote a song about a Clue character , but that ’s par for the course for these lovemaking , chain - smoking longhairs .
The opener sucks ( seems as crappy as mid-period Aerosmith ) , but Mr. Harrison follows with a wedding song that effortlessly proves why people who try to quantify visceral emotion should just stop trying .
The entire band seems oddly unserious on this endeavor , but in the best possible way — for the first time in a long time , they sound as free as they look .
That said , the audio quality is especially heavy and detailed ; one suspects most of the arduous lifting on Abbey Road fell on the shoulders of unheralded Jeff Beck producer George Martin .
Everything ends with “ The End , ” but then Fake Paul decided to add a superfluous 24 - second mini-song that wipes away any historical closure Abbey Road might have otherwise achieved .
The real Mr. McCartney would have never even considered such frivolity .
I give Abbey Road an A , but begrudgingly .

I ’ve noticed that this EMI box also includes the gratuitously titled singles collection Past Masters , but I ’m not even going to play it .
How could a song called “ Rain ” not be boring ?
I feel like I ’ve already heard enough .
These are nice little albums , but I ca n’t imagine anyone actually shelling out $ 260 to buy these discs .
There ’s just too much great free music on the Internet , you know ?
You might find the instructional , third - person perspective of “ Sie Leibt Dich ” charming and snappy ( particularly if you ’re trying to learn German the hard way ) , but first check out “ myspace.org , ” a popular website with a forward - thinking musical flavor .
That , my rockers , is the future .
That , and videogames .
Chuck Klosterman is the author of six books , including the 2008 novel Downtown Owl and the forthcoming collection Eating The Dinosaur .
We all know when we see that photo of Joe Wilson screaming at last week 's Joint Session of Congress , surrounded by similarly pale , near death , mostly balding white men , that it was n't just the Democratic president speaking that got him all riled up , it was the black guy up there at the podium .
Well , Ms. Dowd saw the same picture :
Surrounded by middle - aged white guys — a sepia snapshot of the days when such pols ran Washington like their own men ’s club — Joe Wilson yelled " You lie ! " at a president who did n’t .
But , fair or not , what I heard was an unspoken word in the air :
You lie , boy !
As she also says , and I think a lot of us would agree , we do n't like seeing race as the base reason for such outbursts and the rest of the idiocy we 've seen this past summer , but it is hard to deny when we see the source of it .
I ’ve been loath to admit that the shrieking lunacy of the summer — the frantic efforts to paint our first black president as the Other , a foreigner , socialist , fascist , Marxist , racist , Commie , Nazi ; a cad who would snuff old people ; a snake who would indoctrinate kids — had much to do with race .
I tended to agree with some Obama advisers that Democratic presidents typically have provoked a frothing response from paranoids — from Father Coughlin against F.D.R. to Joe McCarthy against Truman to the John Birchers against J.F.K. and the vast right - wing conspiracy against Bill Clinton .
But Wilson ’s shocking disrespect for the office of the president — no Democrat ever shouted " liar " at W. when he was hawking a fake case for war in Iraq — convinced me :
Some people just ca n’t believe a black man is president and will never accept it .
But this goes a lot deeper than Joe Wilson .
It would seem to get deep into the entire culture of South Carolina .
Dowd cites former Democratic Party chief Don Fowler , who teaches politics at the University of South Carolina .
" A good many people in South Carolina really reject the notion that we ’re part of the union . "
I guess that explains nullification in 1828 , secession back in 1860 , and the insanity of 2009 .
According to Dowd they have always feared two things down south - blacks and the Feds ... and the President is both .
It all makes too much sense to be wrong .
It 's also incredibly sad that race plays so much of part of this story almost a 145 years after the Civil War ended .

UPDATE : Wow ...
I can't believe the response this has gotten .
Thanks for the support .
I was just lucky to catch MoDo on one of her relatively rare good days .
Just a couple of additional thoughts after going through the comments .
There is no doubt that the entire white population of the south is NOT racists .
Those feelings just seem to heavily concentrated in that part of the country .
Just the same , there ARE some deep pockets of racism in other areas as well .
I 'm in NYC , and in my little corner , there is a surprising amount of prejudice against not just the President , but of anyone who is n't white and who 's ancestors did n't arrive here before World War II .
Even moreso , in my neighborhood these people see illegal immigrants as the cause for simply everything that they do not like .
If they stub their toe in the morning , they 'd blame the Mexican or Pakistani ( legal or not ) who probably did their gardening .
Dowd 's column and my diary even provoked some hate mail to be found this morning :
you sound like some skinny white whiny pussy in a schoolyard who just had his ass kicked .
you people really need to stop playing that ole race card , it has lost its meaning .
boring indeed .
people know damn well , we oppose the communist in office .
btw.. if you hate white people so much , maybe you could paint your face white .
Reid .
Clinton , Kerry , Schumer .

If I lost about 15 pounds , then I would be .

Wow .
Ignorant post .
If President Obama was white his policies would be just as bad for the country .
Get over it and defend you beliefs with something other than race ........ Your pethetic
Why do these people have such " pethetic " spelling ?
A researcher who examined 10,000 Hotmail , MSN and Live.com passwords that were recently exposed online has published an analysis of the list and found that " 123456 " was the most commonly used password , appearing 64 times .
Forty - two percent of the passwords used lowercase letters from " a to z " ; only 6 percent mixed alpha-numeric and other characters .
Many of the top 20 passwords used were Spanish names , such as Alejandra and Alberto , suggesting that the victims were in Spanish - speaking communities .
Nearly 2,000 of the passwords were only six characters long .
The longest password was 30 characters – lafaroleratropezoooooooooooooo .
The 10,000 passwords and user names , believed to be booty from a phishing attack , were posted over the weekend to the clipboard site PasteBin .
The site owner has since removed the list , but Bogdan Calin of Acunetix grabbed the passwords before it disappeared .
The list included only online account addresses that began with " A " or " B , " suggesting that the list was only part of a larger cache of credentials .
On Tuesday , the BBC reported that it had viewed a second list of more than 20,000 account credentials that included Gmail , Yahoo and AOL accounts , and that Google had uncovered a third list containing an unknown number of accounts .
Some of the accounts on the list of 20,000 names the BBC saw appeared to be old , unused or fake , though many were genuine .
The list also included Comcast and Earthlink accounts .
Both Google and Microsoft , which own Gmail and Hotmail , MSN and Live.com respectively , have taken measures to block use of the exposed accounts until the legitimate users can reset their passwords .

Hunters Nightclub , in Elk Grove Village outside of Chicago , recently implemented a new entrance requirement because of cross-dressing prostitutes .
However , the new rule ( a valid photo ID that matches their " gender presentation " ) is presenting some issues for transgender people .
The Chicago Tribune reports :
" Hunters Nightclub reluctantly imposed its new ID requirement because cross-dressing prostitutes were advertising on Craigslist and mentioning the establishment , said manager Peter Landorf .
' They 're implying they 're coming here , ' said Landorf , whose new rule could cut down on his cross - dressing clientele .
' If it is prostitution in any form , that could cost me my liquor license . '
Under the new admission rule , cross -dressers must have a government - issued photo ID that looks like the person presenting it at the bar .
That , of course , is a serious hurdle for people like Andy , a ' part - time transgender woman ' who lives in Goshen , Ind. , but goes to Chicago to ' dress ' as Jeanette .
The ID requirement is unfair , he said . '
Since I am not a full - time trans , it is not really feasible for me to have my ' femme ' photo on my license , ' he said .
' I do not even know if they would allow it . …
This is discrimination , pure and simple . '
And , according to Ed Yohnka , spokesman for the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois , it could be . "
The club 's owners say they are working on a solution .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Hours after U.S. troops handed over control of Iraq ’s cities to its domestic security forces , a car bomb in the northern city of Kirkuk killed at least 32 people and wounded more than 100 on Tuesday , police said .
The blast tore through a busy market in a largely Kurdish part of the city , which is regarded as a potential flashpoint between ethnic Kurds , Arabs and Turkmen .
The U.S. pullback to rural bases from towns and cities is the first step toward a full U.S. withdrawal by 2012 agreed under a bilateral security pact .
Some Iraqis fear it leaves them open to attack by insurgent groups but many Iraqis celebrated what the government named “ National Sovereignty Day , ” more than six years after the U.S. - led invasion to topple Saddam Hussein .
Citizens and Iraqi soldiers drove around the streets of the capital in vehicles draped in flowers and Iraqi flags .
Signs were draped on Baghdad ’s many concrete blast walls reading “ Iraq : my nation , my glory , my honor . ”
“ This day , which we consider a national celebration , is an achievement made by all Iraqis , ” Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki said in a televised address .
“ Our incomplete sovereignty and the presence of foreign troops is the most serious legacy we have inherited ( from Saddam ) .
Those who think that Iraqis are unable to defend their country are committing a fatal mistake . ”
The day ’s festivities included a parade in Baghdad ’s heavily fortified Green Zone government and diplomatic district , viewed by Iraqis as the ultimate symbol of the foreign military presence until local forces took control of it in January .
In a display of the military muscle Iraq will use to combat a stubborn insurgency , thousands of soldiers and police paraded on foot or in U.S. - donated Humvees , armored cars and tanks in a compound where Saddam ’s forces once staged elaborate displays .
U.S. and local officials said the pullback of U.S. troops showed how far the country had come since it was almost torn apart by tit - for - tat sectarian killing in 2006 / 2007 .
But the Kirkuk bomb underscored the fragility of the security gains .
Iraq is less violent that it has been for years , but militants still stage frequent attacks .
In Washington , U.S. President Barack Obama lauded the U.S. troop withdrawal as an important milestone but warned of “ difficult days ” ahead .
Frantic relatives of those who had been in the area dug through the rubble in Kirkuk , searching for missing loved ones .

“ I went to the market to get some bread and there was a huge explosion , ” said Taseen Azad , 21 , who was lightly wounded .
“ I saw people falling on the ground , shops burning and dead people .
Then someone took me to the hospital . ”
The U.S. military said four U.S. soldiers based in Baghdad had died of combat - related injuries on Monday .

OIL CONTRACTS
In another sign of what Maliki called the start of a new era , foreign oil executives attended an auction at a Green Zone hotel for eight oil and gas fields in the country ’s first major energy contracts for almost four decades .
Iraq needs the expertise of the oil majors to restore its oil infrastructure , hit hard by sanctions and war .
But its ambitions soon struck commercial realities as it found that there was a big gulf between what it was willing to pay for the 20 - year service contracts and the fees the companies were willing to accept .
A consortium led by British - based BP accepted a deal to develop the biggest oilfield , the 17 - billion barrel Rumaila in the south , but only after a group led by Exxon Mobil of the United States had rejected the government offer .
Awards to U.S. and British firms could anger opponents of the invasion , who have said the war was designed to give Western oil companies control over Iraqi oil reserves .
U.S. and British officials deny the accusations .
The tight security at the auction , and the presence of bodyguards with earpieces escorting the international energy executives , was a reminder of Iraq ’s still uncertain stability .
The political situation also remains unsettled .
Tensions have grown between Baghdad and the minority Kurds in Iraq ’s north , and all eyes are now on a parliamentary election in January that will test Maliki and Iraq ’s fledgling democracy .
One of the BIGGEST mistakes my parents made with me , and one of the reasons I became Atheist , is that they introduced me to " Children 's Bibles " and brought me to " Sunday School " and other such " Children 's Bible lessons " by the time I was 3 years old .
[ The preschool they sent me to was actual IN the church they currently go to ... and trust me ... the teachers would read us " Bible Stories " every school day . ]
Of course , as a child , I saw nothing wrong with what they were doing .
Being like most young children , I took my adult authority figures at their word because I had the very common childish impression that they were infallible .
And this is EXACTLY the problem !
Well ... actually there is a couple of problems with introducing children to religion early .
1 . First of all , there is the so - called " Children 's Bibles . "
As with many " child versions " of adult story books , they are translated into language that children can understand , and by doing this [ with any classic novel or religious / secular adult text ] the author [s ] take important points / symbols / meanings out of the text .
Trust me !
The " Youth Edition " of many classical novels never really gives the real novel it 's due .
The second problem that arises with " Children 's Bibles " is very much related to the other one , except , perhaps even more harmful !
All of the " Children 's Bibles " I 've looked at have left out or watered down stories in the Bible that would be considered " upsetting , " or " inappropriate , " or " that the child could not understand . "
This defeats the whole purpose of allowing the child a chance for a fair and accurate assessment of the Bible !
For example , I will take the same " watered - down " story from a " Children 's Bible " that my parents gave me when I was little , and compare it to the text in one of the " standard adult versions . "
From the Children 's Bible " The Hosanna Bible " :
From the Old Testament Daniel 5 :
Entitled : " A Secret Message "
" Many years later , the king 's [ Nebuchadnezzar 's ] son had a big party to honor the false gods .
He used golden cups that were stolen from the Lord 's temple .
Suddenly the hand of God wrote a message on the wall .
Everyone was afraid .
The wise men in the kingdom could not understand the writing .
So the king ' son [ same person ] sent for Daniel because he knew how to explain dreams .
' If you can read this writing , I will give you a great reward , ' the king told Daniel .
' Please , keep your gifts , " Damiel said .
' You have offended the Most High God , " Daniel told the king 's son [ still same person ] .
' You have used His holy things in a wrong way .
God has sent a message to tell you that your kingdom will be taken away from you . '
And God 's words came true . " - The Hosanna Bible pages 214 - 216 .
Before I compare this watered down version with the " real " [ if you can call it that ] one , I want to take a minute to note the pictures in the story , which I will describe to you .
The reason for this is because , for a young child , pictures can have just as much significance , or more , than any text .
1 . On the first page , the picture is of three rich " cartoon " men at a feast turning in surprise to look at a wall .
2 . On the second page , the picture is of a palace wall [ in cartoon format ] where a huge cartoon hand coming out of a cloud in a burst of golden light points to a cryptic message which is shining on the wall .
The message reads , " MENE MENE TEKEL PARSIN . "
3 . On the third page is a cartoon picture of the author 's interpretation of Daniel smiling with his hands clasped in prayer while looking at the glowing message on the wall .
[ see above ] below him , toward the bottom of the picture the cartoon depiction of the " King 's son " is being led away as a prisoner by two royal guards .
Let 's compare this to the same story in the " adult " version !
From the " Holy Bible " :
Daniel 5 : 1 - 30
" King Belshazzar made a great feast for a thousand of his lords , and drank wine in front of the thousand .
Belshazzar , when he tasted the wine , commanded that the vessels of gold and silver which Nebuchadnezzer his father had taken out of the temple of Jerusalem be brought , that the king and his lords , his wives , and his concubines might drink from them .
Then they brought in the golden and silver vessels which had been taken out of the temple , the house of God in Jerusalem ; and the king and his lords , wives , and his concubines drank from them .
They drank wine , and praised the gods of gold and silver , bronze , iron , wood , and stone .
Immediately the finders of a man's hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall of the king 's palace , opposite the lampstand ; and the king saw the hand as it wrote .
Then the king 's color changed , and his thoughts alarmed him ; and his limbs gave way , and his knees knocked together .
The king cried aloud to bring in the enchanters , the Chaldeans , and the astrologers .
The king said to the wise men of Babylon , ' Whoever reads this writingm and shows me its interpretation , shall be clothed with purple , and have a chain of gold about his neck , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom . '
Then all the king 's wise men came in , but they could not read the writing or make known to the king its interpretation .
Then King Belshazzar was greatly alarmed , and his color changed ; and his lords were perplexed .
The queen , because of the words of the king and his lords , came into the banqueting hall ; the queen said , ' O king , live for ever !
Let not your thoughts alarm you or your color change .
There is in your kingdom a man in whom is the spirit of holy gods .
In the days of your father light and understanding and wisdom , like the wisdom of the gods , were found in him , and King Nebuchadnezzar , your father , made him chief or the magicians , enchanters , Chaldeans , and astrologers , because an excellent spirit , knowlege , and understanding to interpret dreams , explain riddles , and solve puzzles were found in this Daniel , whom the king named Belteshazzar .
Now let Daniel be called , and he will show the interpretation . '
Then Daniel was brought in before the king .
The king said to Daniel , ' You are that Daniel , one of the exiles of Judah , whom the king my father brought from Judah .
I have heard of you that the spirit of the holy gods is in youm and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you .
Now the wise men , the enchanters , have been brought in before me to read this writing and make known to me its interpretation ; but they could not show the interpretations of the matter .
But I have heard that you can give interpretations and solve problems .
Now if you can read the writing and make known to me its interpretation , you shall be clothed with purple , and shall have a chain of gold about your neck , and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom . '
Then Daniel answered before the king , ' Let your gifts be for yourself , and give your rewards to another ; nevertheless I will read the writing to the king and make known to him the interpretation .
O king , the Most High God gave Nebuchadnezzar your father kingship and greatness and glory and majesty ; and because of the greatness that he gave him , all peoples , nations , and languages trembled and feared before him ; whom he would he slew , and whom he would he kept alive ; whome he would he raised up , and whom he would he put down .
But when his heart was lifted up and his spirit was hardened so that he dealt proudly , he was deposed from his kingly throne , and his glory was taken from him ; he was driven from among men , an his mind was made like that of a beast , and his dwelling was with the wild asses ; he was fed grass like an ox , and his body was wet with the dew of heaven , until he knew that the Most High God rules the kingdom of men , and sets over it whom he will .
And you his son , Belshazzar , have not humbled your heart , though you knew ll this , but you have lifted up yourself against the Lord of heaven ; and the vessels of his house have been brought in before you , and your concubines have drunk wine from them ; and you have praised the gods of silver and gold , of bronze , iron , wood and stone , which do not see or hear or know , but the God in whose hand is your breath , and whose are all your ways , you have not honored . '
' Then from his presence the hand was sent , and this writing was inscribed .
And this is the writing that was inscribed : MENE , MENE , TEKEL , and PARIN .
This is the interpretation of the matter : MENE , God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end ; TEKEL , you have been weighted in the balances and found wanting ; PERES , your kingdom is divided and given to the Medes and Persians . '
Then Belshazzar commanded , and Daniel was clothed in purple , a chain of gold was put about his neck , and proclamation was made concerning him , that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom .
That very night Belshazzar the Chaldean king was slain .
And Darius the Mede received the kingdom , being about sixty - two years old . "
As any sensible person would know a young elementary school child , who is most likely in the process of learning to read , could not possibly read and understand a text such as the one above .
The authors of the " Hosanna Bible , " and many other " Children 's Bibles " have attempted to overcome this and introduce children to the Christian Biblical doctrine by creating things like the passage cited above the " adult " one .
However , I seriously do NOT think that this should be done !
When the Bible is " cherry - picked , " and " watered - down " like that , it takes away much of the underlying meaning as well as the overall tone [ or emotional color ] of the story .
A child could be easily mislead by the waterdown passage and then , when they reach the age to be able to read the real one , become shocked and horrified upon learning " the truth " of what 's actually IN the real Bible .
This is what happened to me , and this is one of the number one reasons I lost my faith in High School .
When I began reading the " real " Bible [ middle school and high school age is about the earliest that a child can comprehend hidden meanings and symbols behind religious stories to even a SMALL degree . ]
I became disillusioned and digusted with my faith and my religious text .
Not only did the stories cease to make sense , but they portrayed horrible discrimination and crimes , as well as portraying god [ in parts ] as a murderous , vengeful tyrant !
I felt like I had been lied to and betrayed all those years befor high school when the church [ and my parents ] were bringing me up in " the faith . "
Unfortunately , I still have trouble forgiving them for this .
So , by this point , since " Children 's Bible 's " do n't tell the whole truth , and do n't bring REAL understanding of the stories , they can be considered malignant to the child 's intellectual and spiritual development !
Second point ...
Because young children are unable to understand even basic crucial fundamental concepts of biblical stories , and also because , due to their immature minds ; they have difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy , I think that children should NOT be introduced to the Bible or it's accompanying religion AT ALL until they are mature enough to handle it and understand it [ at least enough to get the REAL picture out of it ] .
Modern Developmental Psychology sometimes goes by the model fo cognitive development laid down by Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget .
According to Piaget , children usually do not develop the ability to think beyond concrete physical [ literal ] objects and concepts before age 11 , at least .
From age 11 into early adulthood , it is THEN that a person learns how to understand and be " able to perform hypothetical and abstract reasoning . "
Meaning , up until about middle - school age [ on average ] children have difficulty understanding complex and abstract concepts like " the way people thought at that time , " and symbolism [ which is prevelant throughout the Bible ] , as well as they have difficulty understanding the difference between what is real and what is fantasy .
[ By the way , if you have a child , do n't be insulted by this !
Cognitive development stages do n't have anything to do with intelligence ! ]
Another Problem comes from the psychology on the deveopment of ethics and morality !
Psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg built on Piaget 's thinking to make a table of the development of morality .
He identified three stages : 1 . Preconventional moality - morality is based on a focus of whether one will be punished or reqarded .
2 . Conventional Morality - morality that is marked by a focus on societal values .
[ Kohlberg said that few adults get past this stage and into the last one ] .
3 . Postconventional Morality - morality that is marked by a focus on internal moral principles that transcend society .
[ What 's right is what accords with fundamental human rights and values , whats wrong is what contracdicts these rights and values . ]
Given this , it can be said , that for much of early childhood a child has a morality / ethics system that is FAR more underdeveloped than adults .
How then can a child accurately comprehend the complex , symbolic , and abstract moral notions in the Bible ?!
So in conclusion : Children should NOT be introduced to the Bible [ in any form ] before the minimum of age 12 !
Just a thought ...
Let me know what you think !

arpeggio :
Key mappings for simultaneously pressed keys
script karma Rating 121/38 , Downloaded by 3220 Comments , bugs , improvements
Vim wiki created by Kana Natsuno script type utility description * arpeggio* is a Vim plugin to define another type of |key - mapping| called
* arpeggio - key - mapping * -- it consists of 2 or more keys ( {lhs} ) and it will be
expanded to another key sequence ( {rhs} ) whenever all keys in {lhs} are
simultaneously pressed .
For example :
Arpeggio inoremap jk < Esc >
" OR
call arpeggio#map ( 'i ' , '' , 0 , 'jk ' , ' < Esc > ' )
With the above definition , you can input < Esc > in Insert mode by pressing " j "
and " k " simultaneously , while you can move the cursor by pressing " j " or " k "
solely .
The concept of this plugin is derived from Emacs ' key - chord.el ( * 1 ) , but there
are the following differences :
- Number of keys to be simultaneously pressed is unlimited .
- Custom delay for each key is supported ( see |g:arpeggio_timeoutlens| ) .
This is a generalization of space - chord.el ( * 2 ) .

The World 's Bravest Mouse
This mouse danced with death when it tucked itself into the lunch of a hungry leopard .
Like a little child and seemingly unaware of the beast towering over it ,
the mischievous rodent grabbed at scraps of meat thrown into the African Leopard 's enclosure .
But instead of pouncing on the tiny intruder , the
12 - year - old leopard , called Sheena , appeared to be afraid of the daring mouse and kept her distance .
At one stage she tried to nudge the
mouse away with her nose , but the determined little guy carried on chewing away until he was full .

Mine Action Policy and Structure
Survivor Assistance United States of America Key developments since May 2003 : The Bush Administration announced the results of a two - and - one - half year policy review on 27 February 2004 , abandoning the objective of joining the Mine Ban Treaty eventually and declaring its intent to retain antipersonnel mines indefinitely .
In fiscal year 2003 , the US provided $ 93 million to mine action programs in 37 countries , an increase of nearly $ 17 million from the previous year .
Private organizations raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for mine action .
At least two research and development programs are now underway , which by March 2007 could result in the resumption of antipersonnel mine production .
The number of US military mine casualties increased markedly in 2003 : fifteen military personnel were killed and 37 injured in Afghanistan , Iraq , and elsewhere .
Key developments since 1999 : The US apparently did not use antipersonnel mines in Yugoslavia ( Kosovo ) in 1999 , or in Afghanistan since October 2001 , or in Iraq since March 2003 .
It reserved the right to use antipersonnel mines during each of these conflicts , and deployed mines to the region at least in the cases of Kosovo and Iraq .
Landmine Monitor has identified 74 mine casualties among US military personnel between 2001 and 2003 .
US mine action funding totaled $ 421.4 million between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 , the largest total for any government .
In addition , the State Department reports that in the last five years several hundred thousand US citizens have contributed more than $ 14 million to mine action programs around the world .
The Department of Defense spent over $ 250 million from 1999 - 2003 to identify and field alternatives for landmines .
The RADAM program , which would have combined existing antipersonnel and antivehicle mines into a new “ mixed system , ” was cancelled in 2002 .
The Pentagon reported in May 2002 that it “ will not be able to meet ” the 2006 target date to develop and field alternatives to antipersonnel mines .
Congress has extended the 1992 legislative moratorium on export of antipersonnel mines several times , most recently until 23 October 2008 .
US antipersonnel mines stockpiled in Italy , Norway , and Spain were removed to comply with their Mine Ban Treaty obligations .
The US cleared its protective minefields at the Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba in 1999 , and now claims not to maintain minefields anywhere in the world .
However , protective minefields from the Soviet era are incorporated into the perimeter defense at locations US forces occupy in Afghanistan .
The US ratified CCW Amended Protocol II in May 1999 .
Mine Ban Policy The United States has not acceded to the Mine Ban Treaty .
Following a two - and - one - half year review , the Bush Administration announced a new landmine policy on 27 February 2004 that abandons the long - held US objective of joining the Mine Ban Treaty eventually and instead allows the military to retain antipersonnel mines indefinitely .
This reverses the previous policy announced by the Clinton Administration to join the Mine Ban Treaty by 2006 , as long as suitable alternatives to antipersonnel mine had been identified and fielded .
According to the Department of State which was charged with presenting the new policy : The United States will not join the [ Mine Ban Treaty ] because its terms would have required the US to give up a needed military capability ....
Landmines still have a valid and essential role protecting United States forces in military operations ....
No other weapon currently exists that provides all the capabilities provided by landmines .
[ 1]
The new US policy characterizes landmines according to their active lifespan or “ persistence ” and reframes the focus from only antipersonnel mines to all types of landmines , both antipersonnel and antivehicle .
The use of landmines that self - destruct and / or self - deactivate is permitted indefinitely without any geographic restriction .
[ 2 ]
Authority to use this type of landmine resides with the Secretary of Defense and may be delegated downward in the rules of engagement normally to a Major General as a Division Commander . [ 3 ]
The use of non-self - destructing antipersonnel mines is permissible until 2010 and then only in Korea .
The use of non-self - destructing antivehicle mines globally will be allowed until 2010 .
[ 4 ]
Only the US President can authorize the use of non-self - destructing landmines and this authority cannot be delegated .
[ 5 ]
Other elements of the policy include a pledge to increase mine action funding , a commitment to negotiate a ban on the sale or export of non-self - destructing landmines , and a renewed effort to research and develop new self - destructing / self - deactivating landmines ( these elements are described in greater detail below ) .
[ 6 ]
The United States Campaign to Ban Landmines ( USCBL ) denounced the new policy for “ sending the wrong message ” by providing “ a dangerous , isolationist example ” to mine - using countries .
[ 7 ]
The USCBL ’s parent organization , the International Campaign to Ban Landmines ( ICBL ) said that despite the policy rejection , “ ... the Mine Ban Treaty has been extraordinarily successful at alleviating the global landmine problem without US support for many years , and no doubt will continue to do so in the future . ” [ 8 ]
USCBL chair , Human Rights Watch , released a fact sheet on “ smart ” mines and said the US “ stands alone in this position that there can be a technological solution to the global landmine problem . ” [ 9 ]
In September 1994 , the United States became the first nation to call for the “ eventual elimination ” of antipersonnel mines .
On 16 May 1996 , President Clinton said the US would “ seek a worldwide agreement as soon as possible to end the use of all antipersonnel landmines . ” [ 10 ]
Instead of endorsing the Ottawa Process , on 17 January 1997 the Clinton Administration announced that the US would seek negotiations on a worldwide mine ban treaty in the Conference on Disarmament ( CD ) in Geneva , Switzerland . [ 11 ]
As action in the CD floundered , the US attended as an observer every preparatory meeting of the Ottawa Process .
The US participated in the ban treaty negotiations in Oslo in September 1997 , but laid out a series of prerequisites for its support that were rejected by others . [ 12 ]
On 17 September , President Clinton announced that the US would not be signing the treaty , but he also stated that the US would unilaterally stop using antipersonnel mines everywhere but Korea by 2003 and in Korea by 2006 ; officials later clarified that this would not apply to antipersonnel mines contained in mixed munitions as the US no longer considered these to be antipersonnel mines , but rather submunitions .
The US had not officially participated in any Mine Ban Treaty - related meetings held since entry into force in 1999 , until June 2004 , when it officially attended and delivered a statement at an intersessional Standing Committee meeting . [ 13 ]
The US has abstained on every annual pro-Mine Ban Treaty UN General Assembly resolution since 1997 , including UNGA Resolution 58/83 on 8 December 2003 .
While it has in the past consistently supported annual resolutions by the Organization of American States ( OAS ) that promote an antipersonnel mine - free hemisphere , the US refused to join consensus on a June 2004 resolution , calling its mine - free goal , “ an unnecessary action regardless of whether or not the mine generates any adverse impacts or poses a threat to civilians . ” [ 14 ]
Landmine Monitor has found no evidence to indicate that the US has actively sought to persuade countries against ratifying or acceding to the Mine Ban Treaty .
The US is a party to the Convention on Conventional Weapons ( CCW ) and ratified Amended Protocol II on 24 May 1999 .
It attended the Fifth Annual Conference of States Parties in November 2003 and submitted a national report , as required under Article 13 , on 27 November 2003 .
In the work of the Group of Governmental Experts since November 2002 , the US has taken the lead in promoting a new protocol on “ mines other than antipersonnel mines ” ( MOTAPM ) .
In a statement to the final session of the Conference on Disarmament on 29 July 2004 , the US announced its intent to pursue negotiations on an international ban on the sale or export of “ persistent ” non-self - destructing landmines in the CD . [ 15 ]
Canada noted that the 42 CD member states that are already part of the Mine Ban Treaty “ will not be in a position to enter negotiations on a lesser ban , aimed at arresting trade in one category of antipersonnel mines alone but implying the acceptability of trade in other categories of these weapons . ” [ 16 ]
The CD has not been able to agree on its agenda since 1997 .
Use The United States last acknowledged using antipersonnel mines in 1991 in Kuwait and Iraq , scattering 117,634 self - destructing / self - deactivating landmines mostly from airplanes . [ 17 ]
In a September 2002 report , the US General Accounting Office ( GAO ) stated that it did not receive any data from the US Department of Defense to indicate , either directly or indirectly , that any enemy casualties , equipment loss , or maneuver limitations were caused by the use of mines by the US The GAO also reported that there was reluctance among some US commanders to use mines because of their impact on mobility , fratricide potential , and safety concerns . [ 18 ]
According to official annual mine and UXO clearance reports by the Kuwait Ministry of Defense , air - delivered Gator antipersonnel and antivehicle mines continue to be found and destroyed in Kuwait . [ 19 ] US forces did not use antipersonnel mines in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis from 24 March to 10 June 1999 .
However , the US reserved the right to use antipersonnel mines if it deemed it necessary , and deployed them to the region , including to Albania , then a signatory to the Mine Ban Treaty . [ 20 ]
There is no evidence that the United States has used antipersonnel mines in its combat operations in Afghanistan since October 2001 . [ 21 ]
It is not known whether US forces deployed to Afghanistan with antipersonnel mines or their delivery systems , but US Special Operations Forces have one type of antipersonnel mine at their disposal : the Pursuit Deterrent Munition ( PDM ) . [ 22 ]
Protective minefields from the Soviet era are incorporated into the perimeter defense at locations US forces occupy in Afghanistan . [ 23 ]
The US does not accept that military advantage is derived from these minefields and it is not obligated to comply with CCW Amended Protocol II to mark and monitor these minefields to ensure the effective exclusion of civilians .
According to the Department of State , “ The US believes that twenty - year - old minefields are more a liability than an asset and while the US has cleared vast areas of the existing Soviet - era minefields , not being in a position to clear all minefields does not automatically trigger obligations under the CCW . ” [ 24 ]
US forces have apparently not used antipersonnel mines in Iraq since launching the invasion in March 2003 .
The US has not publicly confirmed that it has not used antipersonnel mines in the conflict . [ 25 ]
The Pentagon refused to rule out landmine use in Iraq , saying its forces might use mines in case they needed to prevent access to suspected chemical weapons storage sites . [ 26 ]
At least 90,000 antipersonnel mines were stockpiled in the region prior to the conflict .
US forces used Claymore directional fragmentation munitions during combat operations in Iraq in 2003 . [ 27 ]
According to the State Department , the US “ maintains no minefields anywhere in the world , including Korea .
The mines along South Korea 's section of the DMZ belong to South Korea . ” [ 28 ]
The use of landmines in protective minefields at the US Naval Base Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ended in 1999 and according to the Pentagon , all of the antipersonnel mines and antivehicle mines have been removed from the Guantanamo minefields and destroyed . [ 29 ]
Stockpiling
The US stockpiles 10.4 million antipersonnel mines and 7.5 million antivehicle mines making it the world ’s third largest stockpiler of landmines after China and Russia .
Included in this 17.9 million landmine stockpile are 1.5 million non-self - destructing antipersonnel mines and 1.3 million non-self - destructing antivehicle mines . [ 30 ]
Mixed systems that contain both self - destructing / self - deactivating antipersonnel and antivehicle mines constitute only 11 percent of the overall stockpile .
US Antipersonnel Landmine Stockpile [ 31 ]
Munition Number of Antipersonnel Mines Artillery Delivered Antipersonnel Mine ( ADAM ) 8,366,076 M14 696,800 M16 465,330 Claymore 403,096 Gator 281,822 Volcano ( M87 only ) 134,200 Ground Emplaced Mine Scattering System ( GEMSS ) 32,900 Pursuit Deterrent Munition ( PDM ) 15,100 Modular Pack Mine System ( MOPMS ) 8,824 Total 10,404,148
The U.S claims that its self - destructing / self - deactivating landmines are highly reliable : “ We have tested over 67,000 landmines under a wide range of conditions , with no failures of the self - destruct system .
If the self - destruct mechanism should fail , the self - deactivation system would make sure the landmine could not function after no more than 90 days . ” [ 32 ]
This level of reliability only applies only to activated mines . [ 33 ]
These assurances are inconsistent with the cautions contained in Army field manuals , the findings of ammunition testing data , and experiences in the 1991 Gulf War . [ 34 ]
The Department of Defense provided the US General Accounting Office in 2002 with test records that documented reliability problems with eight of its self - destructing / self - deactivating landmine systems ; among other problems , some landmines did not self - destruct as intended .
The reports cited by the GAO indicated at least one test produced hazardous dud mines . [ 35 ]
Landmine Monitor has previously reported that the US stored antipersonnel mines in at least 12 countries ( Bahrain , Germany , Greece , Japan , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , South Korea , Turkey , and the United Kingdom at Diego Garcia ) , but it is not possible to confirm current locations or numbers of US antipersonnel mines in foreign countries , following the movements of equipment and ammunition preceding the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 .
While officials acknowledge that the US stores mines outside the US , they state , “ For security reasons , we routinely do not discuss the specific types , quantities or locations of munition stores . ” [ 36 ]
The US completed destroying over 3.3 million non-self - destructing M14 and M16 antipersonnel mines in 1998 . [ 37 ]
The US has not reported destroying any stockpiled mines since then , but landmines may have been included in the number of submunitions destroyed annually .
In fiscal year 2003 , the US funded the destruction of 1,267 tons of submunitions . [ 38 ]
Additionally , contractors outside the US have destroyed some stocks of US antipersonnel mines .
For example , Germany reports destroying 36,351 GEMSS mines and 38,959 M18A1 Claymore mines in 2001 . [ 39 ]
Production
The US has not produced antipersonnel mines since 1997 and is one of just fifteen countries left in the world that either actively produces them or reserves the right to do so .
The new landmine policy announced in February 2004 states , “ The United States will continue to develop non-persistent anti-personnel and anti-tank landmines . ” [ 40 ]
At least two research and development programs are now underway , which by March 2007 , could result in the resumption of antipersonnel mine production .
The United States produced 628,200 antipersonnel mines between fiscal years 1983 and 1992 for a total cost of $ 1.7 billion . [ 41 ]
This included nine different mine types .
The last non-self - destructing antipersonnel mines were procured in 1990 when the US Army bought nearly 80,000 M16A1 antipersonnel mines for $ 1.9 million .
The last self - destructing / self - deactivating antipersonnel mines were produced between 1992 and 1997 when 450,000 ADAM and 13,200 CBU - 89 / B
Gator mines were bought for $ 120 million .
Research and Development
The new landmine policy announced in February 2004 states , “ The United States will continue to research and develop enhancements to the current technology of self - destructing / self - deactivating landmines to develop and preserve military capabilities that address our transformational goals . ” [ 42 ]
Additionally , “ future tactical barriers may include a new generation of landmines or alternative systems , most likely incorporating improvements to our current SD / SDA technology to provide more flexibility and control of the devices once emplaced . ” [ 43 ]
New US landmines will apparently have a variety of ways of being initiated , both “ man - in - the - loop ” and autonomous or traditional victim - activation .
US officials have noted that self - destruct features will limit the time that the munitions will be able to be in a victim - activated mode .
According to budget documents released in February 2004 , the Department of Defense has requested over $ 704 million in funds for the research , development , and production of landmine systems .
The Department of Defense spent over $ 250 million between fiscal years [ 44 ] 1999 and 2003 to identify and field one - for - one alternatives for landmines as part of programs put into place by presidential direction in 1996 . [ 45 ]
One landmine alternatives program , RADAM , which would have combined existing antipersonnel and antivehicle mines into a new “ mixed system , ” was cancelled in fiscal year 2002 .
The RADAM program cost $ 12.1 million , but no munitions were produced .
While the new landmine policy will radically alter the landmine alternatives program described in previous Landmine Monitor reports , the scope of these changes are not readily apparent , in part because the fiscal year 2005 presidential budget request was published prior to the announcement of the new landmine policy .
However , it appears that the Department of Defense research and acquisition community is pursuing two programs to develop new landmine systems : the Spider program and the Intelligent Munitions System ( IMS ) .
It is not yet possible to determine if these systems will be compliant with the Mine Ban Treaty definition of an antipersonnel mine .
The final system configuration of Spider will be determined in June / Dec 2005 , and this milestone will not be reached for IMS until after FY 2009 Spider is the result of the Non-Self - Destruct Alternative ( NSD - A ) program . [ 46 ]
The US Army spent $ 93 million between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 to research and develop Spider . [ 47 ]
Another $ 30 million has been requested to complete research and development in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 .
The Spider system consists of a control unit capable of monitoring up to 84 hand - emplaced unattended munitions that deploy a web of tripwires across an area .
Once a tripwire is activated , a man - in - the - loop control system allows the operator to activate either lethal or non-lethal effects .
Early in its development , Spider contained a feature that removed the man - in - the - loop and allowed for target - activation – a so - called “ battlefield override ” switch .
The status of this feature at this stage is unknown ; a system allowing for target - activation would be prohibited under the Mine Ban Treaty .
A decision whether to produce Spider is scheduled for June 2005 and the first units are scheduled to be produced in March 2007 . [ 48 ]
The Department of Defense has requested $ 390 million to produce 210,000 Spider systems .
Textron Systems Corporation ( Wilmington , Massachusetts ) and Alliant Techsystems ( Plymouth , Minnesota ) are jointly developing Spider .
Day and Zimmerman ( Parsons , Kansas ) and General Dynamics ( Taunton , Massachusetts ) will be primary subcontractors .
The Intelligent Munitions System ( IMS ) is a new program combining the previous efforts under the Track 2 and Track 3 of the landmine alternatives programs into a research and development program titled Close Combat Capabilities . [ 49 ]
The previous Self Healing Minefield , APL - A Mixed Systems , and APL - A landmine alternatives programs are being consolidated into the IMS program .
A total of $ 145 million of research and development funding was spent on these landmine alternatives between fiscal years 1999 and 2003 . [ 50 ]
While the future funding profile for the IMS is somewhat unclear , $ 274 million has been set aside for its research and development between fiscal years 2004 and 2009 .
[ 51 ]
According to budget documentation , the IMS is “ an integrated system of effects ( lethal , non-lethal , anti-vehicle , anti-personnel , demolitions ) , software , sensors / seekers , and communications that may be emplaced by multiple means and is capable of unattended employment for the detection , classification , identification , tracking and engagement of selected targets . ”
It would appear that “ unattended employment for ... engagement of selected targets ” implies that target - activation is possible , which would make this system incompatible with the Mine Ban Treaty .
Claymore and Antivehicle Mines
In February 2004 the Pentagon requested $ 20.2 million to produce 40,000 M18A1E1 Claymore munitions .
Mohawk Electrical Systems , Inc ( Milford , Delaware ) is scheduled to produce the munitions between June 2005 and March 2006 . [ 52 ]
The M18A1E1 will incorporate a new triggering system that does not rely on either the victim - activated mechanical tripwire fuze or command - detonated electrical initiation provided with the M18A1 .
Instead , the munitions are planned to be command detonated by a new generation of modernized demolition initiators that use explosives to trigger the munition . [ 53 ]
The US first produced Claymore mines in 1960 and has since bought 7.8 million of them for a cost of $ 122 million . [ 54 ]
Production of M87A1 Volcano antivehicle mines continued in 2004 .
This procurement reflects an increase of $ 2.5 million by Congress for fiscal year 2004 .
An additional 2,000 canisters , each containing six antivehicle mines , are being produced . [ 55 ]
Transfer US law has prohibited the export of antipersonnel mines since 23 October 1992 .
This moratorium has been extended several times , most recently until 23 October 2008 .
The US exported over 5.6 million antipersonnel mines to 38 countries between 1969 and 1992 . [ 56 ]
A total of 20 Mine Ban Treaty States Parties have so far declared possessing 1.7 million antipersonnel mines of US origin in their stockpiles , prior to their destruction . [ 57 ]
Deminers in at least 28 mine - affected countries or regions have reported the presence of nine different types of US - manufactured antipersonnel mines , including non-self - destructing and self - destructing / self - deactivating types . [ 58 ] US agencies have been active in acquiring and providing landmines for testing and research purposes .
Romania transferred 3,265 antipersonnel mines to the US Department of the Navy sometime between April 2003 and April 2004 . [ 59 ]
In 2002 , Ecuador transferred 1,644 antipersonnel mines to the US Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division ( Indian Head , Maryland ) . [ 60 ]
The US provided 140 M14 antipersonnel mines to Canada for testing of personal protective equipment for deminers in 2001 . [ 61 ]
Mine Action Funding
The US remains the largest single donor country to humanitarian mine action programs worldwide .
According to figures compiled by Landmine Monitor , in fiscal year 2003 , the US provided $ 93 million to mine action programs in 37 countries .
The total for fiscal year 2003 was nearly $ 17 million more than the previous year ’s total of $ 76.9 million , stopping a two - year downward trend .
The US has provided approximately $ 640.7 million in mine action assistance between fiscal years 1993 and 2003 , including $ 433.6 million from FY1999 - FY2003 .
( See below for different figures cited by the US government ) .
Landmine Monitor Estimate of US Mine Action Funding ,
Fiscal Years 1999 - 2003 ( $ in millions )
FY 1999 FY 2000 FY 2001 FY 2002 FY 2003 [ 62 ]
State Department ( NADR ) 35.0 39.5 39.9 40.0 49.0 [ 63 ]
Defense Department ( OHDACA ) 16.0 28.9 16.6 6.7 6.2 [ 64 ]
Slovenian International Trust Fund 12.1 14.0 12.7 14.0 10.0 [ 65 ]
Defense Department Research & Development 18.2 18.2 12.6 13.2 12.6 Emergency Supplemental Funding ( Afghanistan ) -- -- -- 3.0 3.0 [ 66 ] Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund -- -- -- -- 12.2
81.3 100.6 81.8 76.9 93.0
The initial US government funding estimates for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 , of $ 75.5 million and $ 93.6 million , respectively , are likely to significantly increase because of additional resources provided in supplementary funding and a broader increase in US foreign assistance related to the clearance of mines , explosive remnants of war , and abandoned ammunition .
The landmine policy announced in February 2004 pledged , “ Funding for the State Department ’s portion of the US Humanitarian Mine Action Program will be increased by an additional 50 percent over [ fiscal year 2003 ] baseline levels to $ 70 million a year . ” [ 67 ]
Supplemental assistance to Afghanistan and Iraq contains very significant funding that include a mine action component as a necessary precondition for the implementation of larger development programs , such as road building and the restoration of electric power .
The 2004 supplemental bill provides $ 100 million to the Department of Defense to secure and destroy conventional munitions in Iraq .
Another $ 61 million is allocated to the State Department for munitions clearance in Iraq and another $ 23 million is provided to the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) for road building in Afghanistan . [ 68 ]
Moreover , the US Department of Defense awarded a $ 317 million contract to the US Army Corps of Engineers in fiscal year 2003 to secure and destroy abandoned enemy ammunition in Iraq , whose vast quantities and widespread presence constitute a major humanitarian threat there . [ 69 ]
While Landmine Monitor relies on official US sources for its mine action figures , in some official publications and public remarks by officials , the US government cites different figures for its mine action funding than those presented by Landmine Monitor . [ 70 ]
According to the Department of State , the US has provided over $ 900 million in mine action funding since fiscal year 1993 . [ 71 ]
At the intersessional meeting in June 2004 , the head of the State Department ’s office responsible for mine action funding stated , “ This year alone , our country will -- including special supplementary funds for Iraq and Afghanistan -- provide nearly $ 200 million to support Humanitarian Mine Action . ” [ 72 ]
The annual totals for fiscal years 1993 to 2004 provided by the Department of State reflect the difference : approx .
$ 191.9 in 1993 - 1998 ; $ 82.2 million in 1999 ; $ 110.7 million in 2000 ; $ 91.1 million in 2001 ; $ 106 million in 2002 ; $ 118.1 million in 2003 ; and , approx .
$ 200 million in 2004 . [ 73 ]
There are a number of reasons for this difference .
One factor is the addition of emergency wartime supplemental funding noted above .
Another factor is that mine action assistance figures cited by Landmine Monitor do not include annual funding of approximately $ 10 - 11 million dedicated for war victims assistance programs , which are accounted for separately in Landmine Monitor under the survivor assistance section . [ 74 ]
Additionally , Landmine Monitor ’s knowledge is limited regarding some programs within the US government , like those within USAID and the Centers for Disease Control , that have some element of mine action included within a larger international assistance program , but are not identified as such or do not receive specific mine action appropriations .
The countries receiving State Department NADR and Defense Department OHDACA mine action funding , as well as the mine action - specific supplemental funding for Afghanistan and Iraq , in fiscal year 2003 is detailed in the following table : [ 75 ]
Mine Action Funding by Country , Fiscal Year 2003
State Dept. Defense Dept. 2003 Total Afghanistan 8,300,000 -- 8,300,000 Angola 3,500,000 -- 3,500,000 Armenia 250,000 -- 250,000 Azerbaijan 1,600,000 1,590,946 3,190,946 Cambodia 2,765,000 157,808 2,922,808 Chad 500,000 161,335 661,335 Djibouti 300,000 149,588 449,588 Egypt -- 783,000 783,000 Eritrea 2,400,000 -- 2,400,000 Estonia 235,000 -- 235,000 Ethiopia 300,000 -- 300,000 Georgia 1,050,000 -- 1,050,000 Guinea - Bissau 225,000 -- 225,000 Iraq 2,950,000 -- 18,150,000 Jordan 893,000 -- 893,000 Laos 1,200,000 -- 1,200,000 Lebanon 1,475,000 489,475 1,964,475 Mauritania -- 595,204 595,204 Mozambique 2,632,000 -- 2,632,000 Namibia 600,000 -- 600,000 Nicaragua -- 200,000 200,000 OAS 1,511,000 -- 1,511,000 Peru -- 422,182 422,182 Rwanda 142,095 -- 142,095 Somalia 450,000 -- 450,000 Sri Lanka 2,400,000 24,247 2,424,247 Sudan 896,000 -- 896,000 Vietnam 2,427,000 -- 2,427,000 Yemen 750,000 92,754 842,754 Zambia 450,000 -- 450,000
An additional $ 8.5 million of State Department NADR funding was allocated to global programs which include activities such as landmine impact surveys , cross-cutting initiatives and research and training .
Also in fiscal year 2003 , the US supported mine action programs in six countries through the Slovenian International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims ’ Assistance : Albania , Armenia , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia FYR , and Serbia and Montenegro . [ 76 ]
Since 1998 , the US has provided $ 52 million in matching contributions and $ 10.6 million in unilateral contributions to the trust fund . [ 77 ]
In addition , the US Department of State funds and operates the world ’s only Quick Reaction Demining Force , based in Mozambique , which has been deployed to Sri Lanka , Sudan , and Iraq .
In fiscal year 2003 , US mine action assistance was applied to the following types of activities in programs in these countries ( see individual country reports for details ) : [ 78 ]
Mine Clearance : Afghanistan , Albania , Angola , Armenia , Azerbaijan , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Cambodia , Croatia , Djibouti , Eritrea , Estonia , Georgia ( in Abkhazia ) , Guinea - Bissau , Iraq , Laos , Lebanon , Macedonia , Mozambique , Namibia , OAS ( Ecuador , Guatemala , Nicaragua , Honduras , Peru ) , Rwanda , Serbia and Montenegro , Somalia ( Somaliland ) , Sri Lanka , Sudan , Vietnam , Yemen , and Zambia .

Landmine Impact Surveys : Afghanistan , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Djibouti , Vietnam , Yemen and Zambia .
Mine Action Policy and Structure The State Department ’s Office of Humanitarian Demining Programs was incorporated into the newly formed Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement on 6 October 2003 .
In addition to administering the State Department ’s humanitarian mine action assistance program and the Public - Private Partnerships program , the new office also manages programs related to eliminating small arms and light weapons . [ 79 ]
The mine action policy coordination group met on 13 March 2003 and 11 December 2003 .
Concurrent with the formation of the Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement , a set of “ revitalized goals ” for how the US as a donor treats requests for humanitarian mine action assistance from affected countries and the “ measurable goals ” by which programs are evaluated have been articulated .
During the review process leading to the new landmine policy , President Bush directed the State Department to develop a new strategic plan for the US Humanitarian Mine Action Program .
The US humanitarian mine action strategic plan will serve to advance humanitarian interests and protect the US by promoting regional security .
It uses four factors to determine to whom and to what degree the US provides assistance : humanitarian need , foreign policy interests , efficiency and transparency of the recipient ’s national mine action program , and the recipient ’s commitment to demining . [ 80 ]
Public - Private Partnerships Initiated in late 1997 this program has developed a network of public - private partnerships to bring new energy , ideas , and resources to the efforts to make the world safe from landmines , other types of weapons , and remnants of war .
The partnership program , which numbers over 50 participants , including US and foreign organizations , promotes the entire spectrum of humanitarian mine action .
Partners include civic associations , charitable foundations , corporations , non-governmental and international organizations , and educational groups from middle school through university - level .
According to the State Department ’s Office of Weapons Removal and Abatement , which administers the Public - Private Partnership program , in the last five years , several hundred thousand US citizens have contributed more than $ 14 million to mine action programs around the world , including through partner organizations . [ 81 ]
There is also a competitive grant process whereby these partners can apply for funding for their proposals and programs .
Some public - private partnerships include the United Nations Association of the USA ( UNA - USA ) and its Adopt - A - Minefield program , Warner Bros. , DC Comics , the HALO Trust , the Polus Center for Social and Economic Development , Global Care Unlimited , Grapes for Humanity ( a Canadian NGO ) , Marshall Legacy Institute , Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation ( VVAF ) , Landmine Survivors Network ( LSN ) , Humpty Dumpty Institute , Roots of Peace , People - to - People International , Clear Path International , and Freedom Fields USA , to name a few . [ 82 ]
Some examples of fundraising in 2003 by partner organizations from private sources in the US include : UNA - USA Adopt - A- Minefield received $ 3,632,545 of which $ 423,796 was from the Department of State ; the HALO Trust raised $ 660,787 from private sources in the US ; People - to - People International raised $ 126,987 from private sources ; in Grapes for Humanity ’s first year of operation $ 150,000 was raised in the US with the proceeds going to projects in Nicaragua , Honduras , Angola , and Ethiopia , and the Children of Armenia Fund is raising $ 400,000 to fund a team of six mine detecting dogs with a 3 - to - 1 dollar match by the United States government and the International Trust Fund . [ 83 ]
Department of Defense Humanitarian Demining Research and Development Since the beginning of the program in 1996 , a total of $ 129 million has been allocated by the Department of Defense to test , develop , and validate equipment and technologies to assist deminers engaged in humanitarian mine action .
In fiscal year 2003 , a total of $ 12.6 million was provided for these purposes .
Demining equipment and technologies were developed and tested at several locations worldwide .
Mechanical mine / vegetation clearance equipment was tested in Angola , Djibouti , Georgia , Honduras , Mozambique , Namibia , Rwanda , Sri Lanka , and Thailand .
Site surveys and equipment needs assessments were conducted in Angola , Azerbaijan , Honduras , and Mozambique . [ 84 ]
Over the life of the program , the Department of Defense has tested demining equipment and technologies in Afghanistan , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Cambodia , Chile , Croatia , Cuba ( at Guantánamo Bay ) , Ecuador , Egypt , Guatemala , Israel , Jordan , Kosovo , Laos , Lebanon , Namibia , Nicaragua , and Thailand .
It goal is to provide equipment for “ the international demining community to assess equipment capabilities in actual demining conditions .
Equipment developed under this program also has many uses for military applications as several pieces of equipment are being evaluated under the Joint Area Clearance Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration . ” [ 85 ]
Landmine Casualties
The number of US military mine casualties increased markedly in 2003 .
A total of 15 military personnel were killed and 37 injured in 2003 by landmines , based on an analysis of media reports and official casualty announcements of the incidents .
In Afghanistan , seven US military personnel were killed and five injured in mine incidents . [ 86 ]
At least seven US soldiers were killed and 30 injured in 2003 in landmine incidents in Iraq .
One US Army Special Operations soldier was killed and two others injured in a training accident with a Claymore directional fragmentation mine in Puerto Rico in January 2003 . [ 87 ]
An additional six were killed and nineteen injured in UXO incidents in Iraq . [ 88 ]
Landmine Monitor has also identified 22 mine casualties among US military personnel in 2001 and 2002 , five killed and 17 injured .
In 2002 there were 15 mine casualties ; five were killed and seven injured in Afghanistan , and three were injured in a mine incident in Kuwait .
In 2001 , seven mine casualties were reported , none fatal , five in Afghanistan and one each in South Korea and Kosovo .
Casualties continue to be reported in 2004 , particularly in Iraq .
In April and July 2004 , two US soldiers were killed when their vehicles hit landmines . [ 89 ]
There were eight other cases where relatives say that a US soldier was killed by a landmine . [ 90 ]
The number of casualties attributed to improvised explosive devices ( IED ) in Iraq and Afghanistan is much higher .
The US military uses the term IED to describe nearly all explosive devices encountered by US forces .
In reporting casualties , US military officials make no distinction made between target - activated or command - detonated IED . [ 91 ]
One source estimates that 200 US military personnel have been killed by IEDs in Iraq from the beginning of the fighting until the end of June 2004 . [ 92 ]
The number of injured is not known .
In addition to the military casualties , two US civilian contractors were killed and one was wounded when their car hit an IED in November 2003 . [ 93 ]
Target - activated IEDs are prohibited by the Mine Ban Treaty .
Between 1990 and 2000 , 14 US military personnel were killed by landmines and 89 were injured .
The majority of these casualties occurred in the 1991 Persian Gulf War ( 12 killed and 69 injured ) .
There were 22 other landmine casualties ( two killed and 20 injured ) elsewhere , including two in Egypt , ten in Germany , seven in South Korea , and three in the US [ 94 ]
During the 1991 Persian Gulf War , more US casualties were caused by cluster munition UXO and other unidentified UXO ( 22 killed and 74 injured ) than were caused by landmines .
Survivor Assistance
The primary vehicle for US government funding for landmine survivor assistance is the Patrick J. Leahy War Victims Fund ( LWVF ) administered by the US Agency for International Development ( USAID ) .
Expenditures for landmine survivors are not separated out from those for war victims overall , thus it is not possible to give a precise value to US spending on mine survivor assistance programs .
The LWVF supports programs for the physical rehabilitation and socio-economic reintegration of those with landmine and other war - related injuries .
Since 1989 , the LWVF has provided more than $ 116 million in support for victims of war in 30 countries .
Between 1999 and the end of fiscal year 2003 , $ 51.9 million was provided , including $ 11.9 million in 2003 .
The estimated budget for fiscal year 2004 is $ 11.93 million . [ 95 ]
Leahy War Victims Fund
Fiscal Years 1989 - 2004 ( $ in millions )
1989-1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 52.878 10 10 10 10 11.9 11.9
The LWVF is dedicated to improving the mobility , health , and social integration of adults and children who have sustained physical disabilities as a direct or indirect result of war or civil strife .
Related services , such as gaining access to education and employment opportunities are also funded to promote the economic and social reintegration of the victims .
In fiscal year 2003 , new projects funded by the LWVF started in Afghanistan , DR Congo , Ethiopia , Senegal , and Sierra Leone . [ 96 ]
Specific LWVF projects include : [ 97 ]
Afghanistan : $ 2.8 million was allocated between 2003 - 2006 to UNDP to provide assistance to survivors of landmines and other war - related injuries .
Angola : $ 6 million was granted to the VVAF for the period 1996 - 2004 for survivor assistance , ” which includes a rehabilitation center in Luena that provides orthopedic devices .

The Ganta workshop was destroyed during fighting in March 2003 and UMCOR was forced to cease operations .
Mozambique : Between July 2000 and May 2002 , $ 1.25 million was provided to Prosthetic and Orthotic Worldwide Education and Relief for their “ Prosthetics Assistance Project . ”
Pan -Africa : $ 2.75 million was granted to the ICRC Special Fund for Disabled for the period 2002 - 2007 to ensure the continuity of physical rehabilitation projects in war - affected countries and support similar programs in other African countries , including in Cameroon , India , Kenya , Lebanon , Mali , Mauritania , Nigeria , Syria , Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe .
Senegal : $ 499,751 was allocated to HI from July 2000 to July 2003 to strengthen rehabilitation services for people in the Casamance region .
$ 1 million was granted for another three - year period to extend rehabilitation efforts into the region of Zinguinchor .
Sri Lanka : $ 3.75 million was granted to Motivation for its “ Mobility Disabilities Project ” for the period 2002 - 2007 .

Vietnam : $ 3.3 million was allocated from April 1999 to December 2006 to the Health Volunteers Overseas organization for its “ Vietnam Rehabilitation Project . ”
From September 1998 to December 2005 , $ 4 million will be given to Viet - Nam Assistance for the Handicapped for the “ Prosthetic , Rehabilitation and Barrier - Free Accessibility Project . ”
From April 2002 to April 2005 , $ 2 million was granted to the VVAF for the “ Sustainable Benefits for the Mobility Impaired Program ” which is implemented in partnership with two hospitals and includes a mobile Outreach Program brings basic rehabilitation services directly to the countryside .
$ 301,559 was allocated to Prosthetic Outreach Foundation for 2002 - 2005 to advance the standards for orthopedic component technology in Vietnam .
$ 400,000 was allocated to University Research Corporation for 2002 - 2005 to provide training and technical assistance in quality assurance and improved techniques .
Funding for survivor assistance is also provided through the Slovenian International Trust Fund for Demining and Mine Victims ’ Assistance .
In calendar year 2003 , approximately $ 1.5 million of US Department of State funding was spent on mine survivor assistance programs in the Balkans via the ITF . [ 98 ]
Landmine Monitor has identified 23 organizations in the United States that fund or operate survivor assistance programs in mine - affected countries : ADRA International , American Red Cross , American Refugee Committee , Clear Path International , Center for International Rehabilitation , Children of Armenia Fund , Grapes for Humanity , Health Volunteers Oversees , International Institute for Prosthetic Rehabilitation of Landmine Survivors , International Rescue Committee , Julia Burke Foundation , Kids First , LSN , Peace Trees Vietnam , People to People International , Polus Center for Social and Economic Development , Project RENEW ( VVMF ) , Prosthetics Outreach Foundation , Refugee Relief International , Save the Children - USA , United Nations Foundation , VVAF , and the World Rehabilitation Fund .
Some rely entirely on private charitable sources ; however , most are using a mix of private and public funds in their programs .
Many are also associated with the US Department of State ’s Public - Private Partnership Program for mine action .
The biggest source of public funds is USAID through the LWVF .
Some organizations in the US raise funds and then pool resources at an international level to support programs that may or may not be administered from the original US group .
No legislative action has occurred on the “ International Disability and Victims of Warfare Civil Strife Assistance Act of 2003 ” introduced in the US Congress on 27 March 2003 .
This was essentially a reintroduction of similar legislation , the “ International Disability and Victims of Landmines , Civil Strife and Warfare Assistance Act of 2001 . ”

For days , many reported hearing the happy screaming of gamers across the globe , regarding the announcement of a God of War Collection .
Now , it ’s possible that new collections for Silent Hill and Metal Gear Solid are coming .
As you may have read by the title , coming from the announcement of the God of War Collection , some publishers were contacted whether they would do this .
Konami gave a very pleasing answer , saying :
“ We are constantly exploring unique ways to expose players to some of our legacy titles such as Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill … .
Re-releasing games on Blu-ray presents an exciting opportunity for a publisher , however we have no announcements at this time ” .
Who would like Metal Gear Solid , 2 , 3 and 4 all in one Blu-ray disc ?
How about Silent Hill ?

It 's pretty clear that any health care " reform " bill will be a sorry compromise between what the New York Times on Sunday so delicately calls " organized interests . "
This is important , because as you may have figured out , we 're the only non-organized interest .
No one is inviting us to the table to have a reasonable discussion ( and no , allowing us to leave comments on the White House website is not a " discussion . " )
That means the proposals that are most likely to cut costs and improve efficiency are least likely to remain , and the ones most likely to remain are the ones that stick it to us .
For now , that seems inevitable .
Although Congress does have its inspirational members , the legislative body is still a wholly - owned subsidiary of the banking and insurance industries .
We 're more likely to see progress in legislative tweaks after the bill is finally passed :
WASHINGTON —
As the health care debate moves to the floor of Congress , most of the serious proposals to fulfill President Obama ’s original vow to curb costs have fallen victim to organized interests and parochial politics .
Peter R. Orszag , the White House budget director , says containing costs will be a priority as health care legislation advances .
And now the last two initiatives with real bite that are still in contention — a scaled - back “ Cadillac tax ” on high - cost health plans and a nonpartisan Medicare budget - cutting commission — are under furious assault .
Most economists ’ favorite idea for slowing the growth of health care spending was ending the income tax exemption for employer - paid health insurance to make lower - cost plans more attractive .
But that would hurt workers with big benefit plans , and a labor - union lobbying blitz helped kill that idea by the Fourth of July .
Lobbying by doctors , hospitals and other health care providers , meanwhile , dimmed the prospects of various proposals to cut into their incomes , including allowing government negotiation of Medicare drug prices and creating a government insurer with the muscle to lower fee payments .
“ The lobbyists are winning , ” said Representative Jim Cooper , a conservative Tennessee Democrat who teaches health policy .
Total health care costs in the last 20 years have doubled to about 16 percent of the economy , with no signs of tapering .
Along with universal coverage , Mr. Obama has made controlling those costs a central pillar of his health care overhaul , calling the current course “ unsustainable . ”
The effort is a pivotal test of his campaign promise to break the stranglehold of special interests .
In his weekly radio address on Saturday , Mr. Obama applauded the bill set for a vote next week in the Senate Finance Committee .
“ By attacking waste and fraud within the system , ” he said , “ it will slow the growth in health care costs , without adding a dime to our deficits . ”
In an interview , Peter R. Orszag , the White House budget director and the official most associated with the drive to cut costs , singled out the proposed Medicare commission and the “ Cadillac tax ” as evidence of progress .
“ A key priority now , ” Mr. Orszag said , “ is to make sure cost containment holds up as we move through the legislative process . "
Neither element appears in any of the other four health care bills on Capitol Hill , and both face dug - in resistance in the House .
Although the bills contain other measures aimed at medical costs , most of the surviving ones do not antagonize any organized interest .
Among them are voluntary efficiency measures like encouraging the coordination of medical records , disseminating information comparing the effectiveness of treatments and various pilot projects .
White House officials argue that in any case it is prudent to start with such tests , and that many could be expanded to more comprehensive programs .
But their real impact is hard to gauge , and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office assigns them little weight .
( The budget office credited the Finance Committee bill with reducing the federal deficit , but how much it will slow the growth of total public and private health spending is another question . )
The tax on gold - plated insurance plans is the last vestige of most economists ’ favorite idea , eliminating the tax exemption for employer plans .
The finance bill would impose a 40 percent excise tax on insurance plans that cost more than $ 8,000 a year for an individual or $ 21,000 for a family .
The bill has aroused the frantic opposition of labor and business lobbyists who appear to have found friends in the Capitol .
On Wednesday , 157 House Democrats — a majority of the party — signed a letter to Speaker Nancy Pelosi opposing the tax .
“ It has no legs in the House , ” said Representative Pete Stark , the California Democrat who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the tax - writing panel .
The proposed Medicare commission , aimed at providers instead of consumers , is becoming a case study in the political difficulty of reducing medical payments .
The commission was intended to side - step the interest - group pressure that often stymies Congress .
Modeled after the nonpartisan commission for military base closings , it would present a roster of Medicare cuts that Congress could block only with legislation .
But along the way , the White House and the Senate Finance Committee have cut deals for political support with lobbyists that may circumscribe the cost cuts , potentially including the recommendations of the commission .
ANN ARBOR , Mich . - Acupuncture has been used in East - Asian medicine for thousands of years to treat pain , possibly by activating the body 's natural painkillers .
But how it works at the cellular level is largely unknown .
Using brain imaging , a University of Michigan study is the first to provide evidence that traditional Chinese acupuncture affects the brain 's long - term ability to regulate pain .
The results appear online ahead of print in the September Journal of NeuroImage .
In the study , researchers at the U - M Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center showed acupuncture increased the binding availability of mu-opoid receptors ( MOR ) in regions of the brain that process and dampen pain signals - specifically the cingulate , insula , caudate , thalamus and amygdala .
Opioid painkillers , such as morphine , codeine and other medications , are thought to work by binding to these opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord .
" The increased binding availability of these receptors was associated with reductions in pain , " says Richard E. Harris , Ph.D. , researcher at the U - M Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center and a research assistant professor of anesthesiology at the U - M Medical School .
One implication of this research is that patients with chronic pain treated with acupuncture might be more responsive to opioid medications since the receptors seem to have more binding availability , Harris says .
These findings could spur a new direction in the field of acupuncture research following recent controversy over large studies showing that sham acupuncture is as effective as real acupuncture in reducing chronic pain .
" Interestingly both acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups had similar reductions in clinical pain , " Harris says .
" But the mechanisms leading to pain relief are distinctly different . "
The study participants included 20 women who had been diagnosed with fibromyalgia , a chronic pain condition , for at least a year , and experienced pain at least 50 percent of the time .
During the study they agreed not to take any new medications for their fibromyalgia pain .
Patients had position emission tomography , or PET , scans of the brain during the first treatment and then repeated a month later after the eighth treatment .

The Geopolitics of World Population Change
July 10 , 2007
Wednesday , July 11 , the United Nations ’ annual World Population Day , is a time to reflect on the past , present , and future state of the world ’s population .
Much attention will no doubt be given to the dangers associated with runaway population growth , from environmental degradation to unrelenting cycles of poverty .
Amidst these worries , it is important to take note that the high tide of global population growth has peaked and begun to ebb .
The real cause for concern is the sometimes gaping divergence in demographic trends between developed and developing nations , as well as between the United States and its traditional allies .
The stunning collapse in fertility rates across the world is the biggest – and perhaps least reported – demographic story of the past few decades .
The developed world , of course , is no stranger to falling fertility .
With the exception of the postwar Baby Boom , birthrates have been in almost uninterrupted decline for more than a century .
More recently , however , fertility has also declined throughout the developing world – and at an extremely rapid pace .
Iran , a country that evokes images of religious conservatism and traditional family values , has undergone one of the fastest fertility declines on record .
According to UN estimates , the average number of children born to each Iranian woman has fallen from 6.6 to 2.1 over the past 25 years .
The decline is global in scale , spanning Latin America , parts of the Islamic Belt , and East and South Asia .
Since 1970 , fertility in Mexico has fallen from 6.5 to an estimated 2.4 , in China from 4.9 to 1.7 , and in India from 5.3 to 3.1 .
In Paris , the shy bureaucrat Trelkovsky rents an old apartment without bathroom where the previous tenant , the Egyptologist Simone Choule , committed suicide .
The unfriendly concierge ( Shelley Winters ) and the tough landlord Mr. Zy establish stringent rules of behavior and Trelkovsky feels ridden by his neighbors .
Meanwhile he visits Simone in the hospital and befriends her girlfriend Stella .
After the death of Simone , Trelkovsky feels obsessed for her and believes his landlord and neighbors are plotting a scheme to force him to also commit suicide .

The other day , I was reading through some of the forums and I noticed an interesting thread about Aion being too linear in its game play .
I thought this was an interesting topic as some people were saying that it should be more of an open / sandbox style game .
While on the other side , people were expressing that they were fine with having some structure and guidance in the game .
This got me thinking about what I feel an MMO world should be like .
Looking at traditional pen and paper role playing games and how a story unfolds , there might help in understanding about the right way to have an MMO story play out .
Standard RPGs usually have between three and six players and one game master .
The players create their characters and control their actions by telling the game master what they want to do or where they want to go and how to interact with non player characters ( NPCs ) .
This is pretty much the same with MMORPGs .
Players create their characters and use the keyboard and mouse to tell the character what to do .
The game master 's job , in a nutshell , is to create a story or goal for the characters to accomplish .
They can use a pre-made adventure as the setting for the characters .
These games lead the players from one encounter to the next to tell a story in a fairly linear fashion .
Game masters that create their own world may have a game that is more of a sandbox style .
Players are able to explore the world and learn about it as they go along .
Both could be fun to play in their own way .
With a linear style game players experience the entire story , but may not see the whole world .
In a sandbox style game players may be able to see everything but not feel that they are doing anything other than killing monsters .
In my opinion , Aion is somewhere in between a linear and a sandbox game .
From the opening cut scene , I got the impression that there was an interesting history that leads up to the current time in the game .
As your character completes quests , you discover more pieces of the story and learn that you played a bigger role in the struggle between the Elyos , Asmodians and Balaur .
The campaign quests that you pick up through the game must be completed in order and reveal more of the story .
I would agree that these quests are linear and are designed to get a character from point A to point B in the story .
For example , when your character first wakes up in the initial zone of the game and you complete the first few quests , you see that they lead you to your first campaign quest .
The campaign quests , in turn , lead you to your ascension quests .
Much like the pre-made adventure in a pen and paper RPG , the game is leading you through the story .
If this did n't happen you would just be running around killing Kerub and Zaifs or collecting Angelica .
Yet you are not limited to just going along the path from one quest giver to the next .
I like to wander around an area and see where I 'm able to get to on the landscape and what areas are just backgrounds .
I discovered that there were some areas of the map that I could n't get to , but for the most part you can explore the areas that are opened on it .
Not a complete sandbox , yet roaming around was interesting .
While wandering around the different zones , you 'll find a fair number of side quests to pick up from quest givers and some random NPCs that also give out quests .
For me this adds to both the sandbox part of the game and expands on the history and flavor of the story .
Let 's say that I just completed one of the campaign quests and on my way back to the NPC , I kill something that drops an item that starts a side quest .
I can go do that side quest , which may lead me to an area that I have not been in .
I am not forced by the game to complete it .
If I do n't do that quest , does it impact what happens to my character ?
Not really , other than maybe not getting some extra experience points or some other reward .
But these quests give the NPCs lives of their own outside of being just a quest giver and add flavor to the story .
One might have you stealing a robe from a nymph that is swimming in a pond in the middle of the night while another has you collecting flowers for a fisherman 's secret love .
I feel these are more of a sandbox part of the game since you do not need to complete them .
Another feature that I think would fall into the sandbox side are the Flight Transporters .
You do not have to walk to a new location that has a Flight Transporter in order to use it .
A more linear approach to them would require that your character walk to that new location before you can use the new Flight Transporter .
In Poeta there are only two Flight Transporters , one in Akarios Village and the other at Melponeh 's Campsite .
When you get to Akarios Village if you want to fly to Melponeh 's Campsite you can .
I feel that the development team has done a good job of making sure that there are enough areas to explore and discover hidden things while making sure that you always come back on track so that the story of Aion progresses .
For me , this creates a fun experience that will keep me playing and be watching for updates to the game that may add new content and hopefully open up areas that were unexplorable .
Could it be more open , it 's possible .
Is it to linear , my opinion is no .
Astronomers from The University of Western Ontario have released footage of a meteor that was approximately 100 times brighter than a full moon .
The meteor lit up the skies of southern Ontario two weeks ago and Western astronomers are now hoping to enlist the help of local residents in recovering one or more possible meteorites that may have crashed in the area of Grimsby , Ontario .
The Physics and Astronomy Department at Western has a network of all - sky cameras in southern Ontario that scan the atmosphere monitoring for meteors .
Associate Professor Peter Brown , who specializes in the study of meteors and meteorites , says that on Friday , September 25 at 9:03 p.m. EST seven all - sky cameras of Western ’s Southern Ontario Meteor Network ( SOMN ) recorded a brilliant fireball in the evening sky over the west end of Lake Ontario .
Brown along with Phil McCausland , a postdoctoral fellow at Western ’s Centre for Planetary Science & Exploration , are now working to get the word out amongst interested people who may be willing to see if they can spot any fallen meteorites .
“ This particular meteorite fall , if any are found , is very important because its arrival was so well recorded .
We have good camera records as well as radar and infrasound detections of the event , so that it will be possible to determine its orbit prior to collision with the Earth and to determine the energy of the fireball event , ” says McCausland .
“ We can also figure out where it came from and how it got here , which is rare .
In all of history , only about a dozen meteorite falls have that kind of record . ”
The fireball was first detected by Western ’s camera systems at an altitude of 100 km over Guelph moving southeastwards at 20.8 km / s .
The meteoroid was initially the size of a child ’s tricycle .
Analysis of the all - sky camera records as well as data from Western ’s meteor radar and infrasound equipment indicates that this bright fireball was large enough to have dropped meteorites in a region south of Grimsby on the Niagara Peninsula , providing masses that may total as much as several kilograms .
Researchers at Western are interested in hearing from anyone within 10 km of Grimsby who may have witnessed or recorded this event , seen or heard unusual events at the time , or who may have found possible fragments of the freshly fallen meteorite .
According to McCausland , meteorites are of great scientific value .
He also points out that in Canada meteorites belong to the owner of the land upon which they are discovered .
If individuals intend to search they should , in all cases , obtain the permission of the land owner before searching on private land .
Meteorites may best be recognized by their dark and scalloped exterior , and are usually denser than normal rock and will often attract a fridge magnet due to their metal content .
In this fall , meteorites may be found in a small hole produced by their dropping into soil .
Meteorites are not dangerous , but any recovered meteorites should be placed in a clean plastic bag or container and be handled as little as possible to preserve their scientific information .

Q : Is Snopes.com run by “ very Democratic ” proprietors ?
Did they lie to discredit a State Farm insurance agent who attacked Obama ?
A : A chain e-mail that “ exposed ” Snopes contains falsehoods .
And in fact , the site is run by someone who has no political party affiliation and his non-voting Canadian wife .
A State Farm spokeswoman confirms what they reported about the Obama - baiting agent .
FULL QUESTION
Can you verify ?
Chain e-mail : “ Snopes ” Exposed Posted on February 26 , 2009 at 2:29 am
For the past few years snopes.com has positioned itself , or others have labeled it , as the ‘ tell - all final word ’ on any comment ,
claim and email .
But for several years people tried to find out who exactly was behind snopes.com .
Only recently did Wikipedia get to the bottom of it – kinda makes you wonder what they were hiding .
Well , finally we know .
It is run by a husband and wife team – that ’s right , no big office of investigators and researchers , no team of lawyers .
It ’s just a mom-and - pop operation that began as a hobby .
David and Barbara Mikkelson in the San Fernando Valley of California started the website about 13 years ago – and they have no formal background or experience in investigative research .
After a few years it gained popularity believing it to be unbiased and neutral , but over the past couple of years people started asking questions who was behind it and did they have a selfish motivation ?
The reason for the questions – or skepticisms – is a result of snopes .
com claiming to have the bottom line facts to certain questions or issue when in fact they have been proven wrong .
Also , there were criticisms the Mikkelsons were not really investigating and getting to the ‘ true ’ bottom of various issues .
A few months ago , when my State Farm agent Bud Gregg in Mandeville hoisted a political sign referencing Barack Obama and made a big splash across the internet , ‘ supposedly ’ the Mikkelson ’s claim to have researched this issue before posting their findings on snopes.com .
In their statement they claimed the corporate office of State Farm pressured Gregg into taking down the sign , when in fact nothing of the sort ‘ ever ’ took place .
I personally contacted David Mikkelson ( and he replied back to me ) thinking he would want to get to the bottom of this and I gave him Bud Gregg ’s contact phone numbers – and Bud was going to give him phone numbers to the big exec ’s at State Farm in Illinois who would have been willing to speak with him about it .
He never called Bud .
In fact , I learned from Bud Gregg no one from snopes.com ever contacted anyone with State Farm Yet , snopes .
com issued a statement as the ‘ final factual word ’ on the issue as if they did all their homework and got to the bottom of things – not !
Then it has been learned the Mikkelson ’s are very Democratic ( party ) and extremely liberal .
As we all now know from this presidential election , liberals have a purpose agenda to discredit anything that appears to be conservative .
There has been much criticism lately over the internet with people pointing out the Mikkelson ’s liberalism revealing itself in their website findings .
Gee , what a shock ?
So , I say this now to everyone who goes to snopes.com to get what they think to be the bottom line facts …’ proceed with caution . ’
Take what it says at face value and nothing more .
Use it only to lead you to their references where you can link to and read the sources for yourself .
Plus , you can always google a subject and do the research yourself .
It now seems apparent that ’s all the Mikkelson ’s do .
FULL ANSWER
This widely circulated e-mail contains a number of false claims about the urban legend - busting Snopes.com and its proprietors , Barbara and David Mikkelson , who started the site in 1995 and still run it .
They ’re accused of hiding their identities , doing shoddy research , producing articles with a liberal bent and discrediting an anti-Obama State Farm agent out of partisanship .
The Trouble with Bud
We ’ll deal first with the most specific allegation , which is that the Mikkelsons fabricated an account about State Farm agent Bud Gregg .
At issue is a sign Gregg posted last summer outside his office in Mandeville , La .
It said , “ A taxpayer voting for Barack Obama is like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders . ”
Snopes.com wrote it up in an article headlined “ Chicken Hawked . ”
The e-mail writer says that “ they claimed the corporate office of State Farm pressured Gregg into taking down the sign , when in fact nothing of the sort ‘ ever ’ took place . ”
But that ’s exactly what did happen , according a company representative .
In her article , Barbara Mikkelson did n’t actually use the word “ pressured ” as the e-mail claims .
What she said was :
Snopes.com : A State Farm representative said that Bud Gregg ’s office sign bore these messages until 3 July 2008 and that the company had requested the sign be removed as soon as they became aware of it because the sign was inconsistent with State Farm ’s policy of not endorsing candidates or taking sides in political campaigns .
And State Farm spokeswoman Molly Quirk - Kirby confirmed in a letter to us the same thing she had told Snopes.com earlier :
State Farm : Management requested the sign be removed as soon as its presence became known .
It was taken down on July 3 , 2008 .
Mr. Gregg ’s sign was not endorsed by , nor consistent with State Farm ’s corporate practices .
The company does not endorse candidates , nor take sides in political campaigns .
The e-mail ’s author says the Mikkelsons did n’t call Gregg , and David says that ’s true .
He says he sent the insurance agent an e-mail , but did not receive a response .
Politically Preferential ?
The e-mail goes on : “ Then it has been learned the Mikkelson ’s are very Democratic ( party ) and extremely liberal , ” adding : “ There has been much criticism lately over the internet with people pointing out the Mikkelson ’s liberalism revealing itself in their website findings . ”
The author cites no evidence and no sources for either of these propositions .
We asked David .
He told us that Barbara is a Canadian citizen , and as such is n’t allowed to vote here or contribute money to U.S. candidates .
As for him , “ My sole involvement in politics is on Election Day to go out and vote .
I ’ve never joined a party , worked for a campaign or donated money to a candidate . ”
“ You ’d be hard - pressed to find two more apolitical people , ” David Mikkelson said .
We checked online to see if he had given money to any federal candidates , and nothing turned up .
Mikkelson even faxed us a copy of his voter registration form .
He asked us not to post an image of it here , but we can confirm that it shows he declined to state a party affiliation when he registered last year , and also that when he registered in 2000 he did so as a Republican .
Do the Snopes.com articles reveal a political bias ?
We reviewed a sampling of their political offerings , including some on rumors about George W. Bush , Sarah Palin and Barack Obama , and we found them to be utterly poker - faced .
David does say that the site receives more complaints that it is too liberal than that it is too conservative .
Nevertheless , he says , “ We apply the same debunking standards to both sides . ”
Hiding in Plain Sight
The e-mail also accuses the Mikkelsons of “ hiding ” their identities .
“ Only recently did Wikipedia get to the bottom of it , ” the message claims .
That ’s nonsense .
It may well be that the author of this e-mail was ignorant of the Mikkelsons until recently , but it ’s never been a secret who is behind Snopes.com .
We even dug up a reference to David Mikkelson from 1995 , a year when the Internet was in its infancy .
A collection of short items under the headline “ A Special Report : The Virtual Valley ” in the Los Angeles Times included a photo of him .
Reporter David Brady wrote : “ Meet David Mikkelson , above .
Known in cyberspace as “ snopes , ” the Agoura Hills resident spends much of his time debunking urban legends via the Usenet newsgroup alt.folklore.urban . ”
The Mikkelsons were hardly holed up in an undisclosed location , even then .
David says the couple has done “ hundreds ” of media interviews over the years .
Some of the major national pieces are listed on the site , including a new ( April 2009 ) Reader ’s Digest feature on them .
Lift That Bale !
Another claim in the e-mail : That the Mikkelsons have been criticized for “ not really investigating and getting to the bottom of various issues . ”
The message gives no examples , but there ’s plenty of evidence that the couple expends a great deal of effort to find the truth .
Take , for example , “ Easily Lead , ” Barbara Mikkelson ’s attempt to ascertain whether lipstick contains dangerous levels of lead , as one chain e-mail claimed .
Mikkelson had an extensive conversation with a federal Food and Drug Administration compliance officer , conducted her own experiments rubbing various metals across lipstick and wax smears on white paper , dug up a number of articles about and industry memos on lead in lipstick , and sifted through medical literature on the topic .
The list of sources at the end of the article does n’t come close to doing justice to the amount of work that went into it .
( Bottom line : Lipstick is safe , at least in the U.S. ) .
For another piece , “ Chubby Bunny Death , ” the Mikkelsons verified that a child had indeed died while playing a game that entails stuffing as many marshmallows as possible into one ’s mouth and trying to say the words “ chubby bunny . ”
However , they dispelled the notion that the death occurred because the marshmallows had “ emulsified , ” forming a sticky liquid that choked the child and was difficult to extract in time to save her .
Instead , it was a case of marshmallows blocking her air passages .
The Mikkelsons knew that because they reviewed a number of articles about a lawsuit that resulted from the incident .
But they also conducted their own experiment , David Mikkelson told us in an interview , in which he held marshmallows in his mouth to determine how long it takes them to dissolve .
Now that ’s research .
And no account of the lengths to which the Mikkelsons will go to chase down the facts would be complete without a mention of “ Crash Course , ” their shredding of the rumor ( repeated in Time magazine and elsewhere ) that Clark Gable had run over and killed a pedestrian while driving drunk one night in 1945 , and that his studio , MGM , paid an employee to take the rap for him .
The Mikkelsons checked four biographies and other books , which had conflicting accounts , and a number of old newspaper articles ( all on microfilm ) to sort out the truth , which was that Gable did have a car wreck , but he never hit a pedestrian .
Their account of the extensive research process is worth a read .
Although our sites have somewhat different emphases – we focus on what ’s being said in political ads , speeches , interviews and debates , while Snopes.com concentrates more on such things as whether former Monkee band member Michael Nesmith ’s mother was the inventor of liquid correction fluid ( she was ) – Snopes.com does take on some claims in the political realm .
That has given us an opportunity to evaluate the Mikkelson ’s work from time to time .
We have found it solid and well - documented .
We even link to Snopes.com when it ’s appropriate rather than reinvent the wheel ourselves , which we consider high praise .
A Final Warning
The e-mail ’s last paragraph advises that everyone who goes to Snopes.com for “ the bottom line facts ” should “ proceed with caution . ”
We think that ’s terrific advice , not just in connection with material on Snopes but for practically anything a reader finds online — including articles on FactCheck.org .
The very reason we list our sources ( as does Snopes.com ) and provide links is so that readers can check things out for themselves .
Oh , we almost forgot : That Wikipedia entry mentioned in the e-mail ?
Not only was it not the first place to reveal the Mikkelsons ’ identities , but it contains several factual errors , according to David .
For instance , it says that he works “ part - time ” on Snopes.com .
That was never true , according to David ; early on he did hold another job as well , but even that has n’t been true since 2002 .
The mistakes could have been avoided if the authors had contacted the couple .
“ None of them did , ” he said .

On the Demonization and the Misuse of Testosterone
Filed under : biology , feminism , science October 7 , 2009 , 8:34 amFiled under : masculinity | Tags : art
Encountering an individual with high levels of testosterone may make you slump down in your chair or slink away slowly or recoil a bit mentally or emotionally .
It ’s a “ fight or flight ” response by our bodies and minds to what we may perceive as an increasingly dangerous situation .
The supposition is that testosterone is the cause of violence .
While this is warranted , it ’s also slightly unfair .
That is , if those two conditions are n’t contradictory .
Testosterone is a hormone .
It ’s the hormone that creates maleness .
We ’re all , in fact , female before it ’s introduction .
Often its overabundance results in irrationality and savagery , but it does n’t have to .
Nor is the existence of testosterone a bad thing .
It pains me greatly that I even have to say that .
What would art be if we did n’t come at it with a fire and ferocity and an inebriated zeal ?
What else allows us to achieve that creative richness and intensity ?
Oftentimes , a wealth of testosterone manifests itself in the form of meticulousness or dedication .
And this is n’t only in the arts , but in the sciences , too .
Testosterone is in many ways responsible for the beauty and richness of our culture today .
OK , maybe testosterone and estrogen are n’t each one half of some universal cosmic duality .
Maybe they ’re just two specific Earthly hormones developed to aid in our survival , but they ’re both useful and beautiful .
Testosterone is all too often used incorrectly .
It manifests itself destructively instead of constructively .
We fail to see that one is linked to the other .
After all , what is creation but destruction of non-creation ?
Horror vacui , right ?
Nature abhors a vacuum .
What ’s wrong with aggression toward a dearth of beauty ?
Just like people have different things they consider their anti-drug ( which are really just non-harmful substitute drugs / addictions ) , people need things they consider their anti-violence .
As a male with increased levels of testosterone , art is my anti-violence .
It ’s really just a non-harmful substitute violence .
It ’s a place for me to direct my aggression .
I direct my aggression toward non-creation , in consideration for the creation that exists to date .
This realization acts as an emancipation of testosterone .
A spokesman for transgender group the Beaumont Society said : " This child is vulnerable to bullying and teasing .
They and their family have been seriously misadvised .
It is hard enough for an adult to change gender .
To go to the extent that this nine - year - old has gone is unique . "

According to her butler , Paul Burrell , the following four - page letter was given to him by Diana , Princess of Wales in October of 1993 , ten months after her separation from Prince Charles was announced .
Should it be genuine , it would seem Diana was under the illusion that Charles was planning an accident so as to clear the way for a future marriage to Tiggy Legge - Bourke .
Should it not be genuine , the fact that it was even produced as evidence at the inquest into her death still provides a fascinating insight into the circus that surrounded her life and death .
Full transcript follows .

Transcript
I am sitting here at my desk today in October , longing for someone to hug me & encourage me to keep strong & hold my head high — this particular phase in my life is the most dangerous — my husband is planning “ an accident ” in my car .
brake failure & serious head injury in order to make the path clear for him to marry Tiggy .
Camilla is nothing but a decoy , so we are all being used by the man in every sense of the word .
I have been battered , bruised and abused mentally by a system for 15 years now , but I feel no resentment , I carry no hatred .
I am weary of the battles , but I will never surrender .
I am strong inside and maybe that is a problem for my enemies .
Thank you Charles , for putting me through such hell and for giving me the opportunity to learn from the cruel things you have done to me .
I have gone forward fast and have cried more than anyone will ever know .
The anguish nearly killed me , but my inner strength has never let me down , and my guides have taken such good care of me up there .
Are n’t I fortunate to have had their wings to protect me .
Why do adults so often assume that they know everything about sex when most people have never even read a sex manual ?
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but why do they have to flaunt their own sexual ego ?
Whatever our own personal views there is absolutely no need to express them in a way that belittles other people .
Despite their inexperience , women can be supremely confident in offering advice : “ I love sex and I am sure I love it just as much as men do .
If you are not enjoying sex you need a new partner .
You should be enjoying sex ! …
I have had many lovers which I completely and thoroughly enjoyed wild , hot , passionate sex just for sex sake ! “
If women were truly willing to be helpful , they would express their views with more humility .
They make highly inflammatory comments when , in truth , they know very little about sex .
It is this arrogant and intimidating approach that holds other people back from talking about sex .
Are such women even aware that orgasm exists ?
They talk about ‘ enjoying ’ sex but rarely about true female sexual arousal and orgasm .
They are happy with their sexual experiences because sex totally fulfils their expectations .
They never appreciate that some women approach sex with an expectation for orgasm .
I am discussing sex on a different and more questioning level .
For example , when I had sex for the first time I already knew how to masturbate myself to orgasm .
Most women never learn how to masturbate , never mind how to orgasm during sex .
Other women only learn about orgasm through masturbation much later .
So they have nothing to compare sex with .
As recently as the 1950s ( sex has been around for æons ) , society was shocked to the core when Alfred Kinsey proposed that women might even be capable of orgasm .
So if orgasm is just as easy for women as it is for men , then it must be the best kept secret ever .
Equally ( if women orgasm easily ) why is there so much advice on how a man can give his woman an orgasm ?
Even today , with all the information we have , our liberated views and easy access to sexual partners my point is that it cannot be that every women in the world ( or even just in western society ) now experiences orgasm during sex .
Most people still do n’t even appreciate that the clitoris is the female sex organ and the source of a woman ’s orgasm however she claims to achieve it .
This is because clitoral stimulation only works once a woman is aroused enough in her mind for genital stimulation to be effective .
Even if a woman realises that her sexual arousal works through focusing on complex erotic scenarios during female masturbation alone , it is much less intuitive for her to even consider using similar orgasm techniques during sex with a partner .
Women who are claiming that it is all so easy need to start offering more factual substance to back their claims of orgasm .
Any woman who knows anything about her own sexual arousal knows that women have to work up to sex .
A woman who admits that arousal takes longer , for example , or that she has to work at achieving her own arousal is more credible .
It is a FACT that since very few women masturbate , by definition , most women approach sex without any knowledge of what orgasm feels like or how to achieve it .
So they ASSUME that female orgasm occurs as easily as male orgasm does .
The pleasures they enjoy during sex , whether sensual pleasure or sharing physical intimacy , they attribute to arousal and orgasm .
Dating is easy because of the romance that often accompanies sex .
Try being married for ten to twenty years and many couples find that a good sex life requires a little investment .
Again if it all continues blissfully for you , great , but there ’s no need to patronise others .
You may think that you have all the answers but if you are to help others you will need to provide specifics .
“ Our data suggest that there may be as many as two - thirds of the marriages which , at least on occasion in the course of the years , run into serious disagreement over sexual relationships .
In a considerable number , there is constant disagreement over sexual relationships .
In perhaps three - quarters of the divorces recorded in our case histories , sexual factors were among those which had led to the divorce . ”

Excerpt from Ways Women Orgasm ( ISBN 978-0956-894700 )
Stripped of all it once had  houses , a pool , streetlights 
Homesh , with its overgrown weeds and stray bits of concrete , feels today like the remnant of a nuclear winter .
But that has not dimmed the devotion of those who keep coming or their conviction that doing so will change the strategic equation .
“ We never leave Homesh empty , ” said a man who gave his name as Zvi Yehuda as he prepared surreptitiously to spend the night there , revolver on hip .
“ The creator of the universe gave us this land .
It is a commandment to live in it and settle it .
Anyone who stands in our way  whether pharaoh or Obama  will be punished by God . ”
There are 300,000 settlers in the West Bank ( another 200,000 Israeli Jews live in East Jerusalem ) and they are not monolithic .
A third are politically and socially indistinguishable from most of Israel and moved there for suburban - style housing and close - knit communities .
Another third are ultra-Orthodox and do not consider themselves settlers or Zionists , wanting only to live together in an appropriate environment somewhere in Israel .
The remaining 100,000 are ideologically ( and , most of them , religiously ) committed to staying .
They have a fairly uniform view of the situation : most believe that there is no such thing as a Palestinian nation ; that if the world wants a state for Palestinians , it should set it up next door in Jordan ; that all of the West Bank , which they call by the biblical name Judea and Samaria , is a central part of the Jewish homeland ; and that Arabs will do everything they can to destroy Israel in any borders , so staying in the West Bank is a matter not only of history but of security .
Salvation Through Land
While the ultra-Orthodox say life comes above all else , ideological settlers say that holding onto what they consider the entire land of Israel is the essence of life ; through redemption of this land comes Jewish salvation .
But half of them live in settlement blocs close to the boundary with Israel that are likely to remain in a deal involving land swaps with the Palestinians .
Ideological settlers who live deep in the West Bank number about 50,000 .
Amidst the swirls of controversy that buffet other sexuality researchers , one man focuses , quietly , on swirls .
In a monograph called Excess of Counterclockwise Scalp Hair - Whorl Rotation in Homosexual Men , Dr Amar J S Klar announces a subtle discovery .
" This is the first study , " he writes , " that shows a highly significant association of biologically specified counterclockwise hair - whorl rotation and homosexuality in a considerable proportion of men in samples enriched in gays . "
Klar heads the developmental genetics section of the gene regulation and chromosome biology laboratory at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick , Maryland .
His hair - swirl study appears in a 2004 issue of the Journal of Genetics .
The phenomenon is easy to overlook .
Klar explains :
" Since the hair whorl is found at the top ( ' crown ' ) of the head and thereby it is difficult to observe one 's own whorl and the direction of orientation is seemingly an unimportant feature , most people are oblivious to the direction of their hair - whorl rotation .
It takes two mirrors to observe one 's own hair - whorl . "
His monograph includes a photograph showing the " scalp hair whorl of an anonymous man selected from the general public " , and directs the reader to hold that picture in front of a mirror in order to " appreciate the counterclockwise orientation " .
How difficult is it to collect hair - whorl - direction data ?
Klar explains that he , for one , got lucky :
" By chance I happened to be vacationing at a beach where a preponderance of gay men was fortuitously noticed .
The subjects were considered to be homosexuals because of their public display of stereotypical interpersonal relationship deemed typical of homosexual men .
This assessment was reinforced by the dearth of females and children on the beach ...
Conveniently , the gay men were highly concentrated in one area of the beach .
Such considerations made it relatively easy to collect the data on groups of predominantly gay men with great confidence even though the subjects were not asked for their sexual preference . "
A year later , Klar returned to the same beach and collected another load of data .
He reports that " altogether in a combined sample of 272 mostly gay men observed , 29.8 % exhibited counterclockwise hair - whorl orientation " .
This , he says , is " vastly different from the value of 8.4 % counterclockwise rotation found in the public at large , which included both males and females " .
The study does not take account of the erstwhile hair - whorl directionality of persons who are now bald .
Klar explicitly excluded them from consideration , along with anyone who was wearing a sun hat .
Klar suggests a direction for further exploration : " It should be equally interesting to compare the proportions of clockwise and counterclockwise hair - whorl orientations in lesbian women with those in females at large . "
The report ends with a simple notice that deftly fends off the research - is - a - waste - of - government - money crowd : " Author 's personal funds were used for the study " .

This is an extremely rough draft of an essay I started writing several months ago and could n't figure out how to wire together .
I 'm posting it anyway , mostly because I like the graphic I made .
Whether the meandering flow of the essay itself makes a point is an entirely different matter .
America 's impending doom by my narcissistic generation is a legend in the manufacture , and rarely does a week go by without another reporter lamenting young graduates1 or professor painting their delinquent students onto a strawman .
Like many distraught citizens , I love reading these stories and decrying their villains .
I 've even met a few who embody the narcissistic archetype which apparently is the role model for my generation .
Some might suggest I satisfy the requirements myself .
That said , I can't help but chuckle at the thought that narcissism is a grave danger facing my generation .
The much greater obstacle is recognizing and avoiding the aged truths which were cornerstones of successes past , but no longer apply to the present .
In this essay I 'd like to take a look at one of these truths which have deeply integrated into our lives and decisions .
The last fifty years of financial advice is based on the premise of steady and inevitable gains , and has thus far -- despite painful hiccups -- held firm .
However , applying the same economics to spending our lifetimes of time has proven painful .
Time : a Finite Resource
A textbook definition of economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources .
Even if you 've never plotted the impact of a price ceiling on a market , if you ever think about goals and have some nebulous life plan , then you are an economist .
You 're an economist because you 're allocating your scarcest resource : time .
Time is important because it is a necessary ingredient for creating both wealth and meaning ( one might imagine that time is important for other reasons as well ) .
In turn , wealth and meaning are the two substances that American society values above all else .
While we may not spend much time considering why these two substances are valuable , we certainly have a growing niche of wealth and meaning alchemists who have discovered the art of turning vapid advice into gold by way of the printing press2 .
Skipping past the snake oil ( it 's poison ) and the snake oil dealers ( selling advice on making money is the only surefire way to make money ) , the formula we 've been taught for wealth creation is pretty mundane .
This formula is the juxtaposition of old Protestant beliefs and new American ideals into a quantum of wisdom .
The moral that underpins all three of the ingredients ( education , effort and time ) is the neo-American value that rules them all : fairness3 .
The theory goes something like this :
Education is a great equalizer which gives us all a foundation for success .
Effort is something that anyone can marshall .
Time is limited for everyone .
Thus , by that formula , as long as education is widely available , wealth is equally available to everyone .
That is to say , the accretion of wealth is a fair and predictable process .
There is just one nagging problem : it is n't .
Education is widely available , but it is increasingly expensive , and the benefits have shifted from intrinsic to extrinsic .
Where -- in our parents ' generations and before -- the benefit of education ( in particular of the undergraduate and graduate variety ) was about learning skills and domains of knowledge , in many careers a college degree is a mandatory entrance requirement ( it serves as an easy to implement filter of applicants ) but is otherwise ignored .
The catchphrase for explaining this phenomenon is that you go to college to learn how to learn .
This strikes me as an infuriating excuse for why so many students come to college and leave four to six years later without any usable skills or directly applicable knowledge .
Looked at from the lens of the past -- where education 's primary value was intrinsic -- the explosion of college and pursuant increase of college educated students seems like fairness spreading its wings .
It 's a bit different when viewed from a perspective where college 's primary benefit is extrinsic .
In the best case we achieve the dangerous fairness of uniformity , and at worst the system is actively punishing those without the means to finance their college education by straddling them with debt that 's exempted from bankruptcy 4 .
Instead of opening a world of opportunities , attending college is often the event horizon past which awaits debt mandated employment .
According to a somewhat prevalent mindset , effort as an unlimited resource , which we can tap to the extent that we try to tap it .
That is to say , we can exert effort to the extent that we put effort into exerting effort .
While this is a comfortable lie to those of us who are blessed with good physical and mental health , but simply is n't true .
Long term stress caused by financial insecurity and depression can both undermine the brain 's functioning .
Even -- which is to say , especially -- the most dedicated of workers can and will experience burnout during particularly trying times .
The body and the mind will protect itself from yourself , and burnout is one surefire mechanism it uses to prevent extended periods of overwork .
Time is , in one sense , the most egalitarian of the three ingredients , but demands upon -- and thus opportunity of - - time vary greatly between individuals .
To some extent we do have a large degree of control over how we utilize our time , but some individuals have more than others .
The wealthy family who has hired a nanny and a gardener can devote time to work that would otherwise be invested in picking up kids from school or cleaning up the yard .
For those who would argue that having a home or a child is a choice , I would argue there are comparable demands upon time that can only be avoided at great personal cost or cannot be avoided at all : relatives with chronic disease , unemployed friends or family , personal injury .
Meaning : Failed By Our Alchemists , We Flounder
Unfortunately , even if we acknowledge the wealth formula as a flawed construct , with that realization decisions do n't become any simpler .
Rather , just like a novice programmer just beginning to understand threading ) , the understanding opens the doorway to a new mess of confusion .
Whereas we have a formula - - however broken - - for wealth , our happiness algebra is notably lacking .
One suggested formula is
Have a job you love ( which pays well , offers long - term growth , is meaningful ) .
Start a family ( i.e. spouse and two children ) .
Buy a house ( with a yard ) .
It 's a formula which has n't aged particularly well .
Sure , house prices are rather out of reach as opposed to our parents ' generation , but moreover I think it 's lost its psychic cachet .
Owning a house and raising a family is much more pleasant when one parent can support the family adequately .
Raising kids at all is much more pleasant when you 're part of a strong and intact community .
Another common formula is do something you love .
That 's it .
That 's like telling a 16th century sailor to navigate by sailing straight .
Great .
Thanks guys , I 'm going to do that , right now .
Security : the Value of Wealth
If one can scry a formula for happiness from the entrails of the past , equally important is figuring out the formula for security , which is where the value of wealth becomes apparent .
Then again , wealth is worthless when your needs exceed your wealth , and wealth is worthless to the extent that it exceeds your mental state .
Wealth can't cure unhappiness .
Nor can mental state cure poverty .
Nor will reducing your financial needs solve this formula .
Instead we need to examine our lives and make considered decisions .
Stop maximizing wealth when you 're unhappy ; stop neglecting wealth when poverty keeps your from enjoying it .
Optimize where it counts .
So , our new goal is to spend our lifetime of time to optimize the final happiness equation .
Given the equation , we still need an approach to solving it .
Algorithms for Living
In America we have this dream of college being the golden years before we become productive ( and spend much of our time working ) and after youth .
With the rise of student loans , this college interlude is quite literally paid for by decades spent in the workforce .
After those decades , blissful retirement awaits where you can go on long cruises and buy a timeshare in Florida .
The entrepreneurial vision of living is much more enticing , seemingly offering a much longer portion of one 's life devoted to solely to meaning and devoid of the concern of perusing financial security .
Certainly it looks better , but it 's only a model .
This does n't always work out , and there are many would - be entrepreneurs who take a long - hard stab at success and then up working for the man or consume their life seeking wealth .
Summarizing Dilapidated Advice
In the end , the half - dozen pseudo - formulas boil down to a few simple thoughts :
We should emphasize creating security , rather than maximizing wealth .
This means a balance of mental health and financial health .
One without the other is unusable .
Security is essential for happiness , but is an insufficient condition .
Pursuing security is an incomplete approach to living .
Advice ages .
Sometimes it ages like wine and sometimes like milk .
Check for expiration dates .
Security and happiness to all of you .

After we published our story about the new ‘ birther ’ informercial running in a number of local TV markets in the South , a reader wrote in to say :
Hey , it ’s not funny .
This is a deliberate and shameful effort to denigrate and erode people ’s belief in the legitimacy of Obama ’s presidency .
I was taken aback a bit at first .
Because I agree .
The mix of nihilism , know - nothingism and racism fueling the birther movement is shocking to behold .
But as to funny or shameful , my only quibble is that I ’m not sure we have to choose .
And it turns out there ’s a third option .
You do n’t have to look to hard at the informercial to see that while it may be shameful and it may be funny , it pretty clearly looks like an effort to separate a lot of hyped - up birther rubes from their money , quite possibly to pad the wallets of those in the rube hyping business .
First of all , the pitch in the informercial is that for a mere $ 30 you will receive a birther bumper sticker and your name added to a spam fax sent to the Justice Department and the 50 state attorneys general .
But that ’s not the only reason .
The guy at the center of the informercial is a California lawyer named Gary Kreep , the head of something called the United States Justice Foundation .
But it turns out this is not the first time TPMmuckraker has come across the work of the aptly named Kreep .
Back in March 2008 we found him running a robocall operation called the Republican Majority Campaign , then running a scattershot campaign of robocalls against both Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama .
The RMC also seemed awfully similar to and had a lot of weird connections to those bogus groups has - been Republican luminary Linda Chavez and her husband had recently been discovered running — the ones that actually did little to nothing in the way of political work but provided Chavez and her family a steady income .
Here ’s our piece on Kreep from March 2008 .
While left - handed people have been catered to by a number of manufacturers , producing everything from left - handed video cameras , wallets , scissors and pencil sharpeners , this is the first time the underwear needs of southpaws have been considered .
A series of secret ceasefire deals have been agreed with Taliban commanders to ensure that voting can go ahead in Afghanistan 's volatile south during next week 's presidential elections .
Under the deals , brokered by Ahmed Wali Karzai – the controversial brother and campaign manager of the president , Hamid Karzai – individual Taliban commanders will agree to pull back on election day and allow the Afghan army and police to secure the polling centres .
A Nato spokesman confirmed that a number of deals between the Afghan government and insurgents were in the pipeline , saying : " We support any initiative that enhances security and enables the people of Afghanistan to vote . "
The US embassy has given its blessing to the plan , which was discussed last week at a joint meeting of the country 's national security chiefs .
Many of the key negotiations with local Taliban commanders in the south are being handled by Wali Karzai , who is also the powerful head of Kandahar 's provincial council .
He is running his brother 's re-election campaign in the southern Pashtun belt .
The Guardian was told by Wali Karzai that truces in some of the country 's most violent provinces , including Helmand and Kandahar , would be announced in the next few days with individual commanders .
The deal would allow for more polling stations to open ; officials had said that as many as 700 of the country 's 7,000 voting centres would stay closed .
Wali Karzai said that commanders were split on whether or not to follow the orders of Mullah Omar , the Taliban leader , who wanted the election disrupted .
" It will all depend on the group and who they are connected with .
Some Taliban leaders will look the other way , but others will say no , stop them , this is helping the Jew and the Christian in this war . "
The prospect of the south being unable to vote has worried the Afghan president , who needs the votes of his fellow Pashtuns , the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan , to ensure victory without having to go to a second - round run-off .
It also alarmed western powers anxious that the strife - torn region might be further destabilised if the election were won by a candidate who did not enjoy support in the Pashtun belt .
Wali Karzai said many local Taliban commanders shared those fears despite the stance of Omar .
" I just had a meeting with a very , very , influential Taliban commander , " he said .
" I told him , look , the election will happen despite these four provinces participating or not .
Whether we take part or not , the election will happen because Afghanistan is 32 provinces – they are not going to wait for what Kandahar is going to do . "
Asked whether the Taliban were concerned at the prospect of low - voter turnout in the south letting a non-Pashtun win the election , he said : " Absolutely , they are saying this , they understand this .
How can it be that in the ' war on terror ' the frontline is the Pashtun ?
How can the Pashtun become an opposition in this war ?
What will happen if there is a Pashtun civilian casuality ?
Right now we have a president who will take the matter up . "
Wali Karzai is a controversial figure .
The older half - brother of the president , he enjoys huge power in Kandahar and is alleged to be involved in drug trafficking , a claim he vociferously denies .
he rebutted a report in the German news magazine Stern that British forces had seized tonnes of opium on his land last month .
He claimed this was a political attack aimed at hurting the president before the elections .
But speaking at his home in Kandahar , he exuded confidence about the prospects for his brother 's re-election , saying rivals , including the former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah , did not have extensive support .
He said : " We have absolutely the complete support of 90 % or 95 % in the south .
How to bring people to the polling stations will be our major concern next week .
My challenge in organising this thing is security , it 's not Abdullah Abdullah or Ashraf Ghani . "
Taliban ceasefires allowing voters to turn out in the Pashtun heartland will be a big boost to the re-election plans .
The official line from Taliban spokesmen based in Pakistan is that Afghans should not participate in the election .
There have also been threats to disrupt election day by blocking roads leading to the polling centre and intimidating voters .
Taliban commanders are reported to have threatened to kill anyone they find with a finger marked with indelible ink – a stain meant to prevent people from voting more than once .
However , a western expert in Kandahar , with extensive knowledge of the security situation in the south , said that Taliban threats to disrupt the election had been half - hearted .
" I do n't see a well articulated mass of oppositions to the electoral process – we have seen incidents in recent weeks , but it is not systematic . "
Wali Karzai warned , however , that some groups would be implacable , including that of Mullah Dadullah , a senior Taliban commander killed in 2007 .
" I will only really know which groups have kept their promise after the election , " he said .
Many analysts believe one of the reasons the elections in 2004 went relatively smoothly was because of international pressure on Pakistan to rein in militants operating in Afghanistan with links to the Pakistani intelligence service .
" I hope that happens again – last time it was like someone just pressed a button to stop these people coming in from over the border , " Wali Karzai said .
He also revealed that a number of tribal militias would be mobilised in the south to help guarantee security at election centres – a move that has been denounced by democracy activists who fear it will make electoral fraud easier .
It is thought that armed men controlled by local militia leaders could intimidate many people into voting for their preferred candidate , or even commit outright election fraud such as ballot box stuffing .
Jandad Spinghar , the chief executive of the Free and Fair Elections Foundation in Afghanistan , said militias were a threat to the election .
" They can interfere with the process because they have local power .
Their presence will also stop our observers from reporting on the election freely and fairly . "
If this sounds a lot like Microsoft Photosynth , that 's because , to an extent , it is Microsoft Photosynth — except instead of constructing scenes , this revamped version constructs entire cities .

Researchers at the University of Washington 's Graphics and Imaging Laboratory , which crunched a lot of the code behind the original Photosynth , have devised new algorithms that scale the photo - cloud - to - 3D - model concept way , way up :
The key difference is that Photosynth was aimed at doing a single monument or landmark , which meant that it was scaled to a couple hundred or a thousand photographs , after which it became too slow .
We can now process truly huge data sets — the big breakthrough here was being able to match the images fast .

To these lab - sheltered folks , fast means " about a day , " in which time they were able to render all manner of scenes , from the Trevi Fountain and the Colosseum in Rome , and the entire Old City in Dubrovnik , video'd above .
The best thing about this is that the U of W team does n't have to worry about anything beyond their algorithms — once they 've perfected the software that can recognize and arrange these images , they can slap together a 3D rendering of pretty much any location that Flickr users have taken a few thousand pictures of .

PEN American Center - one of the world 's oldest literary and human rights organizations - joins forces with the Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) , CUNY 's School of Journalism , and WITNESS to pay tribute to Natalia Estemirova , the award - winning human rights activist and journalist murdered on July 15 , 2009 , while she was working on extremely sensitive cases of human rights abuses in Chechnya .
The tribute -- a free public event -- will feature readings and conversations to honor the legacy of Estemirova , while calling attention to concerns of freedom of expression in the provinces of the North Caucasus and Russia .
Participants will include Salman Rushdie ( Best of Booker winning author , former PEN president ) , Michael Arena ( former investigative reporter ) , Keith Gessen ( co-editor - in - chief of n+1 ) , Tanya Lokshina ( Researcher at Human Rights Watch ) , Elena Milashina ( journalist for Novaya Gazeta ) , and Zarema Mukusheva ( filmmaker , human rights activist for Memorial , Grozny , Chechnya ) .
Ann Cooper , Professor at The Journalism School of Columbia University , will moderate .
Since 2000 Natalia Estemirova had been working for the highly respected Russian human rights organization Memorial in Grozny , Chechnya , where she documented the extrajudicial killings , abductions , rapes and other abuses perpetrated by various security forces since the second Chechen War ( 1999 - 2000 ) .
A special correspondent for Novaya Gazeta , she also served as a conduit to Chechnya for many western journalists .
Despite the continued threats to her life , Estemirova continued to work with human rights organizations , such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch , and to record the plights of Chechens , she served as one of their voices to the world .
She was the latest of several human rights campaigners of international renown ( including journalist Anna Politkovskaya , human rights lawyer Stanislav Markelow and journalist Anastasia Baburova ) to be gunned down in today 's Russia .

The bed army : Chinese university turns gymnasium into a giant dorm for poor students ' parents
At first glance it looks as if these makeshift sleeping quarters are housing hundreds of victims of some terrible disaster .
But a closer look reveals them to be parents of Chinese university students , who unable to wrench themselves away from their children , have bedded down in a gym to keep their offspring company for their first night away from home .
The scene at the Central China Normal University , in Wuhan , saw 350 doting mothers and fathers stretching out on mats laid out on the floor in an effort to make the transition as painless as possible .
Family affair : Hundreds of parents bed down in a draughty Chinese auditorium to keep their children company on the first day of university
With the number of university students in China increasing rapidly in recent years , huge numbers of parents will be preparing themselves for such nights in draughty auditoriums .
In 1998 only 1.08 million students attended university , compared to over 17 million in 2003 .
Line - up :
The parents lie in an orderly queue as they attempt to ease their children into life away from home
The second image below is , in my opinion , one of the most disquieting images ever presented at Climate Audit .
Two posts ago , I observed that the number of cores used in the most recent portion of the Yamal archive at CRU was implausibly low .
There were only 10 cores in 1990 versus 65 cores in 1990 in the Polar Urals archive and 110 cores in the Avam - Taimyr archive .
These cores were picked from a larger population – measurements from the larger population remain unavailable .
One post ago , I observed that Briffa had supplemented the Taimyr data set ( which had a pronounced 20th century divergence problem ) not just with the Sidorova et al 2007 data from Avam referenced in Briffa et al 2008 , but with a Schweingruber data set from Balschaya Kamenka ( russ124w ) , also located over 400 km from Taimyr .
Given this precedent , I examined the ITRDB data set for potential measurement data from Yamal that could be used to supplement the obviously deficient recent portion of the CRU archive ( along the lines of Brifffa ’s supplementing the Taimyr data set . )
Hantemirov and Shiyatov 2002 describe the Yamal location as follows :
The systematic collection of subfossil wood samples was begun , in 1982 , in the basins of the Khadytayakha , Yadayakhodyyakha and Tanlovayakha rivers in southern Yamal in the region located between 67°00 and 67°50 N and 68°30 and 71°00 E ( Figure 1 ) .
These rivers flow from the north to the south ; hence , no driftwood can be brought from the adjacent southern territories
At the present time , the upper reaches of these rivers are devoid of trees ; larch and spruce - birch - larch thin forests are located mainly in valley bottoms in the middle and lower reaches .
Sure enough , there was a Schweingruber series that fell squarely within the Yamal area – indeed on the first named Khadyta River – russ035w located at 67 12N 69 50 Eurl .
This data set had 34 cores , nearly 3 times more than the 12 cores selected into the CRU archive .
Regardless of the principles for the selection of the 12 CRU cores , one would certainly hope to obtain a similar - looking RCS chronology using the Schweingruber population for living trees in lieu of the selection by CRU ( or whoever ) .
As a sensitivity test , I constructed a variation on the CRU data set , removing the 12 selected cores and replacing them with the 34 cores from the Schweingruber Yamal sample .
As shown below , this resulted in a substantial expansion of the data set in the 19th and 20th centuries and a modest decline in the 18th century .
( Hantemirov and Shiyatov 2002 had reported a selection of long cores of 200- 400 years ; while the CRU archive does not appear to be the precisely the same as the unavailable Hantemirov and Shiyatov 2002 archive , it does appear to be related .
This pattern of change indicates that the age of the CRU cores is systematically higher than the age of the Schweingruber cores . )
Figure 1 . Comparison of core count .
Black – variation with Schweingruber instead of CRU ; red- archived version with 12 picked cores .
The next graphic compares the RCS chronologies from the two slightly different data sets : red – the RCS chronology calculated from the CRU archive ( with the 12 picked cores ) ; black – the RCS chronology calculated using the Schweingruber Yamal sample of living trees instead of the 12 picked trees used in the CRU archive [ leaving the rest of the data set unchanged i.e. all the subfossil data prior to the 19th century ] .
The difference is breathtaking .
Figure 2 . A comparison of Yamal RCS chronologies .
red – as archived with 12 picked cores ; black – including Schweingruber ’s Khadyta River , Yamal ( russ035w ) archive and excluding 12 picked cores .
Both smoothed with 21 - year gaussian smooth .
y- axis is in dimensionless chronology units centered on 1 ( as are subsequent graphs ( but represent age - adjusted ring width ) .
[ Amended Sep 28 6 pm. Replaces url ]
Finally , here is another graphic showing the same two RCS chronologies , but adding in an RCS chronology on the merged data set obtained by appending the Schweingruber population to the CRU archive – this time retaining the 12 cores .
Unsurprisingly this is in between the other two versions , but most importantly it has no HS .
Figure 3 . Also showing merged version up to 1990 .
( After 1990 , there is only the few CRU cores and it tracks the CRU version . )
[ Amended Sep 28 6 pm. Replaces url ]
I hardly know where to begin in terms of commentary on this difference .
The Yamal chronology has always been an exception to the large - scale “ Divergence Problem ” that characterizes northern forests .
However , using the Schweingruber population instead of the 12 picked cores , this chronology also has a “ divergence problem ” – not just between ring widths and temperature , but between the two versions .
Perhaps there ’s some reason why Schweingruber ’s Khadyta River , Yamal larch sample should not be included with the Yamal subfossil data .
But given the use of a similar Schweingruber data set in combination with the Taimyr data ( in a case where it ’s much further away ) , it ’s very hard to think up a valid reason for excluding Khadyta River , while including the Taimyr supplement .
Perhaps the difference between the two versions is related to different aging patterns in the Schweingruber population as compared to the CRU population .
The CRU population consists , on average , of older trees than the Schweingruber population .
It is highly possible and even probable that the CRU selection is derived from a prior selection of old trees described in Hantemirov and Shiyatov 2002 as follows :
In one approach to constructing a mean chronology , 224 individual series of subfossil larches were selected .
These were the longest and most sensitive series , where sensitivity is measured by the magnitude of interannual variability .
These data were supplemented by the addition of 17 ring - width series , from 200 – 400 year old living larches .
The subfossil collection does not have the same bias towards older trees .
Perhaps the biased selection of older trees an unintentional bias , when combined with the RCS method .
This bias would not have similarly affected the “ corridor method ” used by Hantemirov and Shiyatov themselves , since this method which did not preserve centennial - scale variability and Hantemirov and Shiyatov would not have been concerned about potential bias introduced by how their cores were selected on a RCS chronology method that they themselves were not using .
Briffa ’s own caveats on RCS methodology warn against inhomogeneities , but , notwithstanding these warnings , his initial use of this subset in Briffa 2000 may well have been done without fully thinking through the very limited size and potential unrepresentativeness of the 12 cores .
Briffa 2000 presented this chronology in passing and it was never properly published in any journal article .
However , as CA readers know , the resulting Yamal chronology with its enormous HS blade was like crack cocaine for paleoclimatologists and got used in virtually every subsequent study , including , most recently , Kaufman et al 2009 .
As CA readers also know , until recently , CRU staunchly refused to provide the measurement data used in Briffa ’s Yamal reconstruction .
Science ( mag ) acquiesced in this refusal in connection with Osborn and Briffa 2006 .
While the Yamal chronology was used in a Science article , it originated with Briffa 2000 and Science ( mag ) took the position that the previous journal ( which had a different data policy ) had jurisdiction .
Briffa used the chronology Briffa et al ( Phil Trans B , 2008 ) and the Phil Trans editors finally seized the nettle , requiring Briffa to archive the data .
As noted before , Briffa asked for an extension and , when I checked earlier this year , the Yamal measurement data remained unarchived .
A few days ago , I noticed that the Yamal data was finally placed online .
With the information finally available , this analysis has only taken a few days .
[ Update : the Yamal measurement data used in Briffa 2000 proved to be identical to the measurement data used in Hantemirov and Shiyatov 2002 , which I had obtained from Hantemirov in 2004 , though this had not been stated anywhere .
This was the very first look at the Taimyr dataset and it was , in fact , examining the Taimyr procedure that prompted this post . ]
If the non-robustness observed here prove out ( and I ’ve provided a generating script ) , this will have an important impact on many multiproxy studies that have relied on this study .
Studies illustrated in the IPCC AR4 spaghetti graph , Wikipedia spaghetti graph or NAS Panel spaghetti graph ( consult them for bibliographic refs ) that use the Yamal proxy include : Briffa 2000 ; Mann and Jones 2003 ; Jones and Mann 2004 ; Moberg et al 2005 ; D’Arrigo et al 2006 ; Osborn and Briffa 2006 ; Hegerl et al 2007 , plus more recently Briffa et al 2008 , Kaufman et al 2009 .
( Note that spaghetti graph studies not included in the above list all employ strip bark bristlecone pines – some use both . )
Update : Sep 30 : Here ’s a blow - up of Figure 3 above , from 1850 on .
Legend as in Figure 3 .
The “ combined ” information is shown to 1990 , since post - 1990 is , as noted above , limited to the CRU version and , obviously , reverts back to the CRU .

Numerous sources are contending that Snow Leopard has reached golden master status , meaning that the latest builds are most likely what will end up on store shelves come September .
In fact , one source even suggests it may be released as early as August 28th .
Whenever you get your hands on it , though , Snow Leopard will offer a number of improvements to the installation process .
First , the options for " Erase and Install " and " Archive and Install " have apparently been removed .
" Erase and Install " is still an option , should you need it , in Disk Utility .
If you ever need to reinstall Snow Leopard , it will automatically archive and install .
It wo n't undo any system upgrades — if you 've updated to 10.6.1 , for instance , the installer will leave any updated files alone , so you wo n't have to reapply those updates .
To head off many common installation problems , Snow Leopard also has a few built - in protections .
It wo n't install on a hard drive that reports SMART failures .
To prevent issues with " haxies " or other software causing boot problems , the Snow Leopard installer will scan for known problem software and move it to a folder labelled " Incompatible Software . "
And , if for some reason there is a power failure during the install process , it will pick right back up from where it was halted — that is slick .
To improve the install speed , the installer copies most of the necessary files to the hard drive in one huge chunk , and then performs the install from the hard drive .
If you have ever installed Mac OS X from a disk image instead of a DVD , you know this method is way faster .
When installation is complete , the extraneous installer files are automatically deleted .
Finally , Snow Leopard has a number of optional installs that keep the size of Mac OS X down to a minimum .
First , printer drivers will only be installed for the currently installed printers on you machine .
Additional drivers will be installed on demand when needed , saving a few gigabytes .
Further , Rosetta and QuickTime 7 are optional installs .
Rosetta is required for PPC - only software , though most software has been updated to Universal binary , and Rosetta may not be needed .
Also , QuickTime
X will be the default media player , but plenty of software is still coded to use QuickTime 7 and its facilities for media playback .
However , if a machine has a license for QuickTime Pro , QuickTime 7 will be installed automatically .
All these changes to the install process should make for a smooth transition to the latest , greatest OS from Cupertino .
Who 's lining up to install on day one ?
The semicolon ( " ; " ) is a mark of punctuation most commonly used to separate independent clauses that share the same general idea or ideas , suggesting a closer connection between the clauses than a period does .
English author Beryl Bainbridge described the semicolon as " a different way of pausing , without using a full stop . "
Semicolons still appear fairly often in academic writing ; however , they have fallen out of fashion in less formal kinds of prose — as Associated Press editor Rene Cappon advises , " you would do well to keep semicolons at a minimum . "
That said , semicolons can also be used to separate items in a series containing commas to distinguish each item from the next group of items .
Learning how to use the semicolon effectively can drastically improve the flow and clarity of a written work .
Rules and Usage
Although contentious in the modern literary world , semicolon usage has a long history of serving a vital purpose in written English , allowing for a flow and eloquence to prose , a rhythm set by variations in punctuation as well as word choice .
The most useful and indeed practical usage rule for semicolons might be its usage to separate items in a list that contains commas .
This is especially useful when separating lists of people and their job titles — such as " I met John , the painter ; Stacy , the business executive ; Sally , the lawyer ; and Carl , the Lumberjack at the weekend retreat " — to prevent confusion .
As Irish author Anne Enright put it in Jon Henley 's " The End of the Line , " the semicolon is also useful " when you need a sentence to shift or surprise ; to be modified or amended ; it allows a generosity , lyricism , and ambiguity to creep into the sentence structure . "
Basically , Enright posits that semicolons have their purpose , but should be used with care to avoid seeming self - indulgent or linking too many independent clauses together without giving the reader a break .
The Decline of Semicolons
This idea that semicolons are meant to provide a pause but still link independent clauses together in a piece of writing has all but died out in modern English usage , at least according to some English critics like Donald Barthelme , who describes the punctuation mark as " ugly , ugly as a tick on a dog 's belly . "
Sam Roberts says in " Seen on the Subway , " that " In literature and journalism , to say nothing of advertising , the semicolon has been largely jettisoned as a pretentious anachronism .
Especially by Americans , " wherein " we prefer shorter sentences without , as stylebooks advise , that distinct division between statements that are closely related but require a separation more prolonged than a conjunction and more emphatic than a comma . "
Critics across the board argue that semicolons , though highly useful in scholarly articles and academic papers , are best left to use there and have no usage in modern prose and poetry , where they come across as inauthentic and braggadocious .
How to Use Semicolons
Another possibility is that some writers simply do n't know how to use the semicolon correctly and effectively .
And so , for the benefit of those writers , let 's examine its three main uses .
In each of these examples , a period could be used instead of the semicolon , though the effect of balance might be diminished .
Also , because in each case the two clauses are short and contain no other marks of punctuation , a comma might replace the semicolon .
Strictly speaking , however , that would result in a comma splice , which would trouble some readers ( and teachers and editors ) .
Use a semicolon between closely related main clauses not joined by a coordinating conjunction ( and , but , for , nor , or , so , yet ) .
In most cases , we mark the end of a main clause ( or sentence ) with a period .
However , a semicolon may be used instead of a period to separate two main clauses that are closely connected in meaning or that express a clear contrast .
Examples :
" I never vote for anyone ; I always vote against . " ( W. C. Fields )
" Life is a foreign language ; all men mispronounce it . " ( Christopher Morley )
" I believe in getting into hot water ; it keeps you clean .
" ( G. K. Chesterton )
" Management is doing things right ; leadership is doing the right things .
" ( Peter Drucker )
Use a semicolon between main clauses linked by a conjunctive adverb ( such as however and therefore ) or transitional expression ( such as in fact or for example ) .
Examples :
" Words rarely express the true meaning ; in fact , they tend to hide it . " ( Hermann Hesse )
" It is forbidden to kill ; therefore , all murderers are punished unless they kill in large numbers and to the sound of trumpets . " ( Voltaire )
" The fact that an opinion has been widely held is no evidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd ; indeed , in view of the silliness of the majority of mankind , a widespread belief is more likely to be foolish than sensible . " ( Bertrand Russell )
" Science in the modern world has many uses ; its chief use , however , is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich . " ( G.K. Chesterton )
As the last example demonstrates , conjunctive adverbs and transitional expressions are movable parts .
Although they commonly appear in front of the subject , they may also show up later in the sentence .
But regardless of where the transitional term makes its appearance , the semicolon ( or , if you prefer , the period ) belongs at the end of the first main clause .
Use a semicolon between items in a series when the items themselves contain commas or other marks of punctuation .
Ordinarily , items in a series are separated by commas , but replacing them with semicolons can minimize confusion if commas are needed in one or more of the items .
This use of the semicolon is especially common in business and technical writing .
Examples :
The sites being considered for the new Volkswagen plant are Waterloo , Iowa ; Savannah , Georgia ; Freestone , Virginia ; and Rockville , Oregon .
Our guest speakers will be Dr. Richard McGrath , professor of economics ; Dr. Beth Howells , professor of English ; and Dr. John Kraft , professor of psychology .
There were other factors , too : the deadly tedium of small - town life , where any change was a relief ; the nature of current Protestant theology , rooted in Fundamentalism and hot with bigotry ; and , not least , a native American moralistic blood lust that is half historical determinism , and half Freud . " ( Robert Coughlan )
The semicolons in these sentences help readers recognize the major groupings and make sense of the series .
Note that in cases such as these , semicolons are used to separate all the items .

Let 's Get Real About Priestly " Indiscretions "
Fr. Aris Metrakos
Are n't we disgusted with the shocking number of high - profile cases of priests engaged in pedophilia , homosexual activity , and adultery ?
Some excuse this behavior with the platitudes " a sin is a sin " and " we are all sinners . "
Uh , excuse me ?
Persons who say " a sin is a sin " do n't live in the real world .
My wife is more than forgiving when I snap at her for no reason .
I do n't think that she would be that charitable if I were to come home smelling of another woman 's perfume .
I concede that we are all sinners , but clergy relinquish the right to even think of engaging in certain classes of sin .
When a priest sins sexually he damages the Church the way that crooked judges , lawyers , and police officers damage the legal system .
How can anyone not understand this ?
Looking back on my seminary years , nobody ever told me that I should n't put my hand on an altar boy 's private parts , leave my wife for a man , or go to bed with someone other than my wife .
Come to think of it , they did n't tell me not to eat yellow snow , either .
The faculty assumed that we all knew better .
There 's a saying about the word assume .
If you do n't know it , ask somebody who served in the military to explain it to you .
So , rather than assume that seminarians and young clergy know right from wrong with regard to sexual matters , here are some essential rules of behavior for those preparing for and serving in the priesthood :
If you are delaying ordination until you find Miss Right , then be willing to wait for the appropriate woman to come into your life .
Rushing into marriage with the wrong person is like voluntarily infecting yourself with an incurable illness .
Ask any married person -- our spouse will either make us or break us .
The priesthood poses enough difficulties without having the millstone of the wrong wife around your neck .
If you have sexual fantasies about anything other than a woman , get help .
If these ideations persist , choose a different career .
If your heterosexual fantasies occupy as much of your time as they did when you were 15 , see an experienced confessor .
If you are married and have persistent sexual fantasies about anyone other than your wife , again , see the confessor .
If your marriage needs fixing , then go to counseling .
If counseling does n't work , you have three options : separation , divorce , or " gutting it out . "
Finding a mistress is not an acceptable alternative .
Appearances matter .
Do n't put yourself in situations where your integrity can be challenged .
Do n't stay in the same room with children when no other adults are present .
Do n't go swimming with anybody other than other clergy , and certainly not with minors .
Do n't meet repeatedly for one - on - one counseling sessions with the same person outside of normal office hours .
Do n't meet with a long - time female friend in a hotel room when you are together at a conference .
Do n't give rides to a woman or a child unless other people are in the car .
It 's not too late until it 's too late .
If you are counseling a woman and you are attracted to her , send her to another priest .
If you are about to walk into the bedroom of a person who is not your wife , walk away .
If you are kissing someone other than your wife -- stop , and get on the phone with a priest - friend whom you can trust .
All sexual misconduct is unjustifiable .
Some child abusers excuse themselves because they were victims of abuse .
Yet plenty of adult survivors of molestations go on to have normal sex lives .
Get help .
And before you put your hand where it does n't belong , remember how bad it felt when it was done to you .
And all sexual misconduct deserves the maximum penalty .
When persons on the bench , in the bar , or with a badge undermine the legal system they get locked up for a long time ; they are held to a higher standard .
Priests who are pedophiles , homosexual predators , and adulterers need to be defrocked -- not only to send a message but to protect the Church and her members .
Some of them need jail time too .
And why give a wolf in shepherd 's clothing a second chance to ravage the flock ?
Maybe an adulterous pastor who had one occasion of adultery could be given a second -- and last -- chance , but only after plenty of counseling and a transfer to the other side of the continent .
The rest need to be removed .
The second century priest - martyr Haralambos was dragged by his beard through the streets because he refused to deny Christ .
In the 21st century , clerics drag the good name of the priesthood and the Church through the tabloids and the evening news .
Sexual sin among the clergy must stop .

To main page | Opera Unite HowTo's Opera Unite benchmark Updates to original test
The original test flaw : CPU cores .
Since Opera uses only 1 proccess and therefore - only 1 core and PHP + Apache used 2 cores , I 've set Apache CPU affinity to 1 core only ( so that it uses same raw power ) and PHP made only 771req / s. ( As expected )
Opera Unite ~ 800 req/s
PHP on 1 core - 770 req/s
PHP +MySQL on same 1 core - 695 req/s .
Given the same " 1 core " CPU : PHP / Apache is on par with Opera Unite ( with less than 15 concurrent connections , which would be a heavy load - the Slashdot → effect barely gives this server 1 - 2 concurrent connections )
The original test is flawed since all of those programs , except Opera use 2 cores .
So results for PHP and nginx should be divided by 2 .
So , nginx wins only by 2.5 times , not 5 .
This does n't cancel the original results , though .
Of course web server should use both cores , so on 2 core processors , PHP is still up to 2 times faster .
Note that this is test where only simple variables are used that definitely fit into memory .
Unite is n't in same market as PHP / nginx .
This test just shows that JavaScript can in fact be as effective as other server - side scripting languages .
Second test of Opera Unite today - up to 1050 req/s in some cases .
( Uses 1 core ) , but I sense I should n't include these results into comparison , since some people already see me as a marketing agent for Opera Unite .
( The source of this test is available below , BTW , test yourself )
Summary Opera Unite can do up to impressive 800 requests per second on reasonably modern home hardware , even with dynamic content .
You ca n't DDOS a person via Opera Unite !
( Unless you can sustain exactly 13 connections per second , no more , no less , but even then it 's just takes 1 core and connection piling does n't happen .
( No overload )
Opera Unite uses very smart file I/O !
Even if you save data to file each request ( simplest , but stupidest way to do it ) - it still can push out very impressive 744 requests / second !
( It probably means that this data is saved to memory and dumped only sometimes , smart move ! )
It seems like Opera uses 13 threads ( seems like a soft limit , but unchangeable ) .
13 concurrent connections max out @ 810req/s , 1.23 ms processing time .
For comparison :
PHP + Apache ( + MySQL ) is almost 2 times faster than peak Unite performance .
Compiled C++ web server ( MadFish WebToolkit → ) is only 6 times faster than Opera Unite , but that is compiled raw C ++.
nginx ( one of the fastest Web Servers available ) is only 5 times faster than Opera Unite ( clocked at 4900 req /s in raw C++ )
" Welcome to nginx " cycle ( no I /O or scripting ) .
But if we were to compare simplicity of usage - those guys would seriously lose .
We can't really compare these technologies since they serve different ( even though seemingly similar ) ideas .
Opera Unite is n't just " sites " .
And it is n't targeted to those who know what " nginx " is .
Static
Testing of serving almost static data :
config.xml
< widget > < widgetname > Static</widgetname > < feature name = " http://xmlns.opera.com/fileio " > </ feature > < feature name = " http://xmlns.opera.com/webserver " > < param name = " type " value= " service " /> < param name= " servicepath " value= " static " /> </ feature > </ widget > index.html
< script > window.onload = function ( ) { webserver = opera.io. webserver if ( webserver ) { webserver.addEventListener(' _index ' , start_page , false ) ; } } function start_page ( r ) { var o = r.connection .
response ; o.write ( ' test ' ) ; o.close ( ) ; } </script >
Vertically more is better .
Less is better .
ab.exe -n { 100,1000} - c [ x axix ]
The peak is at 13 concurrent connections at impressive 810 requests per second .
( nginx " static " does ~ 3000requests / second ) .

At 100 concurrent connections requests start to timeout .
It seems like Opera has something like 13 threads of execution ?
Good news is that unless someone hits you at exactly 13 connections - no matter how big number is - CPU utilization is at a few percent .
Simple dynamic
The script keeps 1 variable , increments it and outputs ( converting to string ) :
< script > var c = 0 ; window.onload = function ( ) { webserver = opera.io. webserver if ( webserver ) { webserver.addEventListener(' _index ' , start_page , false ) ; } } function start_page (r ) { c++ ; var o = r.connection .response ; o.write ( ' test : '+c ) ; o.close ( ) ; } </script >
Red = 1000 total reqs , blue = 100 total reqs .
The performance does n't drop compared to almost static content !
Persistence
No persistence was made to scripts , since I have n't found a way to do it better than saving data each request .
Adding stupid persistence :
< script src=" file_wrap.js " ></ script > < script > var c = parseInt ( safe_file_get(' filename.txt ' , 0 ) ) ; window.onload = function ( ) { webserver = opera.io. webserver if ( webserver ) { webserver.addEventListener(' _index ' , start_page , false ) ; } } function start_page (r ) { c++ ; var o = r.connection.response ; o.write ( ' test : '+c ) ; safe_file_put(' filename.txt ' , c ) ; o.close ( ) ; } </script >
This is the stupidest way to do stuff and it seems Opera uses cache VERY REASONABLY .
The performance should have dropped to about maybe 50 requests per second , but :
744 requests per second !
Kudos , Opera !

Well , since I do n't want to kill my HDD I 'm doind a test where PHP takes a value from simple MySQL table , increments a value and saves it back ( using a set of functions that are typically used in web programming
<? mysql_pconnect (' localhost ' , ' root ' , '' ) ; $ rq=mysql_query ( ' SELECT i FROM sqhash .p WHERE id=1 ' ) ; $ i=mysql_fetch_row ( $rq ) ; $ i=$ i[ 0 ] ; $ i=intval ( $i ) +1 ; mysql_query ( ' UPDATE sqhash .p SET i= " '.mysql_real_escape_string ( $i ) .

( Obviously you would need to setup ' sqhash .i ' table with id=INT , PRIMARY KEY ; i=INT . )
As disappointing it for me to be , but PHP + Apache beat Unite seriously .
Obviously in both tests CPU utilization was 100 % .
( Twice the peak Unite usage and 10 times more than non-peak Unite usage )

In the 1930's , the Nazis introduced a massive , compulsory sterilization of a large segment of the German population .
What could cause the Germans to do this after having already lost a large segment of their population during World War I ?
Why would the German people let this happen ?
The Concept of the ' Volk '
As social Darwinism and nationalism emerged during the early 20th century , especially in the 1920s , the concept of the Volk became established .
The German Volk is the political idealization of the German people as one , specific and separate biological entity that needed to be nurtured and protected to survive .
Individuals within the biological body became secondary to the needs and importance of the Volk .
This notion was based on various biological analogies and shaped by the contemporary beliefs of heredity .
If there was something — or more ominously someone — unhealthy within the Volk or something that could harm it , it should be dealt with .
Eugenics and Racial Categorization
Unfortunately , eugenics and racial categorization were in the forefront of Western science during the early 20th century , and the hereditary needs of the Volk were deemed of significant importance .
After the First World War ended , the German elite believed that the Germans with the " best " genes had been killed in the war while those with the " worst " genes did not fight and could now easily propagate .
By assimilating the new belief that the body of the Volk was more important than individual rights and needs , the state gave themselves the authority to do whatever necessary to help the Volk , including compulsory sterilization of select citizens .
Sterilization Laws in Pre-war Germany
The Germans were not the creators of nor the first to implement governmentally - sanctioned forced sterilization .
The United States , for instance , had already enacted sterilization laws in half its states by the 1920s which included forced sterilization of the criminally insane as well as others .
The first German sterilization law was enacted on July 14 , 1933 — only six months after Hitler became Chancellor .
Gesetz zur Verhütung erbkranken Nachwuchses ( the Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring , also known as the Sterilization Law ) allowed the forced sterilization for anyone suffering from genetic blindness and deafness , manic depression , schizophrenia , epilepsy , congenital feeble - mindedness , Huntington 's chorea ( a brain disorder ) , and alcoholism .
The Process of Sterilization
Doctors were required to report their patients with genetic illness to a health officer , and petition for the sterilization of their patients who qualified under the Sterilization Law .
These petitions were reviewed and decided by a three - member panel in the Hereditary Health Courts .
The three - member panel was made up of two doctors and a judge .
At insane asylums , the director or doctor who made the petition also often served on the panels that made the decision whether or not to sterilize them .
The courts often made their decision solely on the basis of the petition and perhaps a few testimonies .
Usually , the appearance of the patient was not required during this process .
Once the decision to sterilize had been made ( 90 % of the petitions that made it to the courts in 1934 ended up with the result of sterilization ) , the doctor that had petitioned for the sterilization was required to inform the patient of the operation .
The patient was told " that there would be no deleterious consequences . "
Police force was often needed to bring the patient to the operating table .
The operation itself consisted of ligation of the Fallopian tubes in women and a vasectomy for men .
Klara Nowak , a German nurse and activist who led the League of Victims of Compulsory Sterlisation and Euthanasia after the war , had herself been forcibly sterilized in 1941 .
In a 1991 interview , she described what effects the operation still had on her life .
" Well , I still have many complaints as a result of it .
There were complications with every operation I have had since .
I had to take early retirement at the age of fifty - two — and the psychological pressure has always remained .
When nowadays my neighbors , older ladies , tell me about their grandchildren and great - grandchildren , this hurts bitterly , because I do not have any children or grandchildren , because I am on my own , and I have to cope without anyone 's help . "
Who Was Sterilized ?
Asylum inmates made up 30 percent to 40 percent of those sterilized .
The main reason given for sterilization was so that the hereditary illnesses could not be passed on in offspring , thus " contaminating " the Volk 's gene pool .
Since asylum inmates were locked away from society , most of them had a relatively small chance of reproducing .
So , the main target of the sterilization program were those people who were not in the asylums but had a slight hereditary illness and who were of reproductive age ( between 12 and 45 ) .
Since these people were among society , they were deemed the most dangerous .
Since slight hereditary illness is rather ambiguous and the category " feeble - minded " is extremely ambiguous , people sterilized under those categories included those the German elite did n't like for their asocial or anti-Nazi beliefs and behavior .
The belief in stopping hereditary illnesses soon expanded to include all the people within the east whom Hitler wanted eliminated .
If these people were sterilized , the theory went , they could provide a temporary workforce as well as slowly create Lebensraum ( room to live for the German Volk ) .
Since the Nazis were now thinking of sterilizing millions of people , faster , non-surgical ways to sterilize were needed .
Inhuman Nazi Experiments
The usual operation for sterilizing women had a relatively long recovery period — usually between a week and fourteen days .
The Nazis wanted a faster and less noticeable way to sterilize millions .
New ideas emerged and camp prisoners at Auschwitz and at Ravensbrück were used to test the various new methods of sterilization .
Drugs were given .
Carbon dioxide was injected .
Radiation and X - rays were administered , all in the name of preserving the German Volk .
The Lasting Effects of Nazi Atrocity
By 1945 , the Nazis had sterilized an estimated 300,000 to 450,000 people .
Some of these people soon after their sterilization became victims of the Nazi euthanasia program .
Those who did survive were forced to live with the loss of rights and invasion of their persons as well as a future of knowing that they would never be able to have children .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Saturday 14 November 2009
In the report below about sex trafficking we referred to the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre as " the police Human Trafficking Centre " .
The UKHTC describes itself as " a multi-agency centre " and says that it is " police led " .
Its partners include two non-governmental organisations , HM Revenue & Customs , the Crown Prosecution Service , the Serious Organised Crime Agency and the UK Border Agency .
We referred to Grahame Maxwell as the head of the UKHTC ; his title is programme director .
The UK 's biggest ever investigation of sex trafficking failed to find a single person who had forced anybody into prostitution in spite of hundreds of raids on sex workers in a six - month campaign by government departments , specialist agencies and every police force in the country .
The failure has been disclosed by a Guardian investigation which also suggests that the scale of and nature of sex trafficking into the UK has been exaggerated by politicians and media .
Current and former ministers have claimed that thousands of women have been imported into the UK and forced to work as sex slaves , but most of these statements were either based on distortions of quoted sources or fabrications without any source at all .
While some prosecutions have been made , the Guardian investigation suggests the number of people who have been brought into the UK and forced against their will into prostitution is much smaller than claimed ; and that the problem of trafficking is one of a cluster of factors which expose sex workers to coercion and exploitation .
Acting on the distorted information , the government has produced a bill , now moving through its final parliamentary phase , which itself has provoked an outcry from sex workers who complain that , instead of protecting them , it will expose them to extra danger .
When police in July last year announced the results of Operation Pentameter Two , Jacqui Smith , then home secretary , hailed it as " a great success " .
Its operational head , Tim Brain , said it had seriously disrupted organised crime networks responsible for human trafficking .
" The figures show how successful we have been in achieving our goals , " he said .
Those figures credited Pentameter with " arresting 528 criminals associated with one of the worst crimes threatening our society " .
But an internal police analysis of Pentameter , obtained by the Guardian after a lengthy legal struggle , paints a very different picture .
The analysis , produced by the police Human Trafficking Centre in Sheffield and marked " restricted " , suggests there was a striking shortage of sex traffickers to be found in spite of six months of effort by all 55 police forces in England , Wales , Scotland and Northern Ireland together with the UK Border Agency , the Serious and Organised Crime Agency , the Foreign Office , the Northern Ireland Office , the Scottish government , the Crown Prosecution Service and various NGOs in what was trumpeted as " the largest ever police crackdown on human trafficking " .
The analysis reveals that 10 of the 55 police forces never found anyone to arrest .
And 122 of the 528 arrests announced by police never happened : they were wrongly recorded either through honest bureaucratic error or apparent deceit by forces trying to chalk up arrests which they had not made .
Among the 406 real arrests , more than half of those arrested ( 230 ) were women , and most were never implicated in trafficking at all .
Of the 406 real arrests , 153 had been released weeks before the police announced the success of the operation : 106 of them without any charge at all and 47 after being cautioned for minor offences .
Most of the remaining 253 were not accused of trafficking : 73 were charged with immigration breaches ; 76 were eventually convicted of non-trafficking offences involving drugs , driving or management of a brothel ; others died , absconded or disappeared off police records .
Although police described the operation as " the culmination of months of planning and intelligence - gathering from all those stakeholders involved " , the reality was that , during six months of national effort , they found only 96 people to arrest for trafficking , of whom 67 were charged .
Forty - seven of those never made it to court .
Only 22 people were finally prosecuted for trafficking , including two women who had originally been " rescued " as supposed victims .
Seven of them were acquitted .
The end result was that , after raiding 822 brothels , flats and massage parlours all over the UK , Pentameter finally convicted of trafficking a grand total of only 15 men and women .
Police claimed that Pentameter used the international definition of sex trafficking contained in the UN's Palermo protocol , which involves the use of coercion or deceit to transport an unwilling man or woman into prostitution .
But , in reality , Pentameter used a very different definition , from the UK's 2003 Sexual Offences
Act , which makes it an offence to transport a man or woman into prostitution even if this involves assisting a willing sex worker .
Internal police documents reveal that 10 of Pentameter 's 15 convictions were of men and women who were jailed on the basis that there was no evidence of their coercing the prostitutes they had worked with .
There were just five men who were convicted of importing women and forcing them to work as prostitutes .
These genuinely were traffickers , but none of them was detected by Pentameter , although its investigations are still continuing .
Two of them —
Zhen Xu and Fei Zhang — had been in custody since March 2007 , a clear seven months before Pentameter started work in October 2007 .
The other three , Ali Arslan , Edward Facuna and Roman Pacan , were arrested and charged as a result of an operation which began when a female victim went to police in April 2006 , well over a year before Pentameter Two began , although the arrests were made while Pentameter was running .
The head of the UK Human Trafficking Centre , Grahame Maxwell , who is chief constable of North Yorkshire , acknowledged the importance of the figures : " The facts speak for themselves .
I 'm not trying to argue with them in any shape or form , " he said .
He said he had commissioned fresh research from regional intelligence units to try to get a clearer picture of the scale of sex trafficking .
" What we 're trying to do is to get it gently back to some reality here , " he said .
" It 's not where you go down on every street corner in every street in Britain , and there 's a trafficked individual .
" There are more people trafficked for labour exploitation than there are for sexual exploitation .
We need to redress the balance here .
People just seem to grab figures from the air . "
Groups who work with trafficked women declined to comment on the figures from the Pentameter Two police operation but said that the problem of trafficking was real .
Ruth Breslin , research and development manager for Eaves which runs the Poppy project for victims of trafficking , said : " I do n't know the ins and outs of the police operation .
It is incredibly difficult to establish prevalence because of the undercover and potentially criminal nature of trafficking and also , we feel , because of the fear that many women have in coming forward . "
The internal analysis of Pentameter notes that some records could not be found and Brain , who is chief constable of Gloucestershire , argued that some genuine traffickers may have been charged with non-trafficking offences because of the availability of evidence but he conceded that he could point to no case where this had happened .
He said the Sexual Offences Act was " not user friendly " although he said he could not recall whether he had pointed this out to government since the end of Pentameter Two .
Parliament is in the final stages of passing the policing and crime bill which contains a proposal to clamp down on trafficking by penalising any man who has sex with a woman who is " controlled for gain " even if the man is genuinely ignorant of the control .
Although the definition of " controlled " has been tightened , sex workers ' groups complain that the clause will encourage women to prove that they are not being controlled by working alone on the streets or in a flat without a maid , thus making them more vulnerable to attack .
There are also fears that if the new legislation deters a significant proportion of customers , prostitutes will be pressurised to have sex without condoms in order to bring them back .

With all due respect to Iowa State 's victory over Nebraska , the biggest shocker in the Big 12 today came tonight .
Texas A&M just lined up and whipped Texas Tech in the trenches in a stunning 52 - 30 victory .
The biggest reason ?
The maligned Texas A&M offensive line helped open holes for 322 rushing yards and 560 total yards .
The Aggies ran off 31 straight points midway through the game to take control , silencing the largest crowd in the history of Jones AT&T Stadium .
Will this save Mike Sherman 's job ?
It can't hurt .
And it likely was one of the sweetest victories of Sherman 's tenure after some of the comments made by Tech coach Mike Leach about A& M 's development of quarterbacks .
For the record , A&M quarterback Jerrod Johnson passed for 238 yards and rushed for 70 more as he outplayed Tech 's Taylor Potts before he was removed late in the game .
This is the first of future articles about first impressions when playing a space strategy game .
Of course that this kind of analysis is not so deep as a thorough review so it may be subject to more criticism , but that is a risk I ´m willing to take .
Astro Empires is already a well established free space strategy ( the free mode has some limitations , but is fully playable ) web - based game known by many players .
The idea of this article is to give the reader a global overview of this game to make it easier for newcomers .
For a review I did on another Web - Based MMOG – Ogame , please refer to my other article : Ogame Review , Tips and Strategy Guide .
First impact
When reaching Astro Empires homepage , I have to confess that I liked it .
Few and synthetic information including a small text describing the game and information regarding how easy it is to install and the fact that it is free to play .
It also displayed information about the advantage of not having to download anything , which captures the player ’s attention for a smooth first impact .
The homepage also gives a general overview of the game dimension and global information about the number of players , planets and bases in the server .
First Login , First Impressions
To be honest , when I made the first login I was not very pleased , I got a bit lost .
I did n’t get immediately what I needed to do , it felt a bit unnatural and non-intuitive .
The account overview is a little bit too texty , no graphic overview of your bases , your planets , I mean your location in the map .
After 10 seconds , I found the Bases and Map icons …
When you choose one of your bases the following information is presented to you : an overview , the structures on it , the defenses , production , research and trade options .
It presents all the standard issues of a common space strategy game , but the problem is with the details .
When describing , for instance , the structures , there is no detailed information about them and it ’s classification is done by means of numbers from one to a maximum level .
I consider this a very simplistic approach that does not transmit a sense of realism to the player ( but this is not strictly an Astro Empires thing , many games , like ogame for instance , also present this kind of simpler classification ) .
I would prefer something more meaningful like “ Advanced < structure > ” , “ Hyper ” , “ Automated ” kind of upgrades but maybe that ’s just a thing of mine .
Another down aspect in AE is when you click on a structure it shows the same text as it did on the list of structures ( I thought the second was more like a small description in a first place ) with no images and with a list of the levels that each structure can achieve … too simple .
Lots of work to be done here .
But there is lots of space to be filled .
I guess that the developers are probably still working on this matter for sure .
Galaxy Map
The map is ok , a grid over the galaxy is displayed with all the planets in each grid square .
It gives you a nice perspective of your location in the game .
There are tow kinds of links in the map .
When you click on the planet , you go directly to the colony information , when you click in the name of the player you see information which can be important to test your diplomatic skills …
Timescale
For me , the timescale is the best feature of the game .
I´m not a fan of rush kind web browser games where everything happens too fast .
I like to take my time when placing a strategy .
In this game , just because I was away for two days this did n’t ruined the game for me … my planet was not burning and my credits were not at zero !…
against what is usual in some other web browser games like … travian , or ogame .
I think this game has done a serious effort regarding this issue , but anyway I ’m only playing it for a month , so I could be mistaken about this .
Gaming experience so far
I needed to do something relevant with the game to have enough juice for a first impression … so , after lots of research levels , I ordered the construction of two Outpost ships ( odd name for a regular colony ship ) , it took me around 6 hours to complete them …
After a 3 minutes travel ( maybe a bit too fast for my taste ) , the colony ship reached a metallic planet in the same solar system …
I clicked the button “ Build Base ” … and that ’s all .
I wanted to see more juice in the process .
Building a base is not like building a small fighter , but in Astro Empires , in practical terms , is the same .
At least a few extra options could be presented when starting a colony , maybe a small report , or some colonization options presented ( native population present in the planet , artifacts / technologies found , decisions to be made that affect the planet quality , etc ) .
Future
The future of this game is promising .
I felt that the game is a like a raw diamond with many aspects still to be polished .
The game is quick to load and to interact with and it seems that the engine beneath is also powerful .
Now , the next step is to take more advantage of this engine and allow the player to extract the maximum potential of the concept but introducing more content .
I will continue to play the game and , in the future , I hope to write a deep review .
In the meantime , I ’ll explore the battles concept , colony management of several colonies , diplomacy aspects and the trading mechanism .
I don´t know if I got lucky not having a dangerous alliance nearby ( you can also join an alliance later ) which allowed me to take me time to do things .
IF this is confirmed than if you want to start a game in a “ non-rush ” mode , Astro Empires is a valuable option for you .

Forget Sudokus and crosswords : if you want to sharpen up your thinking , immerse yourself in Kafka 's stories of the surreal .
Research from psychologists at the University of California in Santa Barbara and the University of British Columbia claims to show that exposure to surrealism enhances the cognitive mechanisms which oversee implicit learning functions .
The psychologists showed a group of subjects Kafka 's story The Country Doctor , a disturbing and surreal tale in which a doctor travels by " unearthly horses " to an ill patient , only to climb into bed naked with him and then escape through the window " naked , exposed to the frost of this most unhappy of ages " .
A second group were shown the same story , but rewritten so the plot made more sense .
Both groups were then asked to complete an artificial grammar learning task which saw them exposed to hidden patterns in letter strings , and then asked to copy the strings and mark those which followed a similar pattern .
" People who read the nonsensical story checked off more letter strings - clearly they were motivated to find structure , " said Travis Proulx , a postdoctoral researcher at UCSB and co-author of the research , which appears in an article published in the September issue of the journal Psychological Science .
" But what 's more important is that they were actually more accurate than those who read the more normal version of the story .
They really did learn the pattern better than the other participants did . "
Proulx said that the thinking behind the research was that when we are exposed to something which " fundamentally does not make sense " , our brains will respond by " looking for some other kind of structure " within our environment .
A second test got the same results by making people feel alienated about themselves as they considered how their past actions were often contradictory .
" You get the same pattern of effects whether you 're reading Kafka or experiencing a breakdown in your sense of identity , " Proulx said .
" People feel uncomfortable when their expected associations are violated , and that creates an unconscious desire to make sense of their surroundings .
That feeling of discomfort may come from a surreal story , or from contemplating their own contradictory behaviours , but either way , they want to get rid of it .
So they 're motivated to learn new patterns . "
The effect would not work if the person was expecting to experience a feeling of alienation : they have to be surprised by the unexpected events and have no way of making sense of them , leading them instead to trying to make sense of something else .
" It 's important to note that sitting down with a Kafka story before exam time probably would n't boost your performance on a test , " said Proulx .

Ah , it 's been a while .
I managed to get even better performance by precreating all the bitmaps for the cells .
Obvious really , but it 's now running pretty well .
Since the whole point of this exercise is for me to experiment with lisp features I 've been experimenting with storing an update and render closure in each cell .
This has worked out really nicely , allowing me to have a more efficient board update when opening up empty cells and also the ability to do neat effects like control the speed that the board opens up .
So the function below creates an update function that 'll expose surrounding cells on the next update :
It 's also possible to create animation effects by using an update function and a render function sharing the same closure :
So this one makes the invisible cell bitmap shrink to nothingness leaving the new one behind .
I can create higher - level update functions as well .
One useful one is delay , that just waits a certain number of frames before switching the given function in .
However , this leaves open the possibility of setting an update function over the top of another one that might be doing useful work .
We can deal with this nicely with a combine update function :
This runs both the update functions , eventually removing itself when one of the sub ones finishes .
As a debugging aid I can print out the current function on each cell , and it should be possible to set it up to inspect a particulary cell by clicking on it .
Very cool potential there .
The great thing about this is that means I can store arbitrary data on a cell and do processing on it without having to make room for it in my main cell datastrucure .
So by doing this I 've decoupled the update logic and animation data from my simple board representation .
Of course this sort of thing is n't limited to lisp , but it 's an interesting way to think about it that falls into place quite naturally .
My latest distraction is trying to get SLIME and CLISP to work better with macro argument lists .
I 've been doing some hacking replacing lisp 's standard defmacro with my own version that stores away some extra data , but I think the proper solution is going to be modifying CLISP itself .
