Remember that Ultra Super Duper Secret Illegal Cheney CIA Program that I posted about earlier ?
Well , well , well , looks like it was Ultra Super Duper redundant ... unless it was those darned Americans they were targeting :
Vince Cannistraro , a former CIA counterterrorism chief , told TPMmuckraker that because we 've been in a state of war against al Qaeda since just after September 11 , there would have been no need for a secret CIA program that received special legal authorization .
Since the war on terror began , said Cannistraro , the CIA has routinely conducted operations targeting top Qaeda leaders .
" The CIA runs drones and targets al Qaeda safe houses all the time , " said Cannistraro , explaining that there 's no important difference between those kinds of attacks and " assassinations " with a gun or a knife .
Cannistraro said the Defense Department has also conducted such targeted efforts , under an initiative that New Yorker reporter Seymour Hersh has written about . [...]
But Cannistraro cautioned that that DOD program has nothing to do with the secret , unidentified CIA program which Cheney is said to have hid from Congress , and which CIA director Leon Panetta ended last month .
As for what the program did involve , Cannistraro suggested that it involved Americans as targets , and that it went beyond surveillance , but declined to elaborate .
He added that , though Cheney may have directly ordered the CIA to keep Congress in the dark , the veep was n't acting alone .
" The approval was from the president , " said Cannistraro .
When the vast majority think of flags , they think of the American flag flying over government structures or even over many residences during holidays such as July 4 ( aaneslandfabrikker ) .
Few people can collect their national flag and it regularly flaps below the American flag on a tall pole .
There are actually many types of flags and those that can be customized for a variety of organizations or hanging banners flags to celebrate a specific team or school .
Work and installation of flag poles .
This will talk about some of these unique ways to organize a private flag and why it ’s great to have it .
With the real estate market in such downturn due to the economy , a great way to advertise a home for sale or business can be to have amazing banners with your business logo on it ( https://aaneslandfabrikker.no/rekkverk/).
They can be carried outside the home you ’re trying to sell to a customer , or across town to attract the attention of impending new customers ( https://aaneslandfabrikker.no/flaggstang/).
They differ from a billboard and are exactly what you might need to capture the attention of a future customer .
Another way groups need a flag store is to get a custom banner with their team ’s logo to bring to games , tournaments , or events .
Homemade signage , at this point , is not enough , but a expert made sign that can be securely attached to a wall or fence where a team will compete , has a great impact and allows the team and all competitors to win .
During the ongoing National Synchronous Swimming Competition , most teams across the state had unique banners with the team logo hanging on all the walls surrounding the water venue .
They came in a variety of sizes and shapes , and it is easy for the team to fall apart and put them in their bags to bring to the next competition .

So recognising that we can have ...
1 . We are here at Future Ruby 2009 in Toronto and here is Avi Bryant .
Why do n't you tell us a little bit about yourself ?
I 'm a developer , an entrepreneur , probably best known for being one of the creators of the Seaside web framework , which is a Smalltalk web framework , for being the co-founder of the company that built Dabble DB and also a new product that we are working on called Trendly .
I'm Canadian , I live in Vancouver .
Actually , I live on a small island off the coast of Vancouver - that 's me .
And I like Smalltalk .
2. So Dabble DB is written in Smalltalk ?
Yes .
The core of Dabble DB is written in Smalltalk .
We do use a bunch of Ruby scripts and actually a little bit of Python for a sort of infrastructure stuff , peripheral stuff , but the core is written in Smalltalk and runs on Seaside .
3 . What 's your new project ?
Is it a product yet ?
What is Trendly ?
Trendly came out of something that we really needed internally for Dabble DB , which is that we use - like a lot of people do - Google Analytics to track our web traffic .
For a web business , the traffic is really your lifeblood and you really need to understand it .
The thing about Google Analytics is it does a great job of collecting data and just showing the raw data , but for an analytics product it does very little analysis .
What we are interested in is not necessarily that the traffic went down with 10 % today or went up 5 % tomorrow , but have there been really any meaningful changes to the traffic patterns ? - and I mean that in a statistically significant sense .
Has anything changed that we really need to pay attention to rather than just noise ?
I spent a while just reading about stats and we were searching this stuff to come up with a model that I thought would work for this kind of traffic .
What were kicking this around with a bunch of people inside the company and also people from other companies , like Patrick Collison from Auctomatic or Bob Hardsorn [ ? ] who 's now Facebook , but was in a startup at that time .
What we realized is that what we really want was a news feed , almost like the Facebook news feed , where it tells you what your friends are up to , we wanted to know what our traffic was up to and to pick and choose the events that we were reported on based on whether or not they were truly significant .
If your traffic just randomly goes up a bit , we do n't want to tell you about that , but if you been slashdotted and suddenly you 've got huge referrals from everywhere then that 's something we wish to report .
Or subtler things , like you 've changed your website and suddenly your average conversion rate has gone from 3 % to 3.5 % - if truly your average has changed , that 's something that we want to report on .
We had this statistical model , we had this idea of a news feed and we spent a few months just iterating on how does that turn into something useful and usable and what kinds of visualizations can we do to support it .
That 's what I 'm talking at FutureRuby is about , that sort of long iterative design process .
What we ended up with I think is quite good and we started previewing in that with people and we hope to fully launch it as a product quite shortly .
4 . Is it available right now to look at it ?
Anyone can go right now and connect to the Google Analytics account and we will pull in their data and do at least a one - off historical report of visualizing their traffic for the last 3 years , say , if they have that much data in it , but what we are going to be doing going forward and what we would be charging for , would be for recurring updates to that .
I mean , real value is in checking it every day , or every week or having it email you when interesting things are happening , so that you can track what 's happening with your data over time .
For now , the preview lets people get a feel for it and lets us understand - for people who are willing to share the results with us - lets us understand how that kind of engine is doing on different profiles of sites , from very small sites that maybe are only getting 100 visitors a month , up to people who are getting 1,000,000 visitors a month .
Does the analysis work across all the different site profiles ?
5 . How do you get my data from Google Analytics ?
Google Analytics released an API - I think that maybe at the beginning of May or the beginning of April it became publicly available - and they use a sort of combination of OpenID and OAuth to authenticate you .
So , they authenticate you when , we never see your Google password , and then you tick a box and Trendly is allowed to access these parts of my Google accounts .
We asks for the email address so that we can get in touch with you and then we ask for your Google Analytics data and we may , at some point , ask for your Google Calendar data , so you can use Google Calendar to mark significant events , like " This was the day that I released a new version of a website " , but we do n't do that yet .
Then Google Analytics basically gives us an API token and we can use that to do queries against your Google Analytics data .
In our case , we 're really doing a huge amount of queries , because we are trying to pull in as much data as we think we can process for you , then we run a bunch of statistical analysis on it and based on the results of that , we do a bunch of visualization generating charts and spark lines and news reports and that kind of things .
6 . Could you maybe say something about this statistical model that you are using ?
Is that generally applicable ?
Yes .
Let me step back and tell you something about the model that we use .
We use a stepwise linear model .
The assumption is that for whatever metrical we are looking at , let 's say the metric is the number of hits a day you get from Twitter .
That number is obviously going to change day by day - I mean how many hits you get from Twitter - , but we assume that the average is going to be the same for a relatively long period of time .
For a month or year , we 're going to have the same average hits from Twitter and then suddenly , Ashton Kutcher is going to post about you and everyone is going to retweet it or whatever and that will cause a shift in the average and for a while , while this kind of meme is propagating out and Demi Moore is retweeting Ashton Kutcher twitting about how cool InfoQ is , that average is going to be quite different .
Then , maybe it will fall back again or maybe you 'll have broken out and everyone 's always going to be twitting about InfoQ from now on , so that average is going to stay at that high level .
What we are trying to do statistically , is simply to detect where those shifts happen and figure out what our confidence level is about whether or not a shift happened and about when a shift happened .
Although we were assuming , the model assumes that the shift was abrupt , that there was a change from this step to this step , we may be able to tell it happened on that day or we may only be confident that it happened some time this week or some time in this time period .
That model , I think , maps fairly well to web traffic data in that it 's usually a pretty constant in telling some event happens , whether it's an internal event , like you changed your website or whether it's an external event like someone links to you or some kind of complicated combination like you search optimized your website and Google finally noticed that and updated you in their index and now you are getting more search traffic on Google or whatever .
This could obviously also be applied to other types of data - sales data for a company , probably load numbers on a server .
There is lots of times you use data that you can apply this kind of analysis , too .
The nice thing for us about traffic data is that Google Analytics does have this API , so it 's really easy for us to get you started .
All you have to do is 2 clicks , they can use my analytics data and they can run the analysis .
For other kinds of data it would be more complicated for us to get a large volume of data from you .
To start with , this is a nice easy market and it's a well - defined way for us to market the product , but if people do like what 's doing for their traffic data and think it would be nice to integrate other kinds of data into it , then that 's something we'd like to talk about and maybe we can publish an API that will let them do that or something like that .
7 . Your talk at Future Ruby is about the actual process of creating Trendly .
What 's the the 2 minute version of your talk ?
It 's a very visual talk , so it 's hard to do in an interview .
A lot of it is showing the screen shots of what the product looks like as it was evolving , but one part of the talk that is less visual that I can talk about is the implementation .
We went through a lot of different versions of both of the front end implementation and of the back end implementation .
On the front end , the sort of central piece of Trendly is a chart .
It 's sort of a stream chart .
I do n't know if you 've seen this Last .
FM visualizations of what people 's music listening history is , but it was inspired by that .
I wrote the code to do that chart at least 6 times , I think .
What we finally ended up using was Ruby in ImageMagick generating it on the server side , but I also did a version in Canvas , I did a version in SVG , I did a version in Flash , I did a version using Ruby and OpenGL .
Trying to hit the sweet spot of performance , because the problem with ImageMagick is that it is not hardware accelerated , it 's actually quite slow to generate the charts and appearance - with Open GL we can never get the antialiasing the way we wanted it to look .
Java 2D actually looks like it would be a good way to do it , but I do n't want to write more Java than I have to .
On the client side , Canvas and SVG was too slow , Flash was great but it was limited to 4,000 pixels for any dimension of a Flash movie and we wanted this long scrolling like 25,000 pixel long charts and it was going to be splitting it up in a multiple Flash movies and it was just a huge pain .
Something similar happened with the backend analysis implementation .
It started out being all written in Smalltalk and what we found was that for a variety of reasons , breaking off parts of it into other little helper scripts ended up being necessary .
For example , my initial chart implementation was written in Squeak , using the Squeak graphic primitives , but again , the antialiasing was n't as good as I wanted and that ended in Ruby Image Magick .
Some of the core number crunching code was just running too slow in any dynamic language , so I ended up writing it in Java .
It would have been better to write it in C in some sense , but Java was the nicest environment to develop in that still had an acceptable performance .
I 'm sure now somebody is going to tell me I should have written it in Ocaml .
We ended up with this amazing hodgepodge - it's a pipe line .
It 's almost like a make process , where each of these little programs running in different languages is taking an input file and producing an output file , which also is nice in terms of parallelizing and distributing the work across how many CPUs we have to work with .
But , the way I describe it in the talk is that the thinking is done in Smalltalk , so the complicated analysis stuff , clustering is done in Smalltalk , the computing is done in Java - just the hardcore number crunching - , the interaction is done in Ruby .
Any time we need to deal with an operating system or a C library , like ImageMagick , they just save the interaction with the user .
Then , the interaction with the user of this product ended up with a huge amount of Javascript code .
It 's really basically a big Javascript app that just pulls a little bit of JSON and some images from the server and then builds the UI from that .
There is lots and lots of code running on the client to deal with the user interface of the visualization .
It 's a lot of fun , actually , because there are all these different parts and different languages that we are playing with .
I think some people would run away screaming from that , but to me , I really enjoy it .
8 . What about using Objective - C instead of Java ?
That would have been fine .
I guess I 'm more familiar with using Objective - C on Mac OS X and in a server environment we tend to deploy on Linux servers .
I know the GNUstep project does exist and GCC can compile objective C , but I 'm not as familiar with that particular environment .
Java is fast enough .
9 . What do you use to host Trendly ?
What do you host it on ?
EC2 or on your own servers ?
We have dedicated servers that are hosted .
There is a Montreal datacenter , IWeb is where it is , and we basically rent a big beefy server core from them and host on that .
The main thing for us is to not have to deal with buying and installing and replacing hardware , but we do like rather than having a lot of little individual slices or EC2 instances that we have to manage for us , for system administration it 's easier to have one big very large 8 core machine .
For now , all of Trendly can run on that .
As more people use it , we may need to add more in the mix .
The thing to say about Trendly from the deployment point of view or from a server resource point view is that it 's a batch job .
I mean this data only changes every day and so we can over night just queue up a whole bunch of analysis that we need to do and do that at a leisure .
We do n't really need the kind of dynamic ability to add and remove server capacity on a hour - by - hour , minute - by - minute basis because we can choose when to run these jobs and make sure that we 're making maximum use even of a single server .
Then , when people are actually access it effectively , we are just serving static files and we 've already done the analysis and saved it and all the of dynamic stuff happens on the client side in Javascript .
It 's actually really nice from that point of view .
It 's such a relief to not have to be worrying about server load spiking because 100 people are using it at once .
If 100 people ask for sign up at once and we are trying to do their analysis , we just queue them up and get to them when we get to them .
10 .
On the Ruby part of Trendly , what do you use - 1.8 MRI , 1.9 JRuby , others ?
Yes , MRI 1.8 , I guess .
Whatever ' apt - get install ruby ' gives , whatever the default is .
I 'm not trying to find a bleeding edge implementation .
We did consider using JRuby .
It 's conceivable that by using JRuby and Java we can port the Smalltalk stuff to Ruby and we could get this all down to a single runtime .
If we ever decided we wanted a downloadable version of this and someone could run behind the firewall , would obviously be easier if this were all packaged up into a single JVM and we could just send them a JAR file or something .
But for now we just use MRI .
11 . With your interest and your background in Smalltalk are you working on any other interesting projects with Smalltalk , involving Smalltalk or anything like that ?
One of the things that has come up with Trendly is , as I said , a huge amount of the interface is written in Javascript and I 've seen that , increasingly , every project we do more and more of it is happening on the client side , is happening in Javascript and less and less of the user interface part of it is happening on the server side .
In this case , for example , we do n't do any generation of HTML on the sever side ; that all happens on the client side in Javascript .
We have somewhat a division in our company between backend engineers and frontend engineers .
Luke Andrews does all of our design work , but also does the majority of the Javascript frontend development .
As that shift is happening , it 's putting more and more of a burden on him and we would love as backend engineers to be able to help him out , but we are used to working with different tools in different languages .
We certainly could .
I mean we are comfortable enough in Javascript , we could just write Javascript , but I guess we have certain ideas about what nice language syntax is and Javascript does n't necessarily meet that and certain ideas about nice tools are and Javascript does n't necessarily have those , certain ideas about nice ways of structuring programs are and Javascript maybe can come up with a convention that can work , but it is n't necessarily best suited for that .
One thing that I 've been experimenting within , really just as a kind of side project experiment for now is whether or not I could compile Smalltalk , although you could just as easily do this with Ruby to equivalent Javascript and that would let us write our interfaces rather than writing them in Javascript , write them in Smalltalk .
I should be clear that I 'm not aiming to perfectly recreate the Smalltalk language on top of the Javascript runtime , which certainly you could do , but my goal is that there are all these very highly optimized Javascript VMs coming out like V8 or like the work Mozilla is doing on Trace Monkey or Squirrel Fish Extreme from Apple and to take the best advantage of those .
What I want is not just to be generating Javascript that runs , but Javascript that is more or less idiomatic .
Not necessarily that someone reading the Javascript would enjoy reading it , but that VM is n't going to be surprised by the things that you are doing .
One good example of this is Smalltalk and Ruby both have this notion of early returns from a block returning from the enclosing method .
In Ruby , say , if you have ' array . each do ... end ' and than somewhere in that do block there is a return , that does n't just return from that iteration of the block that actually returns from the entire method .
The only way to that in Javascript would be to throw an exception and then you got exception handlers everywhere , basically wherever you got a block .
I do n't know , I have n't measured what the performance impact is on that , but I can certainly imagine that , even if it 's not true now , the Javascript implementations possibly in the future might be very much slowed down by it .
What I 'm trying to do is come up with a subset of Smalltalk that maps nicely to Javascript .
So far , that 's been pretty successful .
The fun thing so far is that , because I 'm sort of visioning eventually a Smalltalk - like development environment inside the browser and it needs to be self hosting and so I 've been playing around with PEG grammars which are a lot of fun .
The parsing expression grammars and having this Smalltalk subset has a PEG library that lets it parse and compile itself .
It 's fully bootstraped that way and you can just load a bootstrap file into a browser and go from there .
The name of this project for now anyway is Clamato and I was trying to figure out the other day where that even came from .
I think it was that I was talking to Chad Folwer and Chad said " Hey , I just made this neat discovery !
There is this thing called Clamato and it's great !
It 's clam juice mixed into tomato juice ! "
Most people I think would have gone " Oh , that 's totally disgusting ! " , but I'm Canadian and Clamato is a Canadian thing , is Canadian invention and so this is totally natural for me .
For me , the response was to say back " Yes , and you should try putting that into a Bloody Mary .
It 's called a Cesar . "
I do n't actually even like Cesars , but it somehow triggered a sense of national identity and the next project that I did got randomly called Clamato because of that .
It 's on GitHub , you can find it and check it out .
I really do n't know where it 's going and I do n't know if it 's just what I 'm interested in this week and it will go away , but I think the amount of investment that 's going into Javascript runtimes right now , we would be foolish not to take advantage of it .
I 'm curious to see whether V8 , for example , becomes more of a compilation target for a new dynamic language implementations or just new dynamic languages .
12 . What 's the current subset of Smalltalk in Clamato ?
Right now , one difference for now between Clamato and Smalltalk is that I have just a file based classic method definition syntax rather than having full environment .
I guess it 's like GNU Smalltalk in that respect although I 've tried to be more minimal , have less punctuation in the syntax , but that 's irrelevant .
There is no metaclass hierarchy in the sense that instance methods get inherited but class side methods - are what in the Java world you might think of static methods , in Ruby there are singleton methods - anyway , [ class methods ] do n't get inherited !
That 's the same as in Javascript .
If you attach a method to a constructor , stuff that has that constructor 's instance as a prototype wo n't get that method , but the instance methods .
There is a normal inherited hierarchy .
That 's one big but I do n't think terribly significant difference .
I mean Smalltalk just love the metaclass hierarchy , but I think for a lot of beginners it 's just a source of confusion more than anything else .
I 'm so far not hugely missing the lack of that .
There are no cascades in the syntax , which is probably the thing most likely to change .
I may add those in if it gets too frustrating .
For people that do n't know Smalltalk , a cascade is a syntax for sending a succession of messages , calling a bunch of methods in a row on the same object .
Where it 's most useful , it 's when you are configuring a new instance .
You just created something , you want to call a bunch of methods on it to set up a bunch of stuff .
It 's nice if you do n't have to have a temp variable that you keep referring to when you are doing that , but again , it 's no big deal .
The biggest change probably is - getting back to what I was saying before about early return semantics from blocks - there is no explicit return at all .
Like Ruby , there is an implicit return of the last expression - or like Lisp , I guess - but there is no way at all to return early from a method .
That changes a little bit how you structure stuff .
I 'm used to guard clauses where you check something and return early if something is n't what you want or if there is a base case and a recursion or whatever and instead , you end up with the kind of nasty if expression , very expression based stuff that you might see more like a scheme , but I do really like that implicit expression return .
When you got a simple method , it 's really nice to just have a single expression and that be the result rather than have to explicitly return .
It 's just an aesthetic thing , but the semantics of the early returns from blocks were going to be too unjavascripty for this project .
The only other change that I can think above hand is that rather than declaring instance variables upfront as in Smalltalk and having that be a standard amount of memory that 's allocated when you are creating an object , in Javascript you can always create a new property so that 's true for instance variables in this language as well .
Instance variables work more like they do in Ruby and actually I use the same syntax of having an @ sign in front of instance variables .
Any time you use an @ sign , the identifier creates a new instance variable for you on the fly .
13 .
Which means you do n't have to use self and the name of the getter , I suppose , as in Smalltalk ?
In Smalltalk you can always reference the name of the instance variable directly , if you wanted to , but they did have to be declared as part of the class definition , as you would have to in Java or Objective - C or anything else .
In general , I like that , because you have a very clear knowledge of what the memory profile of a class is going to be .
If you are declaring the instance variable and is going to allocate exactly that many slots , then you can predict precisely how much memory an instance of that class is going to take up .
In Ruby , you might use a hash table , which might use an arbitrary amount of memory , it might be allocating slots explicitly or it might some mix of the two .
So , you can get much less predictable and also much higher memory overheads .
In the last weeks I have been asked several times to modify some components I ’m working on to add the ability to split a full name in its components ( first name , family name , etc. ) .
It looks like most people have great expectations about this working correctly but they get annoyed when it fails , and you can be sure it will fail .
It will fail because it ’s impossible to parse a name correctly , for instance :
Full name First Middle Last Barack Hussein Obama Barack Hussein Obama Pier Silvio Berlusconi Pier Silvio Berlusconi José Rodríguez Zapatero José Rodríguez Zapatero
How can you do this automatically ?
This becomes particularly silly if you cannot be sure that the string you are going to parse is actually a full name , for instance do n’t try to parse a chat nickname .
It ’s true that gmail / gtalk uses your full name by default , but this is only a default and it ’s true only for gmail .
To cut a long story short , please please please do n’t try to parse names .
You can see by yourself how hard it is , even if I ’m just considering western - style names .
If you still do n’t trust me here ’s a quote from e-name - western.c , i.e. the file that does name parsing in libebook :
* < Nat > Jamie , do you know anything about name parsing ?
* < jwz >
Are you going down that rat hole ?
Bring a flashlight .
On a side note when you are trying to understand why some code is broken you can find some funny commits , like the great EDS purge
Update : I found this “ serious ” bug in e_name_western_parse .
NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen is meeting with Kosovo officials and evaluating a possible winding down of the 13,800 strong Kosovo Force ( KFOR ) if the security situation in the region continues to improve .
" I would like to stress that this decision only reflects the improvement of the security situation in Kosovo and I would like to add to this that the decision is conditionally based , " he told reporters in Pristina .
He did not give a time frame to a possible troop reduction .
The new NATO head , who took over from Jaap de Hoop - Scheffer earlier this month , made the comments after meeting with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci .
He is also to hold a meeting with the KFOR commander , Lieutenant General Giuseppe Emilio Gay during the one - day visit .
" The fact I decided to go to Kosovo only a few days after I took over my new office clearly reflects that I will give Kosovo high priority in my work as secretary general of NATO , " Rasmussen , a former Danish prime minister , said after the meeting .
Rasmussen 's first trip as NATO chief was to Afghanistan , where he wants to boost NATO troops to complete a successful handover of security to local forces .
Disputed region
NATO troops have been in Kosovo since 1999 , after an 11 - week bombing campaign by the alliance to end a bloody crackdown by forces loyal to then Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic on separatist ethnic Albanians .
Rasmussen , left , meets with Kosovo President Fatmir Sejdiu , right , and Prime Minister Hashim Thaci
An initial force of 50,000 has been reduced to under 14,000 , and NATO has announced plans to cut the mission to 10,000 troops by January .
NATO has plans to assist Kosovo authorities in the development of a Kosovo Security Force , a civilian protection force of about 2,500 that would help in emergency situations .
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in February 2008 , although Serbia has said it will never recognize an independent state and would continue to fight its independence diplomatically .
The West generally supports Kosovo independence although it is opposed by Russia and China .
Of the territory 's two million people , some 90 percent are ethnic Albanian .

Housing Finance Debate : A Return to ARMs ?
A new , lower rate on some adjustable - rate mortgages may entice homebuyers .
July 17 , 2009  --
They were one of the scourges of the housing crisis , but are adjustable - rate mortgages on the verge of a comeback ?
It depends on whom you ask .
Last week homebuilder Toll Brothers announced that , in certain housing markets , it would offer its homebuyers ARMs featuring a 3.75 percent interest rate for the first seven years of the loan and a reset rate capped at 8.75 percent for loans at or below $ 417,000 .
To qualify , home buyers must have credit scores of at least 720 .
Don Salmon , the chief executive of TBI Mortgage Company , Toll Brothers ' mortgage division , told ABCNews.com that on the weekend following the announcement , the homebuilder saw a spike in interest that 's unusual for the typically slow summer season .
Other homebuilders and lenders , he said , might follow Toll Brothers ' lead .
" If the product makes sense to the consumers , then consumers will demand it ( and ) then the lender will offer it , " he said .
But others , like Bankrate.com senior financial analyst Greg McBride , are skeptical .
" People have been scared away from adjustable - rate mortgages and at the same time , the factors that led them to pick adjustable rate mortgages in the first place have dissipated , " McBride said .
As of July 10 , roughly 5 percent of borrowers chose ARMs , according to the latest data from the Mortgage Bankers Association .
That represents an uptick from earlier this year but it 's still far from the highs last seen in the summer of 2007 :
At that time , more than one in five borrowers chose adjustable - rate loans .
Toll Brothers ' rate notwithstanding , McBride said the average interest rate for 7 - year ARMs is 5.55 percent -- just 0.2 percentage points lower than the average rate for a 30 - year fixed loan .
" The value for the overwhelming majority of homeowners is in fixed - rate mortgages , " he said .
Adjustable - rate mortgages , McBride said , were a niche product that became popular during the housing boom as buyers used them as an " affordability crutch " -- in other words , buyers who might not have been able to afford the rates on a traditional , 30 - year - fixed mortgage could qualify for with the lower initial rates on adjustable loans .
While the housing market was strong , many homeowners with ARMs figured they could sell their homes before their interest rates reset or refinance into fixed - rate home loans .
Those assumptions often proved false and defaults by adjustable - rate mortgage homeowners -- particularly for homeowners with bad credit who took out subprime adjustable - rate loans -- played a key role in driving foreclosures to record highs .
An ' Iron Stomach ' for ARMs
McBride said that a homebuyer today would be foolish to assume they could find a bank to refinance them out of an ARM .
And taking the bet that you'd be able to sell your home before the reset requires a " cast iron stomach , " he said .
Banks and investors who buys home loans from lenders are n't keen on ARMs either , McBride said .
" The secondary market been dead for a couple of years , " he said .
Salmon says that Toll Brothers , however , wo n't have trouble selling its ARMs .
The delinquency rate for Toll Brothers borrowers , he said , is less than 1.7 percent .
The homebuilders ' underwriting standards -- including the 720 credit score minimum -- are prudent , Salmon said .
" We have a very strong buyer profile and our delinquencies historically are lower than the market , therefore our product is more attractive to banks , " he said .
There may be more than just buyer stats working in Toll Brothers ' favor .
McBride said that since Toll Brothers is a homebuilder and a lender , they have a flexibility that traditional lenders do n't -- the costs of offering ARMs could be offset by the increases in home sales .
Still , David Ledford , the senior vice president for housing finance and land development at the National Association of Homebuilders , said that as of now , most other homebuilders have n't followed suit .
Instead , to combat the continued lack of demand from would - be homebuyers , other builders are subsidizing fixed - rate mortgages to offer lower rates , he said .
Some homebuilders have gone a few steps further , offering pre-paid homeowner association dues , free parking , free flat - screen televisions or new furniture .
Such incentives have become more common among homebuilders because , unlike many individual home sellers , the builders stand to lose more money the longer their homes go unsold , Scott Nagel , the vice president of real estate operations for the online realty company Redfin , recently told ABCNews.com .
" Most of the time , they 've got their costs sunk , " he said .
" They 're making payments on the construction loans that they used to build those condos and those homes .
Every month they 're not selling , it 's another month it 's eating into their profit margin . "
Toll Brothers , which finds that many of its buyers are existing homeowners , offers some help in selling their old homes .
In some communities , they assist in making old homes look more attractive to buyers by eliminating clutter , paint touch - ups and other small fixes .
Toll Brothers also offers guidance on marketing your old home .
" We do many things to help people sell their homes , " Salmon said , " because we know that that eases the path to settling in our home . "
Surely you have noted the recent news articles about the connection between population and the envoirnmental concerns .
Some group of , no doubt , really smart people concluded that it is us that are the problem .
Each one of us adds to the pollution issue and each of us uses up tons of carbon during our life span .
Well , they could have asked Pogo and saved themselves lots of time and effort .
You recall that he declared decades ago that he had met the enemy and it was us .
Well , we are carbon based creatures since we are literally made of the stuff and everything we use and need has some place on the carbon chain .
We ca n’t exist without carbon and utilizing it for not only our power but for our food and clothing and even those Ipods that need carbon in their manufactoring process .
The elites grandly concluded that the sure way to reduce carbon emissions would be to reduce world population and world population growth .
I have said for a long time that their analysis is correct .
It is merely logical and factual .
No matter what we do with carbon emission controls or any other envoirnmental program it will be spitting into the wind if the population continues at its current growth levels .
The European population has reached a point of sustainability or even declining growth over the last few decades .
From Italy to Sweden and Britain to Poland the trend is there to see .
The numbers have quit rising .
Many demographers claim that they are n’t having enough babies to maintain their current population numbers and that total population will decline steadily over the next few decades .
Sadly , the areas of the world that will produce the most carbon pollution and population growth are in the places that will not accede to any envoirnmental restrictions and their populations are expected to explode by mid century to swell our total numbers to over 9 billion .
China , India , Brazil and the countries of Africa and Latin America are not making any real progress in this regard except for China .
You are surely familar with their program of limiting families to one child .
They do impose steep penalties for violations and require sterilization in some cases .
Their population is stabilizing at the moment but will it last ?
Will they change the rules as their people prosper more in the coming decades ?
How will they support an huge , aging population with fewer young people to work ?
Of course there have been predictions before that we would over populate ourselves into complete oblivion .
I do think there is sense in that concern .
There has to be some limit to how many people Mother Earth can sustain at even primitive levels of existence .
I have no clue what that number is .
Can we support 29 billion ?
49 billion ?
There is a number , we just do n’t know it .
We have to take these projections and predictions with extreme caution .
During the ’ 60’s and ’ 70 ’s there were many predictions of impending doom for the entire world .
Some of those elite thinkers predicted mass starvation of huge swaths of the planet and that pollution of the earth and seas would kill us anyway if the starvation did n’t .
Lots of those folks believed we had already reached a tipping point with DDT and PCB ’s , etc. and would all die of cancer or malformations .
Look it up , you can find lots of those predictions from that era .
Rachel Carson got the most publicity with these predictions but she was joined by many others .
Well , here we are .
No one , even in the poorest countries starves because there is a lack of food .
Some have starvation issues like in Darfur , but in every case it is due to politics and conflicts that disrupt the transportation of food , not the lack of it .
At the moment we produce enough food for every one and then some .
To make it even more confusing there are some demographers who actually believe the entire world will soon go into an overall decline in population growth .
They believe that population will decrease over the coming decades .
First it will be in Europe and the US but it will spread to BRIC and all the Third World .
That is another interesting scenario .
It offers reall posers for the economists of the future .
Except for the Black Plague and the world wars we do n’t have an historical template for that kind of event .
We do n’t know what will happen to the economies of the world if that reduction were to occur .
We ca n’t go back and compare it to anything else .
The Black Plague made labor more dear and did cause changes in the feudal system because labor was dearer than before .
Some good came out of it but also lots of harm .
There were fewer customers for everything .
The labor was mostly for agricultural needs .
The world wars were only a temporary dip in growth .
In spite of the enormous number of deaths they were still quite small compared to the total population of the West .
I do n’t know about you , but I wo n’t be here to see how it all plays out .
If you are under 40 though you need to give this issue serious thought .
You can be assured that others will be giving it thought .
There will controversies over allegations of racism , there will be pointed disputes about encouraging abortion and many other contentious issues .
I have no doubt you will work it out some how .
If we do n’t do it ourselves then Mother Nature will do it for us .
She will get the final vote on the matter .
Man proposes and God disposes .
First we took tax payer money to pay some , but not all , delinquent mortgages .
You had to pay for your neighbor ’s profligacy .
Now we are taking taxpayer money to buy cars from Government owned companies that will need subsidies for as far as the eye can see .
If they are truly interested in stimulating the economy then it should be for all industries and business sectors not just the union favorites of the politicians .
Heck , just let us all have a voucher to spend on anything .
It could not be saved or invested .
It only had value if you spent it .
Why not rob from all of us and give to all of us at one time .
Is this a great country or what ?

Britain 's biggest polluting companies are abusing a European emissions trading scheme ( ETS ) designed to tackle global warming by cashing in their carbon credits in order to bolster ailing balance sheets .
The sell - off has helped trigger a collapse in the price of carbon , making it cheaper to burn high - carbon fossil fuels and leading to a fall in the number of clean energy projects .
The moves were seized on by environmentalists and other critics who have previously criticised the European Union 's ETS for delivering more windfall profits for business than climate change .
" This [ ETS ] was not designed as a scheme to give corporates cheap short - term funding options in the face of a credit crunch meltdown where banks are not lending , but that appears to be what 's happening , " said Mark Lewis , a carbon analyst at Deutsche Bank .
Steel , concrete and glassmakers are believed to be the main sellers along with financial speculators such as hedge funds .
The sell - off of the pollution permits has led to carbon prices plunging 60 % – from over € 30 to around € 12 per tonne .
The EU 's emissions trading scheme was set up as a market solution to cut greenhouse gas pollution from industry .
Polluters were issued with permits that can be traded between companies and countries as a way of encouraging an overall reduction in carbon output .
However , companies are now cashing them in for their own financial benefit .
Up to € 1 bn - worth of carbon emissions permits are said to have been sold off in recent months as industrial companies see an opportunity to bring in funds at a time when their carbon output is expected to fall due to lower production .
Environmentalists expressed anger last night about the way the ETS was being used .
" The ETS has bowed to corporate self - interest at every stage of its design and implementation , so there is no surprise that it is now being used as a cash cow to see firms through a difficult financial phase , " said Oscar Reyes , a researcher with Carbon Trade Watch .
Point Carbon , an information provider and consultancy , claims the sell - offs are only one of a number of factors that are influencing prices and argues it is " rational " for companies to be selling off credits at this time .
The falling price of oil – from $ 147 per barrel last summer to less than $ 40 now – has dragged down the cost of gas , making it relatively cheap to burn in power stations , it argues .
" Recession in Europe is bringing a slowdown in manufacturing meaning less production and less emissions .
Companies are doing exactly what is the rational thing to do in these circumstances which is to sell if they are long on credits .
It is right that if they are emitting less then they do not need the credits so much and the price of carbon will fall , " said Henrik Hasselknippe , global head of carbon at Point Carbon .
But the price collapse brings echoes of 2006 when it emerged that EU states had given industry too many carbon credits , creating a glut that made them almost worthless .
Since then the European commission has amended the scheme and some of the credits have been auctioned rather than given away .
A study commissioned by the WWF environmental organisation from Point Carbon , published in March last year , estimated that " windfall profits " of between € 23bn ( £ 21.4bn ) and € 71bn would be made under the ETS between 2008 and 2012 on the basis that the price of carbon would be between € 21 and € 32 .
Up to € 15bn could be made by British companies that were given credits they did not need .
Analysts said it was very hard to identify on an individual basis which companies were selling their credits but easier to say which sectors they came from such as cement , whose production is expected to drop 20 % this year and steel where volumes could fall by 15 % .
Lafarge , the world 's biggest cement maker and owner of Blue Circle Cement in Britain , said last night that it had only sold a small number of credits on the open market .
" We mainly sell our credits from one country to another , for example if we have too many in France then we might sell them to Romania if we do n't have enough there .
Very few credits are being sold on the [ open ] market , " said a spokeswoman at its Paris headquarters , while steelmaker Corus was unavailable for comment .
The collapse in the price of carbon has also caused a slowdown in clean energy projects in developing countries against which western firms can gain credits .
The price of Clean Development Mechanism ( CDMs ) offsets has slumped by nearly 30 % over the last couple of weeks .
CantorC02e , a broker in the field , says it is scaling back its operations .
The emissions trading firm has no immediate plans to cut its 40 staff , but says this cannot be ruled out while EcoSecurities , a stock - listed carbon offsetting company , has seen its share price collapse from £ 1.50 to less than 30p .
The low price of UN - approved offsets , known as Certified Emissions Reductions , is slowing the number of clean energy projects being developed in China .
" I 'd say there is half the number of players now than there was a year ago .
Banks have cut back considerably , " said a small Chinese project developer .
James Thompson , finance director of EcoSecurities , says he is confident that the price of carbon will rebound along with a wider economic recovery in 12 or 18 months ' time .
" The short - term price will also recover when the flow of credits stop coming on to the market and long - term pressure will come from governments realising they need a strong carbon price for environmental reasons . "
( CNN ) -- Schools of robotic fish could one day map the ocean floor , detect pollution or inspect and survey submerged boats or oil and gas pipelines , researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology say .
MIT researcher Pablo Valdivia Alvarado works in his lab on a robotic fish he co-created .
MIT engineers are showing off the latest generation of so - called robofish 15 years after they built the first one .
The latest incarnation is sleeker , more streamlined and capable of mimicking the movements of a real fish .
And it 's capable of exploring underwater terrain submersibles can't , said Pablo Valdivia Alvarado , a mechanical engineer at the school .
" Some of our sponsors were thinking of using them for inspection and surveillance , " Alvarado said .
" Since these prototypes are very cheap , the idea was to build hundreds -- 200 , 500 -- and then just release them in a bay or at a port , and they would be roaming around taking measurements . "
MIT researchers built their first robotic fish , " Robotuna , " in 1994 .
But Robotuna has gone the way of the dinosaur .
Alvarado said the new generation -- modeled after bass and trout -- cost only a few hundred dollars and have only 10 parts instead of the thousands used in Robotuna .
At five to 18 inches , the new fish is much smaller than Robotuna and built from a single , soft polymer .
And unlike Robotuna , the fish is able to be released in the oceans .
" Most of the brains , the electronics , are embedded inside , " said Alvarado , who designed the robofish with fellow MIT engineer Kamal Youcef - Toumi .
" We have built prototypes with the battery inside , but for my experiments , for simplicity .
We have a lot of prototypes that are simply tethered .
We have a cable that runs out from the body and connects to a power supply . "
The new generation has withstood harsh conditions in the lab , including two years of testing inside tanks filled with tap water , which is corrosive to standard robots , according to Alvarado , who says the Robotuna inspired him to take the technology to the next level .
The oil exploration company Schlumberger helped fund the research , but Alvarado says the U.S. Navy has also expressed interest in the robofish .
MIT 's mechanical engineers are now turning their attention to new challenges : A robotic manta ray and a terrestrial robot in the form of a salamander .

In How a Perl 5 Program Works and On Parsing Perl 5 , I mentioned ways to manipulate the Perl 5 parser as it executes .
The easiest way to do so is through the use of Perl 5 subroutine prototypes .
This early draft excerpt from Modern Perl : the book explains the good and the bad of prototypes and when they 're a good idea in modern Perl code .
Perl 5 's prototypes serve two purposes .
First , they 're hints to the parser to change the way it parses subroutines and their arguments .
Second , they change the way Perl 5 handles arguments to those subroutines when it executes them .
A common novice mistake is to assume that they serve the same language purpose as subroutine signatures in other languages .
This is not true .
To declare a subroutine prototype , add it after the name :
sub foo ( &@ ) ; sub bar ( $ $ ) { ... } my $ baz = sub ( && ) { ... } ;
You may add prototypes to subroutine forward declarations .
You may also omit them from forward declarations .
If you use a forward declaration with a prototype , that prototype must be present in the full subroutine declaration ;
Perl will give a prototype mismatch warning if not .
The converse is not true : you may omit the prototype from a forward declaration and include it for the full declaration .
The original intent of prototypes was to allow users to define their own subroutines which behaved like ( certain ) built - in operators .
For example , consider the behavior of the push operator , which takes an array and a list .
While Perl 5 would normally flatten the array and list into a single list at the call site , the Perl 5 parser knows that a call to push must effectively pass the array as a single unit so that push can operate on the array in place .
The prototype operator takes the name of a function and returns a string representing its prototype , if any , and undef otherwise .
To see the prototype of a built - in operator , use the CORE : : form :
$ perl - E " say prototype ' CORE : : push ' ; " \@@
As you might expect , the @ character represents a list .
The backslash forces the corresponding argument to become a reference to that argument .
Thus mypush might be :
sub mypush ( \@@ ) { my ( $ array , @rest ) = @_ ; push @$array , @rest ; }
Valid prototype characters include $ to force a scalar argument , % to mark a hash ( most often used as a reference ) , and & which marks a code block .
The fullest documentation is available in perldoc perlsub .
The Problem with Prototypes
The main problem with prototypes is that they behave differently than most people expect when first encountering them .
Prototypes can change the parsing of subsequent code and they can coerce the types of arguments .
They do n't serve as documentation to the number or types of arguments subroutines expect , nor do they map arguments to named parameters .
Prototype coercions work in subtle ways , such as enforcing scalar context on incoming arguments :
sub numeric_equality ( $ $ ) { my ( $ left , $ right ) = @_ ; return $ left == $ right ; } my @nums = 1 .. 10 ; say " They 're equal , whatever that means ! " if numeric_equality @nums , 10 ;
... and not working on anything more complex than simple expressions :
sub mypush ( \@@ ) ; # XXX : prototype type mismatch syntax error mypush ( my $ elems = [ ] , 1 .. 20 ) ;
Those are n't even the subtler kinds of confusion you can get from prototypes ; see Far More Than Everything You 've Ever Wanted to Know About Prototypes in Perl for a dated but enlightening explanation of other problems .
Good Uses of Prototypes
As long as code maintainers do not confuse them for full subroutine signatures , prototypes have a few valid uses .
First , they are often necessary to emulate and override built - in operators with user - defined subroutines .
As shown earlier , you must first check that you can override the built - in operator by checking that prototype does not return undef .
Once you know the prototype of the operator , use the subs pragma to declare that you want to override a core operator :
use subs ' push ' ; sub push ( \@@ ) { ... }
Beware that the subs pragma is in effect for the remainder of the file , regardless of any lexical scoping .
The second reason to use prototypes is to define compile - time constants .
A subroutine declared with an empty prototype ( as opposed to an absent prototype ) which evaluates to a single expression becomes a constant in the Perl 5 optree rather than a subroutine call :
sub PI ( ) { 4 * atan2 ( 1 , 1 ) }
The Perl 5 parser knows to substitute the calculated value of pi whenever it encounters a bareword or parenthesized call to PI in the rest of the source code ( with respect to scoping and visibility ) .
Rather than defining constants directly , the core constant pragma handles the details for you and may be clearer to read .
If you want to interpolate constants into strings , the Readonly module from the CPAN may be more useful .
The final reason to use a prototype is to extend Perl 's syntax to operate on anonymous functions as blocks .
The CPAN module Test :: Exception uses this to good effect to provide a nice API with delayed computation .
This sounds complex , but it 's easy to explain .
The throws_ok ( ) subroutine takes three arguments : a block of code to run , a regular expression to match against the string of the exception , and an optional description of the test .
Suppose that you want to test Perl 5's exception message when attempting to invoke a method on an undefined value :
use Test :: More tests => 1 ; use Test :: Exception ; throws_ok { my $ not_an_object ; $ not_an_object->some_method ( ) } qr/Ca n't call method " some_method " on an undefined value / , ' Calling a method on an undefined invocant should throw exception ' ;
The exported throws_ok ( ) subroutine has a prototype of &$ ;$ .
Its first argument is a block , which Perl upgrades to a full - fledged anonymous function .
The second requirement is a scalar .
The third argument is optional .
The most careful readers may have spotted a syntax oddity notable in its absence : there is no trailing comma after the end of the anonymous function passed as the first argument to throws_ok ( ) .
This is a quirk of the Perl 5 parser .
Adding the comma causes a syntax error .
The parser expects whitespace , not the comma operator .
You can use this API without the prototype .
It 's slightly less attractive :
use Test :: More tests => 1 ; use Test :: Exception ; throws_ok ( sub { my $ not_an_object ; $ not_an_object->some_method ( ) } , qr / Ca n't call method " some_method " on an undefined value / , ' Calling a method on an undefined invocant should throw exception ' ) ;
For entrepreneurs trying to start or run a business , the obstacles are huge .
But few loom as large as one : health care .
For years , small businesses have griped about the burden of rising health - care costs and warned that the situation was near a crisis point .
Well , it 's fair to say that the crisis point is here .
At some businesses , in fact , ...
The deepwater rice normally grows to about one meter ( 3.3 ft ) tall , but can respond to flooding by quickly extending the stem several meters more .
Researchers announced their findings regarding the genes SNORKEL1 and SNORKEL2 in the journal Nature , and described how the genes help regulate the signaling of ethylene response factors that help trigger growth in the rice plant .
They also combined the best of rice variants by introducing the genes into non-deepwater rice that produces higher yield .
I wrote earlier that it was probably driving Google crazy to see people “ amazed ” that Bing is doing stuff that Google itself has long offered .
Now Google ’s fighting back .
The first shot ?
A new Explore Google Search page .
Google ’s had help pages like this before .
For example , this one still remains , showing various special features such as the ability to get weather results .
But this new page is being featured right from the Google home page :
The page frames many of Google ’s features in an easier - to - read format :
And it comes with an introduction highlighting how serious Google is about search :
Search is at the heart of everything we do at Google .
Our engineers work every day to solve the hardest search problems , and thus improve your online experience .
Here ’s a glimpse at what they do , the features they ’ve built and the remarkable user stories that inspire our work .
As I said before :
Google ’s never really had to market itself to consumers , to trot its stuff .
The recently held “ Searchology ” event did n’t cover anywhere near the range of what Google offers .
But if the praise for Bing keeps largely rolling in — if people keep discovering features that are n’t necessarily unique to Bing —
Google may find it has to step up .
To me , this page is all about doing that stepping up .
Of course , the page is well worth reviewing , for those who are n’t aware how Google can provide everything from sports scores to flight tracking .
As can Bing , and as can Yahoo .
This week Stamen Design released San Francisco Crimespotting .
It ’s a crime map and notification system that allows for time and crime trend analysis .
SF Crimespotting has launched just over two years after the release Oakland Crimespotting ( Radar post ) .
Stamen had been waiting for crime data all this time and with the launch of DataSF they are able to use an official API for crime data .
SF Crimespotting is very similar to the initial release for Oakland .
As I wrote in 2007 :
Each type of crime is assigned a color - coded icon with an abbreviation .
You can highlight all of a crime type ’s markers with a mouseover .
You can also change the number of days for which crimes are shown .
Each crime has a detail page and that crime can then be viewed in context with others .
You can also slice the data by day , type and the intersection of the two .
You can also subscribe to get email alerts and RSS feeds for a specific place in Oakland .
The latest releases of the Crimespotting platform reflect several important trends in online mapping :
1 ) Crowdsourced Maps – When Oakland Crimespotting launched it used Microsoft Live maps ( which would now be called Bing ) .
They have switched to Cloudmade maps which are based on Open Street Map data .
The maps look amazing and at initial glance they appear to be the same as any other major provider ’s maps .
Google ’s Mapmaker project ( Radar posts ) has also been seeing more attention and just this week expanded into Mexico ( I wonder how long until they bring Mapmaker to the US ) .
Waze ( Radar post ) is using user - generated traces to create their realtime maps .
2 ) Temporal Mapping – Time is being added to online maps and other visualizations .
As data comes to use in realtime there are new conventions that need to be developed .
Stamen , through this project and their work with Trulia Hindsight ( Radar post ) and MySociety ( Radar post ) , are at the forefront of designing methods of dealing with varying scales and types of time data .
In their post The Pie of Time Stamen details their thinking for how to represent hours , days and years in the project .
The old Crimespotting did not allow you to navigate to archival data .
With the new UI there are now permalinks to all crime reports
The hours control is shown to the right .
Only the crimes that occurred during the highlighted times will appear on the map .
Stamen has included quick links to show specific times like “ Commute ” and “ Nightlife ” .
The slider and dropdown used to navigate days , months and years are shown above .
Each day of the slider shows the total amount of crime that day .
The highlighted area dictates the crime shown on the map .
3 ) Government Data –
The new federal administration has shown a renewed interest in releasing data ( most of this will have some geocomponent ) .
The 2010 Census is around the corner and that will add to the data flow .
As more data is released you can expect an explosion of government mashups .
You can also expect more civic minded companies ( especially after this week ’s exit by Everyblock ( Radar post ) ) .
4 ) Geo-Analysis – GIS used within enterprises , governments and universities are designed to take massive geodata sets and simplify them so that decisions can be made .
Crimespotting may look like a slick consumer app and that ’s because it is .
However as you manipulate its many controls you ’ll realize that you can learn a lot about a city and how a time of day or section of the city impacts the likelihood of your being involved in a crime .
You can determine if you ’re more likely to be mugged in the Castro on Thursdays vs. Tuesdays .
The only problem is that you are limited to crime data .
I ’d love to have ability to add other layers like housing prices or average income .
Crimespotting has a read API ; I hope Stamen adds Write capabilities .
I ’d ask the kind folks at Stamen ( very nicely ) to make a Crimespotting Seattle , but unfortunately we do n’t publicly release our crime data .
Here ’s to hoping that we get a mayor in this Fall ’s election who will open the data coffers .
Does your city share its data ?
If so include a link in the comments .
All of these trends are going to be big topics at this year ’s Where 2.0 ( 3/31 - 4/2 in San Jose ) .

British Humanist Association : Anti-witchcraft conference attacked by Christian church in Nigeria
Leo Igwe , a friend of the British Humanist Association and Executive Secretary of the Nigerian Humanist Movement , was attacked yesterday during a raid by 150 to 200 members of a Christian church at a conference he had organised on " Child Rights and Witchcraft " in Calabar .
Leo had recently returned from London where he attended a BHA day conference and other international humanist events held at Conway Hall over the space of a week , including the world 's first international conference on " Untouchability " , where he was invited to speak on the problem of caste discrimination in Nigeria .
Whilst in London he also spoke to the BBC on the problems faced in Nigeria due to religious superstition .
Helen Ukpabio and her church , the Liberty Foundation Gospel Ministries , have run a campaign of terror against children and those committed to fighting for their rights , of which yesterday 's raid was only the latest development .
The conference had been organised by the Nigerian Humanist Movement and the UK charity Stepping Stones Nigeria in response to the widespread abandonment , torture and killing of children in Akwa Ibom and Cross River State due to the belief in child " witches " .
As the anti-witchcraft conference began at around 10.30 am , the religious protesters dressed in orange raided the venue and began protesting loudly .
The extremists were carrying a number of banners with slogans such as , " This protest is organised by The Akwa Ibom State Government " , " We give freedom to the witches " and " Stepping Stone is not a registered organisation " .
Among the other delegates attacked , Leo Igwe had his glasses smashed and his bag , phone and camera stolen by the mob , who were alternately singing and aggressively disrupting the conference .
After an hour and a half , the police turned up and dispersed the mob .
One person was arrested .
Speaking after the event Leo said : " The conference was a peaceful meeting for people to openly debate what could be done to prevent the abuse of child rights linked to the belief in witchcraft .
This attack by Helen Ukpabio 's supporters once again highlights the depravity of this so - called " woman of God " .
Such false prophets should be immediately arrested and prosecuted under the child rights act " .
Despite the raid the conference , which was well attended by representatives of the Cross River State Government , UNICEF , NAPTIP and a wide range of traditional rulers , students and NGOs , still went ahead successfully .
The issue of child witchcraft has attracted a great deal of media attention since the broadcast of the documentary , Saving Africa 's Witch Children .
The documentary , which won the prestigious BAFTA and Amnesty Film awards highlights the role that Helen Ukpabio has played in spreading the belief in child " witches " in South - Eastern Nigeria .
Teachings such as the one offered by Helen Ukpabio in her book , Unveiling the Mysteries of Witchcraft , which states that , " a child under two years of age that cries at night and deteriorates in health is an agent of Satan " , have caused wide spread international outrage and condemnation of her practices .
Josh Kutchinsky , a Trustee of the British Humanist Association , said today , " Leo is a dear friend .
He is knowledgeable , wise and courageous .
I know that he is outraged by the damage done by superstition and irrational religiosity to the potential for development in Nigeria .
One of his principal methods he uses to combat these problems is to write well crafted and cogent articles .
These have been published in national media and have gained considerable attention .
His other methods are to organise conferences and to visit others in support of them as individuals or their organisations .
He is working with Amnesty International and Stepping Stones Nigera .
He is the IHEU representative in West Africa and a representative on the African Commission on Human and People 's Rights .
" His intervention in individual cases of injustice , no doubt involve some personal risk .
He and his fellow Nigerian Humanists have been awarded the Rainbow Humanist Award by Nordic Rainbow Humanists for their risky public support of LGBT rights in Nigeria . "
Speaking from Stepping Stones Nigeria 's office in UK , the charity 's Programme Director , Gary Foxcroft , said : " The prevalence of the belief in child witchcraft in South - Eastern Nigeria can be linked to the books , movies and teachings of Helen Ukpabio .
She has made a great deal of money by promoting this superstitious belief and seems willing to do anything to protect her interests .
We call upon the Nigerian Federal Government and the Inspector General of Police to act urgently to prevent Helen causing any further embarrassment to Nigeria 's reputation . "
In solidarity with the Nigerian Humanist Association , the British Humanist Association has called on the Akwa Ibom State Government to uphold the terms of its Child Rights Act , which was enacted precisely to make accusations of witchcraft against children illegal .
On its website www.aksgonline.com/issue_child_abuse.aspx the Akwa Ibom State Government states that it " will not fold its hands and watch evil elements of society dehumanise , demoralise , bastardise , displace , stigmatise , or persecute our children for personal gains . "
The Government then states how it will :
· Place full legislative machinery against labelling of children as witches
· Advance high powered investigation into every element of the issues involved and all allegations against persons involved in stigmatisation of children as witches
· Prosecute all persons found culpable of this crime of child labelling
· Deploy social resources for the support , comfort and enjoyment of all categories of children all over the state
· Possibility of closure of every organisation involved in this evil stigmatisation of children
· Government will not spare any culprit involved
Andrew Copson , Director of Education and Public Affairs at the BHA , said today , " Humanists internationally , and many other people who are concerned and appalled by accusations of witchcraft , not least against children , are paying attention to Akwa Ibom State , and will continue to pay attention .
The state government must live up to its promises . "

When Link Christin boarded a Continental Airlines flight from Houston to the Twin Cities on Friday night , he expected to be on the ground in about three hours and ready for a comfy bed .
Instead , he was among 47 passengers who spent the night trapped inside a small airplane , parked at the Rochester airport , complete with crying babies and the aroma of over - used toilets .
The ExpressJet Airlines that operated the plane says the flight was diverted to Rochester because of Twin Cities thunderstorms , and that airline regulations prevented passengers from getting off the plane .
Christin is incredulous that the airline could n't figure out an option besides trapping passengers on the plane for nine hours .
" It 's not like you 're on a [ Boeing ] 747 and you can walk around , '' said Christin , a professor at William Mitchell College of Law .
" This was a sardine can , with a single row of seats on one side of the plane and two rows of seats on the other .
And they 've got about 50 people inside , including babies , for the whole night .
It was a nightmare . ''
Continental Airlines , which issued the tickets for Flight 2816 , referred inquiries to ExpressJet Airlines .
ExpressJet spokesperson Kristy Nicholas said the flight ran into several problems .
The airline crew on the plane reached their maximum work hours in the air , so another crew had to be flown in .
The alternative of chartering a bus did n't work out .
And letting the passengers into the Rochester airport was not possible because they would have to go through security screening again , and the screeners had gone home for the day .
What about just letting the passengers sleep in the airport terminal ?
" That was not provided as an option by ground services personnel at the airport , '' said Nicholas .
PS4の話（例1 , 例2）もすでにいろいろ出ている中で、新しいPS3が発表されました。
高性能なゲーム機あるいはBDプレーヤーを求めている方には朗報なのでしょうが、私にとっては少し残念なニュースです。
新し いPS3では、「他のシステムのインストール」ができないそうです（参考）。「PS3でGNU/Linux、何するの？」の答えの一つ試すことはできなくなるのです（公式には）。高速、高画質H.264ソフトウェアエンコーダ for PS3 のようなものを作るのも難しくなるでしょう。
PS3 に最適化した単精度計算プログラムの性能は 、Core i7のような最新 のCPUを超えています。PS3の発売時期を考えると驚異的なことです。簡単な例を紹介しましょう。単純な行列のかけ算です（C++で使っているものから抜き出したので、C言語なのにmatrix_mul_blas.ccです）。
参考 ：Lapackの使い方
Core 2 Quad Q6600 ( 2.4GHz ) を使って、 「 g++ - O3 matrix_mul_blas.cc - lblas 」とコンパイルして実行すると、8.2 GFlopsくらいになりました（行列サイズは2048、倍精度だと4.2 GFlopsくらい） 。Core 2 Quadの性能はもっと高いのですが、ふつうにインストールされるBLASでの行列のかけ算はコアを1つしか使わないのでこんなものでしょう。
Core i7 940 ( 2.93GHz ) とIntel Math Kernel Libraryを使って、 「 icc - O3 matrix_mul_blas.cc -lmkl_em64t - lmkl - lguide - lpthread 」とコンパイルして実行すると、90 GFlopsくらいになりました（行列サイズは2048、倍精度だと44 GFlopeくらい）。
PS3 を使って、 「 ppu-g+ +
- O3 -I/opt/cell/sdk/usr/include matrix_mul_blas.cc - lblas 」とコンパイルして、 「 export BLAS_NUMSPES=6 」のようにSPE数を設定してから実行すると、125 GFlopsくらいになりました（行列サイズは1920、倍精度だと7.5 GFlopsくらい） 。Core i7より速いです。
このような計算資源が、ユーザの手の届かないところに行ってしまいます。
速いPCを買えばいいと思う人もいるかもしれません。確かに、ここで紹介した計算資源の問題はそれで解決してもいいでしょう。しかし、CELLというちょっと変わったアーキテクチャのためのプログラムを書く喜びは、簡単に替えられるものではありません。
紐付きアプライアンスなんか要らないという向きは、在庫があるうちに旧型を入手しておいた方がいいかもしれません。
追記：SCEの吉増一氏によれば、旧型から「他のシステムのインストール」機能が排除されることはないそうです。
追記 ：PS3 の「 LinuxなどのOSをインストールする機能」を削除したソニーが賠償金を支払うことに
Is n't this special ?
The Senate Finance Committee will drop a controversial provision on consultations for end - of - life care from its proposed healthcare bill , its top Republican member said Thursday .
The committee , which has worked on putting together a bipartisan healthcare reform bill , will drop the controversial provision after it was derided by conservatives as " death panels " to encourage euthanasia .
" On the Finance Committee , we are working very hard to avoid unintended consequences by methodically working through the complexities of all of these issues and policy options , " Sen .
Chuck Grassley ( R - Iowa ) said in a statement .
" We dropped end - of - life provisions from consideration entirely because of the way they could be misinterpreted and implemented incorrectly . "
Would you let your young child near this guy ?
Certain Republicans in Oklahoma City are wondering if investing in Sullivan is a lost cause and if it is n’t time to invest in a candidate who would win .
People like to back a winner .
On the Republican side , former State Sen. Scott Pruitt is being urged to jump into the GOP primary against Sullivan in 2010 .
Pruitt ran against Sullivan in his first campaign and lost in the primary .
Pruitt has interest in an Oklahoma City baseball team but maintains his home in Broken Arrow .
He ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor in 2006 .
He is a conservative Evangelical who has always had an eye for higher office .
Other conservative Republicans in Tulsa are hoping that former Gov. Frank Keating would run for the First District .
Keating is moving back to Oklahoma after working in Washington , D.C. , for a few years .
He was a successful two - term governor and was on the short list for vice president with George W. Bush .
Family sources say Keating is not going to run .
His wife , former First Lady Cathy Keating , lost to Sullivan in the Republican primary in 2001 in a major upset .
A host of Republicans are hoping to persuade former State Sen. Jim Williamson to run for the First District .
They would have liked to draft Williamson for mayor but Williamson declined .
He might like the idea of a higher office .
Williamson has not said he will make that race but he has n’t ruled it out .
Lifelong binge drinker and wingnut John Sullivan is back from his taxpayer - funded stay at the Betty Ford Clinic .
He claims he 's no longer tempted by alcohol .
But he 's doubling down on the crazy wingnuttery .
According to the very conservative , Sullivan , addressing a mob of Republican activists at a health care forum at the Summit Club , questioned the authenticity of Barack Obama 's birth certificate .
Without having his alcoholism as an excuse for his psychotic pronouncements , does Sullivan really have a reasonable shot at being re-elected next year ?
Despite Oklahoma suddenly leaning Democratic in party identification , lets ' not kid ourselves .
Oklahoma gave McCain a bigger percentage of it's vote ( 66 % ) than any other state in the Union , even more than the three crazy Mormon states !
And Obama did even worse in Sullivan 's Tulsa - based district ( OK - 01 ) than Kerry had in 2000 .
At the same time , Sullivan also netted 66 % of the votes in the district .
Out of a possible score of 100 on the ProgressivePunch scale of progressiveness , Sullivan rated a 0.86 !
( He must have had a couple drinks too many one day and accidentally cast a vote that favored working families for a change . )
He is n't even the most far right member of the sociopathic Oklahoma congressional delegation .
Mary Fallin , who represents Oklahoma City , the only part of the state where Obama actually did reasonably well , has a rating of 0.37 !
( She 's been burnishing her image for a run for the governorship . )
Tom Cole and Frank Lucas are relative socialists though with scores of 1.53 and 1.57 on the scale , beating out in the race to the bottom of the fringe barrel such celebrated extremists and national cranks as Lynn Westmoreland ( R - GA ) , Jeb Hensarling ( R - TX ) , Dan Burton ( R - IN , but owned by the government of Turkey ) and Dan Lungren ( R - CA ) .
Back to supposedly the rehabilitated Rep. Sullivan .
Thereports that Sullivan can expect stiff competition , both from a Blue Dog type Democrat , conservative Tulsa Mayor Kathy Taylor , and from a gaggle of far right Republicans .
Thatstory linked above sums up Sullivan and his confusion nicely : " Sullivan began by saying he questioned the authenticity of President Obama 's birth certificate and alluding to what he said is an ' enemies list ' the administration is compiling from e-mails critical of the Democrats ' health care reform initiative , but concluded with a call for less bickering . "
Maybe he only did eleven steps .

OMG , I ca n’t believe all the hoopla about health care reform in the US .
After nearly three weeks here , and talking with family and friends , I have come to the conclusion that no one really understands the issues ( who would , the documents run in the thousands of pages ) .
Opposition comes down to partisan politics and the fear of socialised medicine .
When I first moved to the UK nearly 20 years ago I was leary of the National Health Service ( NHS ) from years of right wing warning :
It ’s government - run .
It ’s inefficient .
It ’s socialism , ferchristsake .
You wo n’t have access to good care .
You know what I ’ve discovered after years of living abroad and extensive use of the NHS : The UK “ socialised ” system is not that bad .
Really .
In fact , I ’m a huge fan .
Last year I found a lump in my breast .
Sick with worry , I called my local doctor and got an appointment the same day .
I was seen by a specialist within FIVE DAYS and was sent to have a scan and a mammogram .
It all took about two hours .
Luckily it turned out to be nothing .
This was with the NHS socialised system .
And then there was the time my GP that made a HOME VISIT to check on me after the birth of my first two children ?
And did I mention the same GP made another home visit to check on my 80 - year - old mother - in - law with blood poisining ?
I ’m what you would call a health care “ power ” user , and have extensive experience of socialised and private health care on both sides of the pond .
Pregnancy with severe pre-enclampsia , NICU babies , bowel surgery , you name it .
With three children I ’ve had to deal with stuffy noses , immunisations , sore throats , tubes and hearing problems and small fingers that have been banged in the door .
As usual it comes down to money : those with it can get whatever they want in either system .
For example , if you want to jump the queue to see a specialist in the UK , you can buy insurance ( which I do n’t have , BTW ) .
But with the NHS , EVERYONE has access :
Poor people , old people , students , people who have lost their jobs .
Not just the gainfully employed and those that can afford it .
Yes , it has a price tag ( but you ’ll pay for it one way or another ) .
And yes , things can go horribly wrong in BOTH systems .
But it ’s nice to know that health care is there when you need it .
It ’s also nice not to get a long , confusing bill .
So please , you nay - sayers , stop it about socialised medicine .
You have no friggin idea what you are talking about .
If you do n’t believe me , I can put you in touch with loads of British mothers that feel they get good care too .
Really .
If you are a happy NHS customer , please leave a comment below and let everyone know what a good system it really is .

A Queensland couple and an Adelaide man are hoping to remain anonymous after each picked up $ 53 million in last night 's biggest division one Oz Lotto prize .
It was beginner 's luck for the Gold Coast couple who had never bought an Oz Lotto ticket before and went to work today despite their new - found wealth .
Mal Neilson , the owner of the Mermaid Beach newsagency where the winning ticket was bought , says he feels like he won first division as well .
" I 'm just lucky to be here I think .
It 's all positive and it's all good fun .
It has its critics [ who say ] ' but it 's gambling and it's punting ' and I tell people ' if they can't afford it do n't do it ' , " he said .
The disbelieving South Australian punter had been a regular player for 20 years .
The man in his 40s from Adelaide 's western suburbs says he felt numb as he watched his numbers drop on the televised draw .
Rebecca Payne from South Australian Lotteries broke the news to him .
" He said , ' I ca n't quite believe this ' and he was in quite a state of shock as it was , " Ms Payne said .
" That 's when he said to me , ' so how much have I won - $ 2 million , $ 3 million ? '
" And I said to him , ' are you sitting down ? '
And that 's when I said , ' you 've actually won slightly more than that - you 've won $ 53 million ' .
" And he just went , ' Oh you just blew my mind ' . "
A massive 10 million entries went into the draw for the chance to win the record $ 106 million .
Golden Casket Lottery says both winners want to help out family and donate money to some charities .
The winning numbers were 12 , 3 , 38 , 21 , 23 , 29 and 40 , with 43 and 22 as the supplementary numbers .

As she prepares to leave Addis Ababa , the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt reflects on the intense level of officialdom she has encountered in Ethiopia which she believes reveals much about the nature of power and responsibility in Ethiopian society .
A rubber stamp conveys absolute authority , and without it no document is genuine
I had not been in Addis Ababa very long when one of my predecessors came to visit .
His first question took me by surprise .
It was not , " How was I getting on , " or " What was going on in Ethiopia , " but : " Did I still have the BBC rubber stamp ? "
Actually I did .
Small , round , wooden handled , not particularly impressive .
" Good " , he said .
" Do n't lose it .
You wo n't believe how long it took me to get it . "
At that point I had no idea what he was talking about .
My notion of rubber stamps came from countries like Nigeria , where every street corner boasted a small plywood booth where the local rubber - stamp maker plied his trade .
Getting a rubber stamp was just a matter of paying your money and coming back in the afternoon to collect it .
A good rubber stamping gave a letter a nice air of authority , but it was not something to be taken too seriously .
But not in Ethiopia .
There a rubber stamp conveys absolute authority and without it no document is genuine .
This was brought home to me when I lost both my passport and residence permit .
The immigration department offered me a temporary permit , to tide me over for a few days until my new passport arrived .
Bureaucracy meant it was difficult to retrieve an impounded satphone I showed them the duplicated slip I had just been given by the British embassy , informing me that replacement passports were now printed in Kenya and the process took at least six weeks .
The official peered at it very doubtfully .
" How do I know this is really from the British Embassy ? " and finally , the killer argument : " It does n't have a rubber stamp . "
Of course something this important cannot just be bought on any street corner .
My predecessor had gone through an elaborate process of getting official authorisation - a " Fikad " - complete with rubber stamp from the authorising ministry , before a BBC stamp could be issued .
Ethiopia 's obsession with these authorisations can be written off as insane bureaucracy , or as a make - work scheme to provide jobs for civil servants .
It is both of those , but above all it is a way of shifting responsibility .
Take my problem with the satellite phone or satphone which served as an antenna for the BBC studio .
I had taken it to London for repair and on the way back I was stopped at customs .
It is the Catch - 22 answer everyone in Ethiopia dreads : ' I can not give you permission because you do not need permission '
The customs officer clearly had no idea what it was but he certainly was not prepared to get into trouble for letting me bring it into the country .
" Did I have authorisation for it ? "
" Er , no whose authorisation did I need ? "
With the air of a man making it up as he went along he thought for a moment , then proclaimed " the Telecommunications Agency , " and impounded the satellite phone .
Waiting game
The next day I presented myself at the agency .
" Was I going to connect it to the Ethiopian telephone system ? " " No . " " Was it going to interfere with wireless transmissions ? "
" No . "
The official there looked relieved .
Then I did not need his permission .
That clearly was not going to do at all .
Without a piece of paper and a rubber stamp I was never going to get the satphone back .
It is the Catch - 22 answer everyone in Ethiopia dreads : " I can not give you permission because you do not need permission . "
Please , please would he give something , anything , with a rubber stamp on it to show to customs .
He weakened .
Well all right , but only if I got an authorisation from the Ministry of Information .
So off to the information ministry , where the official in charge of the foreign press was friendly , but far too wily a bureaucrat to get caught giving me permission to have some dubious piece of satellite technology .
He offered an attestation that I was a fully accredited and responsible journalist .
With a stamp .
" Not good enough , " said the Telecoms Agency .
" Try again . "
This went on for some time until finally everyone 's back was covered .
I was allowed to pay an eye - watering sum of money in customs duty and retrieve my equipment .
Rubber - stamped dictatorship
Of course the dark side of this is that if nothing can be done without an authorisation , then with an authorisation , anything becomes permissible , and all responsibility is lifted from your shoulders .
In the days of the Derg , the brutal military dictatorship that ruled Ethiopia from the mid-1970s until 1991 , every arrest , every interrogation , every killing was documented , authorised , and filed .
And every piece of paper was kept , and is still there , in a vast , chilling archive .
And every single sheet , I am prepared to bet , carries the correct rubber stamp .
Meanwhile I have carefully filed all the paperwork relating to the satphone , and if I go back to Addis Ababa in years to come I will check that my successor still has it .
It may seem a strange question , but you will not believe how long it took me to get it .

Next Best Thing to AWSD , Controller Adds a Mouse to Your Aim
A researcher at Tel Aviv University claims that structure of human teeth holds promising clues for aerospace engineers as they build the aircraft and space vehicles of the future .
After spending years peering into mouths , Professor Herzl Chai has concluded that planes made from tooth - like materials could be much more resistant to potentially lethal stress fractures .
He started by wondering how our teeth can withstand enormous amounts of pressure , over many years , when tooth enamel is only about as strong as glass .
This is where your teeth end up
His team of researchers applied varying degrees of mechanical pressure to hundreds of extracted teeth , and studied what occurred on the surface and deep inside them .
Chai found that teeth are made from an extremely sophisticated composite material that reacts in an extraordinary way under pressure .
The professor says , " Teeth exhibit graded mechanical properties and a cathedral - like geometry , and over time they develop a network of micro-cracks which help diffuse stress .
This , and the tooth 's built - in ability to heal the micro-cracks over time , prevents it from fracturing into large pieces when we eat hard food , like nuts . "
The aviation industry already uses sophisticated materials to prevent break - up on impact .
For example , airplane bodies are made from composite materials , layers of glass or carbon fibres , held together by a brittle matrix .
In teeth , though , fibres are n't arranged in a grid , but are wavy in structure and arranged in several layers , unlike the single - thickness layers used in aircrafts .
Under mechanical pressure , this architecture presents no clear path for the release of stress .
Micro cracks absorb pressure in unison to prevent splits and major fractures .
Chai , himself an aerospace engineer , suggests that if engineers can incorporate tooth enamel 's wavy hierarchy , micro-cracking mechanism and capacity to heal , lighter and stronger aircraft and space vehicles can be developed .
Programming is tough .
Sometimes I need background music to keep things lively .
But choosing songs is tricky .
Anything with lyrics is distracting .
Melodies that are new to me are jarring .
Songs I 've heard a thousand times only emphasize the dullness of a thick page of code .
Sometimes silence is really the only solution , and I 'm sure many programmers out there swear by it .
But for me , if carefully selected , a little music goes a long way .
Here are five of my favorites , matched to the coding dish with which they go best .
1. Architectural and algorithmic design
Philip Glass - Koyaanisqatsi Soundtrack
This is the soundtrack for a strange movie about the beauty of the modern cityscape and all the marvels of 20th century industry , like the New York City subway , nuclear power plants , space rockets , and explosions .
Koyaanisqatsi means life out of balance , and the movie shows how , with industrious spirit and scientific discipline , humans are coming ever closer to bringing life back into balance , finally taming the barbarism of overgrown nature .
Computers are the end game in our long struggle .
And it's we , the programmers , who shall lead the people from desert and jungle , to salvation in the new reality , civilized and virtual .
The Koyaanisqatsi soundtrack is hymn to the technological revolution .
It 's both ode to our forebears in industry and hint of the transcendent abstraction to come .
It stirs us at the event horizon of our humanity , that pivot point between this reality and the next .
Save this music only for the grandest of programming problems .
2. Utility functions
Edvard Grieg -
In the Hall of the Mountain King
Put it on loop .
Type with the beat .
Do da da da di da da di da da di da normalize a vector do da da da di da di da di da di da do a checksum on a file !
3. Parsing XML and the like
Clint Mansell - Lux Aeterna
XML is the programming equivalent of Jabba the Hutt .
It 's a bloated , sluggish thing whose company is deadly dull .
I need a song that comes in like a Jedi Knight with a vendetta , and somehow makes parsing seem epic .
4. Memory management and threading
Silence
This is where the nastiest bugs are born .
Sad to think how many security vulnerabilities have been caused by programmers rocking out to Rage Against the Machine .
Best to keep things quiet .
... Then again , this is a post about music .
So , if you can take it , I suggest :
Rob Dougan - Clubbed to Death
This one is weighty enough to convey the importance of thread / memory safety , melodic enough that you should be able to arrange most code calmly and correctly , and intense enough that the errors you do introduce will be epic and wild ones , which are worth having simply because they are too cool .
Like this one .
5. Creative code
Ratatat - Seventeen Years
This is for when I really do n't feel like working but I want to feel like I am working .
I 'm frustrated with all my scheduled problems , so I decide to be " creative . "
What I 've been working on is n't going anywhere anyway .
After all , I 've already come up with a brilliant idea for this project : " create a great video game , with next - gen procedural effects and shaders , that will work on every computer ever , and will be fun because we will playtest it . "
All that remains is to implement it .
I should n't be implementing things .
Implementation is for mindless grunts , programmers .
But I am software engineer , nay , architect , nay , artist .
I pull out a sketchbook , grab a shot of cappuccino , and scribble my UI - nouveau : each window is a planet , the desktop unfurls as celestial tapestry .
On Google Docs now , new document : " Quantum Tunneling for UI Design . "
Biting burnt tongue reveals intriguing new pain .
Paint my flow charts in pastel blue .
Have to focus , back to code .
But maybe , with quantum superposition ...
In the end it 's all a bunch of foos and bars .
Atlantean relics rendered incomprehensible by the sober mind .
When this humour hits me , I need music that 's more indie than Thomas Jefferson racing a solar car in the Indy 500 , artsier than Art Bell peeling arteries off a melting clock , and , yo dawg , trendier than trends that have trends .
Okay , Ratatat 's not quite this , but I like them , so there you go .
Do you guys listen to music while programming ?
Or perhaps while doing other work ?
Please share your picks !
If you miss pasta , because you do n’t eat wheat or you ’re on a low - carbohydrate diet , this dish makes a nice stand - in for fettuccine .
Be careful not to overcook  it will be al dente with a few minutes of cooking , after which it will quickly fall apart .
When made just right , it ’s silky and wonderful .
You can serve as is , or toss it with a fresh tomato sauce .
Use a vegetable peeler or mandolin to make the thin zucchini strips .
2 pounds zucchini ( or a combination of yellow and green zucchini )
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper
3/4 cup fresh tomato sauce ( optional )
1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan , for serving ( more to taste )
1 . Using a vegetable peeler , cut the zucchini into lengthwise ribbons .
Peel off several from one side , then turn the zucchini and peel off more .
Continue to turn and peel away ribbons until you get to the seeds at the core of the zucchini .
Discard the core .
You can also do this on a mandolin , adjusted to a very thin slice .
Batman BEGINS moviemaker Christopher Nolan has abandoned plans to direct a new big screen adaptation of cult British TV series THE PRISONER .
Nolan had signed up to turn the 1968 show - which starred Patrick MCGoohan - into a big budget blockbuster , but he has now quit the production amid rumours he is planning to start work on his third Batman movie early .
Nolan 's departure has thrown
The Prisoner into jeopardy - producer Barry Mendel admits they might not get the green light for the project until movie executives have gauged the success of the new TV version , which stars Ian MCKellen and Jim Caviezel and is set to air later this year ( 09 ) .
Mendel tells CineFools , " ’ Nolan has dropped out of it but we have a first draft ( of the script ) by David and Janet Peoples who wrote Twelve Monkeys .
It 's a good draft and we 're working on the script right now . ’
“ If the series was wildly popular that might effect us .
The screenplay ( we 've got ) is such a re-imagination of the series , if you think of The Avengers that was n't a commercially successful film but it was very much in the spirit of the original show , this looks and feels so different that the tenants of the show are apparent but the execution of it is so different that I think it is unrecognisable . "
Is the Government Going to Euthanize your Grandmother ?
An Interview With Sen. Johnny Isakson .
Sarah Palin's belief that the House health - care reform bill would create " death panels " might be particularly extreme , but she 's hardly the only person to wildly misunderstand the section of the bill ordering Medicare to cover voluntary end - of - life counseling sessions between doctors and their patients .
One of the foremost advocates of expanding Medicare end - of - life planning coverage is Johnny Isakson , a Republican Senator from Georgia .
He co-sponsored 2007 's Medicare End - of - Life Planning Act and proposed an amendment similar to the House bill 's Section 1233 during the Senate HELP Committee 's mark - up of its health care bill .
I reached Sen . Isakson at his office this afternoon .
He was befuddled that this had become a question of euthanasia , termed Palin 's interpretation " nuts , " and emphasized that all 50 states currently have some legislation allowing end - of - life directives .
A transcript of our conversation follows .
Is this bill going to euthanize my grandmother ?
What are we talking about here ?
In the health - care debate mark - up , one of the things I talked about was that the most money spent on anyone is spent usually in the last 60 days of life and that 's because an individual is not in a capacity to make decisions for themselves .
So rather than getting into a situation where the government makes those decisions , if everyone had an end - of - life directive or what we call in Georgia " durable power of attorney , " you could instruct at a time of sound mind and body what you want to happen in an event where you were in difficult circumstances where you 're unable to make those decisions .
This has been an issue for 35 years .
All 50 states now have either durable powers of attorney or end - of - life directives and it's to protect children or a spouse from being put into a situation where they have to make a terrible decision as well as physicians from being put into a position where they have to practice defensive medicine because of the trial lawyers .
It 's just better for an individual to be able to clearly delineate what they want done in various sets of circumstances at the end of their life .
How did this become a question of euthanasia ?
I have no idea .
I understand -- and you have to check this out -- I just had a phone call where someone said Sarah Palin 's web site had talked about the House bill having death panels on it where people would be euthanized .
How someone could take an end of life directive or a living will as that is nuts .
You 're putting the authority in the individual rather than the government .
I do n't know how that got so mixed up .
You 're saying that this is not a question of government .
It 's for individuals .
It empowers you to be able to make decisions at a difficult time rather than having the government making them for you .
The policy here as I understand it is that Medicare would cover a counseling session with your doctor on end - of - life options .
Correct .
And it 's a voluntary deal .
It seems to me we 're having trouble conducting an adult conversation about death .
We pay a lot of money not to face these questions .
We prefer to experience the health - care system as something that just saves you , and if it does n't , something has gone wrong .
Over the last three - and - a - half decades , this legislation has been passed state - by - state , in part because of the tort issue and in part because of many other things .
It 's important for an individual to make those determinations while they 're of sound mind and body rather than no one making those decisions at all .
But this discussion has been going on for three decades .
And the only change we'd see is that individuals would have a counseling session with their doctor ?
Uh-huh .
When they become eligible for Medicare .
Are there other costs ?
Parts of it I 'm missing ?
No .
The problem you got is that there 's so much swirling around about health care and people are taking bits and pieces out of this .
This was thoroughly debated in the Senate committee .
It 's voluntary .
Every state in America has an end of life directive or durable power of attorney provision .
For the peace of mind of your children and your spouse as well as the comfort of knowing the government wo n't make these decisions , it 's a very popular thing .
Just not everybody 's aware of it .
What got you interested in this subject ?
I 've seen the pain and suffering in families with a loved one with a traumatic brain injury or a crippling degenerative disease become incapacitated and be kept alive under very difficult circumstances when if they'd have had the chance to make the decision themself they'd have given another directive and I 've seen the damage financially that 's been done to families and if there 's a way to prevent that by you giving advance directives it's both for the sanity of the family and what savings the family has it's the right decision , certainly more than turning it to the government or a trial lawyer .

EGAN'S CRUCIAL ROLE IN IRISH PEACE PROCESS MAKES HIS LOSS DEVASATATING
Richard Egan , former U.S. Ambassador to Ireland and billionaire businessman killed himself with a shotgun blast at his Boston residence on Friday police have confirmed .
He locked himself in a linen closet in his Boston home and shot himself at 12.32 p.m. on Friday .
Egan was suffering from stage 4 terminal lung cancer .
A nurse who was present called police .
He was 73 and the founder of EMC Corporation a multi million dollar corporation .
He was routinely listed as among the richest men in the world by Forbes magazine .
They estimated his net worth in 2005 as $ 1.3 billion
He was President George Bush 's first ambassador to Ireland appointed in March 2001 and served during 9/11 , He spent 15 months in Dublin but was ill suited for the job .
A shy , reserved man he was not comfortable with the public aspects .
He quit the post in June 2002 after a little over a year .
Privately , he was said to be frustrated by the slow moving nature of the job while his wife was said to be unhappy in the damp Irish climate .
Egan leaves behind his wife , Maureen , and five children .
The family released a statement last night asking for privacy .
“ Ambassador Richard Egan died today at this home in Boston after a long illness , ” the statement said .
“ Ambassador Egan was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer in May . . .
“ This is a great loss to our family and we are terribly saddened . ”
In addition to lung cancer , Egan was also being treated for emphysema , diabetes and high blood pressure , the statement said .
No funeral plans were announced .
Egan was a a resident of the exclusive Four Seasons condominiums on Boylston Street in Boston .
He was a major contributor to the George W. Bush campaign and was rewarded with the position in Ireland .
While there he will be most remembered for attending a Sinn Fein annual convention right after 9/11 .
Because the visit took place directly in the aftermath of 9/11 Sinn Fein was under pressure on the terrorism front .
Egan 's presence signaled that the Bush administration was still determined to deal with Sinn Fein despite 9/11 .
Egan graduated Northeastern University in 1961 with a degree in Engineering and was on the team that helped develop the Apollo moon mission memory systems .
He founded EMC , a disk memory storage system in 1979 .
The company experienced massive growth during the tech boom of the subsequent two decades .
Following his return to the U.S. he remained closely associated with Republican fundraising and was close to Vice President Cheney
On March 26 , 2006 The Irish Times reportedthe indictments of three people by the U.S. Attorney 's Office in New York , including two KPMG senior partners accused of setting up tax shelters using Irish companies .
The IRS claimed that Egan invested $ 62 million in the scheme , though would not disclose whether Irish firms were involved .
Egan , an engineer by training , served in the Marine Corps Reserve during the Korean War , when he was 17 .
“ Dick Egan served his country with great honor and distinction , ” said former Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci .
“ More importantly , he was one of the finest and most entrepreneurial business leaders our state has seen for some time , creating tens of thousands of jobs and helping lead the commonwealth ’s economic recovery in the mid-1990s .
Dick was a good friend to me and I will always appreciate his support and miss him . ”
“ The world lost a great man and a great leader today , ” EMC CEO Joe Tucci said in a statement yesterday .
“ On behalf of more than 40,000 EMC employees from around the world , we extend our deepest condolences to Mrs. Egan and the entire family .
“ Dick ’s vision became one of the world ’s top technology companies , and his legacy will live on through the tens of thousands of lives he affected in so many positive ways , ” Tucci said .
“ We have all lost a great mentor and friend . ”
Gabe Newell met with a group of deaf gamers to get a better idea of what Valve could do to make their games more accessible for them .
Newell also mentioned possibly incorporating sign language into Half Life 2 : Episode 3 .
A lot of good points were brought up in the meeting , like how stronger facial expressions for characters could help convey their emotions to people who cannot hear the tone of their voice , or how there is a difference between how a deaf person uses sign language and how a hearing person does .
Gabe Newell told the group that he had the idea that Alyx could have previously had a crush on a deaf person and taught Dog how to sign so she could practice .
He said Alyx and Dog might use sign language to communicate when they want to stay quiet or do n’t want others to understand them .

Video footage of the moment Ian Tomlinson was struck by a riot officer at the G20 protests guardian .
co.uk
The police officer suspended following the death of Ian Tomlinson during G20 protests has been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter , after a second postmortem showed that the newspaper vendor did not die of a heart attack .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission said : " Following the initial results of the second postmortem , a Metropolitan police officer has been interviewed under caution for the offence of manslaughter as part of an ongoing inquiry into the death of Ian Tomlinson . "
The new postmortem showed that Tomlinson died from an abdominal haemorrhage .
The cause of Tomlinson 's injury has not been established , but investigators will now have to decide whether alleged police assaults on the 47 - year - old contributed to his death .
The dramatic shift in the Independent Police Complaints Commission 's criminal inquiry into the alleged assaults came after the results of the second post mortem were revealed .
Police previously said Tomlinson had died of a heart attack .
Tomlinson collapsed and died around 7:25 pm on 1 April , shortly after being attacked by at least one riot officer .
He had been attempting to walk home from work when he was confronted by lines of riot police .
An officer was suspended and a criminal inquiry launched after the Guardian revealed footage showing the attack on Tomlinson from behind .
Today the City of London coroners court released the following statement :
" On 9 April 2009 HM Coroner for the City of London opened and adjourned the inquest into the death of Ian Tomlinson .
In so doing he received evidence of identification and the provisional findings and opinion as to the medical cause of death , from a report prepared by consultant forensic pathologist Dr F Patel , instructed by HM Coroner to conduct the post - mortem examination .
The pathologist 's final opinion must await the completion of additional tests .
" Dr F Patel made a number of findings of fact including descriptions of a number of injuries and of diseased organs including the heart and liver .
He found a substantial amount of blood in the abdominal cavity .
His provisional interpretation of his findings was that the cause of death was coronary artery disease .
" A subsequent post - mortem examination was conducted by another consultant forensic pathologist , Dr N Cary , instructed by the IPCC and by solicitors acting for the family of the late Mr Tomlinson .
" Dr Cary 's opinion is that the cause of death was abdominal haemorrhage .
The cause of the haemorrhage remains to be ascertained .
Dr Cary accepts that there is evidence of coronary atherosclerosis but states that in his opinion its nature and extent is unlikely to have contributed to the cause of death .
" The opinions of both consultant pathologists are provisional and both agree that their final opinions must await the outcome of further investigations and tests .
These are likely to take some time .
" The IPCC 's investigation into the death of Ian Tomlinson is ongoing . "
Microsoft is not willing to cede the laundry room to Google .
I wrote last week about how Google ’s Android may be the leading candidate to be the operating system that will drive Internet - connected devices of all sorts , including , according to Sehat Sutardja , the chief executive of the Marvell Technology Group , washing machines .
On Tuesday Microsoft introduced the latest version of its operating system for gadgets called Windows Embedded CE .
Microsoft says that there are already one billion devices made each year that are neither computers nor cellphones that have embedded processors .
These include industrial robots , medical test equipment and digital signs , many of which already use versions of Windows CE .
Now Microsoft is hoping to extend the operating system to the rapidly growing set of consumer gadgets including media players , navigation systems , digital picture frames and digital televisions .
All these devices , which previously were stand - alone , are increasingly networked and connected to the Internet , said Kevin Dallas , general manager of Microsoft ’s Windows Embedded business .
“ We see a unique opportunity for Windows . ”
Unlike Android and other dialects of Linux , Windows Embedded comes with a license fee charged by Microsoft for every device shipped with the operating system , typically $ 3 to $ 15 , depending on the volume .
Microsoft argues that this fee is well worth it because it costs manufacturers , known as O.E.M.’s , less to design software for Windows Embedded than for other operating systems .
“ If you look across the complete life cycle , it is a lot cheaper for O.E.M. ’s to use the Windows platform , ” he said .
The improvements to Windows Embedded announced Tuesday are meant to make it easier for device makers to design more attractive user interfaces .
In particular , they allow designers to use existing Microsoft tools , such as its Expressions Web design software and Visual Studio programming environment , to make the menus , buttons and other features of a device .
While Android is being promoted for cellphones and netbook computers , Windows Embedded is not .
There is Windows Mobile OS for phones .
And the company wants netbooks to run the Windows 7 PC operating system , albeit with a cheaper limited version .
The full version of Windows is meant only for processors using the X86 architecture .
Windows Embedded can also run on other chips , including the ARM processor design used in many cellphones .
Microsoft also said that it was working on a future version that would make it easier to link devices to Internet - based services , like social networks .
It already has a special version meant for GPS navigation systems , with links to Microsoft ’s Web search service .
In a twist on what has been the typical business pattern , Mr. Dallas said that Microsoft ’s fee - based business model allows it to be more open than Google .
As much as Microsoft would like to promote its own Internet services , Windows Embedded is designed to link to Web services from any company , he said .
“ We will be open in working with third parties , ” Mr. Dallas said .
“ Google is going to O.E.M.’s and offering Android , but it is always tied to their services . ”

Elmer Gates ( 1859 - 1923 )
" Scientific method is mental method . "
About This Site
This site is a repository for the work of the American scientist Elmer R. Gates ( 1859 - 1923 ) .
Quite famous in his day , Gates was a virtuoso inventor .
His better known inventions include the foam fire extinguisher , an improved electric iron , a climate - controlling air conditioner , and the educational toy  Box and Blocks . 
He was productive in the fields of X -ray , alloy casting , electrically operated looms , and magnetic separation devices for mining .
He devised instruments for developing muscular skill ; he created indoor replications of weather systems ; in the late 1800s he invented an electronic music synthesizer .
A 1904 Synopsis of his work listed thirty - five lines of inventive research in which results had been obtained .
At the beginning of the 20th century , the Elmer Gates Laboratory in Chevy Chase , MD , was the largest private , non-commercial laboratory in the United States .
Despite his extraordinary output as an inventor , Gates saw himself as a psychologist .
He pursued invention primarily to study the processes of the mind while it engaged in its best work .
Through years of recorded observations , he discovered psychotaxis , the integrated hierarchy of sensory discriminations required to create a valid and complete mental representation of a given part of the physical world .
Gates used psychotaxis to invent .
First , he would experience through each of his senses every piece of sensory data that the subject at hand could impart , letting his mind classify each datum naturally according to its perceived likeness to or difference from the other data .
Having thus acquired and categorized all the subjects sensations , he would then , in psycho - taxonomic order , recreate each sensation in his mind moving through the series over and over until he could execute it at great speed .
This might take several weeks .
Finally , he would work his way through the psycho-taxonomic hierarchy of sensory associations which associations gave rise to images , concepts , ideas , and thoughts .
Repeated recollection of the psycho-taxonomic hierarchy increased the blood flow to the areas of the brain where its data were enregistered and processed .
This refunctioning  brought into dominance those neurological structures through which subconscious connections were made .
The result was new insights into the subject .
He discovered and used other aids to invention , all experimentally validated quiescence , periodicity , climate control ( he invented an air - regulated isolation chamber ) , anabolic emotional states ( he researched their chemistry and physiological effects ) , and linguistic mentation .
Gates hypothesized that unusual mental activity produced unusual structural or chemical differences in the brain .
To test his hypothesis , he conducted many experiments on guinea pigs , rabbits , and dogs sometimes using electric shock as a negative reinforcer ( reportedly the first person to do so ) .
His experiments required test animals to make extraordinarily refined discriminations with some one sense in order to carry out successful adaptive responses to their environment .
Upon completion of the experimental training ( which often lasted for months ) , the test animals and one or more control groups of like animals were chloroformed .
The groups were compared by a histological examination of the brain areas where the sensory data were enregistered .
( To facilitate the examination , Gates invented a staining technique wherein electric current passed the stain through neurons in two different directions .
He also made major improvements in the microscopes magnification . )
As he suspected , the neuronal structure was always more highly developed in the test group .
His conclusion was that rigorous training of the senses gives more brain structure and , therefore , more mind with which to create .
Believing that scientific method is mental method ,  Gates devoted his life to the study of the Art of Mind - Using psychurgy ,  as he named it .
He had no sympathy for theory and speculation , and would state no more than he could prove true if given the opportunity .
Unfortunately , because of the unusual nature of some of his researches , they attracted a fringe element .
Studies were often misinterpreted in the popular press , and quotes were fabricated .
He was said to have seen the shadow of the departing soul of a dying rat , to have found that the color of sin is pink , to have gotten ideas for his inventions by telepathy from the minds of other inventors .
His efforts to stamp out these false reports were unsuccessful ; some live on in the self - help  and new age sections of todays bookstores .
To set the record straight , this site contains most of the extant works of Elmer Gates : patents , lectures , papers , and books .
It presents reliable firsthand accounts by others and several biographical references including the authoritative 1971 biography , Elmer Gates and the Art of Mind - Using , written by his son Donald Edson Gates .
There are also photos of Elmer Gates , his family , his laboratories , and his inventions .
Other supplementary information is included .

The Pentagon has approached Congress to grant the Secretary of Defense the authority to post almost 400,000 military personnel throughout the United States in times of emergency or a major disaster .
This request has already occasioned a dispute with the nation�s governors .
And it raises the prospect of U.S. military personnel patrolling the streets of the United States , in conflict with the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 .
In June , the U.S. Northern Command distributed a " Congressional Fact Sheet " entitled " Legislative Proposal for Activation of Federal Reserve Forces for Disasters . "
That proposal would amend current law , thereby " authorizing the Secretary of Defense to order any unit or member of the Army Reserve , Air Force Reserve , Navy Reserve , and the Marine Corps Reserve , to active duty for a major disaster or emergency . "
Taken together , these reserve units would amount to " more than 379,000 military personnel in thousands of communities across the United States , " explained
Paul Stockton , Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and America�s Security Affairs , in a letter to the National Governors Association , dated July 20 .
The governors were not happy about this proposal , since they want to maintain control of their own National Guard forces , as well as military personnel acting in a domestic capacity in their states .
" We are concerned that the legislative proposal you discuss in your letter would invite confusion on critical command and control issues , " Governor James H. Douglas of Vermont and Governor Joe Manchin III of West Virginia , the president and vice president of the governors � association , wrote in a letter back to Stockton on August 7 .
The governors asserted that they " must have tactical control over all . . . active duty and reserve military forces engaged in domestic operations within the governor�s state or territory . "
According to Pentagon public affairs officer Lt. Col. Almarah K. Belk , Stockton has not responded formally to the governors but understands their concerns .
" There is a rub there , " she said .
" If the Secretary calls up the reserve personnel to provide support in a state and retains command and control of those forces , the governors are concerned about if I have command and control of the Guard , how do we ensure unity of effort and everyone is communicating and not running over each other . "
Belk said Stockton is addressing this problem .
" That is exactly what Dr. Stockton is working out right now with the governors and DHS and the National Guard , " she said .
" He�s bringing all the stakeholders together . "
Belk said the legislative change is necessary in the aftermath of a " catastrophic natural disaster , not beyond that , " and she referred to Katrina , among other events .
But NorthCom�s Congressional fact sheet refers not just to a " major disaster " but also to " emergencies . "
And it says , " Those terms are defined in section 5122 of title 42 , U.S. Code . "
That section gives the President the sole discretion to designate an event as an " emergency " or a " major disaster . "
Both are " in the determination of the President " alone .
That section also defines " major disaster " by citing plenty of specifics : " hurricane , tornado , storm , high water , wind - driven water , tidal wave , tsunami , earthquake , volcanic eruption , landslide , mudslide , snowstorm , or drought , " as well as " fire , flood , or explosion . "
But the definition of " emergency " is vague : " Emergency means any occasion or instance for which , in the determination of the President , Federal assistance is needed to supplement State and local efforts and capabilities to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety , or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe in any part of the United States . "
Currently , the President can call up the Reserves only in an emergency involving " a use or threatened use of a weapon of mass destruction " or " a terrorist attack or threatened terrorist attack in the United States that results , or could result , in significant loss of life or property , " according to Title 10 , Chapter 1209 , Section 12304 , of the U.S. Code .
In fact , Section 12304 explicitly prohibits the President from calling up the Reserves for any other " natural or manmade disaster , accident , or catastrophe . "
So the new proposed legislation would greatly expand the President�s power to call up the Reserves in a disaster or an emergency and would extend that power to the Secretary of Defense .
( There are other circumstances , such as repelling invasions or rebellions or enforcing federal authority , where the President already has the authority to call up the Reserves . )
The ACLU is alarmed by the proposed legislation .
Mike German , the ACLU�s national security policy counsel , expressed amazement " that the military would propose such a broad set of authorities and potentially undermine a 100 - year - old prohibition against the military in domestic law enforcement with no public debate and seemingly little understanding of the threat to democracy . "
At the moment , says Pentagon spokesperson Belk , the legislation does not have a sponsor in the House or the Senate .
Abstract
Culture has long been assumed to be uniquely human but recent studies , in particular on great apes , have suggested that cultures also occur in non-human primates .
The most apparent cultural behaviours in great apes involve tools in the subsistence context where they are clearly functional to obtain valued food .
On the other hand , tool - use to modify acoustic communication has been reported only once and its function has not been investigated .
Thus , the question whether this is an adaptive behaviour remains open , even though evidence indicates that it is socially transmitted ( i.e. cultural ) .
Here we report on wild orang - utans using tools to modulate the maximum frequency of one of their sounds , the kiss squeak , emitted in distress .
In this variant , orang - utans strip leaves off a twig and hold them to their mouth while producing a kiss squeak .
Using leaves as a tool lowers the frequency of the call compared to a kiss squeak without leaves or with only a hand to the mouth .
If the lowering of the maximum frequency functions in orang - utans as it does in other animals , two predictions follow : ( i ) kiss squeak frequency is related to body size and ( ii ) the use of leaves will occur in situations of most acute danger .
Supporting these predictions , kiss squeaks without tools decreased with body size and kiss squeaks with leaves were only emitted by highly distressed individuals .
Moreover , we found indications that the calls were under volitional control .
This finding is significant for at least two reasons .
First , although few animal species are known to deceptively lower the maximum frequency of their calls to exaggerate their perceived size to the listener ( e.g. vocal tract elongation in male deer ) it has never been reported that animals may use tools to achieve this , or that they are primates .
Second , it shows that the orang - utan culture extends into the communicative domain , thus challenging the traditional assumption that primate calling behaviour is overall purely emotional .
Joel Tenenbaum said he was glad he had not been fined millions A US student ordered to pay $ 675,000 ( £ 404,000 ) for sharing music online has refused help paying the fine .
Over the weekend supporters had begun to donate money to Boston University student Joel Tenenbaum who was found guilty of sharing 30 songs .
In a blog post Mr Tenenbaum said : " I ask no one to help me .
And I ask for no one to cover what I signed up for . "
He said any money raised so far would be used to pay expenses to his legal team , many of whom worked for free .
" I shared music .
I was the one who wanted a say in court .
This lawsuit was against me .
This is my verdict , " wrote Mr Tenenbaum .
Mr Tenenbaum was ordered to pay the money to four record labels .
Supporters had begin to donate money , he said , after news of his fine spread around the social networking site Twitter .
Around $ 2000 had been raised before Mr Tenenbaum wrote his blog .
" We do n't want the RIAA ( Recording Industry Association of America ) to be paid when I can't afford to do it , and this money could be more valuable elsewhere , " the blog post said .
" From the money raised already , I would like to reimburse my legal team for the money they 've spent out of their own pockets . "
In a different post , he said that he would " declare bankruptcy " if his appeal against the fine was not successful .
' Giant library '
The case is only the second of its kind to go to trial in the US .
In the first case , a woman in Minneapolis was ordered to pay $ 1.92 m for sharing 24 songs .
On Friday , the jury ordered Mr Tenebaum to pay $ 22,500 for each infringement .
The maximum that he could have been fined was $ 4.5 m .
Mr Tenenbaum used a computer at his parents ' home and at his college to download and distribute digital files .
It was like this giant library in front of you
Joel Tenenbaum Prosecutors working on behalf of the record labels focused on 30 shared songs from artists such as Nirvana and Green Day .
Under US law , the recording companies are entitled to $ 750 to $ 30,000 per infringement .
However , the jury can raise the amount to $ 150,000 per track if it finds the infringements were wilful .
In the Minnesota case , the jury awarded $ 80,000 per song .
On the stand , Mr Tenenbaum admitted that he had downloaded more than 800 songs since 1999 .
" I used the computer .
I uploaded , I downloaded music , " he told the court under questioning from his own lawyer , Charles Nesson .
He said he had used Napster and then Kazaa to download the files .
" It was like this giant library in front of you , " he said .
' Got off easy '
In opening remarks , Mr Tenenbaum 's lawyer said he " was a kid who did what kids do and loved technology and loved music " .
Recording companies had been slow to adapt to the internet , he added .
But prosecutors argued that file - sharers take a significant toll on the revenues for artists and others involved in music
The recording industry has recently changed its tactics in file - sharing cases , preferring to settle quickly for much smaller amounts .
However , cases such as those against Mr Tenenbaum , which were already filed , are proceeding to trial .
The four recording labels involved in the case are subsidiaries of Universal Music , Warner Music and Sony .
Kevin Cullen of the Boston Globe said Mr Tenenbaum had " got off easy " compared to the Minnesota case .

Concern over access to clean water is no longer just an issue for the developing world , as California faces its worst drought in recorded history .
According to state 's Department of Water Resources , supplies in major reservoirs and many groundwater basins are well below average .
Court - ordered restrictions on water deliveries have reduced supplies from the two largest water systems , and an outdated statewide water system can't keep up with population growth .
With these critical issues looming large , researchers at the UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science are working hard to help alleviate the state 's water deficit with their new mini-mobile - modular ( M3 ) " smart " water desalination and filtration system .
In designing and constructing new desalination plants , creating and testing pilot facilities is one of the most expensive and time - consuming steps .
Traditionally , small yet very expensive stationary pilot plants are constructed to determine the feasibility of using available water as a source for a large - scale desalination plant .
The M3 system helps cut both costs and time .
" Our M3 water desalination system provides an all - in - one mobile testing plant that can be used to test almost any water source , " said Alex Bartman , a graduate student on the M3 team who helped to design the sensor networks and data acquisition computer hardware in the system .
" The advantages of this type of system are that it can cut costs , and because it is mobile , only one M3 system needs to be built to test multiple sources .
Also , it will give an extensive amount of information that can be used to design the larger - scale desalination plant . "
The M3 demonstrated its effectiveness in a recent field study in the San Joaquin Valley in which it desalted agricultural drainage water that was nearly saturated with calcium sulfate salts , accomplishing this with just one reverse osmosis ( RO ) stage .
" In this specific field study by our team , in the first part of the reverse osmosis process , 65 percent of the water that was fed in was recovered as drinking water , or potable water , " said Yoram Cohen , professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and lead investigator on the team .
" We can potentially go up to 95 percent recovery using an accelerated chemical demineralization process that was also developed here at UCLA .
This first field study with the M3 was a major achievement and the first phase of our high - recovery RO process demonstration program . "
Andi Rahardianto , a postdoctoral researcher on the team , said that the approach taken by the group is " a significant leap " from the standard practice in the industry of constructing different pilot plants , often from scratch , in order to evaluate and demonstrate the feasibility of water production from different source waters .

" We believe systems such as the M3 can help accelerate not only water technology development but also its adoption , " he said .
In addition to its use as a pilot - scale testing unit , the M3 , according to Bartman , could also be deployed to various locations and used to produce fresh water in emergency situations .
" The M3's ' smart ' nature means it can autonomously adapt to almost any variation in source water , allowing the M3 system to operate in situations where traditional RO desalination systems would fail almost immediately , " he said .
Though the system is compact enough to be transported anywhere in the back of a van , it can generate 6,000 gallons of drinking water per day from the sea or 8,000 to 9,000 gallons per day from brackish groundwater .
By Cohen 's estimate , that means producing enough drinking water daily for up to 6,000 to 12,000 people .
" The system measures in real - time water pH , temperature , turbidity and salinity , " said Cohen , who is also the director of UCLA 's Water Technology Research ( WaTeR ) Center , which is overseeing this project .
" It can control a variety of process variables , including the precise measure of chemical additives to condition the water .
All the valves are computer - controlled , so the system can adjust itself automatically .
We can also see how much energy we 're using , and in the software , we 've also included various techniques for optimizing the system so that it can run with minimum energy consumption . "
" The last time UCLA went into the field with its own newly built pilot system was in the ' 60s , " Cohen said .
" This new system is one - twentieth the size of what was built then , maybe even smaller , and can produce up to 30 percent more potable water .
So to actually go back to the San Joaquin Valley with new advanced technology and be successful is quite an event . "

Rahardianto said that the highly saline agricultural drainage wastewater in the San Joaquin Valley is one of the most difficult source waters to desalt .
" It has been a persistent issue for communities in the valley , one of California 's most productive agricultural regions , " he said .
" While numerous attempts have been made to develop and test various desalting technologies since the 1960s , a practical , cost - effective solution has not yet been adopted , increasingly affecting the ability to sustain agricultural productivity in the region . "
Cohen 's team is working with water agencies and industries across the United States , as well as with the international community , and collaborates with research institutions such as Ben Gurion University in Israel , Victoria University in Australia and Tarragona University in Spain .
According to Stephen Gray , director of the Institute for Sustainability and Innovation at Victoria University , " the M3 system is a very significant improvement in desalination operations , allowing the membrane systems to effectively and quickly adapt to changes in water quality and to achieve high water recoveries .
Such advances are of great importance to Australia and many other places in the world , where many communities are facing shortages in fresh water supplies and are becoming more reliant on saline water sources . "
" We envision a future where many of these systems are deployed all around the world and their operation monitored from a central location , " Bartman said .
" The M3 could be used to rapidly test water sources so that desalination plants can be constructed to augment the diminishing fresh water supply .
The system could also be used in the event of emergencies to provide a quick source for fresh drinking water where it is needed most . "
" The work comes out of necessity , certainly for California , but there are also many places around the world that share our same challenges , " Cohen said .
" I feel we have an opportunity to make a real impact with our work .
We 're pointing out where advanced technology can make a difference .
We 're trying to find real solutions , and in this area , UCLA is certainly leading the way . "
Creating the M3 was a unique multidisciplinary team project involving faculty and students from the chemical , electrical and civil engineering departments with expertise in control theory and optimization , process design / monitoring , computational fluid dynamics , thermodynamics , and software development .

-- bringing together fans of Psychopathic Records artists , particularly , for four hot days of camping , hanging out , Faygo - drinking , and communion .
Eyewitness Chicagoist was not there , because we are allergic to both Faygo and anyone who is wearing clown make - up .
Erdman says he only spent about four hours at the gathering , taking pics and shooting video with his friend David W. It was a lot like visiting Grateful Dead parking lots in the early 1990s , a lot of people that I did n't relate to having a good time .
Actually , the Juggalos seemed genuinely more friendly than some of the Dead Heads that I remember meeting . "
Though he tried some of the pink " rumonade " ( rum and lemonade ) , which he found to be " just OK - tasting , " Nor did he and David W camp on the premises , choosing a hotel about an hour away from the site .
" I 'd say I felt like an intruder , " he says of the experience .
This year 's Juggalo Gathering schedule featuredand many other acts that were popular when we were studying algebra .
And as Erdman 's pictorial shows ,
This may come as a shock to you but any number of people — even completely mediocre bloggers — wind up with people impersonating them on blogs , Twitter , and the like .
No . I ’m serious .
I mean , that ’s why Twitter did that whole “ verified ” thing .
And the bar by which all imitators are measured ?
Fake Steve Jobs .
Well , leave it to Portland ’s newest open source event — LinuxCon — to take the idea of online impersonation and make it more — well — open .
Would you expect anything less ?
Now , four Linux community leaders will be vying for the title of Fake Linus Torvalds .
It was 18 years ago , this week , that a young Linus decided to unveil his little side project of hacking on MINIX — and the world of software development has never been the same .
Given that historical reference , it seemed like the perfect time to kick off the good - natured ribbing of the now - iconic Linux developer .
So what does the Fake Linus Torvalds competition entail ?
For the next few weeks , four FakeLinusTorvalds ( # flt1 , # flt2 , # flt3 and # lft4 ) will be tweeting from our Identi.ca ( linuxfoundation ) and Twitter feeds ( www.twitter.com/linuxfoundation), posing as the real Linus .
I expect some of them to be dangerously outrageous , while others will just be downright funny .
And , the real Linus has given them his blessing .
No infringements here , folks !
Think you can identify the community members masquerading as Linus ?
Well get to work .
Because the identities will be revealed in Portland at LinuxCon , September 21 - 23 .
Still not convinced ?
Well , maybe a little video will get you going ?
“ You act like you never seen a penguin befo ’ . ”

Interested in following along ?
Keep an eye on the Linux Foundation tweets on Twitter or their dents on Identica .
And if you figure out who ’s who , please be sure to let me know , you open source super sleuth you .
Not interested in revealing identities ?
There ’s still something for you to do : vote .
During the final two weeks prior to LinuxCon , we ’re inviting you to vote for your favorite FLT here at Linux.com .
The winner will be chosen based on community vote and will be presented with the “ coveted ” “ Silver Penguin ” award on stage at the conference .

The Concept “ I ” And How It Fits Into Reality
“ I , ” when used in our speech and thought , often refers to the concepts we use to identify the self : its physical attributes , personality , possessions , tendencies , and social relations .
After a moment of contemplation , it can also be understood that the use of this concept “ I ” also implies that there is a distinction to be made between “ Self ” and “ Other , ” and , “ Subject ” and “ Object . ”
Of course this separation is taken as granted : of course there is the “ Self ” and then there is the “ Other , ” of course there is the “ Perceiver ” and then there is the “ Object ” being perceived .
But how do we know this ?
Well , because that is how reality is perceived .
This is what our senses commonly tell us .
We do n’t usually look at a glass of water and confuse our self for the glass of water – no , instead it is “ I ” who is seeing the glass of water .
There are two distinct things being perceived .
Why do things seem the way that they are ?
Where does this thing - ness come from ?
But , would n’t that be delusional ?
Why should we try to see things differently than the way they already seem ?
But then again things are n’t always as they seem ?
So what is there to tell the difference ?
Well , think of yourself as a juror in a courtroom .
It is your job to be fair and unbiased , to see things as they are , and then form a judgment on what really happened in a particular time and place .
But , of course , you are getting two conflicting stories : one from the supposed “ victim , ” the other from the supposed “ criminal ” – but you cannot fully trust either source your information is coming from .
In what way is this similar to observing and judging everyday reality ?
In what way can reality give conflicting reports on what reality “ really ” is ?
This means : when do our senses deceive us , and also , when is reality merely being shaped by our conceptions .
Conceptualizing Reality
In my article Thoughts On The Nature of Reality , Existence , And Meditation I open with a couple paragraphs dedicated to how our mind shapes reality through our perceptual biases ( based on our biological make - up which allows for sensation ) and our cognitive biases ( based on our thinking tendencies , or mental disposition towards our environment ) .
But in this article I just want to focus solely on the idea of how our conceptual thinking – and the using of meaningful concepts explains and describes “ objective ” reality .
I want to discuss how reality and our conceptions have an interactive and interdependent relationship with one another , and – in a sense – are one in the same .
Our map of reality is limited by the language and concepts we use to describe it .
Those with a better perspective on reality are likely going to have a wider vocabulary , a better grasp of various concepts ( both abstract and concrete ) , and an easy way of integrating these concepts together in relation to each “ Other . ”
The better we become at integrating concepts , the more intelligent we become , the better we can apply this knowledge to improving life , the better we can adapt to our environment .
This is the nature of concepts .
The “ Outer ” And “ Inner ” World
Concepts derived from the natural sciences like those from physics , biology , chemistry , astronomy and geology have become tremendously useful in helping us to understand the external and physical world .
Concepts that have been developed to help explain the inner world of our existence have n’t done so well compared to the natural sciences .
This is due to the difficulty of making objective conclusions about a subjective world .
You have a choice :
A ) You could choose to observe the subjective world directly and draw conclusions based on those experiences , perceptions , and interpretations .
B ) You can observe things from an outside perspective , so this allows you to make objective findings and then make inferences as to what happens in the “ black box . ”
In other words : we observe what goes in and we observe what comes out – while paying little attention to the subjective content inside .
C )
You can integrate both of these methods into your studies of mind .
Western Psychology has a history with both A and B , but due to the influences of the scientific method made a complete paradigm shift in favor towards B .
This paradigm shift has in itself evolved over the past century : beginning with the experimental methods of B.F. Skinner , who was one of the pioneers of the Behaviorist philosophy with his theories on Operant Conditioning ( how the mind creates associations , and other early learning theories ) .
In the 1950s emerged the cognitive revolution , now known as the cognitive sciences – an interdisciplinary study of the mind that includes psychology , neuroscience , linguistics , anthropology , artificial intelligence , and computer science .
This field , which is still congruent with choice B as it follows the scientific method of experimentation , and has made extraordinarily leaps in the study of the mind within the past few decades .
The cognitive sciences are a prime example of the incredible integration of a diverse array of concepts , all for the sake of knowledge .
Science , however , cannot be excused for what it willingly chooses to ignore – the subjective world of experience – Choice A. Introspection could never fit into the scientific method , and therefore it is completely dismissed by Western psychology .
Introspection , of course , is n’t perfect – but neither is the scientific method , especially when it comes to the exploration of things like subjective minds .
Thus science only allows for a limited range of concepts regarding the mind , as it refuses to look inwards and define these “ fabrications ” of mind that we spend so much time theorizing and treating as if they were real , but seemingly refuse to look inside and observe them for our self .
Neuroscience , the science of our neurology and brain , has become a fake - way to get inside the “ mind ” .
Psychologists and neuroscientists have teamed up to help explain minds and behavior as they relate to brain chemistry , neural activity , neural networks etc .
In truth , neuroscience has led to many advancements into the understanding of the biological mechanisms behind how the brain - part of the mind perceives , stores associations , and cognizes , but it reveals little about how the mind perceives subjective reality , the nature of existence , and how we can reshape our thought patterns , limiting beliefs , and unhealthy behaviors and decision - making .
Instead , neuroscience has simply offered information on the neural correlations between the brain and mind but has given limited direct causal inference between brain -> mind .
If anything , the mind and brain have an interactive relationship , as can be seen in certain studies , especially those of trained monks and nuns who can alter the EEG - levels of certain parts of the brain when in meditation .
There is also no reason to discount how our particular subjective beliefs , and personal thought patterns , can create their own mental associations and therefore , in a way , “ rewire ” the brain ’s neural composition .
In the science world , however , the brain is still an “ Other , ” to the wretched , and scary “ Self ” that scientists so conveniently ignore .
But how can any true seeker of knowledge ignore the direct observation of the phenomena it so wishes to explore ?
Methodological introspection , like meditation and hypnosis , helps to fill in the gaps that third - person psychology neglects .
Introspecting on “ I . ”
Introspecting on the self can be a daunting task .
The process can sometimes reveal implicit ( or perhaps previously “ unconscious ” ) understandings about our self that we find shocking , frightening or even impulsive .
In this sense , self - analysis can become a scary thing for the self .
It is turning a mirror inwards and observing whatever there is to be observed – inner chat , thought patterns , lines of reasoning , belief systems , subjective feelings and emotions , and associations we make between the mind , body , and our environments .
Extended self - reflection is sometimes even considered a symptom of depression by some psychiatrists and therapists , especially if someone gets into the habit of only reflecting on negative thoughts , beliefs , feelings , etc .
But in general , self - reflection can be tremendously beneficial if it is done balanced and mindfully .
Balanced self - reflection ( or Equanimity ) means observing all thoughts , beliefs , and feelings equally under the so - called microscope of the mind , including ones that give pleasure as well as pain .
Mindfulness self - reflection means observing al mental phenomena with a sense of passiveness – not clinging or giving energy to any particular arising stimulus ( even the sensations we find absurdly enjoyable ) .
By observing the “ I , ” continuously one becomes more skillful in the act of being balanced and mindful .
Slowly , the nature of “ I ” – through direct observation – begins to reveal itself .
It can be noticed that the arising of the “ I ” concept is entangled with all other concepts that arise in the mind .
Why ?
Because the “ I ” is what does the observing – so the “ I ” - concept is implied in all other observations being made .
What Is Thing - ness ?
The thing - ness of things arises from the identification of those things done by the mind .
Contemporary philosophers of mind call this concept intentionality – meaning “ aboutness ” – it is the distinguishing property of mental phenomenon .
It is the difference between when a mind looks at an object and distinguishes it as “ Water ” and when a mind looks at an object and distinguishes it as “ Computer . ”
In other words , these are all talking about the concept of “ Concepts ” , and how they are created and used by the mind , especially when making a particular judgment on what is being observed .
How Does The “ I ” Create Thing - ness
Physical matter that has the property to experience its own being is said to have consciousness .
Although only the individual can only prove his or her own consciousness ( as depicted in David Chalmer ’s Philosophical Zombie argument – an interesting thought experiment ) , it is reasonably to assume that most things that we perceive as beings ( such as insects , fish , birds , reptiles and mammals ) also have consciousness – they experience their environments in relation to a self ( or “ I ” ) .
But what comes first : consciousness or the self ?
Can physical matter experience its self without first having a conception of what “ self ” there is to experience ?
What might create this conception ?
The mind ?
What creates the mind ?
Is it the ability to perceive and make sense of the environment ?
What creates that perception ?
Senses ?
Experience ?
Consciousness ?!
Perhaps consciousness arises parallel to the conception of self , or maybe a better explanation is that they are one in the same thing .
Is consciousness “ the conception of a self ” ?
And thus could consciousness ( and the self ) be the origins of mind : the beginning of concepts , reality , and even happiness and suffering .
If there is no thing - “ I ” or thing - “ Self ” , how can there be thing - “ Other . ”
Without this initial distinction , existence can quickly become chaotic and meaningless – perhaps something akin to the realities of self - less schizophrenics .
Instead , concepts make things meaningful , give things sense , make environments adaptable , and create useful maps of how reality is .
Caveats To The Concept Of “ I ” And “ Self ”
The concept of self is necessary in the same way the concept of gravity is necessary .
As humans , we would n’t normally try jumping off of buildings trying to fly because we have learned the experiential - component of “ Gravity ” – that thing , or force , that we experience as pulling us down to the Earth , and at times is associated with that feeling “ Pain ” which can be experienced if one falls from a great height such as the top of a building .
Even the simplest of thoughts and understandings require the use of a multiple array of concepts – all encoded , stored , retrieved , and re-encoded in the brain ’s neural networks , similar to a computer hard drive – but perhaps not as reliably .
To start , the concept of “ I ” changes moment by moment .
Each new registered memory in the brain plays its small part in shaping the new you .
If not registering new sensations , the brain is just as often letting go of old sensations and old conceptions , or previous moments of self .
These changes can be dramatic , but ordinary daily experience is rarely described as “ life - changing ” – there are certainly some moments we naturally hold as more meaningful than others .
If the one thing that observes things ( the lens of the “ Self ” ) is always changing , than the Self ’s perception of reality and thing - ness is also , to some degree , always changing .
This is an insight into the ever - fleeting , impermanent nature of reality that has been started by this thing we call “ I . ”

The author wrote the seminal work Overshoot : The Ecological Basis of Revolutionary Change in 1980 .
The following ass - kicking paper was written in October 1995 as an inquiry into public denial of ecological overshoot .
It could have been written today , an unsettling fact that adds to the paper ’s importance .
Of great value is Catton ’s demolition of cornucopianism .
– JL , ed .
ABSTRACT
Abundant evidence suggests industrial civilization must be “ downsized ” to curb damage to the ecosphere by the “ technosphere . ”
Trends behind this prospect include prodigious population growth , urbanization , cultural dependence upon ravenous use of fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources , consequent air pollution , and global climate change .
Despite prolonged Cold War distraction and entrenched faith that technology could always enlarge carrying capacity , these trends were well publicized .
But there remain eminent writers who persist in denying that human carrying capacity ( Earth ’s maximum sustainable human load ) has now been or ever will be exceeded .
Denials of ecological limits resemble anosognosia ( inability of stroke patients to recognize their paralysis ) .
Some denial literature resembles their confabulations ( elaborately unreal stories concocted as rationalizations ) .
Denial by opponents of human ecology seems to be a way of coping with an insufferable contradiction between past convictions and present circumstances , a defense against intolerable anomalous information .
The passionate drive in the 104th U.S. Congress “ to kill many environmental protection laws … in the name of less government ” ( Wager 1995 , 3 ) stands in stark contrast to the ecological wisdom implicit in a two - centuries - old statement William Ophuls used as a tone - setting epigraph for his book on Ecology and the Politics of Scarcity ( see Ophuls and Boyan 1992 , vi ) .
Humans , said Edmund Burke ,
… are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition to put moral chains upon their own appetites … .
Society cannot exist unless a controlling power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere , and the less of it there is within , the more there must be without .
It is ordained in the eternal constitution of things , that men of intemperate minds cannot be free .
Their passions forge their fetters .
That these aphoristic sentences imply an important ecological principle becomes sharply visible in light of some conceptualizations recently set forth by Barry Commoner ( 1990 ) .
People , he said , live in two worlds .
We live not only in the natural world that evolved physically , chemically , and biologically over Earth ’s five billion years , but also in a world humans have made .
He insists we need to understand how these two worlds ( Commoner calls them “ the ecosphere ” and “ the technosphere ” ) interact , especially now that the technosphere has become so enormous and consequential , breaching the division between the two worlds .
What we still euphemistically call “ acts of God ” are no longer uninfluenced by human societal activity .
Collectively , we now significantly alter the natural processes of the ecosphere , “ the thin global skin of air , water , and soil , and the plants and animals that live in it ”
According to Commoner ( 1990 , 15 ) , “ What we call the ‘ environmental crisis ’ — the array of critical unsolved problems ranging from local toxic dumps to the disruption of global climate ” — results from a drastic mismatch between the ecosphere ’s “ cyclical , conservative , and self - consistent processes ” and the technosphere ’s “ linear , innovative , but ecologically disharmonious processes . ”
While Commoner ’s statement carries real meaning to human ecologists , I am sure it is completely opaque to the person who happens to “ represent ” my Congressional district .
It is probably meaningless to most of her House colleagues , and to most members of the Senate .
It would probably find little resonance with most of the voters who put them in Congress .
The aim of this paper is to try to shed some light on the apparent refusal of ostensibly educated individuals to realize the urgent need , as Commoner puts it , for ending the “ suicidal war ” between technosphere and ecosphere .
Never have so many seemed so oblivious to so momentous a future - shaping condition .
THE BASIC CHANGES
Human ecologists could well be dismayed by the apparent preoccupation of society ’s decision makers with matters of less basic importance to our global prospects than the following facts :
(1) Human numbers on this planet are much greater today ( and still growing ) than they were just half a century ago ( Demeny 1986 , 29 - 33 ; Ehrlich and Ehrlich , 1990 ; Keyfitz , 1991 ) .
(2) A greater fraction of the world ’s people today live in cities , and many cities are faced with problems of serious air pollution ( Demeny , 1986,55 - 58 ; Lowe , 1991 ) .
(3) Industrialization has enabled and required mankind to use fossil fuels and other nonrenewable resources at prodigious rates , with little regard for the finiteness of the Earth ’s deposits of these substances ( Young , 1992 ; Flavin and Lenssen , 1994,29 - 49 ; Inkeles , 1994 ; Szell , 1994 ) .
(4) The combustion products we have been putting into the atmosphere may be causing climate change ( Tangley , 1988 ; Abrahamson , 1989 ; Rathjens , 1991 ; Revkin , 1992 ; Ravin and Lenssen , 1994,50 - 70 ; Wigley , 1995 ) .
(5) Other products of modem chemistry have been accumulating in the upper atmosphere and wreaking havoc with the protective ozone layer ( Benedick , 1991 ; Litfin , 1994 , 52 - 77 ) .
Could mass media preoccupation with less crucially significant matters explain why there appear even now to be so many literate and educated people who remain unconcerned about these facts , or who deny their truth or at least their importance ?
MEDIA TREATMENT
It is instructive to trace the entry of these topics into the print media to see just how long there has been information about them readily available to the reading public .
For that purpose , it was a simple expedient to explore entries in the many volumes of the Readers Guide to Periodical Literature , a standard resource in many libraries .
Without parading details of this exploration , it suffices to say that all five facts have had appreciable public exposure in the print media .
2
The treatments of the five topics attained clarity and explicitness at varying dates :
( 1 ) exploding population was publicized from the 1950s ;
( 2 ) air pollution received explicit attention by the time of World War II ;
( 3 ) ravenous industrial dependence on exhaustible resources was explicitly depicted from 1973 onward ;
( 4 ) treatment of global warming by the greenhouse effect of C02 etc. in the atmosphere became fairly clear from the mid-1950s ;
( 5 ) depiction of the ozone layer got explicit coverage from 1985 .
Thus , for a decade at minimum , and for several decades in some cases , these facts have been “ available ” to the general reader — and to politicians .
FLAWED ACCOUNTING , WISHFUL THINKING
Until the end of the 1980s , public views of nearly everything were colored by the dangerous rivalry between two nuclear - armed superpowers , each defining the other ideologically as evil .
When the Cold War ended at last , it became possible for a writer desiring to educate people to ecological facts of life to suggest that the visible failure of communism was accompanied by an as yet unrecognized failure of Western capitalism ( Orr , 1992 , ix ) .
“ Our failures , ” he said , “ are still being concealed by bad bookkeeping ( both fiscal and ecological ) , dishonest rhetoric , and wishful thinking . ”
But he insisted “ the day of reckoning ” was coming soon , for “ the world … is not without limits ” recognizable by an ecologically literate person .
Most people are not yet ecologically literate , even this many years after the well - publicized 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment that met in Stockholm .
So “ the health of the planet ” continued to deteriorate ( Brown et al. , 1991 , 20 - 21 ) .
As many people as existed altogether in 1900 were added to the Earth ’s load between 1972 and 1991 , while the world lost nearly 200 million hectares of trees , an area the size of the United States east of the Mississippi .
Deserts have expanded by 120 million hectares , claiming more land than is planted to crops in China and Nigeria combined .
The world ’s farmers lost about 480 billion tons of topsoil , roughly equal to that which covers the agricultural land of India and France .
And thousands of plant and animal species with which we shared the planet in 1972 no longer exist .
So it may have been a display of exaggerated faith in popular wisdom when a pair of demographers ( Tsui and Bogue , 1978 , 3 ) wrote that “ No social problem , other than war , has attracted greater and more sustained public concern during the decades since World War II than the ‘ population explosion ’ . ”
MYOPIA AND OVERSHOOT
Not only were there Cold War blinders restricting people ’s perceptions of the world for so many years ; there was also a consummate faith that continuing technological innovations will enable Earth ’s human carrying capacity to be expanded “ to almost any required size ” ( Ehrlich et al. , 1971 , 41 ) .
This exuberant worldview has been expressed in professional scientific journals , not just in more popular media .
Examples have appeared in Scientific American ( e.g. Hopper , 1976 ; Revelle , 1976 ) , BioScience ( e.g. Weinberg , 1973 ) , and The Sciences ( e.g. Ausubel , 1993 ) , as well as in Science , official organ of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , which published the following assertion ( Simon , 1980 ) :
Incredible as it may seem at first , the term ‘ finite ’ is not only inappropriate but is downright misleading in the context of natural resources … .
Even the total weight of the earth is not a theoretical limit to the amount of copper that might be available to earthlings in the future .
Only the total weight of the universe — if that term has a useful meaning here — would be such a theoretical limit .
In summary , because we find new lodes , invent better production methods , and discover new substitutes , the ultimate constraint upon our capacity to enjoy unlimited raw materials at acceptable prices is knowledge .
And the source of knowledge is the human mind .
Ultimately , then , the key constraint is human imagination and the exercise of human skills .
Hence an increase of human beings constitutes an addition to the crucial stock of resources , along with causing additional consumption of resources ( 1435 -1436 ) .
The idea in that final sentence recurred in the context of some analysis of carrying capacity estimates ; ex-President Bush was quoted insisting that every human possesses not just a consuming mouth but also productive hands ( Cohen , 1995a ) .
Here , and again in a subsequent book , Cohen ( 1995 b ) implied that “ the historical record of faster - than - exponential population growth ” might well continue to be “ accompanied by an immense improvement in average well - being . ”
While human population had increased fourfold between 1860 and 1991 , human use of inanimate energy increased 93 - fold in the same period .
3
Human influence upon the planet had thus grown enormously faster than mere human biomass .
Is this fact a basis for optimistic amazement , or should it be arousing deep anxiety ?
The point of the statement from George Bush ( echoing Friedrich Engels ) was to suggest that human carrying capacity may be not just burdened by more people but could actually be raised by them .
4
But no such faith can eliminate mathematical limits ( see Cohen , 1995 b : Appendix 6 ) .
Anyway , carrying capacity is not simply “ Earth ’s maximum supportable human population ” ( Cohen , 1995a , 342 ) ; the concept should denote Earth ’s maximum sustainable load .
The concept of human carrying capacity is not qualified sufficiently by noting that the load depends on level of living as well as number of people .
What the carrying capacity concept must spotlight is the issue of system durability ; how long can an ecosystem support a given load ?
It is true that the load varies with level of living .
It is no less essential to recognize the idea ( which should be so simple ) that overuse of an environment reduces its load - supporting capacity for future generations of users .
As Ehrlich et al. ( 1971,41 ) suggested a generation ago , it already “ seems clear that a population size smaller than that of 1970 will be necessary , if all human beings are to have a high material standard of living , and if a comfortable margin for error is to be maintained against ecocatastrophes . ”
More recently a writer for Worldwatch Institute has stated flatly that “ we have surpassed the planet ’s carrying capacity ” ( Postel , 1994,4 ) , saying what makes this evident is the extent of depletion and damage to natural capital .
“ The earth ’s environmental assets are now insufficient to sustain both our present patterns of economic activity and the life - support systems we depend on ” .
5
As if to remove all doubt as to what is meant by asserting the human load already exceeds Earth ’s carrying capacity , the head of the Worldwatch Institute insists “ Time is not on our side .
The world has waited too long to stabilize population … .
If we care about the future , we have no other choice but to launch a worldwide effort to stabilize our life - support systems — soils , fisheries , aquifers , and forests — and the climate system ” ( Brown , 1995 , 141 ; cf. Catton , 1980 ) .
And as he pointed out , this would take a massive mobilization of financial and political resources comparable to organizing to fight World War II .
Absent that , “ we will leave our children a world without hope . ”
6
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
For emphasis let me now personalize the changes that have led to these somber assessments .
There are almost three times as many people now living on this planet as there were when , as a boy , I first asked an adult what was the world ’s total population .
Within my lifetime , I have seen small towns grow to become cities , spreading over once open countryside .
In the first third of my life , automobiles and highways , although already well - established as a means of family mobility , had not yet displaced trains and railroads as the major choice for long distance travel .
Nor had the airlines yet proliferated to the point of near extinction of rail passenger service .
The changes in transportation I ’ve experienced and witnessed in one lifetime , together with other industrial growth , have caused world extraction of crude oil to double each decade .
This means that in each of the first five or six decades of my life we humans extracted and used as much petroleum as had been used in all previous time — including the immediately preceding decade .
High school mathematics was more than enough to make it evident that this decennial doubling could not go on forever .
As a visible indication of climate change , I have personally become acquainted with glaciers in both the northern and southern hemispheres and have seen that they are now hundreds of meters shorter than when I first laid eyes on them .
And although I have no direct personal experience of stratospheric ozone thinning , I am inclined to trust the scientific literature on that subject ( e.g. Cicerone , 1987 ; Kerr , 1988 ; Rowland , 1989 ; Firor , 1990 ) .
DENYING REALITY
There are others who deny the whole idea that carrying capacity has now been , or ever will be , exceeded by the human load .
Writing of a future “ age of abundance , ” an economist at the Cato Institute in Washington , DC , has argued that just because a grocery store stocks only a three days supply of milk no one worries that life after the third day must be lived without milk , and similarly , we should not expect to run out of copper simply because copper mining companies calculate that they have only a certain number of years of reserves .
When they use up those reserves , they will have a renewed incentive to locate new sources of supply ( Moore , 1995,116 ) .
He insists , therefore , that the only reliable measure of “ a resource ’s supply is the change in its market price . ”
In support of that view , he cites Julian Simon ’s book .
The Ultimate Resource , a title alluding to human brains and reflecting a faith that ever - increasing numbers of them on this planet will ensure an escalation of solutions to outrace any escalation of problems .
In a more recent book , Simon ( 1994,65 ) has asserted that we already have in the world ’s libraries “ the technology to feed , clothe , and supply energy to an ever - growing population for the next 7 billion years . ”
After noting the relative recency of much of our technological knowledge , Simon adds , “ Even if no new knowledge were ever invented after those advances , we would be able to go on increasing forever , improving our standard of living and our control over our environment . ”
If most human ecologists would regard this as quite preposterous and detached from reality , I have felt almost as stunned each time I have read the negating paraphrase by Julian Simon and Herman Kahn ( 1984, 1 - 2 ) of the summary of The Global 2000 Report to the President :
If present trends continue , the world in 2000 will be less crowded ( though more populated ) , less polluted , more stable ecologically , and less vulnerable to resource supply disruptions than the world we live in now .
Stresses involving population , resources , and environment will be less in the future than now …
The world ’s people will be richer in most ways than they are today …
The out look for food and other necessities of life will be better … life for most people on earth will be less precarious economically than it is now .
The emphases and ellipses are by Simon and Kahn , obviously intended to make their glowing expectations contrast maximally and point - for - point with the Global 2000 summary they were paraphrasing .
Knowing these two men to be both intelligent and educated , I have wondered every time I looked at the quoted passage how they could so flagrantly deny what so many ecologists regard as the real state of the world .
7
As long ago as 1956 , a past president of the American Ecological Society , who was then president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , and would shortly thereafter serve as president of the American Society of Naturalists , wrote : “ I have yet to meet a biologist who shares the optimistic unconcern about natural resources that is so prevalent among a considerable group of technologists and economists ” ( Sears , 1956,22 ) .
In addition to Simon and Kahn , other authors have exhibited similarly sublime denial .
Two astonishing books by Wattenberg ( 1984 ; 1987 ) asserted that “ the bad news ” is just plain wrong , and that far from overpopulation , fertility rate declines in industrial nations should be seen as a dangerous “ birth dearth . ”
Just recently , Wattenberg ( 1995 ) reasserted his “ birth dearth ” concept with specific reference to the United States , arguing this country needs immigrants to offset the effects of past fertility declines on the present young adult ( labor force ) strata in our population pyramid .
A pair of economists , writing about “ the doomsday myth ” ( Maurice and Smithson , 1984 ) , claimed modem economic problems do not significantly differ from crises that have been occurring and getting solved over the past 10,000 years .
Energy shortage problems in the 1970s are alleged to have been a “ created crisis ” ( Sutton , 1979 ) .
And anyway some problems are better left unaddressed , according to a civil engineer , an economist , and an environmental engineer who argued that recycling , for example , is often too costly and has doubtful environmental value ( Hendrickson et al. , 1995 ) .
Not surprisingly , an advertisement for the Mobil Corporation answers its own headline question , “ Running out of oil ? ” by proclaiming , “ Not in your lifetime nor your grandchildren ’s . ”
The ad ’s aim , as it appeared in Newsweek for May 8,1995 ( 15 ) , was to forestall “ Forcing the market to make the transition to alternative fuels prematurely ” which , it said , “ will harm the economy , consumers and taxpayers . ”
And , just possibly , Mobil Corporation ?
In many instances , perhaps , denial may express a vested interest .
But there are common occurrences of denial in other life contexts .
In American Holocaust , Stannard ( 1982 ) presented what a catalog blurb for the book called “ A devastating portrait of the death , disease , misery , and apocalyptic destruction experienced by American Indians during the centuries after 1492 . ”
The pre-European inhabitants of this continent did indeed experience those woes , yet most European - descended Americans today tend not to think about the Indians ’ plight .
Further , it is possible to be so committed to reserving the term “ holocaust ” for another particular disaster that one objects to its use in the title of a book about American Indians .
Katz ( 1994 ) has argued that “ the Holocaust ” is a singular event in human history and the only example of true genocide .
And yet , remarkably , there was frequent resort to denial by survivors of that World War II , Nazi- inflicted Holocaust ( Salamon , 1994 ) .
It appears that fear of ostracism by a society disinterested in what had transpired in those death camps caused many survivors to avoid speaking about what they had experienced .
Denial , said the paper reporting this , “ is considered one of the least mature defense mechanisms .
Yet , it is the one most often employed when stressors are the most overwhelming . ”
MOTIVATION FOR DENIAL
This may be a clue to the Simon - Kahn puzzle .
What could be more overwhelming than clear realization of the full implications of finding the world truly in a condition of life - support system erosion by severe overload ?
How tempting to deny the breakdown is happening , or ever could happen .
Alcoholics are commonly seen as persons overwhelmed by experiences or circumstances beyond their ability to cope , and denial is common among them and their families ( Crisman , 1991 ) .
Realizing this , it seemed plausible to look into writings by psychiatrists and associated treatment professionals in search of some principles that would help explain how Simon and Kahn could contend the Global 2000 Report was diametrically wrong .
After searching not very profitably through a number of papers in psychiatric and related journals , ’ I happened to en counter in Discover magazine an unexpectedly suggestive article .
It described research by a neuroscientist and physician at the University of California at San Diego .
He studies a rather amazing form of denial .
The researcher ’s name is Vilayanur Ramachandran , and the form of denial he has been studying is called anosognosia .
“ One of the best - known victims of the condition was Supreme Court Justice William 0 .
Douglas , who suffered a right - hemisphere stroke in 1974 that paralyzed his left side and eventually forced his retirement .
He initially dismissed the paralysis as a myth , and weeks later was still inviting reporters to go on hiking expeditions with him .
When one visitor asked about his left leg , he claimed he had recently been kicking 40 - yard field goals with it ” ( Shreeve , 1995 ) .
As Dr. Ramachandran describes it , anosognosia is a condition in which the patient does not just ignore his or her paralysis , but actively denies it “ in spite of … complete inability to move . ”
To explain away the real condition , the patient often concocts “ elaborate stories or chillingly unreal rationalizations . ”
( Confabulations is the term for these stories . )
Simon ’s notion that the existing contents of libraries ensure perpetual growth and progress for 7 billion years certainly resembles a confabulation ( see Berlyne , 1972 ; Mercer et al. , 1977 ; and Shapiro et al. , 1981 ) .
The resemblance seems all the more striking the more one reads about anosognosia and its effects .
9 Ramachandran ’s explanation for anosognosia says that this form of denial is a way of coping with an insufferable contradiction that confronts stroke patients ; their paralysis is an incompatible , identity - threatening anomaly that contradicts their prior experience of themselves and their milieu .
Ramachandran has begun trying to use this unusual “ window into the brain ” to understand new aspects of the functioning circuitry of that truly remarkable but vulnerable organ .
He postulates what he calls an “ anomaly detector ” as a kind of decision - making center somewhere in the brain .
He has not located it specifically , but feels it must be in a part of the brain that usually interacts with the part affected by the stroke his patients have suffered , i.e. , the right hemisphere .
Anosognosia involves a breakdown of anomaly detection , so the patient is truly unaware of his paralysis and consequent disabilities .
In a Dictionary of Medical Syndromes ( Magalini et al. , 1990 , 54 ) there is this description of anosognosia : Inability of the patient to recognize a body or functional defect … .
Denies the existence of the condition and attempts to disprove it by going through psychic process that lets him convince himself that what is said by the physician is false .
Here , of course , there is no mention of an “ anomaly detector ” in the patient ’s brain .
But the reference to a “ process that lets him convince himself ” of the falsity of what is said by the physician ( ordinarily a trusted authority ) seemed a close parallel to the case of Simon and Kahn having convinced themselves the things said not only in the Global 2000 Report but by other knowledgeable writers before and since are false .
It is not the intention of the present paper to impute neurological or psychological aberration to Simon , or Kahn , or Wattenberg , or anyone else writing denials of global ecological peril .
If the insights derived from accounts of anosognosia are to shed real light on the Simon - Kahn type of denials , we have to suppose there are sociocultural , interpersonal processes of “ anomaly detection , ” not just organic ones within the individual brain .
We must also suppose these interpersonal processes are subject to deflection , and that the deflective influences are discoverable sociocultural forces .
Reading a description of anosognosia ( and other related forms of denial or “ neglect ” ) coupled with suggestions for care of the patient by family members ( Caplan et al. , 1994 , 214-221 ) caused me to recall a long forgotten instance of denial in my own extended family .
It did not have to do with stroke or paralysis , but it did indeed suggest “ anomaly detection ” may be sometimes a fallible interpersonal process , not just a neural function in the patient ’s own brain .
The example that came to mind was a memory of my mother sadly telling of a visit with her elderly parents when her father , my grandfather , a retired physician , was dying ( in effect , of old age ) .
He had had a fall which broke a hip .
Bedridden , he developed gangrene in his feet .
My mother forlornly described the way her mother had turned back the blankets to show my mother the condition of my grandfather ’s feet , while pathetically insisting my mother must confirm my grandmother ’s wishful perception of ( nonexistent ) signs of improvement .
Denial by solicited agreement .10
There are indeed social psychological patterns that resemble anosognosia , and they are not simply manifestations of neurological impairment .
This is clearly evident in the case of Woodrow Wilson , 28th president of the United States , who suffered a stroke on October 2,1919 , while winding up a nationwide speaking tour to raise public support for the proposed League of Nations .
Despite paralysis of the left side of his body , he remained “ under the illusion , persistently fostered by those around him , that he was on the way to recovery ” ( Hecksher , 1991,632-633 .
emphasis added ; see also Hoover , 1958 ; Walworth , 1965 ; Grayson , 1977 ) .
Both Mrs. Wilson and the president ’s doctor .
Rear Admiral Grayson , are said to have feared Wilson would “ fall back into his post stroke depression ” if told the plain truth about his disability .
In the aftermath of World War I , Wilson ’s supreme mission was to ensure future world peace by establishing the League of Nations .
Led by those close to him to believe his infirmity was abating , he meant to continue campaigning for the League ’s establishment “ Undated rough notes in longhand reveal that at some time during [ the spring of 1920 ]
Wilson drafted a document entitled ‘ 3rd Inaugural ' ” ( Hecksher , 1991 , 633 ) .
Third term candidacy was his imagined way of bringing to ultimate fruition the presumed public support for his League by overcoming the growing opposition in the Senate .
Neither his wife nor his physician would tell him , during that spring , that it was an “ utter impossibility ” for him to run for a third presidential term .
This tragedy of Woodrow Wilson helps clarify what stroke patients with anosognosia and writers who deny global ecological peril have in common : a compulsion to overcome what social psychologists call cognitive dissonance ( Festinger , 1957 ) .
According to theory , cognitive dissonance can be strongly aversive .
A person will attempt to reduce or eliminate such dissonance between two or more cognitions .
The person will act to avoid events or stimuli that would increase it .
The severity or intensity of cognitive dissonance depends on the importance to the individual ( … and to his peers ? … to his reference group ? ) of the cognitions involved .
New cognitions that will add weight to one side of the aversive contradiction can reduce the intolerable dissonance — either by diminishing the contradiction or by reducing its perceived importance ( Zajonc , 1968 , 360-361 ) .
Now let us imagine a scholar who happens to be deeply committed to what Murray ( 1972 , 219 ) called “ the American economic model . ”
Our scholar then encounters “ cognitions ” like the following :
[ This model , which ] values increasing growth , waste ( non-recycling of essential materials ) , and competition [ clearly violates ] ecological principles that have been established by observations : Competition results in elimination of competitors ; continually growing populations eventually collapse ; and ecosystems whose essential materials are not recycled cannot be sustained .
There is no reason to believe that economic systems based on principles that bring collapse to ecological systems are immune to a similar fate .
These statements are certainly dissonant with his prior convictions .
It should be no surprise if this committed scholar tries to reduce dissonance by amassing additional “ cognitions ” supporting his adherence to “ the American economic model . ”
CONCLUSION
By thinking of denial as a defense against intolerable anomalous information , we come back to the classic assertion by Paul Sears ( 1964,11 ) that ecology “ if taken seriously as an instrument for the long - run welfare of mankind , would … endanger the assumptions and practices accepted by modern societies …. ”
Ecology , he said , affords by its very nature a continuing critique of human operations within the ecosystem .
He agreed with F. Fraser Darling that we humans are an integral part of the ecosystem , albeit the most dominant species .
Without resorting to Barry Commoner ’s military metaphor , Sears was already expressing concern about that clash between technosphere and ecosphere later named , described , and deplored by Commoner as a “ suicidal war . ”
Ecological understanding of nature ’s limits and man ’s place in nature contradicts deeply entrenched cultural expectations of endless material progress .
This fact has been expressed repeatedly by assorted writers who came to it from various directions .
In his important but too - seldom - read book on the relation between societal forms and the kinds of energy converters used , Cottrell ( 1955 , 2 ) ” wrote forty years ago that clear understanding of that relation was “ likely to raise questions about the reliability of certain propositions which are basic to the policies of both the Communist and the Free World .
Some of the makers of these policies will be unwilling to accept its implications , ” especially if , as Garrett Hardin ( 1985 , 469 ) contended three decades later , ecology “ demands that our current political , social , economic , and moral order be stood on its head . ”
Simple inability to do that , or committed reluctance to consider how that might happen , seem widespread .
Perhaps that is what motivates men like Simon and Kahn to scorn such views and information as were presented in the Global 2000 Report .
It challenged beliefs and attitudes that were central to their very identity as humans made in the Western industrial mold .
In the same way , and just as fundamentally , it must challenge the beliefs and attitudes crucial to the identities of members of the 104th Congress of the United States .
Is it possible that for them , “ downsizing ” government ( to “ balance the budget ” by 2002 A.D. ) has a “ latent function ” ? — it has helped divert attention from humanity ’s involvement in that “ suicidal war ” on the ecosphere .
If surviving that conflict requires downsizing industrial civilization , rather than just the federal government , how long can the world afford such diversion of those who purport to shape the course of history ?
When will evidence ( or social pressure ) suffice to emancipate them from habits of denial ?
ENDNOTES
Revised version of paper presented at the 1995 meetings of the Society for Human Ecology , October 19 - 22 , 1995 .
The phrase “ population explosion ” began to show up in titles of magazine articles more than four decades ago ; it headlined a Time story in October 1953 , and again in October 1957 .
A Newsweek article in March 1956 was headed “ Too many people . ”
The concept of air pollution had apparently established itself in the educated American vocabulary by the time of World War I .
Items listed in early volumes of Readers Guide pertained to indoor air problems ( ventilation ) .
The word “ smog ” began to show up in article titles just before World War II .
First appearance of the phrase “ Energy Crisis ” as a heading came in vol. 33 , covering March 1973 to Feb. 1974 publications .
In vol. 35 , covering March 1975 to Feb. 1976 , “ Energy policy ” loomed as an important category , with over 140 items listed .
Editors of Readers Guide did not deem “ Greenhouse effect ” a sufficiently meaningful phrase to use it as a heading until vol. 46 , covering 1986 publications .
By 1994 , however , this heading ’s enduring importance was reflected in 19 items listed under it .
And as early as the 1950s and 1960s there were published articles listed under “ Climate ” that had begun to deal with the kind of climate change now familiarly designated as “ the greenhouse effect , ” or sometimes simply as “ global warning . ”
Readers Guide long had the word “ Ozone ” among its headings , though most early volumes listed only a handful of articles ( often as few as one or two per year or more ) .
These articles usually had to do with chemical actions of ozone on materials , or on plants , animals , or humans , from direct exposure to this 3 - atom form of oxygen .
Its corrosive or respiratory effects were all that concerned writers — until vol. 44 of Readers Guide , covering March 1984 to Feb.
1985 publications , with listings of nine items pertaining to stratospheric ozone and what was happening to it .
Subsequent volumes have also contained listings of items on this aspect of the topic .
Expectation that ongoing advances in technology will continue releasing human societies from carrying capacity limits was embraced by Hawley ( 1975,10 ) .
Cohen questioned not only Malthus but also Liebig , whose law of the minimum , an important basis for understanding the carrying capacity concept , was declared misleading on several counts
Marine biologist Sylvia Earle would seem to agree : “ If it were possible to start again , with the planet as it was 10,000 years ago — or even 500 years or 200 or 20 — with knowledge now gained , there would be a better chance to achieve the much - discussed goal of ‘ sustainable use* of planetary resources ” ( Earle , 1995 , 219 ) .
She reports observing “ hundreds of ominous signs . ”
The former vision of “ limitless fish in an infinitely productive ocean ” has been shattered in one generation .
“ Greatly expanding demand to feed growing populations of people coupled with the means to find , capture , and transport animals from all parts of the sea to distant lands have drastically altered the nature of ocean ecosystems in a few decades .
Even familiar staples of the early part of this century — cod , herring , haddock , pollock , halibut , several kinds of salmon , and tuna — are in sharp decline after years of heavy fishing pressure ” ( Earle , 1995,169 ) .
6. Cf. Murray ( 1972,219 ) : “ There is no question that collapse is inevitable .
The question seems to be how much longer businessmen can continue making profits at the expense of future generations . ”
7. Assorted other instances of denial are reviewed by Ellsaesser ( 1992,1 - 26 ) .
Herman Kahn , in collaboration with Ernest Schneider , dubbed The Global 2000 Report “ Globaloney 2000 ” ( Kahn and Schneider , 1981 ) .
Max Singer ( 1992,35 ) asked , “ How do we know that the rest of the world also will become modem and wealthy ?
Because we can recognize the powerful process that has been shaping events , and see that that process is still working , and that there is no reason for it to stop now . ”
And according to Andrew Kenny ( 1994 ) , “ The Earth is Fine ; The Problem is the Greens ” ( i.e. , the environmentalists , with their “ misguided belief in global warming ” ) .
When his article was reprinted in The Christchurch Press in New Zealand it was given the headline , “ The great ozone scare — why it is a lot of unscientific nonsense . ”
8 . One study compared the effectiveness of “ situation redefinition ” versus “ attention diversion ” as means of reducing stress due to a “ nonambiguous threat ” ( Bloom , 1977 ) .
It shed no light on Simon and Kahn .
A paper that summarized psychiatric literature about interactional aspects of denial and defense looked promising at first .
It suggested , among other generalizations , that denial may be shared .
Individuals in interpersonal situations may use denial as a means of avoiding disruption of the relationship ( Dorpat , 1989 ) .
Without knowing the interaction networks of men like Simon and Kahn , and their peers ’ beliefs , this paper could not illuminate their denial .
Several other papers ( Wurmser , 1989 ; Moses , 1989 ;
Wangh , 1989 ; Wasyliw , et al. 1994 ; Langer , 1994 ) also failed to show how it is possible for learned men to reject ecological facts such as the ones I have listed in this paper .
9 . The term was first used by Babinski ( 1941 ) in a French journal .
The following papers enhanced my understanding of its modern usage : Kihistrom and Tobias ( 1991 ) ;
Weinstein ( 1991 ) ; Holmes ( 1994 ) .
A partial version of the denial process was evident among polio patients and their families as studied by Davis ( 1956 ) , and I remember my own partial denial in a Navy hospital suffering from a smashed pelvis and imagining I ’d be out in a few days rather than a few months .
10 .
For more insight into this pattern of behavior , see Festinger et al. 1956 .
11 . George Lundberg ( 1956 . 377 ) began a review of Cottrell ’s book by predicting it would “ doubtless be dismissed as ‘ defeatist ’ in some circles , ” and said it laid itself “ wide open to this treatment … by proclaiming … ‘ that the energy available to man limits what he can do and influences what he will do ' ” — a thesis that challenged the cornucopian claims of both the Free World and its Communist rivals .
Labeling such a book “ defeatist , ” said Lundberg , was “ a curious form of sympathetic magic . ”
The label , he said , “ is sometimes regarded as constituting a refutation of the data , the reasoning , and the conclusions of any work that calls into question the wishful thinking which constitutes the principle basis of much contemporary social science . ”
Cottrell ’s thesis about the societal relevance of energy availability and the nature of different energy converting technologies was , Lundberg recognized , dissonant with customary social science ( and Western cultural ) cognitions .

Imagine how much automobile insurance would cost if it paid for all expenses associated with owning an automobile – oil changes , engine failures , worn - out tires , brakes , rust , and so on .
The number of people who could n't afford car insurance would rise dramatically , and we would have a car insurance crisis in America .
That is the situation with healthcare .
As health plans increasingly pay for almost every service or procedure , ameliorate our every discomfort , and succumb to every cultural whim and fad , the price of insurance continues to rise .
Health plans are paying for every imaginable benefit – while automobile insurers are not – because of both consumer demand and state mandates .
The demand for additional healthcare benefits is greater than for additional automobile insurance benefits because many people feel entitled to have access to every possible healthcare service .
The costs of additional benefits are not always clear to consumers ; thus , many people perceive the benefits to be " free . "
In response to consumer demand , health plans sometimes expand coverage on their own .
In other cases , they are forced by politicians running for reelection to cover additional services or procedures .
To make health insurance more affordable , state governments should stop mandating additional benefits and rescind all of their previous mandates .
In addition , both private and public insurers ( such as Medicare ) should agree to pay for only costly and essential medical services and procedures ( similar to the way they banded together to pledge to reduce $ 2 trillion in healthcare expenses a few months ago ) .
Under the system I am proposing , health insurance would pay for emergencies and urgent care , diagnostic tests and X - rays , medically necessary surgery , hospitalization , therapy , and any other critical services that few people could afford to pay out of their own pockets .
Individuals would pay for routine , discretionary , and elective services – such as doctor visits , acupuncture , marriage counseling – on their own .
This type of system – which has not yet been tried – would lower healthcare costs and make insurance more affordable for everyone , especially the uninsured , by reducing the number of healthcare services that are used .
When the use of services goes up , health insurers must raise premiums to pay for the increase in expenses .
This makes it more expensive for insured people to keep their health coverage , while also making it more expensive for uninsured people to purchase coverage .
Insurance is intended to be a pooling of people 's money to pay for large , unexpected expenses – not for every expense that is incurred .
In other words , it is supposed to be a safety net for catastrophic events .
Yet many Americans go to the doctor for all kinds of trivial ailments , because their insurance pays for it .
True , many people want this type of coverage , but that is because they do not understand the long - term cost implications .
If Americans want to keep the current healthcare system sustainable ( and it appears they do ) , then they need to take on more financial responsibility for their healthcare .
People who choose to visit the doctor for the sniffles should pay for it themselves rather than making everyone else pay for it .
If they did , the use of services – and thus the cost of healthcare – would go down .
If we can budget for our phone , electric , cable , and gas bills , as well as for unexpected household and automobile expenses , then we can budget for routine healthcare services .
This would require some families to forgo the purchase of a plasma TV , but it would make health insurance more affordable .
In addition , most health plans even cover lifestyle choices that have been sold as medical conditions by lobbyists , pharmaceutical and medical companies , politicians , the media , and pop culture .
Some of these covered services – such as cosmetic procedures , birth - control pills , and abortion – do not even address a diagnosis .
( Contrary to popular belief , pregnancy is not a malady . )
If there is no medical condition , then health insurance should not be paying for it .
By shouldering a greater burden of their healthcare costs , Americans would probably eat more healthily , exercise more , quit smoking , and lead healthier and happier lives .
A healthier population would use fewer medical services , which would lower healthcare costs and premiums .
When it comes to healthcare , we should not confuse luxury with necessity .
By transforming health insurance into a system that simply pays for essential medical services and procedures , more Americans would be able to afford insurance – and there would be far fewer uninsured Americans .

Iran : Rafsanjani poised to outflank Supreme Leader Khamenei
From LiveLeak and EurasiaNet.org , July 2 , 2009
It is hard to see the progress from North America but change is happening in Iran as these stories show .
NJN Network
New video to follow
Based on this report , finally Rafsanjani has succeeded in collecting enough support and votes from the members of the “ Assembly of Experts ” to dismiss Khamenei and Ahmadinejad , however , they are delaying the official announcement because the “ Assembly of Experts ” has not yet finalized a decision as to who should replace Khamenei .
They are trying to decide between two alternatives ;
1- Select another high ranking Ayatollah to replace Khamenei ( the name of Grand Ayatollah Montazeri , the highest ranking clergy in Iran , who has been under house arrest for several years has been rumored in multiple sites )
or
2- Instead of having one person being given so much power , appoint a committee of at least 3 or more members to take over this position .
It was reported by a few sources that Rafsanjani will be speaking to the public this coming Friday when he will be leading the Friday Prayer at Tehran University .
Everyone is waiting with anticipation of what he plans to say .
Given the fact that he is the Chairman of the “ Assembly of Experts ” , logically he is the right person to make any official announcements on behalf of this powerful group .
For those who have access to “ Link TV ” , I expect this public announcement to be broadcast live by Link TV at around 1 AM this coming Saturday .
IRAN : RAFSANJANI POISED TO OUTFLANK SUPREME LEADER KHAMENEI Eurasianet.org
Looking past their fiery rhetoric and apparent determination to cling to power using all available means , Iran ’s hardliners are not a confident bunch .
While hardliners still believe they possess enough force to stifle popular protests , they are worried that they are losing a behind - the - scenes battle within Iran ’s religious establishment .
A source familiar with the thinking of decision - makers in state agencies that have strong ties to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said there is a sense among hardliners that a shoe is about to drop .
Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani — Iran ’s savviest political operator and an arch - enemy of Ayatollah Khamenei’s — has kept out of the public spotlight since the rigged June 12 presidential election triggered the political crisis .
The widespread belief is that Rafsanjani has been in the holy city of Qom , working to assemble a religious and political coalition to topple the supreme leader and President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad .
“ There is great apprehension among people in the supreme leader ’s [ camp ] about what Rafsanjani may pull , ” said a source in Tehran who is familiar with hardliner thinking .
“ They [ the supreme leader and his supporters ] are much more concerned about Rafsanjani than the mass movement on the streets . ”
Ayatollah Khamenei now has a very big image problem among influential Shi ’a clergymen .
Over the course of the political crisis , stretching back to the days leading up to the election , Rafsanjani has succeeded in knocking the supreme leader off his pedestal by revealing Ayatollah Khamenei to be a political partisan rather than an above - the - fray spiritual leader .
In other words , the supreme leader has become a divider , not a uniter .
[ For background see the Eurasia Insight archive ] .
Now that Ayatollah Khamenei has become inexorably connected to Ahmadinejad ’s power grab , many clerics are coming around to the idea that the current system needs to be changed .
Among those who are now believed to be arrayed against Ayatollah Khamenei is Grand Ayatollah Ali al - Sistani , the top Shi ’a cleric in neighboring Iraq .
Rafsanjani is known to have met with Grand Ayatollah al - Sistani ’s representative in Iran , Javad Shahrestani .
A reformist website , Rooyeh , reported that Rafsanjani already had the support of nearly a majority of the Assembly of Experts , a body that constitutionally has the power to remove Ayatollah Khamenei .
The report also indicated that Rafsanjani ’s lobbying efforts were continuing to bring more clerics over to his side .
Rafsanjani ’s aim , the website added , is the establishment of a leadership council , comprising of three or more top religious leaders , to replace the institution of supreme leader .
Shortly after it posted the report on Rafsanjani ’s efforts to establish a new collective leadership , government officials pulled the plug on Rooyeh .
Meanwhile , the Al - Arabiya satellite television news channel reported that a “ high - ranking ” source in Qom confirmed that Rafsanjani has garnered enough support to remove Ayatollah Khamenei , but an announcement is being delayed amid differences on what or who should replace the supreme leader .
Some top clerics reportedly want to maintain the post of supreme leader , albeit with someone other than Ayatollah Khamenei occupying the post , while others support the collective leadership approach .
To a certain degree , hardliners now find themselves caught in a cycle of doom : they must crack down on protesters if they are to have any chance of retaining power , but doing so only causes more and more clerics to align against them .
Security forces broke up a small street protest on June 22 involving roughly a thousand demonstrators who had gathered to mourn the victims of the government crackdown two days before .
Also on June 22 , a statement issued in the name of the Revolutionary Guards demanded that protesters immediately stop “ sabotage and rioting activities , ” and threatened to unleash “ revolutionary confrontation ” against anyone who took to the streets .
Such a showdown could come later this week .
One of the country ’s highest - ranking clerics , Grand Ayatollah Hussein - Ali Montazeri has declared three days of mourning for those who have died in street protests .
Grand Ayatollah Montazeri ’s declaration could bring thousands of Tehran residents back out into the streets starting on June 24 .
Meanwhile , the Guardian Council , an unelected state body with election oversight responsibilities , announced June 21 that it had found numerous irregularities connected with the June 12 presidential vote .
A council spokesman , for example , admitted that the number of votes cast in 50 cities throughout the country exceeded the number of registered voters in those locations .
The Guardian Council indicated that there may be as many as 3 million suspect ballots , but stressed the suspected cases of fraud were not such that it could have influenced the outcome of the vote .
[ For background see the Eurasia Insight archive ] .
Ayatollah Khamenei has repeatedly characterized the election as a “ divine assessment ” of Ahmadinejad ’s popularity .
An election analysis released by the London - based Chatham House appeared to confirm that the official results , in which Ahmadinejad was said to have won with nearly two - thirds of the vote , could only have been achieved with massive vote - rigging .
The report was based on voting patterns from previous national elections , and on a 2006 census .
“ In a third of all provinces , the official results would require that Ahmadinejad took not only all former conservative voters , all centrist voters and all new voters , but also up to 44 percent of former reformist voters , despite a decade of conflict between these two groups , ” said the report , which was prepared with the help of the Institute of Iranian Studies at the University of St. Andrews .
The report also used statistical arguments to dispute the notion that Ahmadinejad was popular in rural areas of Iran .
“ That the countryside always votes conservative is a myth , ” the report said .

Lawyers are also arguing about the way in which Mr. Kasab , who is supposed to have no access to newspapers or television , heard about the Pakistani government ’s admission that Pakistani citizens were involved in the attack .
Mr. Kasab said Tuesday that guards outside his cell told him about the development , which prompted him to confess .
The prosecution asked the court to accept into the record a portion of Mr. Kasab ’s admission of guilt on Monday related to the killings at a busy Mumbai train station , where witnesses saw Mr. Kasab and an accomplice mow down dozens of people , but requested that it not admit other aspects of the confession that , it asserts , were filled with “ lies and contradiction . ”
The prosecutor , Ujjwal Nikam , alleged that Mr. Kasab had deliberately played down his role in the attacks to avoid the death penalty and help his Pakistani counterparts who will be tried across the border .
He said any evidence presented in court here could make its way to court there , an argument that Judge Tahilyani discounted .
Later in the hallway , he told reporters that the case would now last for just one more month and that the prosecution would show why Mumbai and foreigners were targeted in the attacks .
He also said he would expose the “ whole infrastructure of the Lashkar - e - Taiba , ” the Pakistani extremist group that India and the United States say masterminded the attacks .
But Mr. Kasab ’s lawyer , S. G. Abbas Kazmi , said that his client had been “ mentally tortured ” by his guards , who told him that the case was now a lost cause for him since Pakistan had given him up and since the police , court and even defense lawyers were Indian .
When the judge asked Mr. Kasab whether that was true , he said that this happened some time ago when he was in police custody , not recently .
Top 5 : Proofs That The Moon Landing Happened
The ultra -competitive space race culminated in a contest between the Soviet Union and the United States , to see which nation would be first to put a man on the moon .
Leaving aside the obvious political leverage of the American success , it was a seminal moment in human history .
Men had long dreamed of reaching the moon , and it represented the culmination of years of research , technological innovation and the spirit of adventure .
While at the time it captured the hearts and minds of the millions of people who watched the live footage , it was , in a way , inevitable that people would seek to diminish the glory of the achievement , perhaps to discredit a government they were disillusioned by .
Is it a coincidence that the first book claiming the moon landings were faked was released in 1974 , the same year that the Watergate scandal did untold damage to the integrity of the Presidential office ?
It is far easier to present the facts as they were and to offer a few of the major arguments that prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the moon landings were genuine , that Neil Armstrong and Edwin " Buzz " Aldrin did , in fact , make the journey of a lifetime and set foot upon the moon .

How to digest this page : ( Hint : Not simply from top to bottom )
If you were to read this page without any additional introduction , from the top , you would doubtless wonder why I was making such a big deal about a " Vitamin . "
So please scroll down toward the bottom , to the BLUE section of links to the many clinical trials and studies I have collected .
BUT PLEASE DO NOT CLICK ON THEM YET .
For now , just read each study 's brief description and its conclusions .
Doing both of these things should give you some sense for why Vitamin D might be significantly more important than you previously suspected .
( And it 's SO INEXPENSIVE and simple to supplement without any risk from increased sun exposure . )
Then come back up here to the top of the page and read from the beginning , knowing a bit more about what 's in store .
And once you get back down to the clinical studies details you 'll have a much better sense for why you 're there and why they probably matter .
And thanks for checking this out !
I hope you 'll be glad you did .
“ Vitamin D ” is in quotes here and above because it is not a vitamin at all — in its active form it is the most powerful steroid hormone in our bodies .
Though it is surprisingly crucial to both our developmental and ongoing health and well being ( as the many clinical studies provided below demonstrate ) , it is present in it 's so - called “ active form ” in concentrations of only 20 to 50 picograms per liter of human blood ( a “ picogram ” is a trillionth of a gram ! )
So just a very tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way !
When human skin is exposed to sufficiently powerful ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation from sunlight , a form of cholesterol contained in our skin ( “ 7 - dehydrocholesterol ” ) is converted into the precursor of Vitamin D , called “ cholecalciferol ” .
This is then converted by our liver into the inactive bulk storage form of vitamin D that blood tests measure ( “ 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ” ) .
Although Vitamin D is present in limited amounts in cod liver oil and some fatty fish ( salmon , mackerel and tuna ) , it is essentially unavailable in metabolically useful quantities from dietary sources .
As we age , our skin gradually loses its youthful cholesterol and its ability to synthesize Vitamin D declines over time .
Although it has not been widely studied , some reports indicate that by the age of 50 , Vitamin D production has fallen to approximately 50 % of its original rate , and by the age of 65 production will have fallen to just 25 % of its original capability .
And independent of age , the skin 's melanin pigmentation — either from natural genetic racial coloration or tanning adaptation — acts to absorb much of the sun 's visible and ultraviolet radiation .
This skin darkening has the beneficial effect of protecting our skin from UV radiation damage , but at the expense of further reducing the skin 's rate and capacity for Vitamin D production .
( Melanin is 99.9 % efficient in absorbing the energy from ultraviolet light , converting it into harmless heat energy . )
“ Vitamin D ” was misnamed when it was first discovered hundreds of years ago , before we knew where it came from or how it was made .
By definition , it is not a “ vitamin ” because vitamins are not produced endogenously ( internally ) , they must be obtained exogenously ( externally ) from dietary food sources .
It seems likely that part of the trouble “ Vitamin D ” has had with capturing
the attention it deserves is due to the fact that , simply by being misnamed a
“ vitamin ” , it has been lumped in with all of the other vitamins and nutrients ,
and thus assumed to be available in sufficient quantity through our diet .
“ Vitamin D ” is n't even a nutrient !
It comes from the sun , not from nutrition .
Vitamin D Science has another problem : Vitamin D is very inexpensive and cannot be patented .
Large and long , many - year double - blind placebo - controlled clinical trials with many participants can easily cost millions of dollars .
But since Vitamin D is technically free ( just go stand in the sun ) or super - inexpensive ( about 2.4 cents per day as a dietary supplement ) , no commercial pharmaceutical company wants to even think about it .
Unlike synthetic chemicals to lower cholesterol , control blood sugar , lower high blood pressure or improve sexual performance , no large pharmaceutical company can make money selling vitamin D .
And as the studies below demonstrate over and over , maintaining adequate levels of Vitamin D throughout a lifetime is both simple and inexpensive .
Prospective study after study shows that Vitamin D is apparently highly effective in preventing many of the health problems that big pharmaceutical firms have invested millions of dollars in developing expensive drugs to cure .
This puts such companies in the admittedly awkward position of not being big fans of health .
Vitamin D inexpensively promotes health .
So only University and some hospital affiliated researchers , with comparatively limited budgets , have any interest in exploring the health benefits of Vitamin D .
And even when they , again and again , demonstrate surprising benefits from maintaining higher levels of vitamin D ... who 's going to market and sell that information ?
Once again , there 's no money in it .
So , once again , although all of these professionally prepared reports and studies are freely available for access , download , and printing on the Internet , the general public never knows about is since there 's no one running expensive prime - time commercials to sell it .
As you read the studies provided below , I predict that you are going to be
amazed and surprised and perhaps finally skeptical .
You 're going to wonder “ if
this is all true , if this could all be true , why does n't the public know about it ? ”
We see expensive commercials every night during prime time for expensive and patented pharmaceuticals that allow older men to urinate more easily and less often , but we never see any similar advertisements mentioning that study after study has shown that simply ( and inexpensively ) maintaining sufficient levels of Vitamin D can work to prevent rickets ( that 's well known ) but also 17 types of cancer including pancreatic , colon / rectal , stomach , prostate , lung , breast , bladder , uterine , espousal , kidney , ovarian , multiple myeloma , non -hodgkin 's lymphoma , and leukemia , lower blood pressure , improve immune system function ( prevents colds and flu ) , autoimmune function , inflammation , multiple sclerosis , autism , allergies , preeclampsia , both type 1 and type 2 diabetes , osteoporosis ( also well known ) depression , muscle and bone weakness and generalized pain .
Looking at that long list of problems above , you may wonder how something , anything , could possibly “ cure ” all of those very different disease conditions .
But that 's thinking about Vitamin D backwards .
Vitamin D does n't “ cure ” anything .
NONE of those things are supposed to go wrong in the first place .
So Vitamin D simply allows our bodies to work the way they were designed to . . . because our bodies were designed to have much more Vitamin D circulating through them than most indoor - living Westerners do today .
The human race evolved , developed and emerged in sub-Saharan equatorial East Africa where , year round without seasons , we received the sunlight we needed everyday for our skin to manufacture all of the Vitamin D hormone we required from our skin 's natural cholesterol .
When we migrated away from the equator , natural selection quickly eliminated most of the melanin pigmentation from our skin in an attempt to compensate for the much weaker levels of UV radiation available for making Vitamin D .
But then we went indoors and have been inadvertently starving our bodies of Vitamin D ever since .
A terrific state - of - the - art Vitamin D summary
After reading the original medical research studies provided below , I wondered what the popular press had to say about Vitamin D . So I purchased a number of inexpensive books to review .
My favorite from among them is this book the “ Vitamin D Prescription ” that I recommend without hesitation .
It very fairly and accurately recaps and summarizes in non-clinical non-medical language , all of the latest original research and findings regarding Vitamin D .
If you were to read all of the fundamental research first , as I have , you would recognize it all in this book , but in much more readily accessible form .
If you would like something more readily digestible , or if you want something for a family member or friend , this might be perfect .

Retail Blood Tests
Unfortunately , purchasing your own blood tests is usually rather expensive .
If you ask your doctor to add a few additional tests ( like serum 25 - hydroxyvitamin D ) to your next regular annual test , insurance will likely pay for the test .
But if you do n't routinely see a doctor , or if for whatever reason you want to obtain your own tests , it 's quite possible to do so .
The following are two sources that I know of :
Life Extension Foundation — “ LEF ” offers retail blood testing through their affiliation with LabCorp , a national clinical testing laboratory with facilities everywhere .
( There are four near me that I had to choose among . )
After purchasing the test (s ) online , you receive a packet send via postal mail or faster ways if you prefer .
That is taken to the lab which draws blood and processes the tests .
The results are electronically returned to LEF who makes them available to you online , by eMail , postal mail or fax ( in any combination ) .
Here 's the link to Life Extension 's Vitamin D ( 25 - hydroxy ) test .
Since it is ( as of this writing ) $ 62.67 for non-members or $ 47.00 for members , with membership costing $ 75 per year , if you think you might be taking multiple tests , as I have been during my experiments , joining to get the lower price pays for itself pretty quickly .
Here 's the link to all of Life Extension 's extensive selection of tests .
Again , since the offer substantial discounts to members , becoming one can reduce the cost of even one expensive blood test .
Grass Root Health —
I recently learned of this site , and their $ 40 " prick your finger at home " Vitamin D blood testing kit .
SO I can't vouch for them in any way , but I wanted to pass on the information in case it might be useful to anyone .
Vitamin D IS HIGHLY TOXIC when ingested in
extremely high doses daily for many months !!!
Our skin 's natural sunlight - driven production of Vitamin D is internally regulated to limit the maximum rate at which Vitamin D can be produced .
It has been estimated that approximately 10,000 to 20,000 IU of Vitamin D is generated by 20 to 30 minutes of full body exposure in direct overhead sunlight .
Beyond that , continued exposure begins to degrade any additional Vitamin D produced to limit its total daily production .
It is , therefore , impossible to overdose on Vitamin D obtained from sunlight , and there is no record that it has ever happened .
But no such limitation exists when high - potency Vitamin D supplements are ingested orally .
Although it is quite difficult to overdose on Vitamin D , YOU MUST TREAT IT WITH RESPECT .
Its value lies in its power , but you want it to improve and not compromise your health .
Follow the labels on supplements , educate yourself about dosages , if at all possible test your blood 's Vitamin D level , check with your doctor , and be responsible .
John Jacob Cannell , M.D. and executive director of the Vitamin D Council has
has the following to say : “ Because synthesis of 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ( the most active metabolite of vitamin D ) is tightly regulated , vitamin D toxicity usually occurs only if excessive doses ( prescription or megavitamin ) are taken .
Vitamin D 1000ug ( 40,000 IU ) / day produces toxicity within 1 to 4 months in infants .
In adults , taking 1250 ug ( 50,000 IU ) / day for several months can produce toxicity . ”

Purchasing Vitamin D Supplements
I have been using the web site “ iHerb.com ” for many years and I recommend them without hesitation .
An advantage for me is that they are located close enough that UPS Ground delivery is overnight , but I would use them if they were on the other side of the moon .
Their service is perfect , their web site works well , and — most importantly — their prices are consistently the lowest anywhere .
5,000 IU “ Now Foods ” Vitamin D3 , 120 capsules for $ 8.80
This is the Vitamin D3 I had chosen for my own use , and it's what I had been recommending to others .
I have since switched to the Vitamin D from “ Healthy Origins ” ( see below ) because it is even less expensive than Now Foods and they are an equally good and trusted supplier .
Because Vitamin D3 ( Cholecalciferol ) is so potent and fat soluble , the capsules are tiny , filled with olive oil , and easy to swallow .
The label instructs to take one 5,000 IU capsule every three days , for an average daily dosage of 5000/ 3 = 1667 IU / day .
Since the 120 capsule bottle costs $ 8.80 , taking one capsule every third day will last one full year , which is impossible to beat for the price .
“ Day skipping ” works well with Vitamin D3 , since after being quickly metabolized by your liver into “ 25 - hydroxy vitamin D ” , that fat soluble metabolite has a half - life of at least three weeks in the body .
So whatever regimen you choose will quickly " average out " to a nice even level in your blood .
Although you should never go “ off label ” to obtain a higher dosage without the advice of a doctor and / or keeping an eye on your important blood levels , especially calcium , this high - potency per capsule does make obtaining higher daily dosages extremely convenient .
You can also get similar quality in reduced dosage and in various capsule counts :

PLEASE remember that Vitamin D can definitely be toxic when taken in large doses over an extended period of time .

A Terrific Vitamin D Video Presentation
One last point about iHerb and Now Foods Vitamin D3 :
While you 're browsing the pages , check out the customer feedback for the 5,000 IU capsules .
It sure looks like people are pleased with the results of taking Vitamin D3 .
( At the time of this writing , the Healthy Origins D3 was too new to have many feedback postings . )

Dr. John Jacob Cannell of the Vitamin D Council
This is the doctor ( MD & Psychiatrist ) who I mentioned during the podcast as working at the Atascadero State Mental Hospital where he had all of the patients on Vitamin D for its beneficial effects on their emotional state .
During that time , an extremely serious influenza ( flu ) outbreak swept the hospital , causing the quarantining of the wards surrounding his on every side . . . while not one of his patients became sick , despite having had ample pre-quarantine contact with the adjoining wards .
Today , everyone in the hospital takes vitamin D. Doctor Cannell is also the founder of The Vitamin D Council and , as you can probably tell from the video , he appears to really know his stuff . . .

In this case , they were examining the relationship , if any , between serum ( blood ) levels of Vitamin D and incidents of cancer and cancer mortality in men .
What they found was that every increase of 25 nmol / L ( that 's 10 ug / mL on the scale most often used ) of serum Vitamin D was associated with a 17 % reduction in total cancer incidence , a 29 % reduction in total cancer mortality , and a 45 % reduction in digestive - system cancer mortality .
The study concluded , in addition to the above , that the Vitamin D supplementation required to achieve a 25 nmol / L ( 10 mg / mL ) increment in Vitamin D serum levels was approximately 1500 IU / day .

The New Haven Independent has a complete report on the ugliness that emerged from last weekend 's march by an immigrant - rights group marching in the suburb of East Haven , Conn . :
The clash happened during an event organized Saturday by New Haven immigrant advocacy organization Unidad Latina En Accion .
More than 100 people marched through the streets of East Haven on Saturday , protesting alleged racial profiling on the part of East Haven police .
They met groups of counter - protesters along the way , including a visiting band of white supremacists .
...
Two arrests were made following a brief fistfight between a female marcher , Jessica Maldonado of East Haven , and Chelsea Fiorentino , an 18 year - old New Haven woman who was standing with a counter protest made up of members of two white pride organizations .
Maldonado ’s father , Dimas Maldonado , said that his family has suffered from police harassment .
( Click on the play arrow to watch the fight and arrests . )
The argument allegedly started after Chelsea Fiorentino yelled an insult at Maldonado , who then crossed the street and confronted her .
East Haven police quickly separated the women , placed them under arrest , and kept the march moving .
The women were charged with breach of peace and assault ; Maldonado was also charged with interfering with an officer .
It appears , from watching the video compiled by the Independent , that there were other near - brawls along the way .
That 's not terribly surprising :
White supremacists and other haters turn out to these things in the hopes of starting fights , and they often succeed .
But watching this tape , one can't help but feel a sense of foreboding about what 's likely to occur when immigration reform comes up on the national plate this fall .
These people are already organized and already inclined to violence .
If you thought the town - hall teabaggers went nuts over health - care reform , just wait .

Williams left the field with fake blood pouring from his mouth against Leinster
Ex -Harlequins director of rugby Dean Richards has been banned from coaching in European competition for three years for his role in the fake blood injury .
Tom Williams faked injury to allow fly - half Nick Evans to return to the field in a Heineken Cup tie against Leinster .
Winger Williams 's initial 12 - month ban has now been reduced to four months .
Quins ' fine was increased to £ 259,000 but European Rugby Cup ( ERC ) stopped short of the ultimate sanction of throwing them out of this year 's Cup .
The original fine of 250,000 euros ( £ 206,000 ) had been half suspended , but the new amount is payable in full .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
However , Harlequins will be relieved not to have been thrown out of this season 's Heineken Cup , which might have cost them 15 % of their annual revenue .
Physiotherapist Steph Brennan was handed a two - year ban after an admission of guilt , but the appeal committee dismissed the charge against Dr Wendy Chapman from the club 's medical staff .
Former England forward Richards , who resigned from his position as director of rugby at Quins last weekend , was also found to have been involved in four similar incidents , hence the severity of his punishment .
Reacting to his ban , Richards said : " I 'm surprised .
Three years is a long time but I 'll reflect on it overnight .
" I took full responsibility for it .
It was a farcical situation , it really was .
" It did n't pan out particularly well on the day .
Everybody looked at it and thought , ' That 's unreal ' , which is what I thought on the touchline as well .
" But I had to hold my hands up . "
The cover - up is thought to have involved Williams ' face being deliberately cut after the Leinster match to hide the fact he had used a fake blood capsule .
Richards said : " I have no knowledge of that .
I was n't party to anything going on there .
I took full responsibility for it .
It was a farcical situation , it really was
Dean Richards
" I 'm not aware that it did happen .
I know that he had a cut but I do n't know how it came about because I was n't in the room . "
Richards had not decided whether to appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport .
He said : " I 'm a little bit shocked , a little bit surprised by it all .
" It seems a little bit disproportionate but , at the end of the day , I 'll reflect on it overnight and obviously see where my thoughts are in the morning . "
Reading a statement , Williams said : " I sincerely regret the role that I 've played in this unacceptable incident that has done so much damage to the image of rugby union .
" I let down my team - mates and the club 's fans , and I 'll have to live with those actions for the rest of my career .
" In deciding to come clean and do the right thing , I 've tried honestly to rectify this mess and repay the good faith shown in me by my friends and family .
" I would like to thank the ERC disciplinary panel for their decision to reduce my sanction and I am relieved that they did this .
Richards resigned earlier this month after four seasons with Quins " However , I also realise the grave error of judgment that I have made . "
He added : " I hope that , as a result of this episode , no player or employee will ever be put in such a compromised position , and if they are then they will always tell the truth , as I had wished I had done from the outset . "
The Professional Rugby Players ' Association welcomed the decision to reduce the ban handed down to Williams .
" We are grateful to the ERC disciplinary panel that Tom 's ban has been reduced on appeal , but the aftermath of this episode has left an indelible stigma on the professional game , " said PRA chief executive Damian Hopley .
" Tom is a fine young man of good character , even though he is guilty of a serious error of judgement , albeit under instruction from his employer .
" He has been under tremendous pressure since the original incident in April , but his determination to tell the truth and attempt to undo the damage done to himself , his family and the image of the game speaks volumes for the enormous remorse he feels . "
The sanction on Richards applies to ERC - organised tournaments , though the ERC will request it is extended to become a worldwide ban .
The decision , which cannot be appealed against , was made by an independent ERC disciplinary committee in Glasgow late on Monday .
A statement on the club 's website said : " Whilst the club are pleased that Tom Williams ' ban has been reduced , we feel this is a very significant penalty in terms of fine .
I also realise the grave error of judgment that I have made
Tom Williams
" We will now continue with our internal review into all aspects of the business to ensure that we have the most stringent compliance and robust policies and processes in place throughout the club and work towards rebuilding our reputation on and off the field .
" We hope that the club can now draw a line under what has been a difficult few months , learn from it and move on . "
Evans had departed injured in the 47th minute of the 6 - 5 defeat by Leinster before his replacement at number 10 , Chris Malone , also went off injured later in the second half .
With time running out , Williams was seen with what appeared to be blood coming out of his mouth , which meant he could go off to be replaced by specialist kicker Evans .
Evans missed a drop goal as the Irish side held out for the win before going on to win the Heineken Cup .
Television pictures appeared to show Williams winking at the bench as he went off .
Leinster were incensed and their club doctor , Professor Arthur Tanner , followed Williams down the tunnel but was prevented from entering the treatment room .

NEWARK -- Federal authorities arrested dozens of people today in New York and New Jersey as part of a money laundering and corruption sweep .
Those arrested included several New Jersey public officials and rabbis .
The suspects are scheduled to appear in U.S. District Court in Newark later today .
Those arrested include Assembly Daniel Van Pelt ( R - Ocean ) , Hoboken Mayor Peter Cammarano , Secaucus Mayor Dennis Elwell and Jersey City Deputy Mayor Leona Beldini , and Jersey City Council President Mariano Vega .
Nearly 20 people , including Cammarano , Elwell , and Vega , have already been led into the FBI building in Newark to face the charges .
Elwell , 64 , and his council slate recently won victory in their contested Democratic June primary contests .
Elwell garnered 56 percent of the vote in his contest against town attorney Peter Weiner .
They were handing out the photocopies by the thousand under the plane trees in the centre of the boulevard , single sheets of paper grabbed by the opposition supporters who are now wearing black for the 15 Iranians who have been killed in Tehran – who knows how many more in the rest of the country ?
– since the election results gave Mahmoud Ahmadinejad more than 24 million votes and a return to the presidency .
But for the tens of thousands marking their fifth day of protests yesterday – and for their election campaign hero , Mirhossein Mousavi , who officially picked up just 13 million votes – those photocopies were irradiated .
For the photocopy appeared to be a genuine but confidential letter from the Iranian minister of interior , Sadeq Mahsuli , to Iran 's Supreme Leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , written on Saturday 13 June , the day after the elections , and giving both Mr Mousavi and his ally , Mehdi Karroubi , big majorities in the final results .
In a highly sophisticated society like Iran , forgery is as efficient as anywhere in the West and there are reasons for both distrusting and believing this document .
But it divides the final vote between Mr Mousavi and Mr Karroubi in such a way that it would have forced a second run-off vote – scarcely something Mousavi 's camp would have wanted .
Headed " For the Attention of the Supreme Leader " it notes " your concerns for the 10th presidential elections " and " and your orders for Mr Ahmadinejad to be elected president " , and continues " for your information only , I am telling you the actual results " .
Mr Mousavi has 19,075,623 , Mr Karroubi 13,387,104 , and Mr Ahmadinejad a mere 5,698,417 .

Could this letter be a fake ?
Even if Mr Mousavi won so many votes , could the colourless Mr Karroubi have followed only six million votes behind him ?
And however incredible Mr Ahmadinejad 's officially declared 63 per cent of the vote may have been , could he really – as a man who has immense support among the poor of Iran – have picked up only five - and - a - half million votes ?
And would a letter of such immense importance be signed only " on behalf of the minister " ?
The letter may well join the thousands of documents , real and forged , that have shaped Iran 's recent history , the most memorable of which were the Irish passports upon which Messers Robert McFarlane and Oliver North travelled to Iran on behalf of the US government in 1986 to offer missiles for hostages .
The passports were real – and stolen – but the identities written onto the document were fake .
Mr Ahmadinejad 's loyalists will undoubtedly blame " foreigners " for the " letter " to Ayatollah Khamenei .
But its electrifying effect on the Mousavi camp will only help to transform suspicion into the absolute conviction that their leader was quite deliberately deprived of the presidency .
Marjane Satrapi , the acclaimed author and the Oscar - winning director of the black and white cartoon Persepolis , was in Brussels brandishing the same document .
In Tehran , there must have been five or six thousand Iranians wearing black , many of them carrying this toxic document in their hands , although they were far fewer than Monday 's million - strong march and scarcely a fifth of their number reached Azadi Square from the centre of Tehran .
Their enthusiasm to maintain their protest – led yesterday by a cavalry of a hundred or more motorbike riders – was cruelly treated by the organisers , who clearly had little idea whether they were supposed to direct them to a central venue or all the way out to Azadi .
At times , they stood in the heat for more than a quarter of an hour while organisers argued about the route .
This was no way to overthrow a government .
What was significant , however , was that once more the security authorities chose not to confront the Mousavi demonstrators .
Military conscripts wearing bright yellow jackets and standing with their hands clasped behind their back – rather than holding batons – lined the first mile of the road but then abandoned the marchers to their own devices .
This followed less than 24 hours after the frightening confrontation between up to 20,000 Mousavi and Ahmadinejad supporters at Vanak Square on Tuesday night when Iranian special forces paramilitary police protected Mr Mousavi 's men and women from the government " Basiji " militia .
Although some civilians were later hurt in fist - fights on the street , the government cops brought in reinforcements and prevented the Basiji and thousands of other Ahmadinejad supporters from entering north Tehran .
Mousavi was clearly behind yesterday 's half - hearted march , for he issued a statement to the participants , condemning those who killed seven men in the dormitories at Tehran University on Sunday night " and beat boy and girl students and killed people in Azadi Square " .
He sympathised , he said , with these " martyrs " and urged all Iranians to send their condolences to the families of those who had been killed .
The highly dubious election results , however , are arousing concern far outside Mr Mousavi 's millions of voters .
Fifty - two MPs have asked the interior minister why he could not prevent the post-election intimidation and violence .
Parliament has asked for a fact - finding investigation into the vandalisation of Tehran University property .
Ali -Akbar Mohtashemi , a member of the Combatant Clerics Assembly – an important figure who founded the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and sent them to Lebanon when he was Iran 's ambassador to Damascus – has demanded a committee to investigate the election results , made up of senior clerics , MPs , members of the judiciary , the Council of Guardians and an official of the interior ministry .
But suppression of the free speech which Mr Mousavi 's loyalists demand so insistently continues .
Yesterday morning , a 26 - year - old student doing his doctorate at Oxford , Mohamed Reza Jaleopour , son of a professor at Tehran University , was arrested without charge at Tehran airport .
The pro-Mousavi paper Green Word was again closed down .
As for Mr Mousavi , it seems that , once broken , the " mind - forged manacles of fear " are difficult to re-attach .
But revolutionary governments are tough , steely creatures with sharp claws , and the Ahmadinejad regime is not about to collapse .
Interior Ministry 's letter to the Supreme Leader
Salaam Aleikum .
Regarding your concerns for the 10th presidential elections and due to your orders for Mr Ahmedinejad to be elected President , in this sensitive time , all matters have been organised in such a way that the results of the election will be in line with the revolution and the Islamic system .
The following result will be declared to the people and all planning should be put in force to prevent any possible action from the opposition , and all party leaders and election candidates are under intense surveillance .
Therefore , for your information only , I am telling you the actual results as follows :
Mirhossein Mousavi : 19,075,623
Mehdi Karroubi : 13,387,104
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad : 5,698,417
Mohsen Rezai : 38,716

Day 5 of Iran crisis
Political football
Iran 's World Cup qualifier against South Korea in Seoul yesterday took on a decidedly political flavour .
At least five of the Iranian team sported green bands around their arms or wrists – the signature accessory of Mousavi supporters back on the streets of Tehran – in an apparent protest against the disputed election back home .
But after half - time , some had removed the impromptu additions to their kit , prompting speculation they had been ordered to do so by their coach .
The captain Mehdi Mahdavikia seemed to defy the team edict , much to the delight of fans waving banners with the plea " Free Iran " and chanting " Go to Hell Dictator " .
The game ended 1 - 1 .
Ambassadors berated
Diplomatic relations frayed as the government summoned an ensemble of Western ambassadors to complain about interference .
According to Iranian state TV , Tehran accused Washington of " intolerable " meddling in its internal affairs , the first time it has blamed the US for playing a role in the post-election turmoil .
Barack Obama took pains to note there was little difference between Ahmadinejad and Mousavi .
" Either way we are going to be dealing with an Iranian regime that has historically been hostile to the United States , " he said .
Britain 's ambassador was berated for the recent comments of Gordon Brown and David Miliband , as well as the BBC 's news coverage of the crisis .
France , Germany and Italy were also given a talking to .
Missing persons
The International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran reported that scores of notable figures had been arrested and their whereabouts unknown .
These included Saeed Hajarian – a one - time adviser to the reformist president Mohammed Khatami – who sustained brain and spinal injuries in a failed assassination attempt nine years ago , and as such needs constant medical attention .
Also arrested was Mohammad Ali Abtahi , a senior adviser to Mehdi Karroubi who came in third in Friday 's presidential election , according to the official results .
Mohamed Reza Jaleopour , the son of a reformist university professor , was also detained at Tehran airport as he prepared to fly to England where he is studying for a PhD at Oxford University .
Regime splits
It emerged that the daughter of Hashemi Rafsanjani , the head of the influential Assembly of Experts that has the right to dismiss the Supreme Leader , had attended Tuesday 's opposition rally .
Faezeh Rafsanjani's public display of support for Mousavi , in defiance of a ban on unauthorised marches from the interior ministry , was widely interpreted as another sign of high - level rifts in the Islamic Republic .
Meanwhile Mousavi has declared today a day of mourning , urging Iranians to come together in mosques or congregate peacefully on the streets .
" A number of our countrymen were wounded or martyred , " he said on his website .
" I ask the people to express their solidarity with the families . "
Bloggers threatened
Iran 's Revolutionary Guards , the country 's most powerful military force , made its first pronouncement on the post- election crisis , warning that the country 's bloggers must remove any materials that " create tension " or face legal action .
It marked another escalation of the information crackdown .
But graphic images and detailed updates continued to leak out over sites such as Twitter , although the traffic directly from Iran appeared fractionally lighter than in previous days .

Times are tough and even the extremely resilient field of information security is suffering .
There are plenty of articles covering the small things that you can do to enhance your resume and make yourself stand out from the field .
These articles list tips from creating a presence on LinkedIn to adding new professional certifications , and more .
Those who are desperate for a job will often load on these recommendations .
One thing that some people have done is to get their names in a Who 's Who directory .
Unfortunately , the world of who's who is a free - for - all in which I found there are few winners and countless losers .
Something told me that while not based in Nigeria , this was a scam .
It had all the makings of a classic rip - off scheme : from the various remailers and spam - type email addresses , to the variants of the names used , and more .
Some of the messages were addressed to Dear , and others Dear Business Professional .
But not a single one had anything that would indicate it was meant specifically for me .
Note the similar generic email from Emerald Who 's Who .
The email had the subject line with a typical sense of urgency of Third Attempt , you may still qualify for inclusion into the Who 's Who .
I do n't recollect getting any of their previous email , likely due to the good spam filters in place .
Google " who 's who " and there are nearly 23 million hits .
Who 's
Who itself refers to a reference book , generally containing biographical information about the persons included .
It is important to note that the term Who 's Who is in the public domain and is not a copyrighted term .
Anyone can create their own Who 's Who directory -- which explains why there are myriad variants of who's who books , and which also makes it an area ripe for scammers .
In fact , you can spend all day reading about who 's who scams at Ripoff Report .
Most Who's
Who publications are simply vanity publications , where the inclusion criterion is the person 's willingness to buy the book , with the business model consisting of selling books directly to the people who are included .
Most people who pay to get their bio in a who's who are generally so enamored by the seeming honor to be included , that they fail to do the most basic due diligence about the offer .
This fact , combined with their high - pressure tactics and the threat of an imminent deadline used by the telemarketers , creates a perfect storm for a scam .
When I got yet another email from Heritage Who 's Who , in the spirit of accomplishment , I filled out the form .
Two days later I got a call from Matt at Heritage who said he had a few questions about my application .
Within a few minutes , Matt told me that he was proud to be able to congratulate me and that I was suitable to gain entry into the Heritage registry .
After a few subtleties , this is where the monkey business started .
Matt tried to sell me the Platinum Executive program , consisting primarily of 2 wall plaques , the handsome leather - bound journal and 3 press releases at a cost of $ 699.00 .
Seeing I was not interested , he suggested the gold program , same as the platinum , except 1 wall plaque for $ 499.00 .
Seeing I was not about to go for that , Matt suggested the wall plaque alone for but $ 199.00 , which he said I could proudly show to friends and colleagues .
As I contemplated the offer , Matt told me that Heritage is published in every university and that they are the only legitimate who 's who .
In fact , Matt told me that as part of the membership , they will send me 3 press releases to send out to newspapers to announce my prestigious entry into the Heritage Who 's Who .
Matt stated that no other who's who could get my inclusion in a newspaper .
" Like the New York Times ? " I asked ; no he responded , " your local community newspaper " .
Anyone who thinks these press releases will do anything for them is deluding themselves .
The fact that anyone would send them to a newspaper , or would proudly announce it on their web page or Facebook profile , is a good indicator that you are dealing with a gullible person .
That pesky Library of Congress deadline
Finally , knowing he was running out of options , Matt told me that the entry deadline that was quickly approaching and that I would need to make an immediate decision since they needed to get their edition to the Library of Congress in time .
The Library of Congress has no such deadlines , and while I squandered my opportunity to get in the Heritage Who 's Who , and find immortality in the Library of Congress , others fall for these somewhat deceptive practices .
Since the term who's who is not protected by copyright law , anyone can create their own edition .
This leads to many Who's
Who directories that only serve to sell memberships to the group .
They simply get a reference guide to others who were silly enough to part with their money .
For a good overview of this scam , Victoria Strauss has a good write - up in Beware Who 's Who Schemes .
I searched hard for anyone who had positive things to say about Who 's Who .
I posted on Twitter and Linked In asking people to contact me they had anything positive to say .
A number of people , including a few with thousands of followers retweeted my request .
I did not get a single reply with anything positive to say .
With that , I emailed a sampling of Heritage VIP Members asking them if they found any value with being in the registry .
Of the sample , 31 % of the emails bounced .
Of the remaining , I received only negative replies .
When asked if there was value in being listed , the director of a non -profit agency told me " absolutely not " and that he found that " anyone qualifies as long as you pay the fee for the book and plaque which no one looks at except for someone like you doing some research " .
I asked him if I could quote him by name , to which he replied " I 'd rather not as I am embarrassed for falling for this nonsense knowing all along that it is worthless .
But then one day , I just had a weak day and said to myself , why not see if anything good actually comes from this , even one or two good contacts would be worth the investment " .
All he had to show for his money and efforts was a dusty plaque and a canceled check .
Other direct replies from Heritage VIP Members include :
" Never really found any benefit from it .
Do n't have any idea if they really do try to generate any business .
I have never had anyone , but you , even comment that they had seen me in the publication . "
" I personally do not believe the return on investment is worth the effort .
I subscribed once , but will not again .
I also suspect that there is an angle to get people to part with their money with minimal return from the company . "
" I signed up but have never used it .
I am not sure of its value one way or the other .
And no one else has ever contacted me with anything about it before . "
" Their initial call caught me off guard under high pressure , now - or - never salesmanship , I allowed myself to be talked into something not worth the cost , something I have kicked myself for ever since .
Only after considering it all later , did I realize their appeal is simply to one 's ego and pride .
They stress the importance of their publication as being an asset to one 's business , that people will use it to check someone out and find them totally reliable - how else could they be in who 's who ?!
However , the book they publish has no real value at all .
It is not readily available to anyone , except possibly a copy in a public library .
Furthermore , their publication of the book that I was in came out two years after I was told it would be published .
Over that time , my phone calls and emails for information went unanswered .
Since publication , I have been harassed about purchasing deluxe copies , etc. , even though on the first such solicitation , I told them I had no further interest in their product .
That has not deterred them from calling several times . "
Ironic to think that all of these comments are from Heritage VIP Members .
But on the other side , it often shows that references are valuable , in that they will tell you the truth .
On that note , when you do list a reference in your job search , make sure the people are going to say nice things about you .
As to the networking capabilities of Heritage and other who's who plans , they clearly do not match the networking potential of sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook .
This is true both from the very limited search capabilities , to the minimal amount of members .
So how really selective is Heritage ?
Based on my call and that of a few friends and the responses I got from the VIP members , they accept everyone .
The simply want the person 's money and they seemingly wo n't let lack of credential get in the way .
In fact , they seem to do no verification of employment or education .
When a friend spoke with Gene at Heritage , the fact that he made up an employer , and said that he had a PhD in engineering from a school that has no engineering program , did nothing to preclude his admittance into Heritage 's registry .
And this is the press release that can be sent to your community newspaper : Perhaps when Mr. Dortch is paroled in 50 years he can make use of the press release .
Unfortunately , since he is currently in the SHU ( Secure Housing Unit ) at Pelican Bay , his isolation from the other prisoners really makes this press release even of less value .
As to references , the Heritage reference page is nothing more than receipts .
There are references for Brigham Young University , Brown University Library , and many others .
Yet if one clicks on any of the 9 links , they are not references , only IRS required receipts noting that the gift was received by the university .
There is absolutely no indication that is was requested or used .
It seems as if Heritage on their own accord mailed the universities free copies of their registry .
Heritage also failed to do a spell check on their references page as they have Northwestern misspelled as NorthWestern , and Wisconsin as Winsconsin .
One last note to the friendly people at Heritage , since when does one network with a dead person ?
Ms. Sentak died a few years ago , yet she is listed as a VIP member .
Is there a need for directories in the age of social networks ?
Heritage and other who's who are utterly obsolete in the era of social networks .
LinkedIn with over 43 million members shines in comparison with Heritage , which claims to have 20,000 members .
Look at it this way :
In the past 6 months , how many people have invited you to , or said they find value with , Facebook or Twitter ?
And in the past 10 years , how many people have told you of the value they get from using a who 's who ?
Even if Heritage were free , it is still of dubious value .
Its extremely small user base , combined with limited functionality , make the Who 's Who into a big Why .
Noted attorney and legal blogger Ron Coleman notes that he has always agreed to provide his profile to the Marquis Who 's Who publications , because he is pretty confident that they are the " original who 's who " .
But he also notes that he has never bought the publication , and can hardly imagine why he or anyone would .
As a who , Ron observed that he naturally knows lots of other whos .
He comments that this has always been the case , but in the social networking era , it is absolutely more so .
Conclusion
Security professionals looking to better themselves with find greater value availing themselves of the data and contacts at sites such as the SANS Institute rather than throwing their money away for entry in a who 's who listing .
Most of the who's who organizations are in it for the money with zero concern for to so - called honorees .
Organizations such as the Heritage Who's
Who make grandiose claims in which the recipients have very little to show for it .
It is incredulous that they would showcase the deceased and invite hardcore criminals into their fold .
Security professionals looking to advance themselves will find no value in having their names in a who 's who , and could in fact be showing their ignorance by promoting their inclusion .

In Meat Wagon , we round up the latest outrages from the meat and livestock industries .
Remember a couple of weeks ago , when news emerged that a Colorado grocery chain had churned out 466,000 pounds of beef tainted with antibiotic - resistant salmonella , sent it out to six states , and then voluntarily recalled it –but not until weeks after several people had fallen violently ill from it ?
Well , they must be having some kind of competition out west , because now a California outfit called Beef Packers , owned by Cargill , the globe ’s biggest agribusiness concern , has issued an even bigger recall of beef tainted with antibiotic - resistant salmonella–this one involving 825,769 pounds circulating in Arizona , California , Colorado , and Utah .
Now , it ’s Meat Wagon tradition to convert such abstract - seeming figures into what we like to call Quarter Pounder Equivalents ( QPEs ) .
We already established that the first recall involved enough suspect beef for McDonald ’s to crank out approximately 1.86 million Quarter Pounders .
According to our proprietary mathematical models , the current recall ’s QPE is 3.3 million .
Combining the two recalls , there ’s enough dodgy beef out there to serve everyone in Los Angeles a Quarter Pounder –with more than a million left over for suburbanites !
But this is really no laughing matter .
Here is how USDA descibes the situation in its press release :
This particular strain of Salmonella Newport is resistant to many commonly prescribed drugs , which can increase the risk of hospitalization or possible treatment failure in infected individuals .
Just to be clear , “ treatment failure ” means , uh , death .
In my post on the earlier recall , I discussed the mounting problem of antibiotic resistance .
Something like 70 percent of antibiotics consumed in the United States end up on factory animal farms , to keep animals alive and growing amid cramped , fiithy conditions that destroy their immune systems .
There ’s a bill floating around the House that restrict prophylactic applications of antibiotics on farms ; but as the NYT recently put it , “ The farm [ read : agribusiness ] lobby ’s opposition makes its [ the bill ’s ] passage unlikely . ”
Obama ’s FDA has come out in support of restricting antibiotics on livestock farms–but the FDA has little or no authority over livestock feed practices .
That task falls to the USDA ’s Food Safery and Inspection Service ( FSIS ) , which regulates safety issues for the meat and egg industries .
At Obama FoodoRama , Eddie Gehman Kohan ( who alerted me to the current recall with a Twitter post ) reminds us that the USDA does not have the authority to impose recalls .
This one , like all other meat recalls , is voluntary .
Thus “ No restaurant , market , etc. is required to turn in their product , or pull it from their shelves , ” she writes .
Meanwhile , the Obama administration still has n’t named an FSIS director –the post has been vacant for months .
Last I heard , a Pennsylvania Big Dairy man with no food - safety experience was being seriously considered for the post .
Let ’s hope the administration finds someone willing to stand up to the meat industry instead .
Whoever takes the job , he or she will certainly be dealing a lot with Cargill , owner of the plant responsible for the latest recall .
Cargill is a vast agribusiness comglomerate ; it ’s largest U.S. grain trader and the majority owner of Mosaic , one if the globe ’s biggest fertilizer prodcuers .
As for meat and egg production , here ’s how Wikipedia describes it .
[ Cargill ] supplies approximately 22 percent of the United States domestic meat market , exporting more product from Argentina than any other company and is the largest poultry producer in Thailand .
All of the eggs used in McDonald ’s restaurants in the United States pass through Cargill ’s plants .
A prehistoric runway for flying pterosaurs has been discovered for the first time .
Scientists uncovered the first known landing tracks of one of these extinct flying reptiles at a site dubbed " Pterosaur Beach , " in the fine - grained limestone deposits of an ancient lagoon in southwestern France dating back some 140 million years ago to the Late Jurassic .
The footprints suggest the pterosaur — a " pterodactyloid " with a wingspan roughly three feet wide ( one meter ) — flapped to stall its flight during landing , and then planted both its two - inch - long feet ( five cm ) simultaneously at a high angle .
The reptile next dragged its toes briefly , took a short " stutter step " — perhaps a hop with both feet — and landed , settling its hands .
It finally adjusted its posture and ambled off normally on all fours .
" No other trackways ascribed to pterosaurs in the world have shown either landings or takeoffs , " said researcher Kevin Padian , a paleontologist at the University of California at Berkeley .
Pterosaurs , like birds , " were very light animals , and did n't tend to leave as many tracks when compared to , say , a 50 - ton sauropod , " the largest dinosaurs to ever stride the earth , explained paleontologist David Hone at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology of China in Beijing , who did not participate in this study .
" If tracks from pterosaurs are going to get preserved , it 's likely to be in the softest muds or finest sands , and it 's unlikely even then , so to get traces of a pterosaur landing like this is very exciting , " Hone noted .
He added the case the researchers make for the way the pterosaurs landed " is very strong and convincing . "
The fact this pterosaur had the capability to stall during flight implies sophisticated flapping control of the wings , Padian said .
Future research will hopefully uncover tracks made during takeoff , shedding further light on how these extinct creatures once flew .
" There are hundreds of trackways in this big quarry , " Padian said .

An experiment currently underway in Greenland is trying to learn about the effect of glaciers on bedrock .
This project has been organised and funded by global nuclear power companies who are planning to create a final storage facility for their radioactive nuclear waste hundreds of metres underground in bedrock caverns .
SIKUnews reports that Posiva Oy is Finland ’s sponsor in the project .
The nuclear power company has already begun work on its subterranean waste repository at Olkiluoto .
This final destination for radioactive waste will hopefully be able to safely overcome any natural challenges to the site over the next 100,000 years .
The company hopes to have it ready for operation by 2020 .
Climate experts are predicting that Earth ’s next Ice Age could begin in Finland around 6,000 years from now .
The experiment in Greenland is testing the effects of melting water from glaciers on the underlying bedrock .
Professor Matti Saarnisto , the former director of research for the Geological Survey of Finland , is one of the most critical voices of the planned storage facility at Olkiluoto .
He claims the planners have greatly underestimated the effects of permafrost melting on the underground site .
“ Permafrost will cause massive variations in pressure around the nuclear waste repository , and that contains the seeds of disaster , ” Saarnisto told YLE .
“ The matter of fact is that to some extent all of the research institutes involved are suffering from a hostage syndrome .
They see it as essential that spent fuel be disposed of at Olkiluoto , because it has been planned that way for decades .
There is no scientific basis for it , ” says Saarnisto .
However , Posiva
Oy feels the study in Greenland will prove that any future Ice Age will not pose a threat to the disposal facility at Olkiluoto .

Apple , it seems , is all about the hits .
The iPod , the iPhone and the MacBook are all phenomenally successful , both as designs and as commercial wins .
These highlights , though , lead us to expect a lot of the company , and serve to make the misses stick out all the more .
Apple has some embarrassing techno- skeletons in its beautiful white iCloset .
Here are five .
The Hockey Puck Mouse
For a company that built itself on the first commercial , mouse - equipped computer , it ’s odd that Apple has never made a good mouse .
Even the current Mighty Mouse is n’t so mighty , pretending as it does to have just one button while actually sporting two , and inexplicably copying the ThinkPad ’s red nipple instead of using a scroll wheel .
But the prize for Worst Mouse Ever goes the the “ hockey puck ” , which shipped with the original iMacs in 1998 .
Not only was it ugly , it was hard to hold due to size and shape , and frustrated users with a too - short cord .
Rarely for Apple , style not only triumphed over substance , it utterly buried it .
The iPod Hi-Fi
Apple ’s $ 350 speaker lasted just 18 months before it was taken out back , shot and sprinkled with lime .
It was an odd product from Apple , which normally leaves these kinds of accessories to a healthy third - party market .
The Bose - designed box had stereo speakers and an iPod dock on the top , and the high price tag and poor performance meant market failure .
Earbuds
Just like the lack of a good mouse , the dearth of decent headphones from Apple is another paradox .
The sound quality may be comparable to or even better than the bundled ‘ buds from other manufacturers , but they ’ll break , and the $ 30 Apple wants for a new pair is better spent almost anywhere else .
I have gone through a lot of them , and the longest any set lasted was a few months .
This includes the latest , remote and microphone - toting model , which managed to last about six weeks before dying .
QuickTake
Long before Apple put a terrible camera in the iPhone , it put a terrible camera into a camera : The 0.3 - megapixel ( 640 x 480 ) Apple QuickTake .
The camera had no way to focus , and zooming was done by walking closer to your subject .
Neither could you blast away like we do with the digicams of today :
The QuickTake 100 , built by Kodak , could fit just eight pictures into its 1 - MB memory .
The problem was that the market was immature , and the QuickTake was one of the first consumer digicams on the market .
Compare this to the successful strategy of Apple since the iPod : Wait until the market has been established , then make a simpler , better product than anyone else .

iTunes
It started so well back in 2001 .
Apple ’s jukebox software was built on the third - party SoundJam which it bought the year before , and was a slick , quick and easy - to - use music player for a long time .
Then Apple decided that iTunes should be the conduit for the iPhone , and kept piling on bloated features .
What had started as a pared - down , single - minded and simple application started to sync with Outlook , gained the useless cover flow view and , on the Mac at least , appeared to have a monopoly on the spinning beach - ball of death .
Worse , the iTunes Store , a fantastically user - friendly music store , gained weight in the form of the awful , hard to navigate App Store .
Of course , these days we have a new , simple and fast music app .
It ’s called Spotify .
Apple , though , has shafted itself .
The problem with selling a revolutionary device which is an iPod , a cellphone and an internet device , all in one , is that the software to support it needs to be similarly multitasking .
Anything we missed ?
While these failures are big , we have restricted them to the modern - day Apple , and ignored the Jobs - less wilderness years of beige boxes and overpriced printers .

THE GERMAN CROSSING OF THE DNIEPER IN THE KREMENCHUG AREA ( KIEV OPERATION )
INTRODUCTION
1. GERMAN FAILURE BEFORE MOSCOW AND KIEV , AND PLANS FOR KIEV ENCIRCLEMENT .
August 1941 saw the German Center Group of Armies under von Bock halted in front of Moscow , and the South Group of Armies under von Rundstedt halted in front of Kiev ( see map at page 42 ) .
There was now no chance for a quick seizure of the capital and a drive by armored spearheads to other strategically important parts of the country as had been the case in France .
Plans were shifted to achieve a gigantic double encirclement , which would aim at the capture of the great Ukranian city of Kiev and the destruction of Budenny 's armies .
The salient between the Desna and the Dnieper , with Kiev at its apex , was to be cut off in a wedge - and - trap operation .
The holding attack would be made by the forces which were already in position in front of Kiev .
The northern wedge of the encirclement maneuver would have to be driven across the Desna northwest of Konotov , and the southern wedge across the Dnieper below Kremenchug .
As preliminaries to the main operation , Uman to the south of the proposed salient and Gomel to the north would have to be taken in order that German troops might advance to the Desna and the Dnieper .
2. IN THE SOUTH -- THE UMAN OPERATION .
While the Sixth Army under von Reichenau was halted in front of Kiev , the German armies in the south had been moving forward in conjunction with Hungarian and Rumanian troops .
Von Stuelpnegel 's Seventeenth Army and von Kleist 's First Panzer Army crossed the Bug west of Uman .
They helped von Schobert ( who had crossed the Bug further south ) in the encirclement of Uman and then occupied the right bank of the Dnieper River .
3. IN THE NORTH -- THE GOMEL OPERATION .
Von Bock kept up the feint of striking toward Moscow , but shifted to the south the Second Panzer Army of Guderian and the Second Army of von Weichs .
These armies encircled Gomel , which fell on August 19 , and moved toward their new assembly areas .
Guderian reached the Desna near Novogorod on August 30 and immediately established a bridgehead on the south bank .
The advance of the von Weichs and Guderian armies toward the Desna also relieved Russian pressure on German forces ( von Reichenau 's army ) west of Kiev .
4. THE SITUATION .
Thus , toward the end of August 1941 , the situation was as follows : in front of Kiev the strong army of von Reichenau was in position to launch a holding attack ; the von Weichs and Guderian armies some 125 miles to the northeast , and the von Stuelpnegel and von Kleist armies some 190 miles to the southeast , were the potential wedges for encirclement of the Kiev area .
But the maneuver could not be begun , much less completed , until a German bridgehead was established east of the Dnieper .
The crossing of this broad and deep river , the third largest in Europe , would have to be attempted in the vicinity of Kremenchug .
The operation was entrusted to the Seventeenth Army under von Stuelpnegel , but , according to German custom , the specially created task force was composed of units deemed to be best qualified , irrespective of the command to which they belonged .

THE OPERATION
5. SELECTION OF A CROSSING POINT .
The general considerations which influenced the German choice of a point for this difficult operation can be seen by reference to the map ( see map at end of article ) .
The area between Kiev and Kremenchug was in every way ill - adapted to crossing operations .
From Kiev to Cherkasi , the eastern bank is swampy , and roads would permit the Russians to move troops and supplies easily to a threatened area .
Furthermore , a wedge driven across in this area would fail to secure the maximum strategic effect , in that fewer Russian forces would be cut off in the resulting pocket .
Between Cherkasi and Kremenchug a crossing is almost impossible ; the Dnieper wanders in numerous channels , much of the terrain is marshy , and a tributary ( the Tyasmin ) parallels the Dnieper on the south .
The area chosen for the crossing , about 25 miles southeast of Kremenchug , possesses several obvious advantages .
The Dnieper flows in a single channel , 1,200 yards wide ; there are no tributary streams ; and the banks are free from swamps .
Moreover , in this area the railroads and roads favored the Germans rather than the Russians .
On the German side of the river , the Dnieper valley road would be useful at all stages of the operations ; on the Russian side , there are no roads to bring reinforcements close to the point of crossing .
A particular feature of the terrain helped the Germans concentrate for attack at this point .
The area southwest included a watershed ridge running perpendicular to the river .
This ridge was wooded and had sandy soil .
The Germans could bring men and supplies by road and rail to a point 30 or 35 miles from the crossing point and advance under cover of the woods , over what was in effect a natural highway almost to the river .
The absence of roads would not prevent armored and supply vehicles from negotiating this route .
On the Russian side , the terrain was adapted to exploitation of a successful crossing .
Once a bridgehead was established , the Vorskla River would protect it on the right flank , while on the left no natural barrier impeded a German advance toward Kremenchug .
North of Kremenchug , the terrain is ideal for a maneuver of envelopment by armored forces .
A watershed ridge gave a good route for advance northward by armored units , regardless of damage done to highways or railroads .
Each flank of this route was protected by a swampy river .
6. PREPARATION .
Very little information is available on the German preparations for this crossing .
In view of its difficulty , and of the importance attached to this operation in the strategy of the campaign , there can be little doubt that a task force was prepared for this assignment according to the usual German principles .
These may be summarized as follows :
a . A commander for the task force is selected and given sole responsibility for the operation .
b. He is given troops and materiel according to his estimate of requirements .
( This would include , in an operation of this sort , all types of infantry and artillery units , a heavy air component , and important pioneer and transport units . )
c. The commander organizes and trains the units for the specific task assigned .
If possible , this is done on terrain similar to that of the proposed operation .
The object of this training is to develop a combat team thoroughly rehearsed in all stages of the assignment .
Preparation for the Dnieper crossing involved concentration of considerable supplies of weapons and other necessary materiel .
This concentration had to be made as close as possible to the place of projected crossing .
The most serious logistical problem was that of bringing up boats and bridging materiel .
German accounts state that hundreds of assault boats were used on the Dnieper River .
These boats apparently were of two types -- one capable of carrying from 4 to 6 men , and one capable of carrying 10 to 16 men .
Both were driven by outboard motors .
It is not known how many of these boats were used in the operation , but if " hundreds " were used the problem of transporting and concealing them was an operation of considerable magnitude .
Equally difficult was the problem of concealing sufficient pontons and platforms for the construction of a 1,200 - foot bridge .
Apparently there were enough trees on the sandy ridge to afford cover , yet not so many as to block the movement of wheeled or tracked vehicles .
In this wooded area , camouflage by tree limbs was easy , effective , and much used , as is shown by German photographs .
German camouflage emphasizes the value of dummy positions which cause the enemy to waste his ammunition and reveal his position , and which divert suspicion from important concealed installations or supplies .
It is quite likely that such positions , with indications of boats and bridging equipment , were constructed at other points on the Dnieper in order to deceive the Russian observers as to the area chosen for the initial crossing .
Concentrations at secondary points along the Dnieper were apparently not so well guarded from Russian air observation .
These other concentrations were made partly to divert suspicion from the preparations for the initial crossing , and partly to have heavy weapons and supplies ready for later crossings which would follow after the success of the initial operation .
7. THE JUMP - OFF .
By the end of August , the subordinate commanders charged with execution of the preliminary operations were able to report to the task force commander that they were ready .
At dawn on the morning of August 31 , German planes took possession of the sky in the Kremenchug area .
German artillery threw a heavy barrage across the river against the Russian lines .
At the same moment , hundreds of assault boats were taken from their hiding places and carried down the gently sloping sandy banks to the shallow water at the edge of the Dnieper .
The boats , which were designed for this particular type of operation , were probably similar to those which crossed the Rhine in somewhat less than a minute in the Maginot operation ( June 1940 ) .
No reports have been seen on the time required for the storm boats to cross the Dnieper , but their attainable speed is variously given as 30 to 40 miles per hour .
The boats were not beached at the eastern bank but returned at once for further loads .
The speed of the turn - around is to be noted ; it is said that the men jumped from the boats as they turned without coming to a complete stop .
The small boats carried about 4 men , and the larger boats ( judging from pictures ) seem to have carried 10 to 12 men .
The carrying of less than the maximum loads may have been designed to permit a speedier crossing .
The Germans report that the Russians , taken by surprise , nevertheless immediately organized a determined resistance .
Since the steersmen of the German boats stood up , many were killed by the Russian machine - gun fire , which was withheld until the boats were near the shore , but in each instance another soldier took the helm .
Preparations had been made for plugging bullet holes immediately , and many boats that received hits were thus enabled to continue across the river .
German photographs show spouts of water in the Dnieper caused by Russian artillery shells , and also show sand clouds produced by Russian shells bursting only a few yards from German concentrations on the eastern side .
Russian resistance cost the Germans many assault troops , but not enough to endanger the success of the operation .
8. FORMATION OF A BRIDGEHEAD .
As soon as the German assault troops reached the far bank , they immediately began to overcome enemy resistance .
The boats crossed the river again and again .
The special river - crossing units were followed by more assault troops and by pioneers , and then by the infantry .
By noon , enough troops had been ferried over to make the Germans feel that their position was secure .
During the afternoon they transported more infantry and further organized their bridgehead .
All these operations were continuously reconnoitered and protected by units of the German air arm .
The passage of troops and materiel was now increased by the use of additional , more vulnerable transport .
Inflated rubber boats were used for ferrying more men-- some 10 to a boat -- and ammunition .
Large rubber rafts were loaded with heavy infantry weapons , especially antitank guns .
These rafts were towed to the eastern side of the river by motor boats .
The Germans also prepared ferries consisting of pontons lashed together to support a platform on which heavy guns were towed across the river to be used in neutralizing and capturing the field fortifications of the Russians .
In the meantime the troops which had been transported earlier in the day advanced and took the sand dunes and low hills beyond the opposite shore .
The enemy line of artillery observation was thus in German hands .
Many troops were now on the Russian side of the river and much materiel had been transported .
Since the area was not occupied in force by the Russians , and possessed neither roads or railroads , there was no possibility of an immediate heavy Russian counterattack .
Thus , in a single day , a strong German bridgehead had been established .
Since they had been carefully rehearsed by specially trained troops , the crossing operations were carried out successfully without great losses .
9. CONSTRUCTION OF THE BRIDGE .
Transport by storm boats , inflated rubber boats , and pontons had been effective , but loading and unloading was necessarily slow .
The bridge was needed and , with air superiority in the area and artillery already in place on the Russian side of the river , the Germans did not hesitate to proceed with its construction .
This was accomplished in a single night ( August 31 - September 1 ) , and the next day supplies and troops were pouring across the bridge .
It seems certain that the bridging equipment used in the crossing below Kremenchug was of the type which the Germans refer to as " bridge - gear B " : equipment tried out in Poland , perfected , and used for the crossing of the Rhine in the Maginot operation in France .
The basic unit in the construction of a German military bridge is the half–ponton .
This is built of metal except for strips of wood on the gunwales .
It is 25 feet long , 6.3 feet broad , and 3.3 feet deep .
The weight is not known .
Half - pontons are used in constructing 4 - ton and 8 - ton ferries , and sections of 8 - ton bridges .
Two half - pontons locked stern to stern form a full - ponton .
The full - pontons are used in constructing 8 - ton and 16 - ton ferries and sections of 16 - ton bridges .
As soon as the pontons are in the water by the shore , the Germans construct platforms on them .
The maneuvering of the bridge section or the ferrying of a ponton - supported raft is accomplished by rowing , by the use of storm boats , by the use of " M " boats ( a powerful light motor boat of 100 h.p. ) , or by the use of outboard motors on the pontons themselves .
German bridging equipment includes prefabricated metal material for building piers at the shore .
However , such piers were not needed at Kremenchug .
Photographs show that the bank was well drained and sloping , and ramps could easily be used to connect the shore with the ponton - supported bridge .
10 . ENLARGEMENT OF THE BRIDGEHEAD .
By the end of August 31 , the Russians realized that a major threat had developed .
Russian planes made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to destroy the bridge , and also attacked the points of German advance .
Hastily assembled Russian reserves made heavy counterattacks with tanks .
The Germans , however , maintained their bridgehead , and extended it upstream to threaten the Russian position at Kremenchug .
11 . ADDITIONAL BRIDGES AND BRIDGEHEADS .
The Germans gradually enlarged their tactical bridgehead on the east bank of the Dnieper into a strategic bridgehead .
Land operations to the northwest reduced enemy resistance 15 miles upstream , at another area free from swampy banks and multiple channels .
To gain another route across the river , a second bridge was built at this point , apparently during the night of September 2 - 3 .
German reinforcements poured across the new bridge , only 10 miles below Kremenchug .
Under their flank attack and a frontal attack from the west , Kremenchug fell on September 8 , and the Germans had secured the controlling center of a road and railroad net .
Whether or not the Russians had destroyed existing bridges is not clear .
In any case , the Germans felt the need of better transportation across the Dnieper at Kremenchug , and decided to move to that point the bridge which had been constructed 10 miles downstream .
The sections were detached and towed upstream during a single night , in a rainstorm , and the bridge was rebuilt at a place where it could serve the Kremenchug road net .
Meanwhile , the Germans had established other bridgeheads across the Dnieper further down the river .
These bridgeheads doubtless had the double purpose of paving the way for further operations in the Dnieper Valley and of preventing the reinforcement of Russian troops further north .
12 . THE PINCER MOVEMENT BEGINS .
With the eastern bank of the Dnieper at Kremenchug in their possession , and a strong bridgehead established , the Germans had accomplished the most difficult part of the large - scale pincer movement which was to isolate Kiev and destroy a considerable portion of Budenny 's armies .
The way was now clear for the southern wedge to move .
With the First Panzer Army on the right and the Seventeenth Army on the left , the Germans advanced northward along the strategic ridge of high ground from Kremenchug toward Lubni and Lokvitsa , their flanks protected by marshy tributaries of the Dnieper .
Meanwhile , from the Desna , the Second Panzer Army moved southward protecting the advance of the Second Army .
At Lokvitsa and at Lubni the armored spearheads which had crossed the Dnieper met those which had crossed the Desna , to complete a gigantic double encirclement .
The Russians of the Kiev salient were in a trap .
The Sixth Army joined the Second and the Seventeenth in the annihilation and capture of Russian forces , while the two Panzer armies protected the operation and moved toward their next objectives .
This successful wedge - and - trap maneuver had been made possible by the river crossing at Kremenchug .
13 . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION .
Air superiority is absolutely essential to the success of an operation such as the initial German crossing of the Dnieper below Kremenchug .
Airplanes were used in the initial phases for reconnaissance , and to deny reconnaissance to the Russians .
Combat aviation guarded the sky above the bridge .
Bombardment aviation was doubtless used to harass and neutralize the Russian lines as German troops moved across the newly constructed bridge .
The German success in the Kremenchug operation especially in the initial stages , owed much to surprise , which they achieved by the secrecy of preparations , by deception , and by very rapid execution .
Deception was achieved by obvious preparations for a river crossing at other points in order to draw the defending forces out of position .
The incomplete evidence suggests that either actual attempts or feints at crossings may have been made at points other than the one described above .
An attempt at Dnepropetrovsk , of uncertain date , is known to have been repulsed .
Speed of execution aided the Germans enormously .
By the end of the the first day ( August 31 ) , the Russians knew that the operation was of major importance , but the speed with which the Germans built the bridge and moved their forces across the river enabled them to establish a large bridgehead , and prepare to extend it , before adequate Russian forces could be brought up .
In river crossings the Germans send over antitank guns very early in the operation in order to neutralize local tank attacks .
Infantry supporting weapons ( 75 - mm and 150 - mm howitzers of the infantry regiment ) are also ferried over early to support the operation of enlarging the bridgehead .
In the Kremenchug operation , the construction of the first bridge did not commence until after the assaulting formations on the far bank had captured the line of artillery observation ; even then the construction was carried out under cover of darkness .
Normally , in crossing smaller streams , the bridge - building operations start much sooner , in some cases before the site is clear of small - arms fire .
When speed of execution is being employed to achieve surprise , as is often the case with armored forces , much time can be saved by an earlier start even though a few casualties must be accepted .
The over - all gain justified those losses .
The German forces employed in the difficult initial crossing of the Dnieper below Kremenchug attribute their success to the secrecy of their preparation , thus exploiting the principle of surprise to the maximum ; to good staff work in the careful tactical and technical preparation ; and , finally , to boldness and skill in the execution of the plans .
The William Morris Agency Advises Clients Against the Google Book Settlement
* Check this out first if you have no idea what the hell is going on * The William Morris Agency has come out strongly against the Google Book Settlement for its clients , citing the fact that the settlement creates a non-competitive marketplace for a whole new product ( orphan books ) , in addition to containing provisions that will make it impossible for writers to remove books from the database after twenty - seven months have passed .
From William Morris ' memo
" In addition to waiving their right to sue Google for infringement , [ authors ] waive , again for the term of copyright , their right to have Google remove their work from its database if they have n't done so within twenty - seven months from the Notice Commencement Date .
As of today , it appears to us that " nondisplay " uses constitute fair use , but it is impossible for anyone to predict that such use will always be the case .
And if such inclusion is not fair use , there may come a time when the author or their heirs might wish to remove their work from the Google database for any reason .
The authors waive that right , forever , if they do not opt out of the Settlement .
" Additionally , the William Morris Agency also strongly condemns the preferential treatment that the settlement gives to Google ; the extra publishing rights that Google will receive regarding orphan books that will make them far more powerful than any competitor :
" We believe that the license being given to Google to publish and display with impunity out - of - print " orphan " works ( where the rights owner is unknown and estimated by the Financial Times to be between 2.8 and 5 million books out of 32 million books protected by copyright in the United States ) will open the door to establishing Google as the most comprehensive database , potentially a monopoly , with unfair bargaining power ...
The only way for any potential competitor to obtain similar rights , absent new legislation , is to infringe , get sued , and hope to reach a settlement on terms similar to Google's .
We believe that giving Google special treatment does not appear to be the way to foster a competitive market place to the benefit of you , our authors .
"
Not surprisingly , William Morris gives the most sensible advice possible to writers who are contemplating this settlement : opt out now ( while you still can ) , and then opt in later with your own specially - negotiated contract ( if you are still alive ) .
The Author 's Guild , of course , disagrees with this line of thinking , as it must also disagree with all claims that are hostile to the negotiated terms of the Settlement .
Whether or not it was before , the Author 's Guild is certainly Google 's creature now .
If this settlement does n't pass , the legal fees will probably bankrupt it forever , causing it to disappear for good in a puff of ink - stained smoke .
The National Writer 's Union , however , has come out in stark opposition to the Settlement , saying the kinds of things you would expect a union to say .
You know , a group that is looking out for writers and trying to get the best deal for them through the phenomenon of " collective bargaining . "
" By scanning and digitally reproducing millions of copyrighted books and articles without permission by the writers , Google violated authors ' constitutionally protected rights , " said Larry Goldbetter , President of the NWU .
" According to our understanding of the proposed settlement , writers whose copyrights were violated might receive a check for between $ 60 and $ 300 for each book and $ 15 per article .
Compared to the number and seriousness of the violations , the amount being offered by Google to each writer is ridiculously low .
Also , of the $ 125 million offered by Google , only $ 45 million is for writers .
This seems way short of the amount needed to compensate authors of millions of books .
" The NWU is the Local 1981 of the United Auto Worker 's Union .
They do things like meet with writers , have assemblies to figure out what writers think , and try to solicit the opinions of the people on whose behalf they claim to speak -- unlike the Author 's Guild , a group that has been secretly negotiating the terms of this agreement with Google for years from a position of zero leverage .
Probably there are only like ten people in the NWU .
BUT STILL !
More from Goldbetter : " Putting the onus on writers to contact Google is also grossly unfair .
Google is essentially saying 'we are going to steal your work and sell it under terms we dictate unless you tell us not to . '
A corporation , no matter how powerful , should n't be able to profit from your work without first contacting you and obtaining your permission in writing .
" Just so you know , everyone in Europe is also freaking out about this Settlement , now that they have awakened to what it means for rightsholders .
From the Financial Times : " While limited only to book rights in the US , the proposed settlement , which still needs court approval , has aroused consternation among European publishers , who fear they will lose some of their rights to millions of European works held in university libraries in the US , which have been drawn into Google 's ambitious book - scanning effort .
" Under the US legal deal , unless copyright holders opt out of the arrangement large segments of the works will be displayed by Google to US internet users , while readers in Europe and elsewhere are blocked .
Online access to the full works will be sold by Google in the US , with the proceeds being shared with publishers .
" Here 's a peculiar wrinkle to the whole state of affairs : a group of French publishers filed a lawsuit in 2006 , basically the same lawsuit that the Author 's Guild and the Association of American Publishers filed , but they did NOT settle , and the lawsuit goes to trial next month .
Our current advice : secure your online rights , sit on them , wait and see what happens with electronic publishing , then put your work in the hands of the electronic publisher you like best once the market stabilizes .
Maybe this will be Google , maybe not .
In the meantime , Scribd is offering the best deal ( 80 % of profits , to Google 's 63 % ) if you need cash now
Joining the likes of Sid_Goon , LimeJellyTeddy and Flopsydaisy in tweeted outrage might once have been considered beneath the dignity of a prime minister .
But Gordon Brown has defied convention to add his voice to a burgeoning Twitter campaign to defend the NHS after US Republicans labelled it " evil " and " Orwellian " .
" PM : NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort , despair and hope , life and death .
Thanks for always being there , " tweeted Downing Street .
He was followed by an even keener Twitterer , Sarah Brown , who said : " #welovetheNHS – more than words can say . "
The Browns added their Twitters to thousands of heartfelt declarations from patients , nurses and other medical practitioners on Twitter 's # welovetheNHS topic .
Such was the popularity of the campaign to defend the NHS from Republicans highlighting the so - called dangers of a " socialised " healthcare system that the micro-blogging site crashed on Wednesday .
If it was an unusual move for Brown to join an online campaign , the prime ministerial Twitter also challenged the convention that British governments do not wade into domestic political battles in the US .
As well as support Obama 's healthcare reforms against Republican attacks , the Browns have personal cause to praise the NHS .
The prime minister 's sight in one eye was saved when he lost the other in a teenage rugby accident , the Browns ' son , Fraser , has cystic fibrosis , while they publicly thanked NHS staff for the support they received when their first child , Jennifer , died in 2001 .
The Labour presence on # welovetheNHS highlighted the relative absence of senior Conservatives , despite the eagerness of David Cameron 's team to embrace new methods of communicating with voters .
Daniel Hannan , the Tory MP whose anti-Brown speech went viral on YouTube this year , joined Republican criticism of the NHS on US TV earlier this week , saying he " would n't wish " the NHS " on anyone " .
Perhaps Cameron was wise to declare he did not agree with Hannan and his party was " 100 % " committed to the NHS without resorting to Twitter .
As the intervention by Andy Burnham , the health secretary , showed , politicians ' attempts to match the informality and passion of ordinary Twitterers can look silly .
A Twitter posted on his behalf by Downing Street said : " Andy Burnham :
Over the moon about strong support for NHS – an institution I will defend to my dying day , 2nd only to Everton FC . "
Eschewing football for greater formality , Burnham said – rather than Tweeted – later : " I am exceptionally proud that Britain has a world class NHS which treats people on the basis of clinical need – irrespective of their ability to pay .
The groundswell we have seen on Twitter … is testament to its remarkable achievements . "
An article here in Spanish tells us of a most unsurprising study , one that confirms that children take less time to read and write a language like Spanish with its simple orthography , compared to the etymologically rich and varied clusterf * &k of an orthography that English has .
Here 's part of the article .
Spanish children learn to read and write before English children thanks to the fact that the writing system is simpler and that the relation between graphemes and phonemes is a very transparent one , according to a study from a group of experts from the University of Granada .
The work was coordinated by the psychologist and pedagogue Silvia Defior and is integrated into the European project ELDEL , which studies the processes of learning in the reading and writing of different languages .
Defior explained that graphical representation is " much easier " in Spanish compared to English , which helps early learning , but still includes some inconsistencies with the difficulty in distinguishing between b and v , g and j , and c and z .
( Note : one good example of the last one is casa - house vs. caza - hunt , pronounced the same )
The group from Granada is working with children in between 5 and 8 years of age and collaborates with various others in the province in order to learn about the acquisition of language in people with dyslexia or dysgraphia , as well as with those with Down syndrome or other specific language disorders .
The EDEL project aims to study the psycholinguistic and cognitive factors that affect the learning of the reading and writing of a language , that is , the relationship between memory , visual attention , morphological and syntactical aspects , but also the environment in which children learn .
The study includes five languages , which are English ( Germanic ) , Spanish and French ( Romance ) , and Czech and Slovak ( Slavic ) , and has the participation of universities in different parts of Europe .
The language in which children have the easiest time learning to read and write would definitely be Finnish , and in terms of not only reading and writing but also grammar Turkish has been cited as the language most easily mastered as a mother tongue

Let ’s open up the hood and take a better look .
Does u201CCash for Clunkersu201D really work , we ask ?
In answer , we guffaw .
Then , we invite dead economists to guffaw with us .
Richard von Strigl , among others , pointed out in 1923 that there is a big gap between real economics and the vulgar economics that drives policy decisions .
On the one hand , serious observers study what happens in a pure , natural economy and draw their truths from its crystal streams .
On the other , the meddlers distort the economic world so much that the observations of the old economists hardly matter .
Downstream from the meddlers ’ camp the water is not even fit to drink .
In theory as well as in fact , the planners never know what they are doing :
 The knowledge of the circumstances of which we must make use never exists in concentrated or integrated form ,  began Friedrich Hayek in 1945 , but solely as the dispersed bits of incomplete and frequently contradictory knowledge which all the separate individuals possess .
The Law Bastiat , Frederic Best Price : $ 4.99 Buy New $ 0.96 ( as of 02:35 EST - Details )
A good is a good only insofar as it is good to the person who wants it .
The public servant — as able and self - less as he may be — has to guess .
History and theory tell us what happens ; he usually guesses wrong .
Only the individual knows what he wants and how to get it .
He compares one good against others — using prices to guide him to where he gets the most good for his money .
But when the government steps in with its subsidies , it effectively pisses in the stream of price information .
Now , the consumer , with no clean signal to guide him , makes mistakes .
He may be lured to buy a new car .
The central planners may be pleased .
They see the effect they desired — more auto sales .
But what do n’t they see ?
We invite Frdric Bastiat for an opinion ( 1850 ) :
 Between a good and a bad economist this constitutes the whole difference — the one takes account of the visible effect ; the other takes account both of the effects which are seen , and also of those which it is necessary to foresee .
Now this difference is enormous , for it almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable , the ultimate consequences are fatal , and the converse . 
But who listens to Bastiat or Hayek ?
Ten countries have taken up u201CCash for Clunkersu201D programs .
In Britain , the government puts up 2000 pounds to grease the deal with a total of 300 million earmarked for the program .
In America , the u201CCash for Clunkersu201D program was extended last week , giving buyers a bonus of $ 3,500 or $ 4,500 when they turn in an old vehicle .
In France , buyers get 1,000 euros toward the purchase of a new car .
Everywhere , the program is hailed as a success .
It is widely thought not only to boost auto sales , but to help revive the economy , reduce pollution , cut oil imports and even lower highway deaths .
We have n’t heard that buying a new car contributes to weight loss , but we have n’t seen the TV news .
Even u201C free market capitalists u201D such as Larry Kudlow say they like it :
Financial Reckoning Da ... Addison Wiggin , Will B ... Best Price : $ 2.36 Buy New $ 2.49 ( as of 04:30 EST - Details )
 The Cash - for - Clunkers rebate program is working .
And the price tag of the program is a mere $ 2 billion compared with the trillions of dollars Washington has been wasting .
So , for once in our lives , Washington spending is giving us a good bang for the buck . 
Bastiat knew better .
He described a scene where a boy had broken a shop window .
The store ’s owner was annoyed , until a foolish economist pointed out that the broken window was a blessing in disguise .
It gave work to the glaziers and glassmakers .
The glaziers then could buy other things and thus did the whole economy enjoy a bounty from this single act of vandalism .
But wait , Bastiat wanted to know , if you could improve the lot of mankind by breaking windows , why not smash every window in Paris ?
And if you could improve the lot of mankind circa 2009 by crushing cars , why not crush them all ?
And knock down London and New York too .
Think of the boom that would accompany the rebuilding !
Obviously , it does n’t work that way .
Replacing broken windows , or crushed cars , takes resources away from some other uses .
This unseen effect is actually greater than the seen effect — the improved market for new cars .
Lured by phony price information , buyers send phony signals to the rest of the economy .
The automakers produce more cars than they need .
Steel , which might have gone to refrigerators is used for car doors .
Oil , which might have been used to generate electricity , is used to stamp out fenders .
Savings , that might have been invested in new industries , go to prop up an old one .
Kudlow allows himself a peek at the unseen consequences :  yes , it ’s quite possible that government rebates today will steal car sales from next year .
But let ’s cross that bridge next year 
Then , he even wonders , briefly , at the obvious foolishness of it almost as though he were a serious thinker :  Well , why not just spend another $ 100 billion and give consumers checks for everything ?
u201D
Or ,  Why not spend another trillion ?
u201D
Well , I do n’t want to go there
No one wants to go there .
The old economists shake their heads : u201CIt ’s a fraud , u201D they say .
The rest of them do n’t give a damn .

Forty years after it first landed men on the Moon , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has little chance of repeating that accomplishment by the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 .
Maybe not even by the 60th .
Five years after NASA was given a goal of returning to the Moon by 2020 , the agency is arriving at an uncomfortable realization  that the American human spaceflight program might not accomplish anything new anytime soon .
“ Unless the president is willing to step up and take a bold step like President Kennedy did , the manned spaceflight program is going to go in the ditch , ” said Senator Bill Nelson , Democrat of Florida .
NASA ’s current plan is to retire the space shuttles by September of next year after completing construction of the International Space Station , then rely on Russian rockets until a next - generation rocket , the Ares I , is ready in March 2015 .
The agency would then retire and dispose of the space station in 2016 and use the freed - up money to develop the heavy - lift Ares V rocket , a lunar lander and the technology for building a Moon settlement .
On The Shortness Of Life By Lucius Annaeus Seneca NOTE : Seneca , a Spanish - born philosopher of Rome who lived in the first century A.D. , was one of the prominent sages of the Stoic school .
He 's chiefly remembered today for his Moral Essays , a collection of twelve articles on various ethical themes .
" On The Shortness Of Life " is an essay addressed to a friend , and it is excerpted and condensed here from Moses Hadas ' fine work , The Stoic Philosophy Of Seneca .
It is a general complaint among mankind , Paulinus , that Nature is niggardly : our allotted span is brief , and the term granted us flies by with such dizzy speed that all but a few exhaust it just when they are beginning to live .
And it is not only the unthinking masses who bemoan what they consider the universal evil : the same sentiment has evoked complaints even from men of distinction .
Hence the cry of that prince of physicians ( Hippocrates ) , " Life is short , art long . "
Hence Aristotle 's grievance against Nature -- an incongruous position for a philosopher : Nature has been so lavish to animals that they vegetate for five or ten human spans , whereas man , with his capacity for numerous and great achievements , is limited by so much shorter a tether .
It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much .
Life is long enough and our allotted portion generous enough for our most ambitious projects if we invest it all carefully .
But when it is squandered through luxury and indifference , and spent for no good end , we realize it has gone , under the pressure of the ultimate necessity , before we were aware it was going .
So it is : the life we receive is not short but we make it so ; we are not ill provided but use what we have wastefully .
Kingly riches are dissipated in an instant if they fall into the hands of a bad master , but even moderate wealth increases with use in the hands of a careful steward ; just so does our life provide ample scope if it is well managed .
Why do we complain of Nature ?
She has behaved handsomely ; life , if you know how to use it , is long .
One man is possessed by an insatiable avarice , another by assiduous application to trifling enterprises .
One man is sodden with wine , another benumbed by sloth .
One man is exhausted by an ambition which always depends on the votes of others , another is driven over every land and sea by the trader 's urge to seek profit .
Some are plagued by a passion for soldiering , and are incessantly bent upon threatening others or anxious about others ' threats .
Some are worn out by self - imposed and unrequited attendance upon the great ; many busy themselves with the pursuit of other men's estates or in complaints about their own .
Some follow no plan consistently but are precipitated into one new scheme after another by a fickleness which is rambling and unstable and dissatisfied with itself ; some have no objective at all at which to aim but are overtaken by fate as they gape and yawn .
I cannot , therefore , question the truth of the great poet 's dictum , uttered with oracular impressiveness : " Slight is the portion of life we live . "
All the residue is not living but passing time .
On all sides we are surrounded and beset by vices , and these do not permit us to rise and lift our eyes to the discernment of truth but submerge us and hold us chained down to lust .
The prisoners are never allowed to return to their true selves ; if they are ever so lucky as to win some respite they continue to roll , as the sea swells even after the storm is over , and secure no release from their lusts .
Do you suppose I am referring to wretches whose failings are acknowledged ?
Look at the men whose felicity is the cynosure of all eyes ; they are smothered by their prosperity .
How many have found riches a bane !
How many have paid with blood for their eloquence and their daily straining to display their talent !
How many are sallow from constant indulgence !
How many are deprived of liberty by a besieging mob of clients !
Run through the whole list from top to bottom : this man wants a friend at court , that man serves his turn ; this man is the defendant , that man his lawyer , and that other the judge : but no one presses his claim to himself , everyone is used up for the sake of someone else .
Investigate the personages whose names are household words and you will find they can be classified by the following criteria :
A is B 's sycophant and B is C's ; no one shows solicitude for himself .
. .
Though all the luminaries of the ages devoted their combined genius to this one theme , they could never satisfactorily expound this phenomenal fog that darkens men's minds .
Men will never allow anyone to take possession of their estates , and at the slightest dispute on boundary lines they pick up stones and rush to arms ; but they do allow others to trespass on their lives , and themselves introduce intruders who will eventually claim full possession .
Nobody on earth is willing to distribute his money , but everybody shares out his life , and to all comers .
Men are very strict in keeping their patrimony intact , but when it comes to squandering time they are most lavish of the one item where miserliness is respectable .
I should like to buttonhole one of the oldsters and say to him : " I see that you have reached the highest life expectancy and are now close to a century or more ; please give us an itemized account of your years .
Calculate how much of that span was subtracted by a creditor , a mistress , a patron , a client , quarreling with your wife , punishing your slaves , gadding about the city on social duties .
Add to the subtrahend self - caused diseases and the time left an idle blank .
You will see that you possess fewer years than the calendar shows .
Search your memory : how seldom you have had a consistent plan , how few days worked out as you intended , how seldom you have enjoyed full use of yourself , how seldom your face was unflurried , what accomplishments you have to show for so long a life , how much of your life has been pilfered by others without your being aware of it , how much of it you have lost , how much was dispensed on groundless regret , foolish gladness , greedy desire , polite society --- and then realize that your death will be premature . "
Why should this be ?
It is because you live as if you would live forever ; the thought of human frailty never enters your head , you never notice how much of your time is already spent .
You squander it as though your store were full to overflowing , when in fact the very day of which you make a present to someone or something may be your last .
Like the mortal you are , you are apprehensive of everything ; but your desires are unlimited as if you were immortal .
Many a man will say , " After my fiftieth year I shall retire and relax ; my sixtieth year will release me from obligations . "
And what guarantee have you that your life will be longer ?
Who will arrange that your program shall proceed according to plan ?
Are you not ashamed to reserve for yourself only the tail end of life and to allot to serious thought only such time as cannot be applied to business ?
How late an hour to begin to live when you must depart from life !
What stupid obliviousness to mortality to postpone counsels of sanity to the fifties or sixties , with the intention of beginning life at an age few have reached !...
Among the worst offenders I count those who give all their time to drink and lust ; that is the sorriest abuse of time of all .
Though the phantom of glory which possesses some men is illusory , their error , at all events , has a creditable look .
And even if you cite the avaricious , the wrathful , and those who prosecute unjust hatreds and even unjust war , these too are more manly kinds of sin .
But the stain upon men abandoned to their belly and their lusts is vile .
Open their schedules for examination and note how much time they spend on bookkeeping , on machinations , on protective measures , on courting the powerful , on being courted , on obtaining or providing collateral , on banquets ( which have now become a business routine ) , and you will see how little time their distractions , call them good or bad , leave them for drawing breath .
. .
The only people really at leisure are those who take time for philosophy .
They alone really live .
It is not their lifetime alone of which they are careful stewards : they annex every age to their own and exploit all the years that have gone before .
Unless we prove ingrate , it was for us that the illustrious founders of divine schools of thought came into being , for us they prepared a way of life .
By the exertions of others we are led to the fairest treasures , raised to the light out of the darkness in which they were mined .
No age is forbidden us , we have admittance to all , and if we choose to transcend the narrow bounds of human frailty by loftiness of mind , there is a vast stretch of time for us to roam .
We may dispute with Socrates , doubt with Carneades , repose with Epicurus , transcend human nature with the Stoics , defy it with the Cynics .
Since Nature allows us to participate in any age , why should we not betake ourselves in mind from this petty and ephemeral span to the boundless and timeless region we can share with our betters ?...
In the meanwhile , while [ people ] are robbing and being robbed , while they disrupt each other 's repose and make one another miserable , life remains without profit , without pleasure , without moral improvement .
No one keeps death in view , everyone focuses on remote hopes .
Some even make posthumous provisions --- massive sepulchres , dedications of public buildings , gladiatorial shows , and pretentious obsequies .
But the funerals of such people should be conducted by torch and taper light , as though they had in fact died in childhood .

As silly as it may look , I am going to start this post by publishing for the third time in a row the same figure .
That is because I want to keep the promise I made earlier that I would explain in terms as simple as possible ( although not simpler ) the details hidden behind the coloured curves and functions pictured there .
I will also take this chance to come down a little from the level of technicality of the recent posts : after all , this blog is supposedly for everybody , and not just for Ph.D. students and recipients .
The figure above , a few of whose " secrets " I wish to unveil in the discussion below , shows the dependence of the as - of - yet unknown mass of the Higgs boson on W boson and top quark masses .
This is a particular version of your generic " W mass versus top mass " plot ( let us call it MW - MT in the following ) , actually : it is the one which uses as a measurement ellipse one constructed with the top quark mass taken as the one computed from the running top mass , an exercise performed recently in this paper , which I summarized in the former post .
Our goal for today will be to ignore the green area , which describes Supersymmetric model , s and just to grasp the reason for the logarithmic dependence of Higgs mass on top and W masses - the growing from 114 to 400 GeV of the Higgs boson mass as you move ever so slightly from the top to the bottom boundary of the red area- , and the parabolic shape of iso - Higgs - mass curves which delimitate it .
This will take us deep in the details of quantum corrections to Standard Model observable quantities .
Before we discuss those functional dependencies , at least a quick - and - dirty introduction is necessary .
Introduction : gauge symmetry and lagrangian functions
The Standard Model of particle physics is an amazingly elegant theoretical construction , which assumes a few crucial principles as its basis - among them quantum mechanics and local gauge symmetry - , and a few particles as its building blocks .
Then , once you specify the blueprint , in the form of a well - defined group structure defining the forces these particles feel , and the resulting Lagrangian function , a marvelous complexity arises .
Already feeling uneasy about the few jargon terms in the previous sentence ?
Worry not .
Here are a couple of explanations .
The term " Lagrangian function " should not trouble you too much .
A Lagrangian is just a function which enshrines the energy balance of the physical system we study .
By specifying in it the various contributions to the total potential and kinetic energy of the bodies contained in the system , we can derive the laws of motion which govern the behaviour of those bodies .
In other words , if we know how to write a Lagrangian function for the system , the rest of the work to predict the future evolution of the system is " just " a technicality .
The most complicated thing to define is " local gauge symmetry " , a symmetry of the Lagrangian function .
The mathematical expression of particles in quantum field theory includes an arbitrary complex phase , and the system has gauge symmetry if by changing the phase of these particle " fields " the Lagrangian , and consequently the equations of motion of the system , remains unchanged .
Quantum fields describing particles are written as complex functions : these have a modulo and a phase , like vectors in a plane .
Imagine rotating all vectors in a plane by the same angle , and you are visualizing a global gauge transformation .
Now , global gauge symmetry of a system is something nobody would object - a global complex phase is never an observable quantity anyway , and we all expect that the physical properties of a system do not change if we vary the phase of all fields .
Moreover , one can prove that it is a highly desirable feature of the theory to be globally gauge invariant : if we consider electrodynamics , for instance , we can prove that global gauge symmetry of the Lagrangian ensures that electric charge is conserved .
Imagine being a theorist who wants to find the laws of quantum electrodynamics , and comes up with a wonderful equation , which however allows net amounts of electric charge to be created at will from any point of space .
Would you uncork your best bottle to celebrate ?
No , you would begrudgingly go back to the blackboard !
A local gauge symmetry is much less trivial than a global one , and apparently it constitutes an eccentric request on the Lagrangian : the locality of the gauge symmetry implies that we can freely change the phase of all fields arbitrarily in different ways at different points of space without affecting the physics .
Promoting to " local " a gauge symmetry is a crucial step in the path of constructing a particle theory , and the Standard Model has it among its foundations .
The reason for enforcing local gauge invariance to our Lagrangian was fully digested by particle theorists in the seventies , when it was conclusively proven in a giant achievement by 't Hooft that theories endowed with that properties are renormalizable .
Just as much as non-local ones , local gauge invariant theories do describe physical processes which , if computed , contain infinite quantities ; however , the infinities they generate can be eliminated by a redefinition of a finite number of arbitrary parameters .
In quantum electrodynamics , for instance , one redefines the electron charge as a " renormalized charge " , and the theory becomes capable of producing finite results : it therefore becomes a usable tool to compute and predict the measured value of observable quantities .
The Standard Model and virtual particle exchanges
In the Standard Model , the interaction between matter fields ( which are fermions : particles of half - integer spin ) is described by the exchange of vector bosons .
The picture is easy to draw : a fermion moving in space - time can be drawn in a plane as the left black line in the figure on the right , where we take time to flow on the vertical axis and space on the horizontal one .
A boson emission by the fermion can be drawn as a bosonic line departing from the fermion at one well - defined space - time point , as shown by the dashed red line .
Then , a second fermion can " absorb " the boson at a different space - time point , as described by the the black line on the right .
As a result , the two fermions " feel " each other : they interact by exchanging the messenger , a vector boson .
With not too complicated calculations it is possible to estimate the effect of this exchange , and compute measurable quantities , such as the scattering angle of the two fermions , their final energy , and so on .
Unfortunately , the above description is clean and simple , but we must realize two things : first , that the boson being exchanged is a virtual particle , and second , that our picture is incomplete .
The boson is virtual because it is not an " asymptotic state " , i.e. , it is not a particle which at the end of the day is still part of the cast in the comedy we are enacting here : it made its apparition on the scene for a vanishingly small instant of time .
And the picture is incomplete , because we only exemplified the interaction by discussing a single boson being exchanged ; but in the subatomic world , there is no such limit .
The interaction between the two fermions is the result of a force field rather than a single boson being emitted and absorbed : if we had more patience , we would have drawn more virtual actors in the figure , as below .
Note that it is entirely possible for a fermion line to emit , and then reabsorb , the same boson , as the lower - right fermion line does in the graph above .
We can continue adding lines to the skeleton diagram , as in the third graph below .
Above , you can see that not just bosons can be virtual : a boson can materialize a virtual fermion - antifermion line - the black circle - for a short instant of time .
The asymptotic states described in the diagram do not change due to the inclusion of an arbitrary number of such virtual particle emissions and absorptions : at the beginning and at the end we just have the two real fermions , which scatter off one another ; however , their kinematics is indeed affected by the higher - order corrections due to multiple exchanges .
The important thing to point out is that any time we add a virtual particle line in the picture and go back to the blackboard to compute the resulting effect on the measurable quantity we are trying to estimate , we are making our approximation of the real physics better ; yet it remains an approximated view of what really happens .
Now , quantum field theory allows to compute physical , measurable quantities out of these virtual diagrams .
It turns out that the " higher - order corrections " to the value of the physical quantities , which result from accounting for more and more virtual exchanges , are smaller and smaller : the theory has the extremely valuable property of being perturbatively computable .
This means that one can happily stop the calculation at a given order - i.e. , by accounting for all diagrams which include a given number of virtual particle emissions - , in the certainty that the result represents a better approximation of the real value than the result obtained at a lower order .
Quantum corrections to heavy particle propagators
After the above introduction , I wish to show and comment a couple of diagrams which are crucial for the thrice - posted picture above .
They describe the propagation in space - time of the W boson and the top quark .
These two particles , together with the Z boson , are the three heaviest known elementary particles , and by virtue of their large mass , their coupling to the Higgs boson is largest .
The Higgs boson , in fact , " feels " the mass of elementary particles , and it influences them with an intensity proportional to the particle mass squared .
Because of that , by studying the phenomenology of W and Z bosons and top quarks , we gather information on the Higgs boson itself .
As far as the Z boson is concerned , its phenomenology has been studied by the four LEP experiments at CERN in the nineties .
By using the amassed information on electroweak interactions involving Z bosons , it is indeed possible to extract a likely value for the mass of the Higgs .
This is typically shown as an oblong , odd - shaped ellipsoidal area ( labeled " LEP I and SLD " ) in plots like the one on the left , which demonstrates how not just the Higgs mass , but also the top quark and the W boson masses are indirectly determined by the LEP electroweak parameters .
In the version of the MW - MT plot shown at the beginning of this post there is no such information , because it has become outdated - direct determinations of top and W masses are more precise ; you can see it by comparing the blue ellipse - direct 2008 measurements of W and top masses - to the red one .
The figure shown on the right here is also useful at this point .
It demonstrates that there are a dozen different observable quantities measured by the glorious LEP experiments in electron - positron collisions at the mass of the Z boson , which can individually be used to infer the Higgs boson mass .
Sure , they are imprecise , but together they do provide a powerful input .
For each observable quantity , listed on the left as a column , a different Higgs mass bound can be obtained by comparing theory and measurement .
These are shown as points with error bars ; the green band shows instead the average value of the many determinations .
Anyway , let us forget about the Z here , and concentrate on the top and W masses , which are the ones that present - day experiments are trying to measure as precisely as possible .
They , too , are influenced by the Higgs boson , and so they give independent additional information on the latter 's mass .
The graphs on the left show examples of the quantum corrections that a heavy particle receives in its propagation , due to its coupling to the Higgs field .
Above , a vector boson " fluctuates " into a fermion - antifermion pair ( the circular " bubble " ) for a vanishingly small instant of time ; below , a boson emits , and then reabsorbs , a virtual Higgs boson ( the hatched line labeled " H " ) .
I should note that these represent just one class of the possible virtual correction diagrams ; I have no ambition to be precise in this article , and much less so exhaustive .
However , I think you understood that these diagrams represent processes that , although " virtual " , need to be accounted one way or another , in order to provide a theory which yields meaningful results from its calculations .
Quantum corrections nail down the Higgs mass
So , there are heaps of graphs like the ones above which one may draw , and then compute .
Their global effect causes a modification of one of the master formulas of the Standard Model : the one connecting the W and Z boson masses through the cosine of the so - called " Weinberg angle " ( paying tribute to one of the fathers of the Standard Model of electroweak interactions , Steven Weinberg ) .
Knowing that each formula I post halves the number of my readers , I afford myself only two formulas today .
Here is the first :
As you can see , the ratio between W and Z masses squared , modulated by the cosine of the Weinberg angle , is called " rho zero " .
Rho , at " tree level " - i.e. omitting quantum corrections - is equal to one in the SM .
Quantum corrections such as those pictured in the figures shown above modify the value of rho .
If one calculates the variation , one comes up with something like this , our second formula for today :
Now , if you belong to the 25 % of readers who survived these two mathematical abuses , please forget the complications in the latter expression and the odd coefficients , and focus on one simple fact : the formula for the variation of rho from unity contains the squared W and top masses ( labeled and , duh ) , and the logarithm of the Higgs mass squared ( guess its symbol ) .
Now , rho can be measured , because we do measure W and Z masses , as well as the Weinberg angle , the latter in a number of ways .
So here is the key : by measuring electroweak parameters and masses of bosons and top quark , we can insert them in the formula above , invert it solving for mH , and extract an estimate for the logarithm of the Higgs mass !
( One word of caution : the formula above is not the whole story as far as the variation of the rho parameter is concerned ; it only describes the variation due to " self - energy " diagrams .
Again , my purpose here is to be didactic and not exhaustive ) .
There you have it .
If you look again at the MW - MT plot , you can appreciate how indeed the variation of Higgs mass caused by a downward shift of the W mass , or - much less dramatically - by a upward shift of the top mass , is very fast : it is the consequence of the inversion of the formula to explicitate the Higgs mass .
By the same token , you can now understand why the figure shown above , where different determinations of the Higgs mass using different electroweak observables are displayed , is made with a logarithmic horizontal axis .
I think you will forgive me now , dear readers , if I stop this post here before it becomes too long to be fruitful .
There would be a whole lot more to say about this topic , but I reserve the right to verify whether this post was indeed read by a sufficient number of readers , and the amount of time they spent here .
I do not mind a small audience , but the effort must be adequate to the return ...
Remember the OpenOffice.org prototype ?
Now you can try the Renaissance Impress ( thanks to Gnu / Linux Atelier for the link ) without any installation ( but you do ) .
Remember that this is just a prototype , only to be used to see how it looks .
That being said , you can download the Impress prototype from HERE .
After running Impress , you will notice a window where you can change between different variants of scrolling toolbars or fixed label toolbar ( see image above ) .
I played a bit with it and I must say that yeah , it does copy MS Office ribbon , but it 's definitely an improvement over the old OpenOffice interface ( I know a lot of you are fond of the old looks and probably do n't want change , but change is not always bad ... ) .
For instance , I really liked the 3D slide show :

Wobbling earth triggers climate change
Regular wobbles in the earth 's tilt were responsible for the global warming episodes that interspersed prehistoric ice ages , according to new evidence .
The finding is the result of research led by Dr Russell Drysdale of the University of Newcastle that has been able to accurately date the end of the penultimate ice age for the first time .
The new dates , which appear in the today 's edition of Science , show the end of the second last ice age occurring 141,000 years ago , thousands of years earlier than previously thought .
Using information gathered from a trio of Italian stalagmites , the research has punched a hole in the prevailing theory that interglacial periods are related to changes in the intensity of the northern hemisphere summer .
Drysdale and colleagues suggest that the earth emerges from ice ages due in large part to changes in the tilt of the planet in relation to the sun , otherwise known as its obliquity .
This affects the total amount of sunlight each hemisphere receives in its respective summer , rather than the peak intensity of the solar radiation during the northern summer .
Dating ice ages
Sediment on the sea floor contains accurate a record of what happened to the earth 's climate prior to the last ice age .
But up until now dating the sediment and the evident climatic changes has not been possible .
Drysdale and colleagues overcome this difficulty by comparing the changes in the sea floor to similar material on the surface that can be accurately dated .
Dr John Hellstrom of the University of Melbourne used a sensitive mass spectrometer to measure the amount of uranium and thorium contained in samples taken from the three stalagmites in the Italian Antro del Corchia cave to date the material .
They were then able to relate variations in the chemical composition of the stalagmites , to changes in the North Atlantic sea floor , thereby dating the changes .
" When it 's cold in the ocean , there is less evaporation and less rainfall above the cave .
When it 's warm in the ocean , there 's a lot more water evaporated and a lot more rain , " says Hellstrom .
Then and now
This technique for dating the comings and goings of prehistoric ice sheets has the potential for tracking climate changes much further back than ever before .
The result is that the new date for the end of the second last ice age is thousands of years too early to be related to any increase in the intensity of the northern hemisphere summer as predicted by the Milankovitch Theory .
Instead , the researchers found that , in the past million years global warming events have occurred every second or third cycle of the earth 's changing obliquity , which occurs every 41,000 years .
Hellstrom says that the new knowledge may assist in calibrating the effectiveness of current climate modelling technology .
" Any improvement we can have in understanding how the earth 's orbital parameters affect our coming in and out of ice ages can certainly affect the models used now too . "
The team are now using their measurements to investigate the provocative idea that the glacial melting periods actually began in the Southern Hemisphere .
The next series of The Apprentice could be rescheduled if a general election is called next spring because of Sir Alan Sugar 's new role as a government adviser , it emerged today .
The 62 - year - old entrepreneur took up a seat in the House of Lords on Monday and is the government 's new " enterprise champion " .

Critics said the dual role would compromise the BBC 's political impartiality , and the corporation 's governing body , the BBC Trust , said broadcasting the show in the run-up to an election could be seen as giving unfair publicity to the Labour Party .
To avoid undermining public confidence in the corporation , the BBC should give " due consideration to the implications of showing the programmes in the months immediately before a general election " , Trust chairman Sir Michael Lyons said .
The Conservatives had complained to the BBC that Lord Sugar 's appointment could breach corporation rules on impartiality in the lead - up to the vote , which must be held by June 3 next year .
Sir Michael said it was important that the public had confidence in BBC impartiality and did not feel presenters ' and programme makers ' outside interests compromised their positions .
" The Committee notes that there is now less than a year before the next general election and that this increases the sensitivity caused by Lord Sugar 's dual role , " he said .
" Scheduling decisions are a matter for the Executive .
But the Trust is clear that when scheduling next year 's transmission of The Apprentice and Junior Apprentice the Executive must give due consideration to the implications of showing the programmes in the months immediately before a general election . "
This year The Apprentice ran from March until early June , and the trust 's editorial standards committee said Lord Sugar 's role as a government adviser created a " greater than normal risk " to the corporation 's impartiality .

But the committee ruled there was no inherent conflict of interest , providing that strict safeguards were followed .
Under guidelines set out by BBC management , the businessman , who officially became Baron Sugar of Clapton in the Borough of Hackney on Monday , may not campaign on behalf of the government , and must take care that his image is not used in campaigning material .
The committee said that for a period immediately after the announcement of Lord Sugar 's peerage , there was a risk that public confidence in BBC impartiality could have been undermined .
A lack of clarity about the precise nature of his new role may have allowed the impression to form that the appointment would compromise the corporation 's political independence , the committee ruled .
The committee also criticised BBC management over Lord Sugar 's appearance at an event in Gateshead to promote the National Apprenticeship Service ( NAS ) .
While apprenticeships enjoyed widespread support across parties , the committee said , the event should have been regarded as political activity and referred to the BBC executive for consent .
The Conservatives said they were still unhappy with Lord Sugar 's dual role .
The shadow culture secretary , Jeremy Hunt , said : " The BBC Trust has admitted what we have known all along , that Alan Sugar 's Government appointment risks the impartiality , integrity and independence of the BBC .
" Whatever restrictions the BBC seeks to put on his political activities Lord Sugar is taking the Labour whip and has an official Government role .
" It 's amazing that the Trust has therefore not explained why licence fee payers should fund a programme hosted by someone who will help formulate , promote , and endorse Government policies .
" The Trust has disappointingly missed an opportunity to show it has teeth when it comes to enforcing impartiality obligations . "
A BBC spokesman said it had always taken particular care over party political fairness around elections .
" When elections are called or are clearly imminent , we review all of our schedules to ensure that our output is suitable for transmission during that period , " the spokesman said .
" The Trust has emphasised that all scheduling decisions are a matter for the BBC Executive .
However , the Executive has noted the Trust 's clear view on the particular sensitivity of broadcasting The Apprentice during an election period .
" If the next general election falls in the first part of 2010 , the Executive will of course bear the Trust 's view in mind when it considers when to transmit the next series of The Apprentice . "
The cause of the fault has not been revealed
A cable fault that caused a major blackout of internet services across West Africa has been repaired .
The damage was discovered 25 km ( 15 miles ) off the coast of Benin on a branch of the SAT - 3 cable , which connects Europe to South Africa .
The fault knocked out 70 % of Nigeria 's bandwidth , causing severe problems for its banking sector , government and mobile phone networks .
Services were severely disrupted or knocked out in Togo , Niger and Benin .
Countries had to either reroute traffic overland or use expensive satellite links to maintain connectivity .
Nigeria was particularly badly hit because around 70 % of its bandwidth is routed through neighbouring Benin .
The network , run by Suburban Telecom , was set up to bypass Nigeria 's principal telecoms operator Nitel which runs the SAT - 3 branch cable which lands in Nigeria .
The SAT - 3 consortium diverted a ship from Cape Town in South Africa to repair the fault .
It arrived in Cotonou in Benin late Saturday evening and carried out repairs on Sunday morning .
The cause of the fault has not been revealed .
SAT - 3 is currently the only fibre optic cable serving West Africa .
The 15,000 km ( 9,300 mile ) SAT - 3 cable lands in eight West African countries as it winds its way between Europe and South Africa .
Two new cables are planned for the area .
The Main One cable is expected to be completed in 2010 whilst the West Africa Cable System ( WACS ) is due in 2011 .
Despite a flat reading for U.S. consumer prices in April , the annual inflation rate fell with the sharpest decline in 54 years , the government reported on Friday .
The Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) remained unchanged in April after decreasing 0.1 % in March .
However , a reduction in the cost of energy over the past 12 months helped drive the annual rate 0.7 % lower , marking the second straight monthly dip and the biggest decline since August 1955 .
" The era of U.S. consumer price deflation is now upon us as the ongoing economic recession and deteriorating labor market conditions continue to weaken the bargaining power of retailers and laborers alike , thereby quenching the once raging inflationary flames , " Millan Mulraine , economics strategist for TD Securities , was quoted on Forbes.com
There is a debate raging between economists on whether a threat to the approaching economy is rising inflation or spiraling , out of control falling prices , known as deflation .
" It ’s impossible to see how deflation can persist given the amount of liquidity in the system , " Maxwell Clarke , chief U.S. economist at 4Cast.com in New York , was quoted on Bloomberg Thursday when the government reported an increase in producer prices .
" With oil moving back up , the thought in people ’s minds becomes that inflation could ultimately become a problem that outweighs deflation . "
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke believes the danger of deflation is " receding , " recently commenting on the Fed ’s monetary policy .
" We are currently of course being very aggressive because we are trying to avoid another form of price instability , which is deflation , " Bernanke said at a conference in Jekyll Island , Georgia , on May 11 .
" We are also committed to removing accommodation in a timely way to ensure that , as we come out of this episode and we move to a sustainable recovery , that we will have price stability , low and stable inflation , going forward . "
The CPI is a key government gauge for inflation .
The core CPI , which excludes volatile food and energy prices , is even more closely watched .
It rose by 0.3 % in April following three monthly gains of 0.2 % .
However , 40 percent of the April increase came from a huge 9.3 % rise in tobacco prices due to higher federal taxes .
The core CPI is up 1.9 % over the past year .
That is within the Federal Reserve ’s traditional comfort 1 % - 2 % range .
Consumer price details
Rising April prices include :
Tobacco and smoking products rose 9.3 % after a 11 % jump in March
New vehicles prices rose 0.4 % after a climb of 0.6 % March and following a 0.8 % increase in February
Medical care rose 0.4 % in April after a 0.2 % increase in March
Education and communication prices gained 0.3 % after 0.2 % increases for two straight months
Declining April prices include :
Food and beverage prices fell 0.2 % after two straight months of 0.1 % declines
Energy costs fell 2.4 % .
Prices had declined 3.0 % in March and rose 3.3 % in February
Gasoline prices fell 2.8 % .
Natural gas prices fell 7 % .
Housing prices , which accounts for about 40 % of the CPI index , declined 0.1 % for the second straight month
Clothing prices dropped 0.2 % following the same decline in March and 1.3 % surge in February — the biggest increase in nearly 20 years
Airfares declined 1.5 % after a 2.3 % drop in the prior month
Used car and truck prices fell just 0.1 % after two consecutive months of 1.7 % declines
In a separate report Thursday , the Labor Department said Producer price rose 0.3 % in April .
A companion - like report to the CPI , the PPI measures prices at the factory door and inflation pressures before they reach the consumer .

A short history of why we eat oil , can't smoke pot , and why assault weapons are so expensive in our hour of need
( With running commentary by THE SCREAMING MAN )
Well , for starters , the above title is a damned lie , since this little screed is not a history .
It 's just rumination on the tilting point at which Americans started the slide into the deepest sort of cultivated consumer consciousness -- which is to say our corporate managed engorgement and swinedom at the service of the rich .
Very rich families and corporatists , to whom , as in earlier articles , we shall refer to as " the bastards , " have always been with us .
Even Tom Jefferson thought periodic revolution against wealth and authority was desirable to keep these bastards in check .
Which implies that he figured they would inevitably get us by the throat down on the floor from time to time .
But the bastards scared the hell out of later presidents too .
Abe Lincoln feared the large corporations born of business profiteering during the U.S. Civil War -- the military industrial complex of the day -- easily constituted the greatest threat to the American republic .
Being president and all , he could n't call them what they were , and settled for the term " money power , " and predicted that , " money power will … work upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed . "
And as everyone knows , Dwight Eisenhower famously feared the same military - industrial complex was busy taking over the nation .
What we never hear about though , is that Eisenhower 's definition of the complex included among the bastards , not only the military defense industry corporations , but also right alongside them the news media and the university and private research establishments .
If nothing else can be said for the bastards , we must admit they do plan far ahead , ( or seemed to anyway , before the latest meltdown ) even if only to screw us blind , which is usually the case .
Since the early robber baron era of John D. Rockefeller 's Standard Oil , just after the turn of the century , the bastards understood that the key to national domination was oil -- creating an economic culture based on petroleum -- and planned toward that end .
Big corps such as E.I. DuPont had invested heavily in the oil industry since the turn of the century , and especially since the 1930s creating synthetic materials such as plastics , in which the public was decidedly uninterested in buying .
Then World War II came along , creating big demand for synthetics such as nylon for parachutes , tires , tents , ropes .
DuPont and similar bastards had drawn a royal flush .
SCREAMING MAN HERE !: RIGHT !
IT 'S THE ONLY SURE RACKET .
ASK ICE MAN CHENEY .
YOU MAKE STUFF , SELL IT TO THE PENTAGON MOB AND RAM THE PRICE CLEAR UP THEIR ASSES .
THEN THEY BLOW THE STUFF UP , INCENERATE IT , AND COME BACK FOR MORE AT DOUBLE THE PRICE BECAUSE NOW THERE'S A SHORTAGE !
FOR A FAST DEPENDABLE BUCK , YOU CAN'T BEAT INDUSTRIAL SCALE WARFARE WITH A GODDAMNED STICK !
( Ahem ! )
Unfortunately all good things end , no matter how bloody profitable .
But those super - expanded wartime corporations that had cranked out planes and tanks were not going to downsize just because we had run out of Dresdens to bomb .
They intended to remain dominant and even expand .
With the war drawing to a close , and with fewer burning jeep tires on the battlefields and fewer parachutes left dangling in the trees of Belgium , American citizens were going to have to eat the slack .
The bastards would have to stuff 'em fuller than a Christmas goose ; make them eat petroleum based synthetics , if it came down to that .
Which it eventually did of course , in the form of petrochemical agriculture , food dyes , etc .
SCREAMING MAN : YOU GOTTA A FUCKING PROBLEM WITH NUMBER TWO RED DYE OR SOMETHING , ASSHOLE ?
DON'T BULLSHIT THESE PEOPLE , YOU FLAMING OLD FRAUD !
I'VE SEEN YOU EAT A WHOLE BOX OF PINK HO - HOS BEHIND A BOTTLE OF JAY DEE AND SOME COLUMBIAN BUD !
AM I GONNA HAVE TO TAKE MY NEEDLE NOSED PLIERS TO YOUR LYING ASS ?
Plastics , heralded as durable and everlasting ( and today lamented for the same reason ) eventually gobbled up nearly every other material market , in the from of jewelry , dashboards , dishes , clothing , napkin rings , perfume bottles , knickknacks , flooring and carpeting , resin building materials , vinyl raincoats and boots , molded furniture , radio sets … America was remade in the image of open chain hydrocarbons .
That nine tenths of what was produced and marketed was unnecessary , and downright shitty did not go unnoticed by the American public , which had been deeply distrustful of plastics and synthetics from the time they were first ballyhooed at the 1933 Chicago World 's Fair .
People were just not buying the sales job .
But the combination of wartime shortage frustrations and massive industrial public relations delivered the one - two punch , and the consumer knuckled under .
Or perhaps they were just worn down by industry PR , which enlisted the help of trusted figures such as Frank Capra and Walt Disney , among others , along with in - school industry propaganda for the next generation : " Our story of the miracle of plastics starts with an oil well in a faraway place by the Persian Gulf … "
AND IT GODDAMNED WELL IS GONNA END THERE TOO !
IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES , IF IT HASN'T ALREADY !
DOES ANYBODY REALIZE THE NUMBER OF SARAH PALIN BLOW -UP DOLLS SHIPPED TO THE TROOPS IN IRAQ ?
IF THAT'S THE KIND OF ARMY WE'RE SENDING TO KILL OFF THE PALM VERMIN , THEN WE'RE GONERS ALREADY !
As I was saying , the bastards not only created an economy by and for themselves , based on the black sticky stuff , they also built a civilization .
From the tallest building right down to the petrochemical soaked dirt in which the food supply is grown , and all along the chain through processing and plastic packaging and distribution ,
The black stuff was cheap and it was plentiful , so long as the bastards were willing to buy off the top dog sheiks like ibn Saud , who would in turn keep the dusky peasantry in line through good old perennials such as beheadings and public stonings .
SCREAMING MAN MISSES THOSE POST 9/11 BEHEADING VIDEOS , DON'T YOU ?
IT WAS SO EASY TO TELL WHO AMERICA'S ENEMIES WERE THEN .
BUT AT LEAST WE'VE STILL GOT BEN BERNANKE AND BILL GATES .
During the 1940s AND '50S while ibn Saud was fathering some 60 children by 22 wives in Arabia and dishing out corporeal punishment to the far flung wretches of his kingdom , here at home the corporations were doing their own hit jobs on the this nation 's peasantry -- the farmers .
Petroleum based synthetics , with legislative help , wiped out one quarter of the domestic cotton market in the first few years following the war , along with flax for linen , and hemp fiber , replacing them with ugly but profitable synthetic nylon and polymer textiles .
Not to mention replacement of literally hundreds of farm produced natural organic materials for medicines , cosmetics , milk by products such as casein for glues and paints , with synthetic petro - based commodities , all of which were mercilessly hammered into the populace as " miracles of modern science . "
Kings may croak , but cash lives forever
The fact that the bastards were corporate entities made them more powerful than any robber baron 's best wet dream , because their power and reach extended beyond human mortality .
Deathless corporations and trusts replaced the mortal thieves such as Rockefeller and Morgan ; and despite the advent of income taxes , capital continued to aggregate in the bastards ' coffers , particularly financial bastards , at what was seen then as an unimaginable scale .
" Money for nothin ' and chicks for free ... "
Powered entirely by balance sheets , and existing for the sole le purpose of wealth accumulation , parting with any assets was antithetical to their very purpose .
Not to mention the logic of the wealth based stockholders .
The majority of assets were held by elite , whose main accomplishment was then and still is coming from families that commandeered some substantial portion of the public medium of exchange in order to derive more wealth .
WHOA THERE FATSO !
WHOSE FAMILY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE ?
PARIS HILTON'S ?
OR MAYBE ALICE WALTON'S ?
PARIS HILTON HAS EARNED EVERY JEWEL ENCRUSTED THONG IN HER CLOSET !
FROM TUSH TO TITTIES , WE'VE SEEN EVERYTHING PARIS HILTON HAS TO OFFER .
AND IT'S WORTH A FEW BILLION TO KEEP HER IN CIRCULATION .
GIVES THE MEN OF THIS MISERABLE WORKHOUSE NATION SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN .
SOMETHING TANGIBLE .
SOMETHING THEY CAN ACTUALLY SEE AND WHACK OFF TO .
HER DIRTY FLICK , " 1 NIGHT IN PARIS " WAS A GIFT TO ALL MANKIND .
LET THE LESBIANS FIND THEIR OWN PARIS HILTON … BUT ALICE WALTON ?
SCREAMING MAN WOULDN'T FUCK HER WITH YOUR WHANG , BUSTER !
THAT MISERABLE DRUNKEN BITCH RAN DOWN AND KILLED A FIFTY YEAR OLD WOMAN IN TEXAS .
WHAT'D SHE GET ?
A $ 925 FINE !
SHE HAS 20 BILLION DOLLARS AND GETS OFF FOR LESS THAN A THOU .
AND WHAT DOES ALICE GIVE US ?
CHINK MADE FLIPFLOPS AND GODDAMNED PLASTIC PATIO CHAIRS THAT BUCKLE LIKE OBAMA AT A BAILOUT PARTY !
GIVE THE SCREAMING MAN PARIS HILTON ANY DAY .
NOW , FATSO … YOU WERE SAYING ?
Hell , I can't remember .
Oh yes , the bastards .
Once you are born into the Royal Court of the Kingdom of Bastardy and are issued your caviar spoon , no further effort is required to amass capital .
You simply keep on withholding capital from those who had create it -- the working masses -- keep captive the economic lifeblood upon which all others depend .
Observe , for instance , the banking industry 's present refusal to unass any money for credit , despite the hundreds of billions handed to them as a taxpayers ' gift , a bailout AFTER they 'd ripped off their shareholders and customers , and looted their own institutions from the inside .
UPSET ARE YOU , FATSO ?
LET THE SCREAMER TELL YOU HOW IT REALLY IS .
IT WAS ALL AN ACT .
THE FED WAS JUST PRINTING AND HANDING OUT WORTHLESS WALLPAPER -- WHICH THE BANKING BASTARDS , WITH ALL DUE APLOMB , WILL PAY BACK IN KIND .
THEN THE BASTARDS WILL BE DECLARED SOLVENT , FAT AND HEALTHY AS A BUNCH OF PARK BEARS .
MEANWHILE , YOU GODDAMNED PEASANTS WILL CONTINUE TO ANGUISH OVER THE BAILOUTS LONG AFTER THE REAL RIP - OFF IS IN .
THE ONE YOU NEVER SAW AND CAN'T EVEN WRAP YOUR SORRY POINTED FUCKING HEADS AROUND .
THE REAL DOUGH IS SPREAD ACROSS DUBAI , MONACO , LONDON , AND FOR SAFETY'S SAKE , BEIJING .
WHILE YOU ANGUISH , PATE OF UNBORN VEAL CALF IS BEING SERVED TO THE REAL BASTARDS UP ON THE 50th FLOOR .
THEY POUR ANOTHER GLASS OF 1999 PERRIER - JOUET , AND CHORTLE AT THE DISMEMBERMENT OF A NO - TALENT HACK LIKE BERNIE MADOFF .
THAT HAPLESS SMALLTIME JEW GREASEBALL WHO CAME INTO THE GAME WITH $ 5,000 IN PENNY STOCKS THAT HE BOUGHT WITH MONEY HE MADE INSTALLING SPRINKLERS .
NEVER A REAL PLAYER LIKE US , EVEN WITH HIS BULLSHIT WALL STREET TITLES .
JUST A DUMB FUCK FROM QUEENS WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHEN TO QUIT A SCAM .
LET THE SERFS GNAW AT HIM .
KEEPS 'EM BUSY AND OUT OF OUR HAIR .
LOOK , THEY'VE PULLED ONE OF HIS ARMS OUT OF ITS SOCKET .
CHRIST , NOW THEY'VE RUINED LUNCH . "
THAT'S WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON , FATSO .
The bastards .
Why have they lasted this long ?
Purely on their own merits , most American corporations probably would not have survived the 1930s .
By then our wildly fluctuating economy was already demonstrating the folly of overly concentrated capital and power .
What was needed , said the big players who'd wrecked the economy with their uncontrolled speculation and greed , was , lo and beshit , a controlled economy !
One even more controlled by corporations .
Problem was , the only entity capable of such control was the government .
And unfortunately , the Constitution of the United States was founded on a separation of business and state to the same degree as that of church and state .
If the bastards were to run the economy , if Americans were going to be pistol whipped down the road to " prosperity through unprecedented consumption , " then government authority by Constitutional law would be necessary .
As a 1937 shareholder 's report of the E.I. DuPont Company " the revenue - raising power of government [ taxation ] must be converted into " an instrument for forcing acceptance of sudden new ideas " and a " social reorganization . "
Uh oh !
Just whose sudden new ideas ?
And what kind of social reorganization ?
The report stated bluntly that to realize further extensive profit from its wartime investments , the U.S. government " must be the primary tool . "
While their plans to use the government were put into the shareholder 's report , they were never publicly discussed .
FDR saves the bastards ' bacon
The chance to pull it off came ironically or maybe not so ironically , with Roosevelt 's New Deal .
FDR was , contrary to the subsequent hagiography that has grown up around his grave , was first and foremost a capitalist and was determined to save capitalism .
Given his affluent background and times , he , like everyone else , could not imagine anything but capitalism as the nation 's economic system .
Yet nowhere in the Constitution is capitalism specified as America 's preferred economic system .
His lifelong circle of friends and associates consisted entirely of the elites of family and corporate wealth , which meant that it also included some of his enemies .
But together they created a host of " emergency legislation , " in much the same fashion as 911 let George W. Bush get away with so much under the excuse of a national threat .
Even allowing for the resistance of some wealthy elites , FDR favored the bastards ' plans toward a thoroughly corporatized national economy .
The Supreme Court , however , a stickler for details such as the U.S. Constitution , did not see things Roosy 's way .
It would take a rewriting of the U.S. Constitution for the government to crawl into bed with the corporations .
So every piece of legislation FDR and his cohorts created got snagged in Supreme Court and just kept piling up .
The key for FDR and the Princes of Bastardy turned out to be taxation .
To control society means to control individual behavior .
The Constitution prohibits that , except for those few powers granted in the Constitution , such as the coinage of money or declaring war .
Throughout the 1930s the public watched FDR and the corporatists duke it out with the Supreme Court .
While the public was engaged in the debate over FDR 's threatened stacking of the court , FDR and the bastards managed to accomplish their agenda in controlling opposing social behavior -- taxing it to death .
The government is granted the power to tax by god !
And the Roosevelt era saw the art of behavior modification through taxation perfected .
Now in changing American social behavior through taxation there are two rules .
The first tax must be a very logical one .
And the second must be one created of whole cloth , a manufactured one to counter a manufactured threat .
So after the Supreme Court knuckled under to FDR 's threat to divide up the judicial limelight by appointing more justices , a more compliant court happily passed a $ 200 tax on machine guns -- the equivalent of $ 3,000 today -- the same tax , incidentally , that allowed the ATF ( Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms division ) and the FBI to invade the Branch Davidians at Waco .
It was unconstitutional as hell .
But the court understood public relations .
What kind of deranged fucker needed a machine gun anyway ?
Well , there was There was John Dillinger ( whose penis was 14 inches long , according to folk legend of the day , which was either threatening , or vastly intriguing , depending upon one 's sex or moral perspective on life ) .
There was Seymour " Blue Jaws " Magoon , Bonnie and Clyde , Pittsburg Phil , Baby Face Nelson , Al Capone , Bummy Davis .
And if there was any further doubt , there was also the fact that the members of Murder Incorporated were Jewish , Italian or Irish .
Ah ha !
More proof to the then - majority Anglo Americans of naked immigrant depravity .
So two hundred bucks per tommy gun it would be under the 1937 Machine Gun Tax Act .
The second tax the court upheld was the 1937 Marijuana Tax Act .
Most Americans had never heard the word marijuana .
The tax act had adopted a little known Mexican street term as a name in order to demonize it , and differentiate it from the thousands of acres of government hemp being grown for naval ropes , etc .
Never mind that in the entire previous year only a couple of pounds of the stuff were seized by border police .
A $ 200 an ounce tax had worked on machine guns , so a $ 200 tax per ounce was placed on hemp cultivation without permit , and no permits were issued .
And so as an added bonus -- or maybe intentionally -- the synthetic fiber industry and the plastics industry saw its most threatening long term competitor , hemp , eliminated .
And for the first time in the history of the United States the bastards could use the government to tell farmers what seeds they could put into the earth .
In short order by way of the New Deal , through various agricultural acts , corporatists , through government policy , had control over the land even though they did not own it .
The chief competitors to industrial food giants and synthetics industry , the small farmer producers of thousands of natural goods and raw materials , were eventually taxed or regulated out of existence .
At the same time , subsidies for big - time agri-biz producers started snowballing .
A nation of consumers of synthetics was cultivated in the next generation .
The result we see around us , obese Americans willingly wearing the bastards ' brands on acrylic clothing … and guzzling synthetic soft drinks , Americans who 've never once considered that the pizza crusts they gnaw at start out with a grain crop called wheat .
Ten thousand years of agriculture was synthesized into money .
The soil - to - city chain of small farms , villages , and towns to the great city markets was destroyed .
Those ever more profitable compressed gobs of humanity in the cities and suburbs could be cultivated for maximum productivity and profit as the bastards increased their domination of the needs hierarchy .
If you made a movie of this , swapping out the humans for some sort of large intelligent rodent or insect , and left everything else as it really is in American life , people would call it chilling science fiction .
Long story short :
The bastards won .
This distillation of how they won , this little piece of feral scholarship , is sure to be disputed by hairsplitting pinheads in political science and history departments .
The " Oh but … " crowd .
Which is OK with me .
Everybody needs a job , I suppose .
But that 's the view from here in the cheap seats among the non-players , the fuckees in the great fuck - the - proles game of bastard politics and ever bigger money .
Call this a pulp comic summary of post war history .
It 's not a very damned funny history .
Maybe that 's why we choose not to remember it .
Here in the United States of Amnesia .
We cannot retain what happened last week , much less history .
But I 'm trying here folks .
I really am .
SCREAMING MAN : BULLSHIT FOLKS !
DON'T BELIEVE A WORD FROM THIS GODDAMNED BEER SOAKED , REDNECK WHO CAN'T SPELL AND THINKS HE'S A GENIUS BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW TO BRING UP WIKIPEDIA ON HIS BROWSER .
IF AND WHEN HE'S SOBER ENOUGH .
THE SCREAMING MAN HAS BEEN TRAPPED INSIDE BAGEANT'S BLOATED , DISEASED CARCASS FOR SIXTY TWO YEARS , AND THE SCREAMER CAN TELL YA THIS : IF BRAINS WERE DYNAMITE BAGEANT WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO BLOW OFF A GOOD FART .
YOU'VE JUST WASTED TWENTY FUCKING MINUTES OF COMPANY TIME .
NOW GO TAKE UP SOMETHING USEFUL , LIKE NARCOTICS .

Full ' Jungle Monkey ' Email by Officer Justin Barrett
Here 's the full text of the email sent by Boston police officer Justin Barrett to Boston Globe columnist Yvonne Abraham in response to her criticism of the arrest of Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr .
Barrett :
That was by far the worst article I 've ever read .
I am a former English teacher , writer , current police officer , father , husband and military veteran .
You need to be corrected and I certainly hope others have attempted , for your written messages and material is so 4th grade level , I am embarrassed I paid 1.50 for the paper [ rest assured , it is my aim to tell as many readers The Boston Globe and your biased reporting is both sub standard and strictly one sided ] .
For you are not professional and basically , your writing is ridiculous .
A reader may assume , per your article , that criminals are never well - dressed with a tucked in polo [ 2nd paragraph ] .
Your defense [ 4th paragraph ] of Gates while he is on the phone while being confronted [ INDEED ] with a police officer is assuming he has rights when considered a suspect .
He is a suspect and will always be a suspect .
His first priority of effort should be to get off the phone and comply with the police , for if I was the officer he verbally assaulted like a banana - eating jungle monkey , I would have sprayed him in the face with OC [ oleoresin caseinate aka pepper gas ] deserving of his belligerent non-compliance .
Further [ 5th paragraph ] , a reader may assume that crimes only happen in back alleys at 0300 ?!
You 're kidding me , right ?
Are you still in the 5th Grade , Catholic School ?
That paragraph was a s pathetic as jungle monkey gibberish -- I might as well ax you the question , Is this your first test at reporting ? "
You do not understand roles , tactics , and dangers police officers face , as apparently you think no one wearing a polo might possess a firearm of knife on his / her person .
Might you fathom a woman could be a criminal ?
Or are criminals all hairy , dirty , stinky , mean ugly looking men ?
You are a hot little bird with minimal experience in a harsh field .
You are a fool .
An infidel .
You have no business writing for a US newspaper nevermind [ sic ] detailing and analyzing half truths .
You should serve me coffee and donuts on Sunday morning .
My last point counters your final 2 paragraphs , in which you state Gates is , " this immensely famous expert on race " -- you really have to be kidding me ?
Famous for what ?
Expert why and says who ?
What has he done for the law enforcement community or military veterans or to secure freedoms and our borders in this country ?
What has he done to limit and reduce my income tax ?
He has proven to work to get himself attention and become a wealthy lecturer .
He lectures students on the subject of racial ethics and profiling .
Jee whiz .
I must attend that lecture lest I lose my identity and right to free speech and the right to celebrate God and beliefs as I see fit .
I am not a racist , but I am prejudice towards people whop are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they claim is freedom when it is merely attention because you do not receive enough of it in your little fear - dwelling circle of on - the - bandwagon followers .
You mention gates ' charges were dropped but that it was too late to stop the damage ?
Damage ?
Still kidding ?
You need to serve a day with the infantry and get swarmed by black gnats while manning your sector .
Or you just need to get slapped , look in the mirror and admit , " Wow , I am a failure .
I am a follower .
Who am I kidding ? "
Again I like a warm cruller and hot Panamanian , black .
No sugar .
Your final statement reads , Gates , whose great success has allowed him to transcend the racial divide " to which I ask , when did he transcend ?
He indeed has transcended back to a bumbling jungle monkey , thus he forever tremains [ sic ] amid this nation 's great social / racial divide that makes it a free and great nation mixed with crazy awkward differences .
Go ahead , ax me what I think ?
Gates is a goddamned fool and you the article writer simply a poor follower and maybe worse , a poor writer .
Your article title should read CONDUCT UNBECOMING A JUNGLE MONKEY –BACK TO ONE'S ROOTS .

Researchers have largely put to rest a long debate on the underlying mechanism that has caused periodic ice ages on Earth for the past 2.5 million years – they are ultimately linked to slight shifts in solar radiation caused by predictable changes in Earth 's rotation and axis .
In a publication to be released Friday in the journal Science , researchers from Oregon State University and other institutions conclude that the known wobbles in Earth 's rotation caused global ice levels to reach their peak about 26,000 years ago , stabilize for 7,000 years and then begin melting 19,000 years ago , eventually bringing to an end the last ice age .
The melting was first caused by more solar radiation , not changes in carbon dioxide levels or ocean temperatures , as some scientists have suggested in recent years .
" Solar radiation was the trigger that started the ice melting , that 's now pretty certain , " said Peter Clark , a professor of geosciences at OSU .
" There were also changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and ocean circulation , but those happened later and amplified a process that had already begun . "
The findings are important , the scientists said , because they will give researchers a more precise understanding of how ice sheets melt in response to radiative forcing mechanisms .
And even though the changes that occurred 19,000 years ago were due to increased solar radiation , that amount of heating can be translated into what is expected from current increases in greenhouse gas levels , and help scientists more accurately project how Earth 's existing ice sheets will react in the future .
" We now know with much more certainty how ancient ice sheets responded to solar radiation , and that will be very useful in better understanding what the future holds , " Clark said .
" It 's good to get this pinned down . "
To make their analysis , the researchers used an analysis of 6,000 dates and locations of ice sheets to define , with a high level of accuracy , when they started to melt .
In doing this , they confirmed a theory that was first developed more than 50 years ago that pointed to small but definable changes in Earth 's rotation as the trigger for ice ages .
" We can calculate changes in the Earth 's axis and rotation that go back 50 million years , " Clark said .
" These are caused primarily by the gravitational influences of the larger planets , such as Jupiter and Saturn , which pull and tug on the Earth in slightly different ways over periods of thousands of years . "
That , in turn , can change the Earth 's axis – the way it tilts towards the sun – about two degrees over long periods of time , which changes the way sunlight strikes the planet .
And those small shifts in solar radiation were all it took to cause multiple ice ages during about the past 2.5 million years on Earth , which reach their extremes every 100,000 years or so .
Sometime around now , scientists say , the Earth should be changing from a long interglacial period that has lasted the past 10,000 years and shifting back towards conditions that will ultimately lead to another ice age – unless some other forces stop or slow it .
But these are processes that literally move with glacial slowness , and due to greenhouse gas emissions the Earth has already warmed as much in about the past 200 years as it ordinarily might in several thousand years , Clark said .
" One of the biggest concerns right now is how the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets will respond to global warming and contribute to sea level rise , " Clark said .
" This study will help us better understand that process , and improve the validity of our models . "
The research was done in collaboration with scientists from the Geological Survey of Canada , University of Wisconsin , Stockholm University , Harvard University , the U.S. Geological Survey and University of Ulster .
It was supported by the National Science Foundation and other agencies .

Earlier this week , the Department of Homeland Security ’s Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) Administrator Craig Fugate met with several state governors to discuss “ emergency preparedness , ” according to a press release posted on FEMA ’s website .
“ FEMA is committed to protecting and assisting our states and citizens during disasters , ” said Fugate .
“ By working together and strengthening relationships at the state level , we can continue to build the national emergency response team which includes FEMA , as well as state , local , tribal and federal partners , the private sector and faith - based organizations .
The work we are putting in now to build this team will go a long way during the next disaster . ”
Preparations are now underway for FEMA ’s NLE 09 .
On Sunday , Fugate addressed governors from around the country at the National Governors Association conference in Biloxi , Mississippi , where he “ discussed how FEMA can best support the states and their citizens as we prepare for and respond to emergencies and disasters . ”
FEMA does not specifically detail the “ next disaster , ” although Fugate had participated “ in a video teleconference with governors and officials from over a dozen hurricane prone states on his first day as Administrator . ”
Last October , investigative journalist Wayne Madsen learned from knowledgeable FEMA sources that the Bush administration had put the final touches on a plan that would see martial law declared in the United States with various scenarios anticipated as triggers .
“ The triggers include a continuing economic collapse with massive social unrest , bank closures resulting in violence against financial institutions , and another fraudulent presidential election that would result in rioting in major cities and campuses around the country , ” explained Madsen .
An additional trigger has since emerged – a mass flu pandemic the government promises will occur this autumn .
In addition , Army Corps of Engineer sources told the journalist that the assignment of the 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team ( BCT ) to the Northern Command ’s U.S. Army North will augment FEMA and federal law enforcement in the imposition of traffic controls , crowd control , curfews , enhanced border and port security , and neighborhood patrols in the event a national emergency being declared .
The BCT was assigned to duties in Iraq before being assigned to the Northern Command .
On July 3 , Infowars reported on National Guard troops training to engage in combat with “ militia ” groups .
In the exercises , held in Missouri and South Dakota , eight members of a Jefferson City - based battalion acted as a “ fictitious militant group ” and attacked military checkpoints and convoys .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
On September 30 , the Army Times reported that the BCT would be deployed in the United States under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks .
The BCT mission “ marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities , ” Gina Cavallaro wrote for the Times .
The military is prohibited under the Posse Comitatus Act from working with local law enforcement .
Madsen reported on a highly - classified document regarding the martial law scenario on April 3 , 2008 .
“ WMR has learned from knowledgeable sources within the US financial community that an alarming confidential and limited distribution document is circulating among senior members of Congress and their senior staff members that is warning of a bleak future for the United States if it does not quickly get its financial house in order .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is among those who have reportedly read the document . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The document is called “ C & R , ” short for “ conflict ” and “ revolution . ”
It reportedly states that if the United States defaults on loans and debt underwriting from China , Japan , and Russia , all of which are propping up the United States government financially , and the United States unilaterally cancels the debts , America can expect a war that will have disastrous results for the United States and the world .
“ The other scenario is that the federal government will be forced to drastically raise taxes in order to pay off debts to foreign countries to the point that the American people will react with a popular revolution against the government . ”
In November of 2008 , noted trends forecaster Gerald Celente predicted revolution , food riots and tax rebellions in America by the year 2012 .
“ Celente says that by 2012 America will become an undeveloped nation , that there will be a revolution marked by food riots , squatter rebellions , tax revolts and job marches , and that holidays will be more about obtaining food , not gifts , ” Paul Joseph Watson wrote for Prison Planet .
Celente accurately predicted the 1987 stock market crash and the fall of the Soviet Union .
More recently , Celente said “ The Greatest Depression ” will be called “ Obamageddon ” in America .
“ The measures taken by successive governments to save the politically corrupt , morally bankrupt , physically decrepit giant from collapse have served to only hasten its demise .
While the decline has been decades in the making , the acceleration of ruinous policies under the current Administration is leading the United States – and much of the world – to the point of no return , ” Celente wrote on July 1 .
On July 27 , FEMA will conduct National Level Exercise 2009 ( NLE 09 ) , scheduled to run through July 31 .
“ NLE 09 will be the first major exercise conducted by the United States government that will focus exclusively on terrorism prevention and protection , as opposed to incident response and recovery , ” a FEMA factsheet states .
It is designated as a Tier I National Level Exercise , or TOPOFF , which are exercises conducted annually in accordance with the National Exercise Program , “ which serves as the nation ’s overarching exercise program for planning , organizing , conducting and evaluating national level exercises , ” according to FEMA .
In addition to the participation of domestic “ partners , ” the FEMA exercise will include foreign troops .
“ This year the United States welcomes the participation of Australia , Canada , Mexico and the United Kingdom in NLE 09 . ”
The FEMA factsheet does not explain why the participation of foreign troops is necessary .
In February , D. H. Williams , reporting for the Daily Newscaster , revealed meetings held between FEMA , the Department of Homeland Security , and Indiana county municipal officials in the vicinity of Chicago .
The feds allegedly told the officials that every county in the country would be required to prepare a Hazard Mitigation Plan , including plans to vaccinate the entire population within 48 hours and prepare mass graves .
In addition , according to Williams ’ source , the county was asked to make plans for “ hardening ” police and fire stations , putting in hardened bunker type buildings around town , and draft up plans for the possibility of up to 400,000 refugees from Chicago entering the county .
Infowars and Prison Planet have been at the forefront of an effort to document the existence of mass graves , specifically in Phoenix and Houston .
In April of this year , The Jones Report detailed the storage of thousands of plastic coffin liners in Alabama .
Finally , it should be noted that FEMA was organized specifically for martial law .
On July 5 , 1987 , the Miami Herald reported on the existence of camps operated by FEMA “ should martial law need to be implemented in the United States . ”
The existence of the camps and Rex 84 — short for Readiness Exercise 1984 — came to light during the Iran - Contra hearings .
“ And there you have it , ” writes Allen L Roland , “ the real purpose of FEMA is to not only protect the government but to be its principal vehicle for martial law… .
This is why FEMA could not respond immediately to the Hurricane Katrina disaster — humanitarian efforts were no longer part of its job description under the Department of Homeland Security . ”
The FEMA press release states that the feds are conducting a large exercise in order to respond to “ emergencies and disasters , ” when in fact they are conducting a martial law exercise with not only state , local , and tribal “ partners , ” but foreign troops as well .

Is there any wild place that is n't going to pot ?
Yosemite National Park is the latest in a list of popular outdoor destinations to report discovery and eradication of illegal marijuana farms .
( If the photo looks familiar , it was used earlier this week to illustrate a similar occurrence in Mono County .
That followed discoveries and eradication efforts in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park .
Both discoveries prompted warnings for hikers to exercise caution and report suspicious activities . )
Yosemite rangers and National Park Service Agents , with assistance from Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks , eradicated 4,735 marijuana plants valued at nearly $ 19 million from within the park on Thursday .
They found and removed nearly 400 pounds of fertilizer , 3,000 feet of irrigation hose and 200 pounds of human trash .
The trash posed a threat to wildlife , especially bears , which are easily habituated to garbage .
Park officials did not disclose the location of the discovery .
“ Yesterday ’s operation reaffirms our commitment that Yosemite remains safe for visitors , that the park will not accept these incursions , and organized growers will not profit from these activities ” , Chief ranger Steve Shackelton said in a news release .
Presumably , this " abuse of public property " was the work of Mexican drug trafficking operations .
Hikers who stumble into these areas are urged to leave as quickly as possible and report to the nearest authorities

Sometimes , there are pieces of software , which are unfairly forgotten .
Let ’s talk about one these .
Often , while working on software projects , one finds , that there are repetitive tasks , which would be much easier to deal with , if automated .
In the C / Unix world , this task is often solved by Make ) , Java programmers prefer Apache Ant ) , Ruby programmers use Rake ) .
The fact , which is not commonly known , is , that PHP also has such instrument , and it is called Pake .
It was originally created by authors of Symfony framework .
Unfortunately , they never wrote any documentation , which killed adoption rates .
To start automating something , you need to create Pakefile . php in the root - directory of your project , define some tasks inside and run them with “ pake taskname ” from command - line .
The good news is , that tasks are defined in PHP language and syntax is quite simple :
<? php
pake_desc (‘ FOO task ’ ) ;
pake_task ( ‘ foo ’ , ‘ bar ’ ) ;
pake_desc(‘ BAR task ’ ) ;
pake_task ( ‘ bar’ , ‘ baz ’ ) ;
pake_desc(‘ BAZ task ’ ) ;
pake_task ( ‘ baz ’ ) ;
pake_alias ( ‘ default ’ , ‘ foo ’ ) ; // marking foo as default task
function run_foo( $ task , $ args )
{
echo “ foo
” ;
}
function run_bar ( $ task , $ args )
{
echo “ bar
” ;
}
function run_baz ( $ task , $ args )
{
echo “ baz
” ;
}
I defined 3 rules , gave them descriptions and specified dependencies .
Additionally , I specifed default rule .
Now , we can play with this a bit .
Create file with this contents , save it somewhere , and point your terminal to the same directory .
`
pake baz bar foo `
What happened ?
Pake looks for “ default ” task in the pakefile .
We defined “ foo ” as default .
Pake found out , that foo depends on bar , and bar depends on baz .
So , Pake runs “ baz ” , then “ bar ” and then , finally , “ foo ” .
That is as simple as it can be .
Pake has builtin support for basic file - operations ( pake_mkdirs ( ) , pake_copy ( ) , pake_rename ( ) , pake_remove ( ) ) , which are the powered - up versions of php ’s filesystem - functions , templating ( pake_replace_tokens ( ) ) , directory - mirroring ( pake_mirror ( ) ) and runners for creating PEAR - packages , Phing - commands and Simpletest .
Pake project was n’t maintained for a while , so I decided to give it a spin ( as there is a good chance , that I will be able to use it for my current projects ) .
I imported it ’s version history to GitHub .
You can find latest version here : http://github.com/indeyets/pake
My plan is to add some generally usable helpers to current branch , write some documentation and then to start work on Pake2 which would use all new features of PHP - 5.3 ( namespaces , closures , rich SPL ) .
Git - project is a source for creating pear - package .
To build one use the following command :
`
php bin / pake .php release 1.1.0a1 `
it will create “ pake - 1.1.0a1.tgz ” file in the same directory .
You can install it with the following command :
`
pear install -f pake - 1.1.0a1.tgz `
If you want to grab a prebuild pear - package of pake , you can do it here
The government must be quietly grateful to the distractions of August .
Only Computer
Weekly noticed that nine local authority workers have been sacked for accessing the personal records of celebrities , and their acquaintances held on the core database of the government 's ID scheme .
This is a significant story because government ministers have always dismissed campaigners ' claims that once all personal information is stored in a single database it will become vulnerable to abuse by those with access to the system .
Ministers have repeatedly insisted that security will be absolute and that severe penalties will deter anyone tempted to read files illegally .
Not true .
The magazine 's website reported that the nine fired were among 34 people who illegally accessed information .
Some were reprimanded , some resigned and some were sacked but none was prosecuted .
Using a freedom of information request , Computer Weekly found that Cardiff and Glasgow Councils sacked people who had looked up celebrities in the customer information system ( CIS ) which is run by the Department of Work and Pensions ( DWP ) and contains 90 million records .
Various other councils sacked people for looking up their friends , their own details and in one instance , a girlfriends .
The really important point is that these cases come from sample checks , this raises the prospect that the security of CIS is in fact much more regularly breached .
" Over 200,000 government officials have access to the database , " says the website , " including 480 local authorities , and numerous government departments , including the Department of Work and Pensions , HM Revenue & Customs , and the Courts Service .
The Child Support Agency uses the CIS to trace missing parents . "
A DWP spokesman suggested that the small number of breaches recorded indicated that unauthorised access by officials was spotted quickly .
He did not , of course , acknowledge that these cases came from sample checks generated by the system .
This is absolutely critical .
For years Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge university and NO2ID have been arguing that by their nature large databases will never be free of such abuse .
Anderson 's
Rule means you cannot construct a database with scale , functionality and security because if you design a large system for ease of access it becomes insecure , while if you make it watertight it becomes impossible to use .
And yet government presses ahead with the grand scheme of linking database together and allowing access to hundreds of thousands of officials .
A note on security contained in a DWP Information bulletin , unearthed by NO2ID , hints at the possible problem when it mentions access to tax data from Her Majesty 's Revenue and Custom .
" DWP and HMRC customer information is shared with local authorities on the understanding that only authorised access is permitted . "
The document goes on to admit that the sample checks have revealed serious security breaches and warns that anyone found abusing the system will face sanctions ranging from disciplinary action to prosecution .
Investigators will plot " audit trails showing the full access history of those under suspicion , " says the document rather unconvincingly
This may catch may a few bored council workers who have trespassed in a friend 's file but lets just imagine a more sophisticated attack involving one of those crime syndicates specialising in identity theft and about which we hear so much from ministers trying to scare us into accepting the ID card .
It surely would be an irony if the aggregation of personal information in the United Kingdom were to make identity theft more , not less , likely .
The CIS system will be the foundation of the ID card scheme .
It came into being in 2005 after Accenture and the Department of Work and Pensions completed a pilot .
It is designed to provide an overview of personal details of anyone who has a national insurance number .
It includes the deceased , their beneficiaries and details of ethnic background .
In other words , the customer information service , which incidentally has a friendly supermarket ring about it , presents a hugely attractive target for organized crime and maybe a lot of other bad hats too – foreign intelligence services , for example .
Back in 2005 Computer
Weekly suggested that CIS was " good news " because " its relatively simple design looks like achieving success . "
Today it is clear that this is the problem – it is too user friendly to be secure , which is extremely worrying given we are only at the start of this process of merging databases .
Anyway , I leave you with that cheerful thought as I go on my holiday .
I shall be away for a couple of weeks or so and unlike Tomasky will not have a computer or Blackberry with me .
Thanks to the OLPC Sugar team , there is now another way , starting from the python prompt .
" import hulahop " is where it begins .
This article will show and explain the voodoo magic incantations necessary to bring up a window where you can begin to gain access to the DOM model of the XULrunner technology .
In this way , you can begin to use technology which was designed for web browsers but has become something much much more powerful than originally intended by its designers .
XULrunner , the technology behind projects such as Firefox , is both powerful and obscure .
Even getting started with XULrunner is tricky , and even more so from dynamic languages such as python .
pyxpcomext addresses these issues , and does so from the perspective where the developer creates a " bundle " which is registered with XULrunner .
XULrunner is then started by the user , and the user opens a magic URL which triggers loading of the pyxpcomext - based application .
XULrunner the application is stand - alone , and is responsible for bringing up a window , in which the web application is displayed .
pyxpcomext provides the linkage between XULrunner and python .
Python Hulahop does something similar , but starts from a different angle .
Hulahop joins a standard GTK window to the technology behind XULrunner , thus requiring the python developer to use " import hulahop " , to create a hulahop WebView and to add it to a GTK app just as you would any other GTK widget , and to use " import xpcom " to then gain access to the WebView 's interfaces .
This is a completely different perspective , which allows the developer to embed XULrunner into GTK applications as " just another widget " .
This article will therefore first cover the " startup " phase , and then go on to describe how to interact with the resultant widget , including being able to respond to DOM events ( with python callbacks ) .
Future articles will cover more complex topics such as how to use XMLHttpRequest from python .
Diving in
First , two files must be created - hula.py and progresslistener .py .
hula.py is adapted from the OLPC " web browser " , and progresslistener .py is copied verbatim from the same project .
Here is the hula .py file :

wv.load_uri(' file:///tmp/blank.html' ) # start gtk gtk.main ( )
Briefly , then : the equivalent of firefox profile directory is set up ; a ContentListener class is declared , which is used to wrap event handling ; the main " Browser " class is declared ( in which the key point of interest is the _loaded function ) ; the rest is GTK and startup code .
Here is the progresslistener .

Briefly : the OLPC team have linked python - gobject and the xpcom " nsIWebProgressListener " interface together , so that gobject callbacks to python functions can occur when xpcom progress events occur .
What happens ?
Firstly , and crucially , the equivalent of the firefox profiles subdirectory is set up , if it does n't exist :
hulahop.startup('/home/lkcl/test ')
In this subdirectory , you will find that prefs.js , xpti.dat , pluginreg .dat , cert8.db and many other XULrunner / Gecko essential files are created , along with a Cache subdirectory .
Next , a GTK window is created , of size 800 by 600 , and a Browser instance is created ( Browser is derived from hulahop .
WebView ) .
Note also that a progress listener instance is created :
self.progress = ProgressListener ( ) self.progress.connect(' loading -stop ' , self .
_loaded ) self.progress.connect('loading-progress ' , self ._loading )
It 's thanks to ProgressListener , which wraps the nsiWebProgressListener interface , that the Browser .
_loaded and Browser .
_loading functions will be called ( through gobject signals ) as the page load progresses and finishes .
Of course , it 's necessary to load a page , but that will be covered shortly .
Before then , it 's important to note the Browser .
do_setup function :
WebView.do_setup(self ) self.progress.setup( self ) listener = xpcom.server.WrapObject( ContentInvoker(self ) , interfaces.nsIDOMEventListener ) self.window_root.addEventListener(' click ' , listener , False )
The OLPC team created a convention whereby WebView.do_setup will be called at an appropriate time ( presumably after XULrunner interfaces are initialised properly , which is something that has to be taken into consideration ) .
We take advantage of this to set up the WebView itself , and the progress listener , and then also to add an Event Listener to window .
As can be seen , this is the voodoo - magic incantation that is equivalent to " window.onclick = function ( ) {...} " in javascript .
It is absolutely crucial to note the use of the ContentInvoker class , here .
There are several conventions which the various XULrunner interfaces expect .
In the case of nsIDOMEventListener , the class instance that is wrapped using xpcom.server .
WrapObject is expected to have a method " handleEvent " .
In the case of nsIWebProgressListener , the class instance that is wrapped is expected to have functions onLocationChange , onProgressChange , onStateChange etc. even if those functions are not used ( hence , in progresslistener .py , the use of " pass " to ensure that runtime exceptions do not occur when the XULrunner engine cannot find the callbacks it expects ) .
Now we get to trigger the Browser .
_loading function , by creating a dummy web page containing no content :
f = open ( " /tmp/blank.html " , " w " ) f.write ( " " ) f.close ( ) # load the blank document .
wv.load_uri(' file:///tmp/blank.html ')
It 's worth noting here that the use of a blank document is entirely deliberate for demonstration purposes , but that literally any content , and any valid URL , could be given here .
Absolutely anything , including a remote HTML page , another XUL application ( with a chrome : URI ) , is perfectly acceptable .
All we care about , however , is that the page successfully loads , and Browser .
_loaded gets called .
Finally , we get to do something !
After all that voodoo incantation magic , we can get at the browser document instance , confident that it will not " disappear " out from under us , and confident that all the XULrunner interfaces have been initialised and will be valid .
Now it 's possible , in Browser .
_loaded , to do something :
doc = self.get_dom_window( ) . document body = doc.createElement ( " body " ) n = doc.createTextNode ( " hello " ) doc.body = body body.appendChild(n ) r = body.getBoundingClientRect ( ) print " body rect " , r.bottom , r.top , r.left , r.right body.style.setProperty('background-color ' , '# 00ff00 ' , None )
None of these functions and properties should come as a surprise : they should in fact look eerily familar to anyone who has done javascript programming .
However , we 're no longer in Kansas : this is python !
Now it can be seen clearly why a blank document was loaded , so as to be able to demonstrate the use of nsIDOMDocument 's createElement function to create a < body > element , and place it into the document .
A text node is also created , with the word " hello " in it , and this is added to the body element using appendChild .
For demonstration purposes , getBoundingRectClient is called , in order to print ( on the standard console ) the outer bounds of the body element .
Finally : instead of having a separate CSS stylesheet , the body 's " background - color " property is modified to an eye - glaring green .
Not a single bit of javascript is involved .
Window Event Handling
Lastly - there 's just one more trick that 's easy to miss : the nsIDOMWindow click handler that was created in Browser.do_setup ( ) .
When running the application , click anywhere in the window .
On the standard console , there should be some output : " click 0 " and " html " should typically be observed , indicating that the left button was used and that the main content was clicked .
Clicking on the word " hello " should show the word " body " instead .
Examine ContentInvoker.handleEvent to find out why :
def handleEvent ( self , event ) : print event.type , event. button target = event. target print " target : " , target.tagName.lower ( )
So , it can be seen that the actual event can be accessed , just as it can as if this was javascript , not python .
Note also that because of the ContentInvoker class instance , it 's possible to gain access to the Browser window ( through self .
_browser ) , so there is absolutely no excuse for creating global variables : it 's completely unnecessary to do that .
If more state information is required in the event handler , adapt ContentInvoker and add more arguments to its constructor , passing them in when the listener xpcom wrapper is created .
Conclusion
Through a little bit of voodoo magic , thanks to the OLPC Sugar team 's efforts , a declarative style of python web programming is now possible .
As Hulahop is also a GTK Widget as well as a XULrunner / Gecko Engine , it 's possible to embed Gecko into standard python gtk2 applications and still manipulate and interact with the DOM model .
Adding < embed <>> nodes to the DOM , on - demand , to fire up NPAPI plugins such as Flash and Java plugins is perfectly within the realms of possibility .
Taking DOM model manipulation to its fullest logical and inevitable conclusion , an entire new python GUI Widget Set API can be created , utilising absolutely every single feature that is available in the DOM of web browser engine technology .
The result is Pyjamas Desktop
So , for the curious : here in Pyjamas Desktop is a more sophisticated version of hula .py ( progresslistener .py is still the same ) , and its cousin , pywebkitgtk.py .
These two , hula.py and pywebkitgtk.py , are slowly being made to be identical , so that declarative applications can be created which will have exactly the same underlying python API as far as developers are concerned , and the developer or even the user can choose , at runtime , whether to pick XULrunner or WebKit , with the application needing absolutely no modifications whatsoever .
Punished for the Crimes of Others
When everyone at your job is forced to attend an unexpected sexual harassment workshop , you can figure one of the Vice Presidents was hiking the Appalachian Trail .
And when there ’s an unannounced class on ethics , it ’s a safe bet the CFO got caught with his hand in the till .
Similarly , when Uncle Sam ’s global adventures result in some terrorist blowback to the “ Homeland , ” we all wind up suffering for it .
Jerry Garcia ’s phrase , “ doing time for some other f*cker ’s crime , ” seems appropriate .
Consider the extent to which our movements are regulated and we ’re spied upon for the sake of “ fighting terrorism . ”
Our residual status as “ Land of the Free ” has been replaced by a lockdown , “ papers please ” culture .
Your bank snoops your account for the feds , looking for any suspicious movement of money that might be associated with the financing of terrorism .
The NSA snoops your emails and long - distance phone conversations .
The TSA Gestapo running the internal passport checkpoints strip you down to your socks and toss your shampoo bottles–and that ’s if you ’re lucky .
If they do n’t like your facial expression or choice of airplane reading matter , or your membership in the Wobblies or Free State Project puts you on their no - fly list , you may feel a rubber glove tickling the back of your tonsils .
Federal and state police staffers are constantly publishing helpful tips for the local Red Squads , regarding what bumper stickers or organizational memberships may indicate terrorist sympathies .
And if that ’s not enough , we ’re encouraged to spy on each other ; the feds periodically try recruiting the plumber , the electrician , and the guy from the gas or power company to keep an eye open for contraband or signs of impermissible opinions inside your house .
But it ’s all for our own safety , do n’t you know .
As Cool Hand Luke would say , you should n’t be so good to me , Cap’n .
Never mind that all these measures are likely to be ineffective .
Asymmetric warfare is about agility , developing new tactics faster than bureaucrtic national security establishments can react .
After months of methodical committee meetings and grinding of organizational wheels , the plodding bureaucrats at Homeland Security spit out a policy brilliantly designed to thwart tactics Al Qaeda used a year ago and were probably smart enough to know would only work once .
The national security bureaucrats are always busy developing foolproof methods for winning the last war , like the French spending billions on the Maginot Line .
And never mind the question of their real agenda .
Never mind the possibility that the threat of “ terrorism , ” like that of “ drugs , ” is just used as an excuse for feeding their power lust .
Never mind the likelihood that the state tracks our every movement for the simple reason that , like the rest of us , it wants to know where it ’s stuff is–and we ’re its stuff .
Let ’s just take the justifications at face value , and stipulate that the genuine aim of the policy is a good faith effort to “ keep us safe , ” to prevent another terrorist attack on the American public .
The fact remains that the primary reason for terrorism is n’t that “ they hate our freedoms ” –that ( even Pat Buchanan gets off a good one now and then ) Osama stumbled across the Bill of Rights and went ballistic .
The primary reason for terrorism is that word we used earlier–blowback .
This is where Krauthammer and Kirkpatrick usually start squealing about “ Blame America First . ”
But the United States has the closest thing to uncontested hegemony in human history ; it has military bases and garrisons in half the countries of the world , at least rivals the greatest empires in the number of governments it has overthrown and installed , and has adopted as an explicit national security policy the prevention of any rival to its hegemony .
As Noam Chomsky has pointed out , an observer from Mars would probably assume that such a hegemonic global power just MIGHT have something to do with the state of world political and economic affairs .
In virtually every national civil war and insurgency , every ethnically - based territorial dispute , there ’s a pretty good chance that United States arm sales , military advisers and CIA shenanigans hold the balance of power .
From the standpoint of those engaged in such local conflicts , therefore , influencing American public opinion in a dramatic way is the key to victory .
And that just removes the question of real motivation back a step .
The military bases and garrisons , the carrier groups , the military budget that dwarfs those of the rest of the world combined , are there for a purpose .
And that purpose is to prop up a global economic and political order .
In the immortal words of Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler , USMC ,
“ “ I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business , for Wall Street and the bankers .
In short , I was a racketeer , a gangster for capitalism … .
Looking back on it , I might have given Al Capone a few hints .
The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts .
I operated on three continents . ”
Lest one dismiss that as the raving of an “ America - hater , ” consider the commendable frankness of corporate globalization ’s number one defender , Tom Friedman :
“ ‘ The hidden hand of the market will never work without a hidden fist .
McDonald ’s cannot flourish without McDonnell Douglas … .
And the hidden fist that keeps the world safe for Silicon Valley ’s technologies to flourish is called the US Army , Air Force , Navy , and Marine Corps . ”
( Of course that ’s nonsense ; the market would work just fine without the national security state .
It ’s the market that the global corporations really want protection from . )
So every time some goon in uniform demands your papers , take comfort in the fact that we ’re all doing our little part to keep the world safe for Bill Gates .
The tantalizing question about William Gibson ’s ideas in his novel Neuromancer involves their relationship with the course that the Web took and continues to take as Neuromancer ’s publication date -- July 1 , 1984 , 25 years ago today - - recedes farther into the past .
In his afterword to the 2000 re-release of the book , novelist Jack Womack suggests that Neuromancer may have directly influenced the way the Web developed -- that it may have provided a blueprint that developers who grew up with the book consciously or subconsciously followed .
Womack asks “ what if the act of writing it down , in fact , brought it about ? ”
I 'll take a stab at discussing Neuromancer ’s major tech inventions , including the ones that are already coming true , as well as some that seem unlikely to happen anytime soon .
First , a little background .
Neuromancer tells the story of Case , once a hot and high - paid cyberspace cowboy who could infiltrate and rip off corporate databases .
But he stole from his employer , who took revenge by crippling Case 's nervous system with a mycotoxin , rendering him unable to hack .
Alone and suicidal , Case is scooped off the street and given a second chance by a shadowy group of people who have big ( and scary ) plans .
In exchange for curing Case ’s nervous system , they want him to help them infiltrate the core of a huge and powerful AI ( artificial intelligence ) called Wintermute .
If you have n’t already read Neuromancer , consult the ( nicely done ) plot summary on the Neuromancer Wiki page , which includes a handy character index and a glossary of terms .
The novel is widely credited with popularizing the term “ Cyberspace , ” with presenting a thoroughly developed idea of virtual reality , and with introducing the idea of the World Wide Web .
Neuromancer also gave rise to a whole new genre in literature : cyberpunk .
The World Wide Web
The prognostication in Neuromancer that rings most true today is the novel 's idea of a World Wide Web .
The concept of an Internet already existed when Gibson wrote Neuromancer in 1984 :
In the early eighties , several universities had strung together various systems of servers via a telecom link .
What Gibson introduced was the idea of a global network of millions of computers , which he described in astonishing detail -- though the World Wide Web , as we know it today , was still more than a decade away .
Imagine the novelty of that idea in 1984 when the personal computer was still a fairly new idea .
Of course , things start getting really interesting only in the nineties , when technology linked all of those computers together .
Once you thoroughly unfasten yourself from reality , truly all things are possible .

BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) -- A Boston police officer is suing the city after he was suspended for referring to a black Harvard professor as a " banana - eating jungle monkey " in an e-mail .
Boston police Officer Justin Barrett apologized for his e-mail about Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates , Jr .
" If I 'm charged with a crime I want a chance to answer .
I want the chance for a fair hearing , " Officer Justin Barrett told CNN on Tuesday .
Barrett has apologized and denied he is a racist .
His lawsuit claims his civil rights have been violated ; Barrett 's lawyer said the words referring to Henry Louis Gates , Jr. were misinterpreted .
" The choice of words were poor ; but they were n't meant to characterize professor Gates as a banana - eating jungle monkey , " attorney Peter Marano said .
" They were meant in a response to behavior and characterizing the behavior .
Not the person as a whole . "
Marano said the city had effectively fired Barrett , though he is officially suspended with pay .
He said it was fair to hold Barrett to a higher standard than the general public because he is a police officer , but that he was still entitled to express his opinions .
" Being held to a higher standard should n't eradicate his right under the First Amendment for free speech .
That is part and parcel of the lawsuit , " the lawyer said .
Gates was arrested at his house last month when a neighbor called police after she thought she saw a man trying to break into Gates ' home .
The man turned out to be Gates himself , who was attempting to free a jammed door .
The incident sparked a national debate about race and policing , drawing in President Obama himself .
Obama , who is a friend of Gates , said the officer who arrested the professor " acted stupidly , " but then withdrew the comment , saying he did not know all the facts when he spoke .
He hosted Gates and Sgt. James Crowley for a beer at the White House to calm the tensions .
Barrett later sent a mass e-mail about the encounter to other officers and to the Boston Globe newspaper .
Barrett was suspended from his military duties as captain in the Army National Guard and placed on administrative leave from the Boston Police Department pending the outcome of a termination hearing .
Barrett said he was moved to write the note because he believed a Boston Globe column about Gates ' arrest " seemed like it was biased . "
" It did not show the roles and duties of a police officer and how dangerous it already is without having a debate about people getting in a police officer 's face , which should never happen at all . "
Asked what led him to choose to use such language , he said , " I do n't know .
I could n't tell you .
I have no idea . "
He added , in response to a question , that he had never used such language before .
Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis denounced the e-mail .
Barrett used the " jungle monkey " phrase four times , three times referring to Gates and once to the Boston Globe column .
He also declared that he was " not a racist but I am prejudice [ sic ] toward people who are stupid and pretend to stand up and preach for something they say is freedom but it is merely attention because you do not get enough of it in your little fear - dwelling circle of on - the - bandwagon followers . "
According to a statement from Boston police , Davis took action immediately on learning of Barrett 's remarks , stripping the officer of his gun and his badge .
Barrett 's arrests and investigations will be reviewed for indications of racial bias , Davis said .
The department will also look closely at the officers who received or viewed the e-mail .

POLICE IN CHINA have charged a man for stealing a motorcycle - part by part from the factory where he worked .
The assembly line worker told Police he 'd always wanted his own motorbike but could never afford one on the lowly wages he received .
Over a five - year period the man whipped parts from the warehouse .
Once complete he began to use the bike to commute to and from work .
But , luck was n't on the light - fingered worker 's side ; he was stopped by police who discovered that he had no driving licence or paperwork .
The man admitted theft and was fined the equivalent of £ 440 , put on probation for a year , and ordered to return the complete motorcycle to the factory .
That 'll teach him .
By Bob Beckel - August 18 , 2009
" It will be tough to make some of these changes if doctors feel like they 're looking over their shoulders for fear of lawsuits ... some doctors may feel the need to order more tests and treatments to avoid being legally vulnerable . "
( President Obama , American Medical Association June 2009 ) .
" Anyone who denies there is a crisis in medical malpractice is probably a trial lawyer . "
( Barack Obama 1996 Illinois State Senate race ) .
" I 'm not advocating caps on malpractice awards . " ( President Obama , AMA convention June 2009 ) .
The first two statements are right on Mr. President , reconsidering the third may well save healthcare reform .
It wo n't be easy .
We Democrats have benefited mightily from the trial lawyers support and vice versa , but its time for these boys and girls to put some skin in the healthcare reform game and accept caps on pain and suffering malpractice awards .
Why ?
Because Democrats advocating medical tort reform will fundamentally change the healthcare reform debate and in the process may save universal healthcare legislation .
Universal healthcare has been our fight for 50 years .
It is ingrained in our DNA and we are close .
There are no guarantees , but Democrats offering tort reform will confound the Republicans , take away one of their most potent arguments , and put us back on the offensive .
If that means throwing some trial lawyers under the bus , so be it .
Why have n't we talked about tort reform during this entire debate ?
Because we have n't wanted to bite one of the biggest hands that feed us .
That substantial and legitimate disagreement over the effects of medical malpractice awards on health care costs is another .
And there is our child - like fear the trail lawyers will abandon us .
On that last point let me be brutally pragmatic .
The trial lawyers wo n't abandon us because they have nowhere else to go .
As a trail lawyer friend admitted to me , " I hate to lose medical malpractice , but there 's a whole lot of suing to do out there that has nothing to do with doctors " .
And that 's the point .
We 're not talking about massive tort reform .
We 're not taking tobacco and asbestos of the table .
We 're talking a cap on punitive damages .
And what 's the payoff for holding our collective noses and accepting caps ?
For years
Republicans have repeatedly stated that tort reform will generate tens of billions in healthcare savings every year .
In fact , the Republicans have presented authoritative reports and gone on the record hundreds of times insisting that the savings approach $ 100 billion A YEAR !
Let 's accept their numbers .
Now the vaunted CBO and GAO wo n't score the savings anywhere near that number .
( Both argue that so many states have enacted different tort reform laws that an assessment of savings is not possible ) .
But the CBO has reviewed the few credible reports that do exist and concluded , " A number of those studies have found that state level tort reforms have decreased the number of lawsuits filed , lowered the value of claims and damage awards ... thereby reducing general insurance premiums .
Indeed premiums fell by 40 % for some commercial policies " .
( CBO Report June 2004 )
Then there is the restriction to accessible healthcare resulting from malpractice lawsuits .
A GAO report in August 2003 concluded , " Actions taken by healthcare providers in response to malpractice pressure have contributed to localized healthcare access problems .... pregnant women in rural central Mississippi ( for example ) travel 65 miles to locate obstetric wards to deliver because family practitioners at local hospitals faced with rising malpractice insurance premiums stopped providing obstetric services . "
Since those states that have enacted tort reform have such disparate caps on pain and suffering malpractice lawyers " venue " shop for states with higher caps and more plaintive - friendly juries .
The attractiveness of class action suits , which can result in millions of dollars ( 30 to 40 % of the award goes to lawyers ) , often result in pitifully small payments to the injured parties .
Let 's be clear , there are thousands of legitimate malpractice cases where doctors and hospitals cause terrible damages .
National standards for medical malpractice would mandate full payment for economic damages a cap of $ 250000 in punitive damages would be a reasonable award in most of these cases .
Where the cap is insufficient in particularly egregious cases a " Health Court " could hear appeals and make awards above the cap from a compensation fund provided by the healthcare industry .
A similar proposal is favored by former Democratic Senator Tom Daschle who stays in close contact with the White House and said recently , " If doctors subscribe to best practices , and we have that transparency , the next step is to give them ( doctors ) safe harbor and immunity from lawsuits ... "
One gets the feeling that President Obama , despite his comments to the AMA , may be thinking along similar lines .
A recent New York Times story reported that Obama is working behind the scenes to protect doctors from malpractice lawsuits .
Senator Ron Wyden ( D - Org ) has said that Obama has " touched on this issue ( medical tort reform ) at a number of meetings . "
It is also widely circulated ( but yet to be confirmed ) that then State Senator Obama supported non economic caps on medical lawsuits while in the Illinois State Senate and in 2005 as a US Senator he supported the Class Action Fairness
Act vigorously opposed by the trial attorneys and by liberal Senators led by Senator Ted Kennedy .
From this evidence , it is reasonable to assume that the president 's opposition to caps before the AMA may not be set in concrete .
Nor should it be .
Even if the CBO refuses to put a savings on national caps for punitive damages , we have those Republican studies confirming savings of 30 to 100 BILLION dollars per year .
As a Democrat , I 'm glad to accept these figures and stipulate that they are accurate .
Combined with proposed savings in Medicare and Medicaid , taxing high end insurance plans , and savings promised from the pharmaceutical companies and hospitals , the GOP savings from tort reform would provide for revenue neutral universal coverage over ten years and contribute to a downward curve in out year health costs .
And despite the CBO reluctance ( dare I say courage ) to score tort reform savings one irrefutable fact remains ; between 1997 and 2007 medical tort costs ( including insurance premiums ) have risen from $ 15 billion to $ 30 billion a year .
That fact alone should insure that yearly savings in the billions from medical tort reform would pass the credibility test .
Politically , I am convinced that by adding tort reform to healthcare legislation will instantaneously change the debate ; take a major weapon to defeat healthcare reform from the GOP arsenal ; bring huge numbers of doctors and healthcare providers to the reformers side , and in one stroke rekindle the momentum for reform before the summer of " death panels " soured the public support for singularly the most important legislation Democrats have enacted since the civil rights laws .
Tort reform may not be a magic bullet , but coming from the Democrats the Republicans will be forced off message fast and reform forces can get back on the offensive .
Is it worth the price of angering the trail lawyers to perhaps achieve universal coverage for 47 million citizens ?
You bet it is .
( CNN ) -- A 14 - year - old boy allegedly beaten at a boot camp in China for young Internet addicts was in critical condition Thursday , less than three weeks after a youth at a different camp died , Chinese state media reported .
People sit at a wireless cafe in Beijing , using their laptop computers .
Internet use has skyrocketed in China , especially among teens .
And Chinese parents have turned to hundreds of training camps that offer to wean their children -- mostly teenagers -- from excessive Internet use .
There are at least 400 private rehabilitation clinics or camps in the country , according to a recent survey by the China Youth Internet Association , adding that China has 10 million teenage Web addicts .
But the Chinese Ministry of Health says none of the private rehab clinics are legally registered .
The parents of Pu Liang , the injured teen , had sent him to a camp called the Anti-traditional Education Training Center on August 4 near Chengdu , capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan , Chinese media reported .
Pu allegedly was beaten three times between August 4 and August 11 .
Police discovered the boy in solitary confinement last week and he was taken to a hospital , according to media reports .
His parents accused a counselor at the camp and Pu's peers of repeatedly hitting him , Chinese media said , adding that particular camp has been closed .
" He is suffering from water on the lungs and kidney failure , " Pu's father , Pu Shiwei , told the publication China View on Wednesday .
" All injuries were done by the people at the camp . "
The training center denied that a counselor beat the youth , contending Pu was hit by other campers because he could n't get along with them , China View reported .
Authorities in Zhongjiang county , where the camp is located , said they detained the counselor after a report of alleged abuse from the parents of another child .
The man who established the military - style camp , Wu Yongjing , admitted to the BBC that youngsters were sometimes subjected to " physical punishment . "
" Physical punishment is an effective way to educate children -- as long as it can be controlled , " he said in an online story Wednesday .
The injured youth 's mother told Chinese media that her son " got addicted to online games and frequented Internet cafes ... at the end of last semester , my son said he did n't want to go to school . "
The mother , Li Shubing , saw an ad for the training camp and hoped her son could be helped , she told China Daily .
The parents signed a contract with the center and paid 5,000 yuan ( about $ 730 ) , she said .
In a separate incident , 15 - year - old Deng Senshan died after his parents sent him to a summer training camp for his Internet addiction , according to Chinese news agency Xinhua .
That camp was in south China 's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region .
Authorities detained several counselors and were investigating the incident .
Injuries found on the body indicated the teen had been beaten , Xinhua reported .
China is in the process of classifying Internet addiction as a mental illness , according to China Tech News .
Medical experts have called for laws and regulations to govern treatment .
Last month the government banned electro - shock therapy as treatment for Internet addiction after abuses were reported .
Internet users claiming to have received the treatment wrote in blogs and forums about being tied down and subjected to shocks for 30 minutes at a time .
" The market of Internet addiction treatment in China is in a total mess due to lack of diagnostic standards and treatment guidelines , " said Tao Ran , director of the country 's first Internet addiction clinic at Beijing 's Military General Hospital .
China started to pay attention to the prevention of addiction in 1994 , when his clinic opened , Tao said .
Data from the Beijing Public Security Bureau indicate that about three - quarters of juvenile criminals in China say they are addicted to the Internet .
The proposed Diagnostic Criterion of Internet Addiction makes clear that the Internet - addicted should be treated in medical units with psychiatric departments , Tao said .
" Internet addiction is treatable .
Through about three months ' treatment , 80 percent of the patients can get away from the addiction , " Tao has said .
Some youths are so immersed in chat rooms and online games that they drop out of school , he added .
" They are suffering from depression , nervousness , fear and unwillingness to interact with others , panic and agitation .
They also have sleep disorders , the shakes and numbness in their hands , " Tao said .
One authority on Internet use in China said she has known several college students there who are wildly enthusiastic about the Internet .
" When they 've come to the U.S. , they 've all been hooked on the social networking sites , " said Susan Barnes , associate director of the Laboratory of Social Computing at the Rochester Institute of Technology .
" No matter what time it is , you can always find somebody online . "
The Internet can easily become compulsive behavior for anyone with an addictive personality , Barnes said .

Record numbers of pupils set to get three grade - A passes at A - level next week have been turned away from Britain 's most elite universities .
Oxford and Cambridge experienced a large surge in applications for places , meaning that more than 12,000 students with three predicted top - grade passes have been left disappointed .
The situation is exacerbated at Cambridge because the university made fewer provisional offers this year ; admissions officers believe an expected rise in A - grade passes for the 27th year in a row will mean that most candidates will be awarded their projected grades .
The number of applications to Oxford has soared by more than 10 per cent from 13,388 in 2008 to more than 15,000 .
A spokeswoman said that home and overseas applications had increased .
It had only made about 3,000 offers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At Cambridge , applications have risen from 14,498 to 15,679 , while the number of offers made has been cut from 4,066 to 4,016 .
The university said that attempts to widen participation and encourage more school leavers from disadvantaged homes to apply to elite universities was one reason for the increase in applications .
The university has remodelled its admissions system this year , scrapping the process of applying to individual colleges through separate application forms and the requirement for every candidate to have a languages GCSE .
Both these requirements were seen as hindering disadvantaged school leavers from applying to the university , especially now that so many state - school pupils , particularly in disadvantaged areas , have ditched languages since the Government made the subjects voluntary for 14 - to 16 - year - olds .
Academics worry that a year in which there has been a rise in applications from more disadvantaged school leavers could be accompanied by record rejections by Oxford and Cambridge , although the figures have not been broken down yet to show how many applicants from poorer backgrounds have been turned away .
Professor Alan Smithers , from the Centre for Education and Employment at the University of Buckingham , said : " It is good more people are applying but it does signify the need for an examination that can distinguish the most talented .
At the moment it does n't look as if the A grade does that . "
Phil Willis , the Liberal Democrat chairman of the Commons select committee which monitors universities , said : " There needs to be a better approach to admissions which does not solely rely on A - levels but looks at other factors . "
Last year it was estimated about 12,000 pupils with three straight
As were rejected and experts say that figure will rise by as many as 500 this year .

The trend could be mirrored at other elite universities , with top - performing candidates struggling to gain places .
One leading academic said : " In past years , universities have managed to find places for candidates who just miss out on their provisional offer [ getting , say , two As and a B instead of three As ] .
I 'm not sure that will happen this year . "
Geoff Parks , the head of admissions at Cambridge University , said : " I would be surprised if we did n't set a new record [ for three - A rejections ] . "
About 25 per cent of past applicants have been from overseas students which , if that trend continues , would mean about 21,000 home applicants this year .
The percentage of overseas students accepted tends to drop as many have to choose between Cambridge , Oxford or a top US university .
About 6,000 places are available for home students at Cambridge and Oxford , meaning up to 15,000 home applicants will have been rejected .
The rise in applications coupled with the increase in the number projected to get three grade - A passes has made it the hardest year yet for admissions officers seeking to recruit the most talented school leavers to popular courses such as law and medicine .
However , it is predicted next year that performance could drop for the first time in more than two decades .
In 2000 , Laura Spence was rejected from Oxford University despite attaining three As at A - level , only to be accepted at Harvard , in the US .
Questions are to be made harder next year to test critical thinking skills and an A * grade will also be on offer .
" I would n't be totally surprised if [ the percentage of scripts awarded A grades ] did go down next year , " said Dr Parks .
" I think it will take some time for teachers and students to adapt to the new changes . "
Cambridge is also recognising the A* grade by making its standard offer two grade As and an A* grade pass .
The pressure on admissions officers to select the brightest candidates should ease but critics fear the changes could benefit independent over state schools with private school teachers more likely to coach pupils to achieve A* grades .
Next year 's shake - up might help A - levels to fight off challenges from rival qualifications such as the Pre-U , on the grounds that it is based on more traditional lines with increased emphasis on the end - of - course exam .
The Opportunity rover has come across an odd - shaped , large , dark rock , about 0.6 meters ( 2 feet ) across on the surface of Mars , which may be a meteorite .
The rover team spotted the rock called “ Block Island , ” on July 18 , 2009 , in the opposite direction from which it was driving .
The team then had the rover do a hard right ( not really , but you know what I mean ) and backtrack some 250 meters ( 820 feet ) to study it closer .
Oppy has been studying the rock with its alpha particle X - ray spectrometer to get composition measurements and to confirm if indeed it is a meteorite .
Below , see a close - up , colorized version of Block Island and a 3 - D version , both created by Photoshopper Extraordinaire Stu Atkinson .
Block Island really does have a meteorite - like look to it .
Stu suggested on his blog that it looks like several meteorites found on Earth , such as one of the Derrick Peak meteorites found in Antarctica , shown below .
The Derrick Peak meteorites are iron meteorites , and about 27 were found in one location in Antarctica .
Researchers believe they all came from one meteor shower .
Check out Stu ’s blog Cumbrian
Sky to see lots of other meteorites , including the one Opportunity found on Mars in 2005 .
And below is a look at Block Island in 3 - D .
We ’ll keep you posted on the results from Oppy ’s examinations of this rock , and what this interesting find might tell us .

Here 's a neat companion story to the nation - rocking news that UK Members of Parliament have used their expense accounts to commit massive acts of fraud against the taxpayer : it turns out that Scotland Yard 's top detectives have been doing the exact same thing , charging millions to their official AmEx cards , taking huge cash - advances at ATMs , buying clothes for their girlfriends , charging custom - made suits bought from mail - order bespoke tailors , etc .
One officer charged £ 40,000 to his card in a single year .
These were elite cops from special units — including the anti-terror squad , whose members are charged with inflating their expenses from investigating the 7/7 bombings .
" It beggars belief that our police , who are supposed to be solving crime , are suspected of fraud on a grand scale . "
Auditors at the Metropolitan Police Authority have spent two years examining receipts from the accounts of more than 3,500 officers .
The Amex cards were issued in 2006 to detectives from specialist operations , which includes counter - terrorism and those involved in diplomatic and royalty protection .
The scheme was then extended to the specialist crime directorate , which counters organised crime , as well as conducting sensitive inquiries such as the cash - for - honours investigation …
Sources have told the Observer that some detectives had fallen into the habit of withdrawing hundreds of pounds at a time from cashpoints .
Other officers appear to have filled in blank receipts from restaurants to account for cash payments .
That ’s a far cry from a few years ago , when nanotechology aroused feverish visions and fantastic fears .
Futurists predicted microscopic “ nanobots ’’ coursing through human systems to root out cancer cells , scrub clogged arteries , and repair tissue .
Alarmists raised fear of “ gray goo ’’ - self - replicating swarms of nano - particles - devouring the planet .
“ These early nano - products may seem rather mundane , even a letdown , ’’ said Andrew Maynard , chief science adviser to the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center , a Washington think tank .
For now , though , most nano - products are almost numbingly prosaic : stickier dental adhesive , mildew - resistant paint , and stain - proof khakis .
Plus a handful of pharmaceuticals whose nano - properties make them somewhat more effective than standard treatments , but hardly wonder drugs .
With scores of research labs and cutting - edge commercial ventures in New England developing products , nano seems headed to become a potent economic force in the region , as well as a transformative technology .
Nanoparticles of gold , for example , absorb light and convert it into heat with a precision that would be impossible using ordinary flakes of the precious metal .
Other materials that possess only ho - hum electronic properties at normal size zip current right along at teensy scales .
And some materials that seem smooth in their normal state become highly sticky when nano - engineered .
Nanotechnology takes its name from the nanometer , equal to one - billionth of a meter .
That ’s bigger than atoms or simple molecules , but still so tiny that many materials behave differently than they do at the scales previously standard for most chemical , biological , and electronics engineering .
But analysts and scientists say extraordinary new devices and techniques are not far off , especially in the realms of medical treatment , power sources , and consumer electronics .
Picture cellphones so thin and flexible they can be worn as neck scarves .
Imagine assembly lines “ staffed ’’ by viruses .
Think of concrete produced with just a fraction of today ’s pollutants ( concrete production is a major emitter of greenhouse gases ) , but able to endure for thousands of years .
Holman reckons that by the middle of the next decade “ nanotech will touch $ 3.1 trillion worth of products ’’ worldwide .
By and large , “ nano - particles ’ ’ will be used to make existing products tougher , more flexible , or more energy - efficient - faster computer processors , more moldable plastics , sprayable films able to act as solar collectors - rather than to create entirely new entities , at least at the outset .
“ It ’s not yet a mainstream technology , but it ’s becoming one , ’’ said Michael Holman , research director for Lux Research , a Boston firm that analyzes budding technologies .
The technology today underlies some $ 200 billion worth of workaday items , some prescribed by doctors but most sold directly off retail shelves .
From a gleam in the eye of a few far - seeing scientists , nanotech has leapt with little fanfare to shopping centers and workplaces .
CAMBRIDGE - Long the stuff of hype and occasional hysteria , nanotechnology is quietly merging into modern life , its minuscule particles infused in an array of products , ranging from stink - proof socks to life - saving cancer medications .
“ Instead of nanobots , we got sunscreens , ’’ Maynard wryly noted , referring to new lotions containing nanoparticles able to deflect the most damaging wavelengths of sunlight .
“ Nano ’s development is proving more evolutionary than revolutionary .
The cool stuff is still in the labs .
But some incredible medicines and [ micro - engineered ] electronics are getting closer to reality . ’’
For example , cancer - fighting “ nanoshells ’ ’ - orbs of gold and glass so tiny that thousands could fit on a pencil ’s dot - engineered by Rice University ’s Naomi Halas seem poised for prime time .
The shells , coated with antibodies to hunt out specific cancers , are dispersed inside the body and attach themselves to tumors .
Then near - infrared light is beamed through skin and organs onto the shells , heating the gold and destroying the tumors without hurting healthy tissue .
“ This is a radically different way of treating cancer that could displace surgery and conventional radiation therapy , ’’ said research analyst Holman .
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , a chemical engineering professor , Robert S. Langer , is overseeing research into a device called “ pharmacy on a chip , ’’ silicon slivers drilled with infinitesimal wells filled with drugs .
Floating in the bloodstream , the chips can theoretically be programmed to release medicine at precisely the right location - a narrowing portion of an artery , for example - for maximum effect .
“ In medicine , delivery is critical , ’’ Langer said .
“ This is one feasible nano approach to putting the right medicine exactly on target . ’’
On another nano front , MIT materials engineer Angela Belcher applied a longtime fascination with abalone mollusks - which extract dissolved chemicals from water to manufacture their fabulously pearly shells - to “ train ’’ viruses to assemble batteries .
The genetically altered viruses , which are harmless to humans , pull ions from a solution to form both the positive - and negative - charged ends of a lithium - ion battery .
“ There , you see , ’’ said Belcher , flipping a switch that illuminated a small light bulb powered by such a nano - constructed battery .
“ It works . ’’
Belcher ’s batteries are unlikely to juice anything bigger than a pacemaker .
But other nano researchers are focusing on much mightier batteries because tiny - scale technology seems the most likely route toward creating long - lived , lightweight fuel cells .
President Obama has made replacement of fossil fuels in cars a priority of his administration ; this month the federal government handed out more than $ 2 billion in energy grants to boost battery research .
Massachusetts nano - battery designer A123 Systems received a $ 249 million slice of the largesse .
“ The next generation of batteries will only do what they are supposed to do if they are engineered at nano scales , ’’ said the Wilson Center ’s Maynard .
That ’s partly because the greater surface area of multiple nano particles can both discharge power and absorb fresh energy far more efficiently than conventional materials .
Environmentalists and other activists complain that nanotechnology is so diverse and poorly understood that it is slipping under the radar of regulators - teensy materials , they warn , could pose big dangers to humans and ecosystems .
“ There is concern about toxicity and mobility , ’’ said Richard Denison , senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund .
For example , studies in mice have suggested that so - called carbon nanotubes - tiny cylinders of carbons with extraordinary electrical and structural properties - might also have an asbestos - like ability to penetrate tissue and trigger disease .
In British research last year , mice injected with nanotubes developed lesions similar to those that appear in human lungs after persistent exposure to asbestos .
Analysts note that every new technology poses fresh dangers , and that even infamously toxic materials , like asbestos , may never have become such scourges had they been handled more carefully .
“ Risk never killed a new technology , ’’ Arthur Caplan , director of the University of Pennsylvania ’s Center for Bioethics , told journalists at a recent workshop on nanotechnology at MIT .
“ There will certainly be issues , there will certainly be problems .
But I do n’t see any major ‘ in principle ’ objection ’’ that will pose a huge impediment to nanotechnology .

how accommodating can you get ?
A group of communicators have a new idea for dealing with religious zealots on a warpath against science education : shirk from the challenge .
Imagine yourself as a skeptic arguing with a religious zealot who insist that creationism needs to be taught in your local school district and that evolution is nothing more than atheist gospel .
You counter with evidence for the evolutionary process and point out that religious dogmas are n’t the same scientific theories .
Suddenly , a few people from the audience jump up and say that while you ’re technically right , you should recognize that it ’s not impossible to believe in a higher power and respect science at the same time , that science was inspired by religious devotion and that you should be nice to your zealous opponent because if you do n’t say anything mean about his beliefs , he ’ll eventually come around .
What happened ?
You ’ve met the accommodationists .
The accommodationist position seems to be confusing at best .
Yes it ’s true that a lot of scientists made a lot of profound discoveries and studied the natural world because they were inspired to learn how it was created by a supernatural being .
And yes , it ’s true that there are a lot of people who separate their science from what they hear in church and have no problem believing in a deity and defending the science classes from the likes of Don McLeroy and Barbara Cargill because they think that a good science education is crucial .
And as you might ’ve already guessed , these are n’t the people who make it a habit to barge into school board meetings to spew fire and brimstone speeches as they wave Bibles in their hands .
Appealing to moderate theists for help in backing science education and respect for scientists is just preaching to the choir .
This is where the accommodationist stance slips into politics .
Believing that moderate sensitivities are one of the vital but fragile pillars of public support for scientific endeavors , they want to muzzle atheists , skeptics and unbelievers who do n’t strike a Reader ’s Digest style , non-confrontational tone when defending science .
They would much rather give more leeway to religious and inaccurate interpretations of evolution and cosmology in the public eye than a critique of fundamentalist notions .
And while the Ray Comforts and Ken Hams and their friends sabotage education , they sit back and insist that the fundamentalists will come around on their own or will eventually be swayed by enough evidence .
To speak ill of their beliefs is to offend the moderates who will suddenly bolt and rush to defend the very same people with who they vehemently disagreed before .
One of the accommodationists ’ favorite tenants is that religion and science pursue different knowledge so in theory , they should have no problem co-existing .
But the reality is very different .
Religion is a social construct which exists to perpetuate its traditions rather than actually acquire any new insight .
All the knowledge it wants is already contained in its holy books and the lengthy ruminations on them .
Those who feel inspired to go out and explore , find themselves in the realm of science , a bureaucratic entity which gathers , documents and sifts through new knowledge .
It started off as a nearly blank slate and its entire purpose is to find new information and grow with each discovery .
The conflict between the two spheres happens when scientists discover something that contradicts religious dogma and the people who rigidly follow their holy texts mount a campaign to defend their worldview from the new information .
Do you honestly think that fundamentalists are interested in broadening their horizons when their primary concern is to make sure everyone around them does as they say ?
In the supposed war between science and religion , the actual facts take a back seat .
Rather , the debate is about whether we could pick and choose our personal worldview regardless of the facts .
Creationists are n’t mad because they did a study that found major contradictions in evolutionary biology .
They ’re mad because scientists dare to tell the world about evolution and use facts they passionately want to ignore to teach this knowledge in schools .
We can see the same problem when people mix their beliefs into facts to reconcile the contradictions in their minds .
Sure they think they ’re creating a profound blend of theology and science , but all they ’re really doing is trying to cram their dogmas into the fluid , expanding body of knowledge that is science and coming up with a muddled mess .
Testable claims are mixed with opinion and personal desires so we get quotes like “ people have experiences scientists ca n’t explain ” promptly followed by “ and do n’t you give me any studies otherwise , they were all done by atheists and they ’re all wrong ” or “ if we ca n’t repeat CERN experiments at home , all the claims those scientists make are n’t falsifiable . ”
In other words , do n’t try to prove your point because I have no interest in hearing it , and if I ca n’t replicate an experiment at home or understand the science involved , it ’s just random conjecture .
Accommodationists do n’t stop for even a moment to point out just how anti-scientific that attitude is , parading it as some great reconciliatory gesture in fear of offending anyone of faith .
Instead of trying to draw a line between facts and our personal interpretations of what those facts mean about the universe at large , and make sure that the boundary is loud and clear , we ’re supposed to be timidly sitting in the corner and quietly ask if it would n’t be too much trouble not to muddy the scientific waters .
And if we just drop the milquetoast act to make the case that separating science from religion is a good idea , we get swiftly cast as loud , obnoxious new atheists who only want to bully and demean religion , and bombarded with empty quotes about how it ’s foolish to claim absolute knowledge of anything .
This tactic does n’t address the issues at hand or answer any questions .
Its intent is to make us be quiet and go away while the accommodationists can mingle with their like - minded friends , complaining about those silly absolutists and their quaint notions like keeping fact and opinion separate .
ANALYSIS

Google 's operating system aims to tempt people away from Windows
So at long last Google is making its move .
Promising a lightweight but fast operating system - Chrome OS - the internet search company is poised to strike at the heart of Microsoft 's software empire .
The Windows operating system is Microsoft 's cash cow , powering about 90 % of the world 's personal computers , and as a result accounting for the majority of its profits .
The benefits are wider , though .
Every Windows desktop comes with an invitation ( and at times the imperative ) to use other Microsoft software and services .
This , in turn , hobbles Google 's ambition of organising all the world 's information , and making money on the back of it .
After all , most people 's computer experience is bogged down with frustration - from the time it takes to start a computer , to software conflicts , and worries about viruses and malware ( or for Apple Macs the cost of buying a computer ) .
Clash of business models
Soon those people who are spending more of their time in the company of Google rather than Microsoft will have the opportunity to use the Chrome OS for all their computing needs
Rory Cellan- Jones
BBC 's technology correspondent
Read Rory 's thoughts in full Google promises to change all that by stripping desktop computing to its basics .
Your PC wo n't have to do the heavy lifting , applications will run in your browser instead , powered by Google 's huge server farms .
It comes down to a clash of business models .
Microsoft earns money by charging customers a one - off fee for its operating system , probably $ 20 for its old Windows XP software , and a rumoured $ 150 for Windows Vista and the forthcoming Windows 7 , which is due to go on sale this autumn .
Google is unlikely to charge for Chrome OS .
The company wants you to get online fast , have a whale of a time ... and use as many Google services as you can : from search to email , social networking to photo sharing , word processing , to watching films on YouTube .
It is yet another incarnation of the company 's " Google everywhere " strategy .
Google , the software firm Chrome OS also shows what you can achieve when you sit on a huge cash pile , attract some of the world 's best software engineers and - most importantly - start with a blank slate .
Google has a track record .
Not that long ago the firm announced that it was developing an operating system for smartphones , dubbed Android ( which is distinct from Chrome OS ) .
Microsoft executives that I spoke to back then were dismissive , arguing that Google was underestimating the complexity of such a venture .
But already Android is in many ways a more accomplished piece of software than version 6.1 of Microsoft 's Windows Mobile .
Google is helped by the fact that unlike Microsoft it has no need to worry about compatibility with legacy software .
That , however , could also be the Achilles heel of Chrome OS .
Consumers who want to buy a Chrome OS computer will have to start with a blank slate as well .
Any software that they hold near and dear is unlikely to be compatible with the new system .
And they have to limit their ambitions .
If you play computer games , do heavy - duty video or picture editing , or need any kind of specialised software , then you 'll return to the shelves heaving with Microsoft powered PCs or Apple Macs .
Timing is everything
As you make your buying decision , you will have this niggling worry that one day , maybe , you will need to use some software that simply can't run in your browser .
The advertising campaigns of both Apple and Microsoft will have a great time stoking these worries .
Google 's announcement comes at an interesting time .
Microsoft is poised to launch its new operating system Windows 7 .
Unlike its predecessor Vista , Windows 7 is proven to be a good fit for ultraportable netbooks , currently the fastest growing segment of the PC market .
So Chrome OS , due in mid-2010 , may come either at just the right time , as the economy recovers and consumers go shopping again , or it may come too late , with Windows 7 already firmly hogging the market .
Chrome impact
In the end , Google 's strike may not cut deep into enemy territory .
Chrome , the web browser , is still stuck at a tiny market share of 1.2 % .
Android is available on just two or three phones , not enough to really make an impact .
Google Apps - productivity software to handle spreadsheets and word documents - has just come out of its " beta " test phase , but look around you and you will find most people still using Microsoft Office .
The one field where Chrome OS may make a difference is the market for the open source Linux operating system .
Chrome OS will use bits of the Linux kernel , the link between the computer hardware and the Chrome browser running on it .
Google is bound to make Chrome OS much more user - friendly than most " distros " or versions of Linux available right now .
Instead of slaying Microsoft , Chrome OS might corner the segment of the consumer space that might have been Linux's .
No doubt , Google 's charge with Chrome OS will needle Microsoft .
But we wo n't know for years whether it will deliver a mere pinprick , or is the fine point of the dagger at the heart of Microsoft .

Telstra 's new chief executive David Thodey will earn about $ 4 million less than his predecessor Sol Trujillo , according to figures released to the Australian Securities Exchange today .
Mr Thodey will receive a fixed salary of $ 2 million a year , $ 1 million less than Mr Trujillo .
However Mr Trujillo received a far greater sum of bonuses last year than the maximum his replacement can achieve this year .
According to the terms of his contract released to the Australian Securities Exchange today , Mr Thodey stands to earn just over $ 9 million if short and long term targets are met .
Mr Trujillo was paid a fixed salary of $ 3 million for 2007 - 2008 , but his total remuneration package was more than $ 13 million last year including bonuses .
Mark McDonnell from the stockbroking firm BBY says it seems Telstra has taken on board the public backlash associated with Mr Trujillo 's package .
" I think the board has been a little bit sensitive to the criticisms that were levelled around the substantial payments made to Sol Trujillo , particularly in the context where at the time of his departure , the share price was at an all time low , " he said .
Mr McDonnell says , while Mr Thodey 's contract is still very attractive , it is costing Telstra a lot less .
" The short - term incentive , the range is 80 per cent to 160 per cent of the base salary , which is $ 2 million , and the long term incentive is up to 200 per cent , " he said .
" So if you look at that and were to assume that the maximums were paid out , the total package , back of the envelope , is a little north of $ 9 million . "

The new Team US F1 has pulled off a major coup by securing the services of YouTube co-founder and CEO Chad Hurley for its 2010 assault on grand prix racing , as AUTOSPORT predicted .
Following weeks of speculation linking Hurley with the operation , the Charlotte - based F1 team confirmed on Wednesday night that the millionaire will be the outfit 's primary investor .
Speaking about the announcement , Hurley said : " I am thrilled to be a part of America 's first Formula 1 team in more than 40 years .
" Getting in on the ground floor of a project of this size and scope is a tremendous opportunity , and I look forward to helping shape the US F1 vision and corporate strategy for years to come . "
Hurley was one of the original founders of the video - sharing website YouTube , and has helped take it from its original concept to the huge global brand it is today .
The business was sold to Google for $ 1.65 billion ( USD ) in 2006 , although Hurley stayed on board to guide it .
As well as his financial input , US F1 has said that Hurley will bring his outside experience to the team to help with its corporate strategy and media planning going forward .
US F1 team principal Ken Anderson said : " Chad 's addition to the team is a victory for USF1 .
Bringing in a businessman with his level of credentials , and experience in developing and fostering a vision for start - up companies , is an honour , and we look forward to taking on the Formula 1 challenge together in 2010 and beyond . "
Sporting director Peter Windsor added : " This is a great day for USF1 .
Chad 's commitment to this team is vital and his visionary expertise and leadership will help steer us into the future as we look to attract best - in - class sponsors , drivers , employees and fans in our quest to compete at the highest level of motorsports . "
US F1's announcement about Hurley means that it is the first of the three new teams to confirm it has major investment on board , although AUTOSPORT understands that Manor Grand Prix has signed a deal with Virgin for a title sponsorship deal that will be announced in mid-November .

An upstate New York man has been sentenced to the maximum 25 years in prison for the hate - crime killing of a transgender woman .
Dwight DeLee was found guilty of manslaughter last month for shooting Lateisha Green because of anti-gay bias .
The 20 - year - old construction laborer is only the second person in the nation to be convicted of a hate crime for killing a transgender victim .
In April , a man was convicted of first - degree murder and a hate crime in the death of a transgender teen in Colorado .
Green , 22 , was born and raised in Syracuse as Moses Cannon .
At age 16 , Green came out as transgender and began living as a girl .

She faced bullies and threats at school but had a supportive family , said Michael Silverman , director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund , which has worked closely with Green ’s family .
In November , Green and her brother , Mark Cannon , drove to a small house party .
When they arrived , several guests started yelling slurs about Green ’s sexuality , witnesses later testified .
Green was sitting with her brother in their car outside the house when DeLee walked up , raised a . 22 - caliber rifle and fired a single shot .
DeLee was acquitted of murder .

The manslaughter conviction means he intended to injure , not kill , his victim .
Kim Jong-il held talks with Hyundai 's chairwoman in Pyongyang North Korea has agreed to reopen its border with South Korea and allow tourism and family reunions to resume , the North 's KCNA news agency said .
But at the same time KCNA reported that the entire country had been ordered on to special alert over joint US - South Korea military exercises .
The border move followed talks between the North 's leader Kim Jong -il and the head of the South 's Hyundai group .
It also raised hopes for a return to talks on the North 's nuclear programme .
South Korean media have reported that China 's top nuclear envoy is likely to visit the North Korean capital , Pyongyang , later on Monday .
' Prompt annihilating strike '
The North has shown some recent signs of improving its foreign relations .
It recently pardoned two jailed US journalists .
The visit of the chairwoman of Hyundai , Hyun Jeong - eun , also won the release of a detained worker who had been held since March for allegedly criticising Pyongyang 's regime .
Hyundai heads up tourism to the North and operates a joint factory just north of the border that is a key source of revenue for the impoverished regime .
However , there was no word on whether Hyundai had agreed to the North 's demands for large wage increases for workers at the Kaesong industrial park .
The KCNA statement said that South Korean tourists and business people would soon be allowed to cross freely .
It also said it would allow more reunions of Korean families - separated since the 1950 - 1953 war - starting around Chuseok , the Korean harvest festival , which falls on 3 October .
But the BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul says it is unclear whether the South will agree to the resumption of the tours .
It has said the trips will not be allowed to resume until it gets an apology and an explanation for the shooting death of a 53 - year - old South Korean tourist by North Korean soldiers last year .
The meeting between Kim Jong-il and the Hyundai officials came a week after Pyongyang released the two US journalists following an unexpected visit by former US President Bill Clinton .
However , in keeping with its usual response to South Korea 's military exercises , the North vowed to retaliate for any breach of its sovereignty with a nuclear attack .
It threatened a " merciless and prompt annihilating strike at the aggressors " , saying the drills south of the border were a " grave threat " to peace and a prelude to an invasion .
The North quit multilateral talks aimed at ending its nuclear programme last year , preferring direct talks with the United States .
China , the US , Russia , South Korea and Japan want the North to rejoin a process in which aid will bring an end to the North 's nuclear threat .
But the North carried out nuclear and missile tests in May .
The North 's leader , Mr Kim is believed to be ill and is thought to have designated his youngest son as his successor , but fears remain for the stability of the impoverished state .

Will They Still Love Him Tomorrow ?
President Everyman is starting to look like a salesman for the superstate .

Climate change is rapidly expanding the size of the world 's tropical zone , threatening to bring disease and drought to heavily populated areas , an Australian study has found .
Climate change is rapidly expanding the size of the world 's tropical zone , threatening to bring disease and drought to heavily populated areas , an Australian study has found .
Researchers at James Cook University concluded the tropics had widened by up to 500 kilometres ( 310 miles ) in the past 25 years after examining 70 peer - reviewed scientific articles .
They looked at findings from long - term satellite measurements , weather balloon data , climate models and sea temperature studies to determine how global warming was impacting on the tropical zone .
The findings showed it now extended well beyond the traditional definition of the tropics , the equatorial band circling the Earth between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn .
Professor Steve Turton said that meant the subtropical arid zone which borders the tropics was being pushed into temperate areas , with potentially devastating consequences .
" Such areas include heavily - populated regions of southern Australia , southern Africa , the southern Europe - Mediterranean - Middle East region , the south - western United States , northern Mexico , and southern South America , " he said .
" All of ( them ) are predicted to experience severe drying .
" If the dry subtropics expand into these regions , the consequences could be devastating for water resources , natural ecosystems and agriculture , with potentially cascading environmental , social and health implications . "
Turton said tropical diseases such as dengue fever were likely to become more prevalent .
" Some models predict the greatest increase in the annual epidemic potential of dengue will be into the subtropical regions , including the southern United States , China and northern Africa in the northern hemisphere , and South America , southern Africa , and most of Australia in the southern hemisphere , " he said .
James Cook University vice - chancellor Sandra Harding said the evidence showed climate change was already affecting wildlife and rainfall in Australia , which is in the grip of its worst drought in a century .
She said studies showed changes to wind patterns meant rain was now being dumped in the ocean south of the continent , rather than over land .
" There is also evidence that many Australian animal and plant species are moving south in an attempt to track their preferred climatic conditions , " she said .
" Some won ? t make it . "
Harding said the world had to get serious about finding solutions to problems caused by climate change in the tropics .
" Tropical climate conditions are expanding and the impact of this expansion is immense because the tropics is a big , complex and important zone of the world , " she said .

Mathematicians have proposed an alternative explanation forthe accelerating expansion of the universe that does not rely on the mystifyingidea of dark energy .
According to the new proposition , the universe is notaccelerating , as observations suggest .
Instead , an expanding wave flowingthrough space - time has caused distant galaxies to appear to be acceleratingaway from us .
This big wave , initiated after the Big Bang that is thought to have sparked the universe , could explain whyobjects today appear to be farther away from us than they should be accordingto the Standard Model of cosmology .
" We 're saying that maybe the resulting expanding waveis actually causing the anomalous acceleration , " said Blake Temple of the University of California , Davis .
" We 're saying that darkenergy may not really be the correct explanation . "
The researchers derived a set of equations describingexpanding waves that fit Einstein ?s theory of general relativity , and whichcould also account for the apparent acceleration .
Temple outlines the new ideawith Joel Smoller of the University of Michigan in the Aug. 17 issue of thejournal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
While more research will be needed to see if the idea holdsup , " the research could change the way astronomers view the composition ofour universe , " according to a summary from the journal .
To convince other cosmologists , the new model will have topass muster with further inquiry .
" There are many observational tests of the standardcosmological model that the proposed model must pass , aside from the late phaseof accelerated expansion , " said Avi Loeb , director of the Institute forTheory and Computation at the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics .
"
These include big bang nucleosynthesis , the quantitative details of themicrowave background anisotropies , the Lyman - alpha forest , and galaxy surveys .
The authors do not discuss how their model compares to these tests , and whetherthe number of free parameters they require in order to fit these observationalconstraints is smaller than in the standard model .
Until they do so , it is notclear why this alternative model should be regarded as advantageous . "
Johns Hopkins University astrophysicist Mario Livio agreedthat to be seriously considered , the model must be able to predict propertiesof the universe that astronomers can measure .
He said the real test " is in whether they are able toreproduce all the observed cosmological parameters ( as determined , e.g. by acombination of the Hubble Constant and the parameters determined by the CMBobservations ) .
To only produce an apparent acceleration is in itselfinteresting , but not particularly meaningful . "
Inconvenient truths
Dark energy is itself a hasty fix to an inconvenienttruth discovered by astronomers in the late 1990s : that the universe isexpanding , and the rate of this expansion seems to be constantly picking upspeed .
To explain this startling finding , cosmologists invoked darkenergy , a hypothetical form of energy that is pulling the universe apart in alldirections ( note that dark energy is wholly separate from the equallymysterious concept of darkmatter - a hypothetical form of matter that populates the universe , interacting gravitationally with normal matter , but which cannot be seen withlight ) .
In this interpretation , the whole universe is blowing up like aballoon , and from any given point within it , all distant objects appear to bespeeding away from you .
But not everyone is happy with the dark energy explanation .
" It just seems like an unnatural correction to theequations - it's like a fudge factor , " Temple told SPACE.com .
" Theequations don ? t make quite as much physical sense when you put it in .
You justput it in to fit the data . "
Temple and Smoller think the idea of an expanding wave makesmore sense .
" At this stage we think this a very plausibletheory , " Temple said .
" We 're saying there is n?t any acceleration .
Thegalaxies are displaced from where they 're supposed to be because we 're in theaftermath of a wave that put those galaxies in a slightly differentposition . "
Ripples in a pond
Temple compared the wave to what happens when you throw arock into a pond .
In this case , the rock would be the Big Bang , and theconcentric ripples that result are like a series of waves throughout theuniverse .
Later on , when the first galaxies start to form , they are forminginside space - time that has already been displaced from where it would have beenwithout the wave .
So when we observe these galaxies with telescopes , they don' tappear to be where we would expect if there had never been a big wave .
One potential issue with this idea is that it might requirea big coincidence .
For the universe to appear to be accelerating at the samerate in all directions , we in the Milky Way would have to be near a localcenter , at the spot where an expansion wave was initiated early in the Big Bangwhen the universe was filled with radiation .
Temple concedes that this is a coincidence , but said it 'spossible that we are merely in the center of a smaller wave that affects thegalaxies we can see from our vantage point - we need not be in the center ofthe entire universe for the idea to work .
Asteroid Eros , seen here by NASA ’s NEAR spacecraft , is 33 kilometres wide , making it the second largest near - Earth asteroid ( Image : NEAR Project / NLR / JHUAPL / Goddard SVS / NASA )
Existing sky surveys miss many asteroids smaller than 1 kilometre across , leaving the door open to damaging impacts on Earth with little or no warning , a panel of scientists reports .
Doing better will require devoting more powerful telescopes to asteroid hunting , but no one has committed the funds needed to do so , it says .
Near - Earth asteroids larger than 1 kilometre across could blast huge amounts of sunlight - blocking dust into Earth ’s atmosphere in an impact , causing devastating climate change .
The US Congress asked NASA in 1998 to find 90 per cent of those in this size range within 10 years , a goal that has now nearly been reached .
Astronomers have now found 784 of them , mostly using telescopes funded by NASA .
That works out to 83 per cent of the 940 estimated to be out there by astronomer Alan Harris of the Space Science Institute in Boulder , Colorado .

But asteroids below 1 kilometre in size can cause serious harm , too , and they hit Earth more frequently because they are more numerous .
To address the small - asteroid threat , Congress told NASA in 2005 to find 90 per cent of the near - Earth asteroids larger than 140 metres across by 2020 .
NASA asked the US National Research Council in 2008 to figure out the best way to survey small asteroids and meet the 2020 goal .
Now , the NRC panel has issued an interim report , saying that without new money for more powerful surveys , NASA will not be able to meet the goal .
Surprise hit
“ To achieve this goal , or to even come close to achieving it , new facilities capable of detecting fainter asteroids and having wider fields of view to cover larger portions of the sky each night are required , ” the report says .
Panel leader Irwin Shapiro of the Harvard - Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge , Massachusetts , says there is wide agreement on this point .
“ Pretty well everyone agrees now that [ just ] continuing with what we have , there ’s no way we could reach the 2020 goal , ” he told New Scientist .
The report also points out that existing surveys are designed to gradually build up a catalogue of near - Earth objects over time , not to watch out for incoming asteroids that are just days or weeks from colliding with our planet .
Small asteroids could easily slip past existing surveys unnoticed until the moment of collision because telescopes currently devoted to the task are only capable of imaging a small part of the sky each night .
And even then , clouds can prevent them from spotting asteroids , says Timothy Spahr of the Minor Planet Center in Cambridge , Massachusetts , a central clearinghouse for asteroid and comet data .
‘ No free lunch ’
Asteroids approaching from the direction of the sun would also be missed , at least by ground - based telescopes , says Alan Harris .
Sending a telescope to another vantage point in space could overcome this problem .
“ [ But ] it could be seriously expensive , ” says Harris .
“ So one must ask , ‘ What ’s it worth ? ' ”
“ There is no free lunch , ” Shapiro agrees .
But he adds , “ We ’re talking about investing in an insurance policy . ”
A comet or asteroid as small as 30 metres across is thought to have exploded in the atmosphere over Siberia in 1908 , unleashing hundreds of times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima , Japan , in 1945 , and flattening trees in a zone dozens of kilometres across .
A small asteroid impact in the ocean could also flood coastal cities by triggering huge waves , though scientists are still debating how far such waves could travel before petering out .

The following story isnt true .
It is more of a “ political joke ” of sorts .
When Nikita Khrushchev was forced out of power in the Soviet Union he left his successor ( Leonid Brezhnev ) with two letters .
He told his successor to open the first letter when he came to his first major crisis and follow the instructions .
He was told that following the instructions would get him through the crisis .
He was also told that when a second major crisis stuck , he should open the second letter from Khrushchev and follow its instructions .
The inevitable crisis happened and Brezhnev became worried that the crisis could cause him to be removed from power .
He opened Khrushchev ’s first letter which said “ Blame everything on me .
The only way that you can stay in power is to blame everything on my poor leadership and announce that you have to reverse my policies in order to save the State . ”
So , Brezhnev followed the instructions in the letter and things in the Soviet Union got better for a while .
However , after a few more years , the economy began to stagnate and Brezhnev once again became worried that he would lose power .
He realized that the advice from Khrushchev ’s first letter had saved him once and that maybe it could do so again .
Brezhnev opened the second letter and it read “ Sit down and write two letters . ”
As I said above , this is not a true story .
It is however , a useful lesson on political survival .
I would argue that President Obama began reading his first letter during the campaign when he blamed everything wrong in the world on President Bush .
He has continued to beat up on President Bush ’s record in a constant attempt to convince the public that the current crisis is not his fault .
He will likely continue to read from this letter for several years .
For example , if the situation in Iraq continues to improve and we can pull our troops out , Mr. Obama will undoubtedly take all of the credit , despite the fact that President Bush ’s controversial Surge plan was a complete success and has effectively won us the war .
If on the other hand , the situation in Iraq deteriorates and we either do not leave within Mr. Obama ’s promised 16 months or we end up leaving in disgrace , there can be no doubt that President Obama will blame Mr. Bush .
Similarly , if the economy turns around in the next year or two , Mr. Obama will take all of the credit .
If however , the situation worsens , the economy continues to contract , and unemployment approaches or reaches double digits , President Obama will claim that he inherited this mess .
In his speech last night President Obama said “ I ca n’t tell you for sure that everything in this plan will work exactly as we hope , but I can tell you with complete confidence that a failure to act will only deepen this crisis as well as the pain felt by millions of Americans .
My administration inherited a deficit of over $ 1 trillion , but because we also inherited the most profound economic emergency since the Great Depression , doing a little or nothing at all will result in even greater deficits , even greater job loss , even greater loss of income , and even greater loss of confidence . ”
This was effectively Mr. Obama hedging his bet : if the economy turns around , he can take credit , but if it doesnt work , he will say that things are still better than they would have been if the bill wasnt passed and besides , it is still President Bush ’s fault .
This is why President Obama still sounds like his is running for President , rather than holding the office .
It is safe to say that President Obama was not elected to office based any past accomplishments that he had .
He was also not elected based on any future plans that he had .
Rather , he was elected because the American public was ( and still is ) fed up with President Bush .
The fact that Mr. Obama was elected President is really only an externality of the perceived failure of the Bush Administration .
Mr. Obama really didnt run against John McCain ; he really ran against President Bush .
How many times did you hear Mr. Obama refer to “ 8 years of failed policies ? ”
Because Mr. Obama was elected as an opposition candidate–a reactive candidate rather than a proactive candidate– he is likely to continue this course of acton .
Expect him to continue to beat up on President Bush ’s record .
Furthermore , you can expect him to denounce Republicans who vote against his programs ( in a manner that will probably become much more hostile in the near future ) .
The problem is that Mr. Obama cannot continue on this course for too long .
The American people are fickle and grow tired of things quickly .
Remember that when the War in Iraq started Bush ( who was cheered on to war by the American public as well as the media ) had an approval rating of near 70 % .
At some point , the American public will grow tired of hearing Mr. Obama blame all of the country ’s problems on the previous administration –especially if things get worse .
The people want solutions and when President Obama realizes that he cannot deliver them , he may have to reach for that second letter .

In - game ad house Double Fusion has brought dynamic , in - game video advertising to the PlayStation 3 gameacross North America and Europe , the company said Monday .
Double Fusion said it will inject advertising that will complement the hover - racer 's futuristic presentation .
The new video ads have yet to launch , but Double Fusion CEO Jonathan Epstein said certain unnamed advertisers have already signed up for placements in .
Ads will be shown during the game 's loading screens , Double Fusion said .
The company added that the video ads would be " the highest definition " available in - game , and the game will also have supplemental ads that are standard definition .
One of the game 's advertisers is State Farm -- an insurance firm that does n't exactly reflect the reckless blow - em - up zero - gravity racing exhibited inor previous franchise entries .
( See this YouTube video , found via games blog Fidgit ) .arrived as an ad - free download for PlayStation Network in September 2008 .
The game is developed by Sony Liverpool , which recently released the expansion , Double Fusion said it plans to launch in - game advertising in " another handful " of PS3 games by the end of the year .
The San Francisco - based company services more than 30 game publishers via its ad network .
Analysts have estimated that in - game ad spending could reach $ 1 billion by 2014 .
Currently the market stands at about $ 600 million , a figure that also includes web games .
According to in - game comparison footage captured by YouTube user Ryaldeco , the in - gamead is displayed as part the " loading " process , thereby significantly inflating that loading process to more than twice its usual length .
The user reports having to sit through the ad more than three times in an hour .
]
Sony has informed Eurogamer that the ad in question has been removed , commenting that " we are investigating the situation to ensure that any in - game advertising does not affect gameplay . " ]
Did you ever play with the Fisher Price Little People when you were a kid ?
Or Lego village sets ?
Did you ever notice how every store was simply named for its purpose , and there was zero competition ?
For example , the market was called “ Market , ” the barber shop was called “ Barber Shop , ” and the pet store was called “ Pet Store ” ?
Apparently , Roosevelt Island is modeled after this revolutionary idea !
Though Roosevelt Island certainly has its share of interesting sights , its Main Street has to be one of the most depressing places in New York City .
Lined with ugly , box - shaped brown buildings that block out the sun , it seems to exist in perpetual darkness .
Main Street is the commercial district for the island , and consists of about ten or fifteen shops , all of which seem to be named like the Fisher Price Main Street .
Want your nails done ?
Go to “ Nail Salon ” at # 570 !
Looking to brighten your girlfriend ’s day ?
Perhaps a trip to the “ Flower Shop ” is in order !
Of course , it ’s nice to get a discount once in a while , and for that you need go no farther than “ The Thrift Store . ”
Need a new hammer ?
Looking to rent that silly mall cop movie that recently came out ?
You ’re in luck – on Roosevelt Island , you can do both at the same establishment .
Sure , most churches are named after a particular saint or martyr … but not on Roosevelt Island !
Finally , when you need to send your children to school …well , you get the idea .
The most creatively named place is the “ Cards ‘ n ’ Gifts ” shop across the street , the quirky yet satisfying reduction of the word “ and ” to a single letter suggesting a level of creativity far superior to that of their neighbors :
And lest you think these are ancient holdovers from a bygone era , I happened upon an island sign putter - upper hanging a brand new “ Senior Citizens Center ” sign .
I ’m being a bit facetious – some of these stores sort of have actual names hidden in the shadows of Main Street ’s alleyways .
But I get the sense that , with such little space available , perhaps the island designated each storefront for a particular purpose , and regardless of the current tenant , say , # 570 will always be “ Nail Salon . ”
Ha , I always liked the idea of the perfect archetypal Lego Main Street , but now I ’m not so sure …

Venezuela has revoked the licences of dozens of radio stations as part of a wider crackdown which could jail people deemed guilty of " media crimes " for up to four years .
At least 13 stations went off the air over the weekend and another 21 were expected to follow soon in an effort by President Hugo Chávez to extend his socialist revolution .
The move followed last week 's introduction of a draft law to jail journalists and broadcasters who " harm the interests of the state " , " cause panic " or " disturb social peace " .
Critics denounced the moves as a recipe for censorship .
" What we are witnessing is the most comprehensive assault on free speech in Venezuela since Chávez came to power , " said Jose Miguel Vivanco , Americas director at Human Rights Watch .
" With the exception of Cuba , Venezuela is the only country in the region that shows such flagrant disregard for universal standards of freedom of expression . "
Several hundred protesters held a vigil outside one Caracas station , CNB 102.3 FM , for its final transmission on Saturday .
" This is a government attack , " said the station director , Zaira Belfort .
" We want to keep living in democracy , and once again they 've silenced us . "
The government 's telecommunications agency said it would revoke the licences of up to 240 radio stations , almost 40 % of the total , citing irregular paperwork .
It said the closures were lawful and that most radio stations remained in private hands .
Chávez applauded the decision and said the licences would be " given back to the people " in the form of broadcasters who shared his leftist vision .
He has also threatened to shut Globovision , the last outspoken opposition TV channel , claiming it was part of a " media war " backed by United States imperialists .
After a decade in power the former tank commander remains popular for his anti-poverty programmes but has tightened his grip in the wake of mounting economic problems .
Last month the government yanked opposition TV and radio adverts off the air and proposed compelling cable channels to carry Chávez 's speeches live .
Critics have been most alarmed by the attorney general 's announcement last week that freedom of expression " must be limited " with a yet - to - be defined bill on " media crimes " .

So the optimization you 're looking for here is fusion of some kind .
GHC ships with build / foldr fusion , and there are libraries for an alternative system , stream fusion .
GHC uses an intermediate representation called ' Core ' , which is a mini-Haskell , essentially , that is optimized repeatedly via type - preserving transformations .
You can inspect this with a number of tools , including " ghc- core " ( available on Hackage ) .
Now , you 're example uses a list comprehension ( which is translated into an enumFromTo call , and a call to filter .
It also uses a call to sum , which is a non-fusing left - fold under build / foldr fusion , but fuses under stream fusion .
I 'll desugar your code explicitly , and translate the calls from build / foldr to stream - fusible functions : $ cabal install uvector import Data .
Array .
Vector main = print .
sumU .
filterU ( \x -> x `mod` 3 == 0 || x `mod` 5 == 0 ) $ enumFromToU 3 ( 999 :: Int ) Running through ghc - core we see : 146 PreInlineUnconditionally 320 PostInlineUnconditionally 84 UnfoldingDone 18 RuleFired 7 +# 1 -# 1 <=# 2 ==#->case 1 ># 3 SC : $ wfold0 1 fromIntegral / Int-> Int 2 streamU / unstreamU 12 LetFloatFromLet 1 EtaReduction 210 BetaReduction 8 CaseOfCase 94 KnownBranch 4 CaseMerge 5 CaseElim 6 CaseIdentity 1 FillInCaseDefault 18 SimplifierDone Showing what transformations happened .
Notably , 2 occurences of the " streamU/unstreamU " transformation , to remove intermediate structures .
The final code looks like : $ s$wfold :: Int# ->
Int# $ s$wfold = \ ( sc_s19l :: Int# ) -> case modInt# ( -9223372036854775807 ) 3 of wild21_a14L { __DEFAULT -> case modInt# ( -9223372036854775807 ) 5 of wild211_X159 { __DEFAULT -> $ wfold sc_s19l ( -9223372036854775806 ) ; 0 -> $ wfold (+# sc_s19l ( -9223372036854775807 ) ) ( -9223372036854775806 ) } ; 0 -> $ wfold (+# sc_s19l ( -9223372036854775807 ) ) ( -9223372036854775806 ) } $ wfold :: Int# -> Int# ->

Which might take a while to understand , but the key thing is the types at the top level are Int# -- they do n't allocate [ Int ] , but instead use unboxed , machine - level int values .
Optimization succesful .
There are papers and manuals describing " GHC Core " - the intermediate form - on haskell.org .
For fusion , google for " deforestation " or " stream fusion " .

Mark Fiore , a Bay Area cartoonist and winner of the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning , appears every Thursday on SFGate .
A cyclist who knocked down an 84 - year - old pedestrian who later died has been jailed for seven months .
Supermarket worker Darren Hall , 20 , cycled down a hill in Weymouth , Dorset , too fast and rode on to the pavement , Dorchester Crown Court heard .
Hall was said to be riding " like a bat out of hell " when he hit Ronald Turner in August 2008 .
He died 13 days later .
Hall , of Weymouth , pleaded guilty to the 19th Century offence of wanton and furious driving causing bodily harm .
He was also banned from driving for a year .
Hall had admitted the offence at an earlier hearing .
The court heard that on 8 August last year Hall cycled around a blind bend but was travelling too quickly to take evasive action .
He told police he had been forced on to the pavement to avoid a swerving car .
The wanton and furious driving charge goes back to 1861 under the Offences Against the Person Act and reflects the gravity of the incident
Sgt Tony Burden
An off - duty nurse helped Mr Turner , who was taken to Dorset County Hospital in Dorchester with head injuries where he died on 21 August .
In a statement , his daughter Gillian Muhl said : " The cyclist was described as riding like a bat out of hell .
" Mr Turner 's family are relieved that the whole episode has been brought to a close and urge all cyclists to stay off the pavement .
" If they choose to break the law then they must expect to face the consequences of their actions . "
Speaking after the hearing , Sgt Tony Burden said : " There is no such thing as causing death by dangerous or careless cycling .
" There is only careless or dangerous driving which the Crown Prosecution Service thought because of the seriousness of the offence was too minor .
" The wanton and furious driving charge goes back to 1861 under the Offences Against the Person Act and reflects the gravity of the incident .
" This case clearly highlights the dangers of riding a cycle on a pavement .
Adults should be riding on the road and if they are forced to go on to a pavement they should take extreme care and always give priority to pedestrians . "
Correction 14 August 2009 : An earlier version of this story , based on an agency report , incorrectly stated that Hall had mounted the pavement to avoid a red traffic light .

More on why you should not volunteer with children Share This :
I looked further into the story in the hope of finding reason to believe Tripoli is guilty because I hate , hate , hate the thought of a man 's life being ruined because of an act of kindess he rendered to a child .
But the more I uncover the more I am convinced of his innocence . .
Let me run down some of the facts giving me great pause :
-- There is no physical evidence that molestation ever happened .
No suspicions reported by the parents .
Medical personnel who examined the girl found no signs of penetration .
-- Volunteers for the program Tripoli was in undergo a screening process , that includes exhaustive local and national criminal history and sex offender checks .
His record was so clean that he literally did not have a speeding ticket . .
-- The police could not find other children molested by him .
The man was 68 - years - old .
I find it difficult to believe that Tripoli , who worked with children , suddenly became a child molestor in his retirement years . .
-- The tutoring and , so , the alleged molestation supposedly took place in a cafeteria - like area at the public school where food service workers were coming and going unpredictably .
Volunteers also know that school officials will monitor their work in some manner from time - to - time .
-- No one witnessed Tripoli taking the girl to or from a secluded area .
-- Parents approve the tutoring as well as the tutor matched with their child .
-- In the courtroom , the girl couldnâ€™t identify Tripoli .
The prosecuting attorney ascribed this to the fact that he had lost 20 pounds -- undoubtedly from stress -- and was no longer tanned .
-- One of the alleged incidents occurred on February 15th , 2008 .
Tripoli was not at the school that day .
He established his presence at a softball game through several witnesses .
-- The girl was interviewed by Tripoli's female supervisor at least three times and never said anything about inappropriate touching .
-- Moreover ... Tripoli seems like a decent man .
A comment appended to this news story came from a fellow who claims to have sat through the trial .
He wrote ,
I do know that all mentors , bus drivers anyone who is in contact with young children is put through a backround check , and it was testified that nothing came up on his record , not even a parking ticket .
The detectives also ran a backround check and came up with nothing .
" Mr Tony " had been a mentor for 4 years and no other charges came from it .
Why would a man of 60 something ruin the rest of his life for this offense ?
Pictures were presented at the trial which showed the area where the one - on - one was going on in very public areas , the cafeteria , the copy room , all open areas where people were walking in and out all the time and noone saw anything .
For almost two years this man has been under scrutiny and not a blemish .
I really would be interested to know how the jury came to their decision .
I think it may have been wrong this time .
I hope this young girl will have a long happy healthy life as she does appear to be having .
And I hope this was the correct verdict because if it was n't another whole family is getting messed up .
As for the person who suggests he looks like a child abuser , shame on you .
You can't judge a book by its cover .
Take a look in the mirror .
You might think you look intelligent .
In his closing argument , defense attorney Thomas Garland called the charges against Tripoli â€œevery manâ€™s worst nightmare .
All it takes is for one person to say something happened .â€ 
He warned of the " chilling effect " a guilty verdict would on any man who volunteers to work with children .
To my great relief , after the verdict , Garland announced plans to seek a new trial .

I was not selected for the jury either but I did sit thru testimony and it seems to me evidence was lacking .
The 8 year old , who was seven at the time of the incident changed her story from the time of the first accusation to the statement made in the video to the time she was on the witness stand .
Each time her statements were a little more rehearsed and I think a young mind like that could be influenced by others .
She may very well have been abused but I do n't think it was by this man .
As a victim of child abuse myself , I do recall some things and I had alot of " issues " depression , fear , This 8 year old girl appeared to have not a care in the world and even the mother and teachers did not notice any change in her behavior .
When she heard the name " Mr Tony " her face lit up like she was talking about a friend not an abuser .
I do know that all mentors , bus drivers anyone who is in contact with young children is put through a backround check , and it was testified that nothing came up on his record , not even a parking ticket .

Why would a man of 60 something ruin the rest of his life for this offense ?
Pictures were presented at the trial which showed the area where the one - on - one was going on in very public areas , the cafeteria , the copy room , all open areas where people were walking in and out all the time and noone saw anything .
For almost two years this man has been under scrutiny and not a blemish .
I really would be interested to know how the jury came to their decision .
I think it may have been wrong this time .
I hope this young girl will have a long happy healthy life as she does appear to be having .
And I hope this was the correct verdict because if it was n't another whole family is getting messed up .
As for the person who suggests he looks like a child abuser , shame on you .
You can't judge a book by its cover .
Take a look in the mirror .
You might think you look intelligent .
In his closing argument , defense attorney Thomas Garland called the charges against Tripoli â€œevery manâ€™s worst nightmare .
All it takes is for one person to say something happened .â€ 
He warned of the " chilling effect " a guilty verdict would on any man who volunteers to work with children .
To my great relief , after the verdict , Garland announced plans to seek a new trial .

I have n't been able to get Anthony J. Tripoli out of my mind .
He is the 69 - year - old man I wrote about in a July 19th blog post .
He was a volunteer who tutored children one - on - one in reading skills at a public school in Florida .
Based on the testimony of an 8 - year - old girl and without any supporting evidence whatever , he was given a life sentence for allegedly touching her in an inappropriate -- that is , a sexual -- manner .
In reading the news story , I thought the man was probably innocent and a victim of the public / legal hysteria that surrounds the issues of children and sex .
I looked further into the story in the hope of finding reason to believe Tripoli is guilty because I the thought of a man 's life being ruined because of an act of kindess he rendered to a child .
But the more I uncover the more I am convinced of his innocence .
.
Let me run down some of the facts giving me great pause : -- There is no physical evidence that molestation ever happened .
No suspicions reported by the parents .
Medical personnel who examined the girl found no signs of penetration .-- Volunteers for the program Tripoli was in undergo a screening process , that includes exhaustive local and national criminal history and sex offender checks .
His record was so clean that he literally did not have a speeding ticket .
.-- The police could not find other children molested by him .
The man was 68 - years - old .
I find it difficult to believe that Tripoli , who worked with children , suddenly became a child molestor in his retirement years .
.-- The tutoring and , so , the alleged molestation supposedly took place in a cafeteria - like area at the public school where food service workers were coming and going unpredictably .
Volunteers also know that school officials will monitor their work in some manner from time - to - time .
-- No one witnessed Tripoli taking the girl to or from a secluded area .
-- Parents approve the tutoring as well as the tutor matched with their child .
-- In the courtroom , the girl couldnâ€™t identify Tripoli .
The prosecuting attorney ascribed this to the fact that he had lost 20 pounds -- undoubtedly from stress -- and was no longer tanned .
-- One of the alleged incidents occurred on February 15th , 2008 .
Tripoli was not at the school that day .
He established his presence at a softball game through several witnesses .
-- The girl was interviewed by Tripoli 's female supervisor at least three times and never said anything about inappropriate touching .-- Moreover ... Tripoli seems like a decent man .
One paper reported , A neighbor in The Fountains off U.S. 1 described Tripoli as a nice and quiet man who played softball with other senior residents and liked to work on his car .
" He has a very lovely wife , " said the woman , who asked that her name not be used .
" We 're all sick over that .
" A comment appended to this news story came from a fellow who claims to have sat through the trial .
He wrote ,
The Pentagon has begun using a contractor to rate the attitudes of potential embedded reporters , according to the partially - government - funded Stars & Stripes newspaper .
" U.S. public affairs officials in Afghanistan acknowledged to Stars & Stripes that any reporter seeking to embed with U.S. forces is subject to a background profile by The Rendon Group , " the paper reported Monday .
Rendon reportedly ranks reporters ’ stories as " positive , " " negative " or " neutral " towards U.S. war aims .
The Pentagon denied that the ratings were used to screen embeds .
Besides , the military stopped using the " positive , " " negative " and " neutral " labels in October , according to Pentagon spokesman Brian Whitman .
Now the Pentagon simply looks for accuracy in reporters ' stories , said Capt .
Elizabeth Mathias , a military media handler in Kabul .
" It 's so we know who we 're working with , " Mathias said .
Today Stars & Stripes fired back , quoting from leaked documents that show the military continues to use the " positive , " " negative " and " neutral " system .
" One of the profiles [ in the leaked documents ] evaluates work published as recently as May , indicating that the rating practice did not in fact cease last October as Whitman stated , " the newspaper revealed .
Worse , the Rendon reports are being used to craft strategies for influencing journalists , according to Stars & Stripes .
The paper quotes a Rendon report recommending the military steer a particularly " subjective " TV reporter towards " the positive work of a successful operation " in order to " result in favorable coverage . "
Prof. Bob Zelnick , a former ABC military reporter now at Boston University , is worried about the prospect
of Pentagon media manipulation .
" I do n't think war can be covered in any significant way without an embedded component to the coverage , " he told Danger Room .
" That 's the way every war was covered , from the Civil War right up to Vietnam . "
He added that small media outlets – blogs , free weeklies , local papers – are more vulnerable to Pentagon screening than big , established outlets that can loudly protest any military manipulation .
Still , Zelnick said , all media have the power to reverse any wrong - headed Pentagon press policies .
" It seems to me , if reporters are being denied access , or if that access is severely controlled , I 'd take it right to the top .
I think current Secretary of Defense [ Bob ] Gates is sympathetic to fair coverage . "

HTTP category : architecture tags : crud , interface , rest
This is to comment on a perception forming that REST encourages exposing basic data elements through CRUD and that it encourages development of dumb applications ( applications with shallow business logic ) .
Apart from some tweets I saw on the topic and some twitter conversations , the blog posts which perhaps set off the thought were
The underlying fear and rationale for these posts makes a lot of sense - the fear of creating real dumb passive and shallow applications .
I submit , that the problem however is not CRUD - it is resource identification and scoping , and CRUD is not only good for but is the right way to build intelligent , active and deep applications .
CRUD supports Uniform Interface :
The primary reason why CRUD gets used is because it supports a uniform interface .
At the end of the day , a consistent Create / Read / Update / Delete or POST / GET / PUT / DELETE interface makes things easy .
It makes things easy for the development team because of the consistency it introduces in their applications .
It makes things easy for the clients who have a simple and consistent interface to deal with .
At the interface level CRUD breeds consistency , and at the risk of broad generalisation , consistency is good .
So why do we end up creating shallow applications at times with REST ?
CRUD in general works with simple forms built on simple tables .
Quite often this style of programming gets elevated into simple forms over simple domain objects .
Standardised CRUD helps a lot at the lower end of application development and most database driven application developers are likely to have at some stage in their early development life attempted to build a small CRUD library or framework to help themselves substantially .
The reason why we are likely to be ending up creating shallow applications is not because we apply CRUD , but because we continue to apply CRUD on tables or simple domain objects .
And therein lie the distinctions
REST is not about CRUD on tables - its about CRUD on resources
CRUD is the interface - not the implementation
I attempt to bring up the difference in the example that I detail below .
Simple Account Transfer Example
Lets say we want to build the software to transfer amount X from account A into account B . Lets further specify that a transfer is not effected immediately and requires one more explicit approval .
Lets also specify that while a transfer is waiting to be approved , it could be amended .
Thats the simple scenario that we shall deal with .
In order to implement this , we shall define a datastructure / table / object for Account which shall contain a field called balance .
Further there shall also be Transfer table / object which shall contain the fields sourceAccount , destinationAccount , amount and status .
The possible status values shall be Initiated and Completed .
In a simple service oriented application we shall perhaps have a transfer service .
Ignoring error handling , SOA wrapping etc. , the service interface will probably boil down to the following equivalent Java interface .
public interface TransferService { public Long transfer ( Long sourceAccountId , Long destination AccountId , BigDecimal amount ) ; public Transfer get ( Long transfer Id ) ; public void amend ( Long transfer Id , Long sourceAccountId , Long destination AccountId , BigDecimal amount ) ; public approve ( Long transfer Id ) }
Lets think of these might get modeled in a REST environment .
The important thing to remember is - do n't think about services or functions or methods - think about what are the resources you choose to expose using a simple CRUD interface .
# The following creates a new transfer .
The returned data shall include # the URI of the new transfer , and the URI to approve it POST / transfer #
The following retrieves the status of a current transfer .
If it has not # been approved the returned data shall include the URI to approve it .
GET / transfer / $ { id } #
The following modifies the transfer .
The returned data shall also # include the URI to approve it PUT / transfer / $ { id } #
The following approves and further processes the transfer .
It shall # return the URI for the transfer POST / transfer / $ { id } / approve
While most of this seems all right - what sticks out like a sore thumb to me is the approve URI .
Its just so SOAish / RPCish .
Plus at least the way this particular interface has been implemented , there is no way to access the approval specific information , without actually accessing the transfer .
Hence I suggest that we define a new resource TransferApproval to account for the same .
# The following creates a new approval .
If successfully executed # the transfer is complete and no future amendments or approvals # are allowed .
the returned data shall include the TransferApproval # URI and the transfer URI POST / transfer / $ { id } / approval #
The following gets an existing approval GET / transfer / $ { id } / approval / $ { approval Id }
Please note that the " $ {approvalId} " at the approval URI simply was n't required - since there exists a 1 - 1 relationship with the transfer .
I just included it for easier understanding .
If I had to implement the functionality as is I would choose to skip it however if I knew I would very soon need to build in multi-stage approval ( as in most banking systems ) , I would keep it so that each approval against a transfer can also be listed .
But the really interesting method above is the POST .
This is a seemingly simple new ( in RDBMS parlance ) insert into Transfer Approval table .
But if you are building a REST service , you might be tempted to encourage your clients to not only create the new TransferApproval resource , but also go back and update the Transfer table to update a status to Approved .
That would be a smell .
Once the POST on the approval is processed , all side effects on other tables should be handled while servicing the POST request .
In other words the POST request is not just an insert - its an insert with an associated trigger to conduct all the necessary downstream processing .
And its essential one looks at request servicing in this manner so that CRUD can be used effectively .
Servers should be designed this way , and clients should anticipate it and we should be on our way to build non-shallow applications .
So finally - CRUD is good .
It makes things easy for the clients .
Stick to CRUD .
Just remember that it is CRUD on resources and not on tables , and the resources shall handle all the downstream changes necessary so that you do n't have to .
And finally CRUD is the interface , not the implementation .
Note : Some might notice that this post is just a much more detailed elucidation of one of my earlier posts - REST is the DBMS of the internet .
Dr Fatih Birol , chief economist at the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , says his agency 's recent study of 800 oil fields around the world ( representing three quarter 's of the world 's oil reserves ) reveal that we are facing a global energy catastrophe even sooner than researchers thought .
The IEA estimates that the decline in oil production in existing fields is now running at 6.7 per cent a year compared to the 3.7 per cent decline it had estimated in 2007 , which it now acknowledges to be wrong .
This means the pressure will be on to start using enivonmentally - disastrous tar sands in Canada .

When it comes to choosing guns , thirty years of hits and misses has taught me that a gun I do n’t like to shoot wo n’t accompany me to the range .
Comfort is thus a key consideration when choosing a firearm .
Especially with handguns , accuracy is required for effect .
Every handgun cartridge has documented instances where a determined attacker absorbed hit after center - of - mass hit and kept right on being a threat .
The reality is that even someone with holes in their heart can keep going long enough to kill .
Only solid hits on the central nervous system are decisive and instant fight - stoppers .
People who buy someone else ’s favorite hand cannon ( sorry for the offensive T - shirt in the link ) , shoot it a couple times and put it in a drawer to gather dust may not be helping themselves .
It ’s not much better if the shooter develops a flinch from anticipating recoil , muzzle blast or being hit by ejected cases from their gun .
For many , the answer lies in choosing guns that are not so powerful as to discourage practice .
Among handguns a great example is the 9 mm Luger .
When loaded with 124 grain or 147 grain jacketed hollow points this cartridge typically performs well in gelatin testing .
There are many great gun designs ( here , here , here , here , here , etc. ) that chamber the 9 mm .
My favorites are the Glock and ( cover your ears , Mr. Browning ) and model 1911 - A1 .
The Glock pistol chambered for 9 mm is simplicity itself , reliable , relatively easy to master , has magazines of capacities varying from 10 rounds to the 33 - round version essential for battling zombie hordes ( legality depending on where you live ) , and is surprisingly customizable .
Gun Digest 2009 : The W ... Ramage , Ken Best Price : $ 2.36 Buy New $ 58.86 ( as of 11:20 EST - Details )
1911 - style pistols often have among the best triggers of all repeating firearms .
Most 1911 pistols are chambered for the original 45 ACP cartridge , a wonderful round designed around military specifications set in the last days of the horse cavalry .
It was intended to equal the 45 Colt revolver cartridge , useful for among other things shooting horses weighing half a ton from under their riders .
While there ’s nothing wrong with a 45 ACP that shoots a 230 grain bullet at about 900 feet / second , the same gun chambered for the 9 mm Luger , shooting a 147 grain bullet about 980 feet / second makes for a much more enjoyable experience .
That often translates to more range time .
Until recently the 1911 / 9 mm combination suffered from reliability problems ; some would feed , fire , and eject without fail , many would choke periodically .
One manufacturer , Springfield Armory , redesigned the magazine under the guidance of legendary competitive shooter Rob Leatham and now the 1911 in 9 mm is as reliable a combination as can be found .
Finding one is the problem .
They remain rare although more companies are making them now than ever before ( here or here , for example ) .
Some makers offer downsized versions of the 1911 ( here , here , here ) , reduced to fit the smaller cartridge from the ground up .
They ’re quite pricey , but get rave reviews .
Regarding shoulder - fired guns , a good defensive carbine ( a rifle with a shorter barrel and less powerful cartridge ) can be just as good a fight - stopper as a shotgun at short range but contains a whole lot more rounds in the magazine , not to mention the carbine ’s usefulness at longer ranges should the unusual need arise .

Massad F. Ayoob Best Price : $ 2.13 Buy New $ 18.95 ( as of 11:20 EST - Details )
A breakthrough in this area is currently in process .
The effectiveness of a rifle bullet apparently has much to do with fragmentation .
The " old " military load for the M16 was a 55 grain bullet moving about 3240 feet / second when it exited a 20 inch barrel .
Within about 125 yards the bullet was still moving fast enough that upon hitting a person the bullet would break into two or more pieces and each fragment would sow a separate path of destruction through tissue and potentially hit an important anatomical target .
Recent changes toward shorter - barreled weapons and a heavier , longer bullet led to concerns about performance .
Fragmentation occurred less often and only at shorter ranges due to the slower velocity of the bullet .
A " fix " that started within the Army was to develop a new cartridge that addressed the shortcomings of the 5.56 NATO round and improved upon the 7.62×39 cartridge fired by the AK - 47 .
The result was the 6.8 mm Remington SPC cartridge .
This new cartridge has seen its share of controversy and growing pains and its widespread adoption by the military is unlikely , but it is gaining a committed following among civilian shooters and hunters .
In properly set up rifles ( usually variants of the AR15 ) it hurls a bullet twice as heavy as the 5.56 NATO at nearly the same velocity when both are shot from handy 16 inch barrels .
Depending on the specific bullet used , it offers fragmentation out to 300 yards and retains the ability to penetrate common barriers like car windows and doors .
The 6.8 shoots soft , carries up to 25 rounds in a magazine , is often exquisitely accurate , all in a design that is thoroughly proven and user serviceable .
Its major drawbacks are ammunition availability and cost , with factory - loaded cartridges running around a dollar per shot ( about the same as 308 Win and twice that of cheap 5.56 NATO FMJ practice ammo ) .
Since I believe it ’s folly to plan on fighting the Next American Revolution , I consider these issues negligible .
Revolutionary Language Calderwood , David C. Best Price : $ 4.48 Buy New $ 13.27 ( as of 03:45 EST - Details )
The 6.8 deserves serious consideration by anyone looking for a long gun .
It is effective from zero to 300 yards , easy on the shooter ’s shoulder whether being fired or carried , and customizable to most persons ’ tastes and budgets , plus it meets one of the most important criteria of all : it is still fun to shoot after a couple of magazines ’ worth of rounds are expended .
Examples of the 6.8 SPC AR15 are here , here , here , and here .
These last three sell only the expensive part , which is the upper half of the rifle ; the lower half of any AR15 , regardless of manufacturer , simply snaps on and must be purchased through a licensed firearm dealer , for a total cost around $ 1,000 to $ 1,200 .
One of the best aspects of the AR platform is how any home hobbyist can buy a quality stripped receiver from a gun shop and mail order all the other parts to assemble one at home .
When it comes to the 6.8 SPC , my strong preference would be to assemble the lower myself and buy a quality complete upper receiver from one of the firms with an overall rating of " A " on this chart .
Guns of other calibers have merit ; I just wish I had n’t spent so much money these past 30 years on guns I learned to dislike shooting .
Give me a 9 mm pistol or the newest 6.8 SPC any day .

Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri is calling for a further weakening of the American Climate and Energy Security Act ( ACES ) that passed out of the House last week .
Of course , that ’s not what she calls it .
Sen .
McCaskill twittered last week :
I hope we can fix cap and trade so it does n’t unfairly punish businesses and families in coal dependent states like Missouri .
( emphasis mine )
I ca n’t help but wonder what happened to the Senator who dared mention that oil prices should n’t be allowed to fall too far at the Rocky Mountain Roundtable , Session 2 , Part 3 , during the DNC :
There ’s a certain reality here that it is important that we do n’t get gas too cheap again , and I certainly agree with what [ Randy Udall ] said .
We will never see the days of … when people are pumping $ 1 , $ 1.50 gas again .
And that may not be an all bad thing because it will motivate the politics on this issue to the forefront so we have a sense of urgency .
Lest you think I ’m casting dispersions here , not only was I one of only a few obvious press in attendance , but here ’s the audio in question .
I apologize for the audio quality – I ’m hardly a professional sound person .
A more cynical person than myself might make me wonder if Sen.
McCaskill ’s complaint about ACES is more because coal mining giant Peabody Energy , headquartered in Missouri , supported her election to the tune of $ 5,000 in direct PAC contributions ( equal to former Sen .
Ted Stevens of Alaska and fellow Missouri Senator Christopher “ Kit ” Bond ) .
Given that ’s a paltry sum compared to the donations she ’s received from most other sectors , perhaps not .
Perhaps , though , it ’s fair to wonder if Sen.
McCaskill would have had the courage to criticize coal had coal prices spiked equivalently to oil prices last summer ….
UPDATE : There has been some criticism of Sen.
McCaskill for her comments about the ACES cap and trade provisions .
Here ’s a few links to sites that have also taken her to task for her call to weaken it even further :

Digging out of debt keeps getting harder for the unemployed as more companies use detailed credit checks to screen job prospects .
Out of work since December , Juan Ochoa was delighted when a staffing firm recently responded to his posting on Hotjobs.com with an opening for a data entry clerk .
Before he could do much more , though , the firm checked his credit history .
The interest vanished .
There were too many collections claims against him , the firm said .
“ I never knew that nowadays they were going to start pulling credit checks on you even before you go for an interview , ” said Mr. Ochoa , 46 , who lost his job in December tracking inventory at a mining company in Santa Fe Springs , Calif .
“ Why would they need to pull a credit report ?
They ’d need something like that if you were applying at a bank . ”
Once reserved for government jobs or payroll positions that could involve significant sums of money , credit checks are now fast , cheap and used for all manner of work .
Employers , often winnowing a big pool of job applicants in days of nearly 10 percent unemployment , view the credit check as a valuable tool for assessing someone ’s judgment .

Un bebé de 26 días de nacido murió acribillado a balazos , luego de que su familia fuera atacada por un grupo de pistoleros en la ciudad de Chihuahua , la noche del sábado .
El pequeño recibió dos impactos de bala , informó la Procuraduría de Justicia , y perdió la vida en brazos de su madre , quien resultó herida .
Según testigos , la familia circulaba por la transitada avenida Tecnológico cuando dos vehículos comenzaron a seguirlos ; al intentar huir , abrieron fuego en su contra .
Vinicio Guadalupe Gurrola Garibaldi , conductor de la camioneta
Tahoe en la que viajaban , intentó perder al comando internándose en la colonia Revolución ; sin embargo , al llegar al cruce de Marielena Hernández y Pascual Orozco los alcanzaron .
El chofer y padre del pequeño recibió varios disparos que le provocaron la muerte , mientras que la madre y un hermano del menor resultaron lesionados .
Paramédicos y agentes policiacos prácticamente tuvieron que arrancar al bebé de los brazos de su madre , quien se negaba a soltarlo , en medio de una profunda crisis nerviosa .
Hasta el momento no hay detenidos por el ataque , confirmó la fiscalía .
Guerra entre narcos
El sábado , alrededor de las 23:30 horas , se enfrentaron a balazos dos grupos armados sobre el kilómetro 298 de la autopista Morelia - Lázaro Cárdenas , con un saldo de un presunto delincuente herido y una camioneta Ford incendiada .
En el vehículo se hallaron rifles AK - 45 y AR - 15 ; pistolas 9 mm ; cargadores , y cartuchos de diferentes calibres .
La balacera ocurrió a siete kilómetros de un retén de la Armada de México , ubicado en el puente Dr. Ignacio Chávez , en los límites entre los estados de Michoacán y Guerrero , sobre la desembocadura del río Balsas .
Al lugar arribaron decenas de policías federales y militares , quienes acordonaron el área y realizaron la búsqueda de más presuntos delincuentes , sin resultados positivos .
El lesionado fue trasladado al Hospital General de Lázaro Cárdenas , en calidad de detenido ; fue identificado como Aurelio Torres González , de 37 años de edad , originario de Chutla , Guerrero .
En las últimas 24 horas , en crímenes relacionados con la delincuencia organizada , cuatro hombres fueron ejecutados en Michoacán ; dos cuerpos torturados , maniatados y con el tiro de gracia fueron hallados en Taretán y dos más en Morelia .
En Guerrero se reportaron tres homicidios más .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The popular “ cash - for - clunkers ” program is boosting U.S. auto sales and manufacturing but is also slashing donations to charities that rely on gifts of cars to fund social programs , charity officials say .
Smokes comes from the engine of a " clunker " that is being permanently disabled as part of the U.S. government 's " Cash for Clunkers " program at Clark Chrysler Jeep dealership in Methuen , Massachusetts August 7 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Brian Snyder
Volunteers of America and other charities that receive tens of thousands of cars each year said such donations have quickly fallen up to 12 percent -- and fear a 25 percent drop eventually , or over $ 100 million -- as owners rush to trade gas guzzlers for new fuel - efficient models while federal rebates last .
“ We started seeing it right away in July ” when the program began , said Jim Hartman , vice president of vehicle donations at Volunteers of America , a nationwide charity .
“ It varies by market , but there ’s been an 11 to 12 percent drop compared with last year . ”
“ The cars I ’m seeing cashed in as clunkers , like older SUVs , are absolutely the typical donation to us , ” he said .
The clunkers program gives consumers a U.S. government rebate of up to $ 4,500 for trading in older , inefficient vehicles for new , fuel - sipping ones .
Washington scrambled early this month to add $ 2 billion when the popular program ’s initial $ 1 billion funding was quickly spent .
Rick Frazier , director of the car donation program at The Military Order of the Purple Heart , which assists U.S. veterans , estimates the $ 3 billion will result in 700,000 clunker trades .
Frazier said charities would normally receive 25 percent of those 700,000 cars and , at an average value of $ 600 each , they could be out $ 105 million over 24 months .
“ That will be devastating , ” he said .
“ A lot of services will have to be cut . ”
HELPS VARIETY OF THE NEEDY
Over the last 20 years U.S. charities have started up car , airplane and boat donation programs they convert to cash that helps fund social services for the needy , including the elderly , the homeless , disabled vets and at - risk youths .
Volunteers of America and Purple Heart each get about 40,000 to 50,000 car donations a year .
Many go to auction while others are sold at a discount to low - income Americans .
But the clunkers program is also having social benefits by jolting the U.S. economy and putting people back to work .
Ford Motor said last week the program has ignited sales , prompting it to reopen plants and increase third - quarter production by 18 percent to 495,000 vehicles , especially its fuel - efficient Focus and Escape models .
Officials fear the clunkers ’ impact will linger for six to 12 months as hundreds of thousands of trade - ins are squeezed into the summer months .
Over the next year , Volunteers of America ’s car donation revenues could be cut 25 percent , Frazier said .
“ People usually take their time shopping for a new car , inquiring how much their old vehicle might fetch as a trade in , ” Hartman said .
“ We would n’t get them this week or next week but spread out over a year they ’d come in . ”
Only clunkers still running are eligible for rebates .
But charities are still getting “ non-runners , ” or junk cars , that are n’t eligible for the federal program .
Volunteers of America and Purple Heart have yet to alter their programs to inspire donations , officials said .
But Melwood , a Washington - area charity that helps people with disabilities , partnered with a popular restaurant chain to offer a $ 100 gift certificate to people who donate cars .
Under current law , donors get a tax deduction of up to $ 500 or the car ’s selling price if a charity sells the car .
But Hartman said he hopes Congress will approve a bill pending in the House of Representatives that promotes charitable donations of cars , boats or airplanes by allowing tax deductions of up to $ 2,500 or the item ’s appraised value .
When Benny Raz moved house 15 years ago , Karnei Shomron seemed like an obvious choice .
It sits on a hilltop surrounded by rocky slopes stretching to the horizon and is only a few minutes ' drive from the major cities of central Israel .
Discounted prices meant he could upgrade to a spacious , seven - bedroomed house with a view .
To make it even more tempting the government gave him a subsidised mortgage .
In this small , quiet town of fewer than 5,000 people was a country club , with swimming pool , tennis courts , green public parks and a fresh mountain breeze .
" We came here and saw a beautiful place and so we bought a house , " said Raz , 56 .
Karnei Shomron is , however , also deep inside the occupied West Bank , a Jewish settlement not far from the Palestinian city of Nablus and , under international law , illegal .
But when Raz and his family moved here in 1994 they and their neighbours did not consider themselves settlers .
It was the time of the Oslo peace accords and a moment of what Raz called " euphoria " about how Israelis and Palestinians might live together in peace .
It was also , ironically , a time of accelerated settlement growth .
" I came just for a good life .
I 'm not ideological , " said Raz .
There are thousands , perhaps tens of thousands more settlers like him who moved to the West Bank to take advantage of state - subsidised discounts , the so - called economic settlers .
Now Raz has come to realise there is no place for settlers like him if a peace agreement is ever to be struck with the Palestinians .
He is one of the founders of an organisation called Bayit Ehad , or One Home , which is trying to convince the Israeli government to offer financial compensation to allow those settlers to move back into Israel .
" The government helped me to come and the government must help me go , " he said .
His change of heart happened gradually .
There was the violence of the second intifada , the Palestinian uprising , which came into the heart of the settlement in February 2002 when a suicide bomber blew himself up in a pizzeria at the Karnei Shomron shopping mall , killing three Israeli teenagers .
Raz was there at the time , with his daughter , and lost his hearing in one ear .
Then there was the growth in Israeli army checkpoints and an increased sense of vulnerability .
When Israel began building its vast concrete and steel West Bank barrier , its long snaking route did not stretch around Karnei Shomron , leaving them and 70,000 other settlers to the east feeling vulnerable .
The settler movement has also changed , with secular Israelis losing influence to a more hardline , religious and millenarian element .
Then , four years ago , Israel withdrew its soldiers and settlers from Gaza .
At that point Raz and others like him came to realise their days as settlers in Karnei Shomron might be numbered and they started to canvass for support among Israeli politicians .
" I started to ask questions and nobody wanted to talk to me , " he said .
" The problem was the new border .
I asked if the Israeli government had a plan to leave this place and take the people away from here .
I do n't want to wait .
" If you have a plan to take me from here , take me now .
But you must help me . "
Of course , Raz could simply sell his house today but it would make less than half its original price , and far less than he has spent on mortgage payments .
House prices in settlements beyond Israel 's barrier have dropped with the realisation that the " security fence " is probably Israel 's idea of a final border .
Rightwing Israeli politicians did not want to listen to his concerns , but eventually Raz found an ally in Avshalom Vilan , who was at the time an MP for the leftwing Meretz party .
Vilan helped draw up an evacuation compensation plan under which he proposed the government would pay a reasonable price for homes that settlers wanted to leave .
The buildings would then be sealed and it would be a criminal act punishable by five years in jail for anyone who tried to live in the houses .
Vilan made many visits to the settlements and now believes tens of thousands of West Bank settlers might be interested .
" I found as many as half the settlers did n't come for ideology but for a better quality of life or because they wanted a new villa , " he said .
If his estimate is even close to accurate , it suggests it may be far easier to convince many settlers to leave than the Israeli government would have the world believe .
The idea was considered by the last government , under the then prime minister Ehud Olmert , but was eventually dropped because of pressure from influential rightwing , pro-settler parties .
Vilan argues a two - state settlement to the conflict is inevitable .
" It 's the only game in town , " he said .
" At the end of the day it 's well known that this is going to happen so why not do it before and give these people the chance to get out ? "
He is hoping to revive the compensation proposal and has written to the current prime minister , Benjamin Netanyahu , with whom he did military service in the same unit .
But several weeks later he is still awaiting a reply .
Part of the problem is that few of the economic settlers are prepared to speak out as publicly as Raz .
There are often disagreements even within families .
Raz 's son Roy , 26 , does not identify himself as a settler , despite his address , and talks enthusiastically about having Palestinian friends .
But he is worried that leaving the West Bank might only encourage a more violent reaction against Israel from Palestinian terrorists .
" I think a resolution will include the fact that we are going to leave this place and if it 's necessary to have a decent peace I would do it , " he said .
" But I do n't see how it can happen .
I do n't see how Israel would be protected and secure . "
Raz himself believes he lost his job working in the settlement municipality because of his political views .
He says he has been taunted and threatened by other settlers who see him as a challenge to their way of life .
There is little doubt they do not relish his presence .
One recent afternoon Raz stood on a deserted road at the outskirts of Karnei Shomron pointing out a nearby Palestinian village and the rolls of barbed wire fence between them .
Another settler suddenly drove up in his car , stopped , took several photographs of Raz and then crudely thrust his middle finger at him before accelerating away .
Sex education continues to be elusive in India .
A few months ago , a parliamentary committee on petitions rejected the new Adolescence Education Programme , a comprehensive sex education programme proposed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development .
India ’s “ social and cultural ethos are such that sex education has absolutely no place in it ” , the committee huffed .
Naturopathy and ayurveda should be taught instead .
Meanwhile , teenage girls continue to get married and become pregnant .
According to the National Family Health Survey III , nearly half of women in India get married before the age of 18 .
More than 50 % of children said they had faced one or more forms of sexual abuse , according to a 2007 study ( pdf ) by the ministry of women and child development .
They have neither the knowledge nor the means to protest or handle it adequately .
In this context , the committee ’s obstinacy seems baffling , almost brutal .
But it has its roots in deep - seated emotions that are closely entangled with centuries of religious and cultural mores .
Leaders from Buddha to Gandhi demonised sex , it was seen as something evil or dirty , something to be avoided , controlled or condemned .
Add to that elements of prudish patriarchy , peevish ignorance and paranoid imaginings about cultural colonisation and you have a mess of dysfunctional views with regard to sex .
That the committee ’s objections are irrational is clear .
Most can be broken down quite easily .
Its insistence that sex before marriage is “ immoral , unethical and unhealthy ” and that sex outside marriage is “ against the social ethos ” of the country is easily refuted given the current climate of sexual openness in the mass media .
Vague terms like “ decency ” and wild conjecturing about possible dangers seem strange counters to the very real , concrete facts on sexual abuse and HIV .
Culture is not a monolith ; it needs to change and adapt to shifting realities .
Policymakers and politicians need to realise this but a seismic shift of mindset will take time .
In the meantime , all we can do is to find ways around the official stance .
A number of NGOs are doing effective work in this sphere .
Mobile educational units that visit villages and towns are innovative and inclusive .
They create the space for honest dialogue without , as far as possible , scaring people away .
Comic books are being used to spread health awareness – and sex education could also use such ideas .
Some experts say that television can play a significant role .
Short programmes on sex education could help dispel some basic misconceptions .
Wherever possible , families must provide their children with sex education .
Neighbourhood groups should organise space for such discussions among their children .
Apartment co-operatives could organise talks with NGOs or health experts .
Of course , we must continue to hope for change at a higher level .
We must bring this up often , until the urgency is eventually recognised .
But let ’s also look at less formal methods .
Our failure to do so could be damaging – or even fatal – for our children .
Google Analytics helps you monitor , track and analyze your online marketing campaigns such as paid search campaigns ( PPC ) , banner ads , email marketing and other online programs .
Here , I have detailed on the tracking of paid campaigns .
How to track your Paid campaigns :
There are two ways to track your paid campaigns ( PPC )
1. Auto - tagging :
For Google Adwords : Go to My Account >>
Account Preferences and enable auto - tagging .
This lets Google Analytics to automatically produce reports with clicks , costs , conversions and other
information for every given keyword .
This can be done by linking your Adwords accounts and Google Analytics account .
When you do this for the first time , you will be suggested to automatically select destination URL autotagging and Cost Data Import .
2. Manual Tagging :
The second method to track your PPC campaign is through Manual tagging .
To do Manual tagging , you need to build your landing page URL with manually tagged campaign variables which should be added to the end of your URLs .
Manual tagging will help you to track your paid listings in Google , Yahoo , Adcenter , Facebook , Linkedin , Email campaigns etc .
Linking Adwords to Analytics :
Linking your Google AdWords account to Google Analytics , you would probably get advanced analytics reports .
These reports will evaluate Return on Investment ( ROI ) for your AdWords campaigns .
Link your Adwords account with Analytics which is placed on top of your Adwords account .
Purpose of Auto - tagging :
Auto - tagging your links is important since Analytics reports differentiate your Google sponsored listings from organic results traffic .
If you have not enabled auto - tagging , then Analytics would consider both your sponsored and organic results as coming from the same source and label them under Google organic results .
Auto - tagging would work by adding unique id , or g - c - l - i-d , at the end of your landing page URLs which allow Analytics to track and display click and cost data in your reports .
Manual URL Tagging :
Five variables are there when tagging URLs manually .
Each variable is separated by an ampersand .
Let ’s have a look on each variable .
URL builder helps you tag your landing page URLs in order to separate your paid listing traffic from other organic results .
Variable1 : utm_source —
To identify the specific website ( Search engine )
Variable2 : utm_medium —
To identify a medium for example , CPC for Cost Per Click
Variable3 : utm_term —
To identify the keywords
Variable4 : utm_content —
Differentiate ads or links that point to the same URL
Variable5 : utm_campaign —
To identify the name of the campaign
Example : http://www.example.com/car.html?utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=cpc&utm_term=car&utm_content=textlink&utm_campaign=car_sale
Data Discrepancies :
There are several reasons owing to which you may perceive differences between visits and clicks data in your Google Analytics and AdWords reports .
Some of them are :
1. Initially , AdWords tracks clicks while Analytics tracks visits .
Some visitors who click on your AdWords ads might have enabled JavaScript or cookies .
For such users , Analytics will not report the visits , but AdWords will report the clicks .
2 . If the Google Analytics code is not correctly inserted in all web pages , AdWords will track clicks but Analytics will not track visits .
3 . You may also notice the differences due to invalid clicks .
Though Google AdWords automatically filters an invalid click from your report center , Google Analytics will still record the visits .
While some may say that every picture tells a story , I 'm under the belief that only a few can do it right .
These are the masters of storytelling , the ones who can draw out an emotion in us and leave us with a lasting memory .
We 've written about some of these photographers right here at the MET .
Like Erik Johansson who stretches our imagination and turns reason upside down and inside out .
Or August Bradley , who crafts amazing scenes out of his imagination and who cites authors , such as Thomas Pynchon and David Foster Wallace , over fellow photographers as his sources of inspiration .
Thank you , photographers and artists , for showing us your point of view .
For explaining that it's our stories that connect us and our life experiences that bind us .
Thank you for being today 's modern - day storyteller .

A guaranteed bonus might strike many people as a contradiction in terms .
But on Wall Street , banks have become so eager to lure and keep top deal makers and traders that they are reviving the practice of offering ironclad , multimillion - dollar payouts  guaranteed , no matter how an employee performs .
The resurrection of the guaranteed bonus is sure to become a hot - button issue for the Obama administration ’s pay czar , Kenneth Feinberg , who is preparing this week to review how compensation should be structured at seven companies that received two or more federal bailouts .
The companies must each submit 2009 compensation plans for their top 25 earners by Thursday , and Mr. Feinberg has 60 days to rule on them .
He has the authority to single out any of those employees and adjust their pay packages .
In the next phase , he is to review the packages of the next 75 highest earners in each company .
For them , he can set pay formulas to be applied broadly .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
Researchers have developed a new technique that allows them to make a movie of bacteria infecting their living host .
Whilst most studies of bacterial infection are done after the death of the infected organism , this system developed by scientists at the University of Bath and University of Exeter is the first to follow the progress of infection in real - time with living organisms .
The researchers used developing fruit fly embryos as a model organism , injecting fluorescently tagged bacteria into the embryos and observing their interaction with the insect 's immune system using time - lapse confocal microscopy .
The researchers can also tag individual bacterial proteins to follow their movement and determine their specific roles in the infection process .
The insect immune cells known as hemocytes ( green ) rapidly engulf the bacteria following infection and this can be studied in real - time using timelapse microscopy .

The scientists are hoping to use this system in the future with human pathogens such as Listeria and Trypanosomes .
By observing how these bacteria interact with the immune system , researchers will gain a better understanding of how they cause an infection and could eventually lead to better antibacterial treatments .
Dr Will Wood , Research Fellow in the Department of Biology & Biochemistry at the University of Bath , explained : " Cells often behave very differently once they have been taken out of their natural environment and cultured in a petri dish .
" In the body , immune surveillance cells such as hemocytes ( or macrophages in vertebrates ) are exposed to a battery of signals from different sources .
The cells integrate these signals and react to them accordingly .
" Once these cells are removed from this complex environment and cultured in a petri dish these signals are lost .
Therefore it is really important to study whole organisms to fully understand how bacteria interact with their host . "
Dr Nick Waterfield , co-author on the study and Research Officer at the University of Bath , said : " To be able to film the microscopic battle between single bacterial cells and immune cells in a whole animal and in real time is astounding .
" It will ultimately allow us to properly understand the dynamic nature of the infection process . "
Professor Richard Ffrench - Constant , Professor of Molecular Natural History at the University of Exeter , added : " For the first time this allows us to actually examine infection in real time in a real animal - it's a major advance ! "
The study has been published in PLoS Pathogens .

The terms " pro-life " and " pro-choice " refer to the dominant ideologies concerning abortion rights .
Those who are pro-life , a term that some argue is biased because it suggests that the opposition does not value human life , believe that abortion should be banned .
Those who are pro-choice support keeping abortion legal and accessible .
In reality , the controversies related to reproductive rights are much more complex .
Some people back abortions in certain circumstances and not in others or believe such procedures should be " safe , rare , and legal . "
Complicating matters is that there 's no consensus on when exactly life begins .
The shades of gray in the abortion debate are why the reproductive rights discussion is far from simple .
The Pro-Life Perspective Someone who is " pro-life " believes that the government has an obligation to preserve all human life , regardless of intent , viability , or quality - of - life concerns .
A comprehensive pro-life ethic , such as that proposed by the Roman Catholic Church , prohibits : Abortion
Euthanasia and assisted suicide
The death penalty
War , with very few exceptions
In cases where the pro-life ethic conflicts with personal autonomy , as in abortion and assisted suicide , it 's considered conservative .
In cases where the pro-life ethic conflicts with government policy , as in the death penalty and war , it 's said to be liberal .
Pro-Choice Perspective People who are " pro-choice " believe that individuals have unlimited autonomy with respect to their own reproductive systems , as long as they do n't breach the autonomy of others .
A comprehensive pro-choice position asserts that the following must remain legal : Celibacy and abstinence
Contraception use
Emergency contraception use
Abortion
Childbirth Under the Partial Birth Abortion Ban passed by Congress and signed into law in 2003 , abortion became illegal under most circumstances in the second trimester of pregnancy , even if the mother 's health is in danger .
Individual states have their own laws , some banning abortion after 20 weeks and most restricting late - term abortions .
The pro-choice position is perceived as " pro-abortion " to some in the U.S. , but this is inaccurate .
The purpose of the pro-choice movement is to ensure that all choices remain legal .
Point of Conflict
The pro-life and pro-choice movements primarily come into conflict on the issue of abortion .
The pro-life movement argues that even a nonviable , undeveloped human life is sacred and must be protected by the government .
Abortion should be prohibited , according to this model , and not practiced on an illegal basis either .
The pro-choice movement argues that the government should not prevent an individual from terminating a pregnancy before the point of viability ( when the fetus can't live outside the womb ) .
The pro-life and pro-choice movements overlap to an extent in that they share the goal of reducing the number of abortions .
However , they differ with respect to degree and methodology .
Religion and the Sanctity of Life Politicians on both sides of the abortion debate only sometimes reference the religious nature of the conflict .
If one believes that an immortal soul is created at the moment of conception and that " personhood " is determined by the presence of that soul , then there is effectively no difference between terminating a week - old pregnancy or killing a living , breathing person .
Some members of the anti-abortion movement have acknowledged ( while maintaining that all life is sacred ) that a difference exists between a fetus and a fully - formed human being .
Religious Pluralism and the Obligation of Government The U.S. government can't acknowledge the existence of an immortal soul that begins at conception without taking on a specific , theological definition of human life .
Some theological traditions teach that the soul is implanted at quickening ( when the fetus begins to move ) rather than at conception .
Other theological traditions teach that the soul is born at birth , while some assert that the soul does n't exist until well after birth .
Still , other theological traditions teach that there is no immortal soul whatsoever .
Can Science Tell Us Anything ?
Although there is no scientific basis for the existence of a soul , there is no such basis for the existence of subjectivity , either .
This can make it difficult to ascertain concepts such as " sanctity . "
Science alone can't tell us whether a human life is worth more or less than a rock .
We value each other for social and emotional reasons .
Science does n't tell us to do it .
To the extent that we have anything approaching a scientific definition of personhood , it would most likely rest in our understanding of the brain .
Scientists believe that neocortical development makes emotion and cognition possible and that it does n't begin until the late second or early third trimester of pregnancy .
Alternative Standards for Personhood
Some pro-life advocates argue that the presence of life alone , or of unique DNA , defines personhood .
Many things that we do n't consider to be living persons might meet this criterion .
Our tonsils and appendices are certainly both human and alive , but we do n't consider their removal as anything close to the killing of a person .
The unique DNA argument is more compelling .
Sperm and egg cells contain genetic material that will later form the zygote .
The question of whether certain forms of gene therapy also create new persons could be raised by this definition of personhood .
Not a Choice
The pro-life vs. pro-choice debate tends to overlook the fact that the vast majority of women who have abortions do n't do so by choice , at least not entirely .
Circumstances put them in a position where abortion is the least self - destructive option available .
According to a study conducted by the Guttmacher Institute , 73 percent of women who had abortions in the United States in 2004 said that they could n't afford to have children .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- JPMorgan
Chase is grabbing a bigger slice of a smaller dealmaking pie -- leaving less for rival Bank of America .
New York - based JPMorgan ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) was the biggest fee earner on Wall Street in the first half of 2009 , according to figures released Thursday by markets data firm Dealogic .
JPMorgan generated $ 2.4 billion in fees for arranging stock and bond sales and mergers worldwide , Dealogic said .
That 's down 2 % from a year ago .
A small year - over - year drop would hardly be worth celebrating in a typical year .
But with Wall Street in steep decline -- industrywide fees dropped 30 % in the first half , Dealogic said -- JPMorgan 's performance stands out .
JPMorgan was the leading arranger of debt and equity offerings in the first half , displacing last year 's No. 1 underwriter , the combination of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch .
BofA Merrill fell to second in debt underwriting and fourth in equity underwriting .
Its fees plunged 45 % from the first half of last year .
The first half declines aside , BofA is hardly starving .
BofA earned underwriting fees of $ 1.6 billion , in the first half , according to Dealogic data .
Neither JPMorgan Chase nor BofA was able to supplant Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) as the top mergers and acquisitions adviser , though .
JPMorgan was second and BofA fifth this year -- the same as last year .
Goldman was second in fees over all , raking in $ 1.7 billion -- down 23 % from a year ago .
JPMorgan 's gains came as merger activity and equity issuance slowed along with the global economy , in spite of a flurry of second - quarter debt and equity sales tied to the bank stress tests and Troubled Asset Relief Program repayments .
Worldwide stock sales in the first half were at their lowest level since 2005 , while M&A volume plunged 36 % from a year earlier , Dealogic said .
The weak equity numbers came despite a record number of follow - on stock offerings as financial firms raised capital .
Still , more than half of JPMorgan 's total fee windfall -- $ 1.3 billion -- came from equity underwriting , Dealogic said .
Nothing succeeds like success
Analysts have been gushing about JPMorgan 's success during the financial crisis of the past two years .
Led by CEO Jamie Dimon , the bank has benefited from the tumult , having been chosen by the government to buy troubled rivals Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual when they were at death 's doorstep .
Dimon has also boasted of having built a " fortress balance sheet , " in contrast to rivals such as Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) that have had to resort to federal assistance to shore up their capital .
JPMorgan repaid its $ 25 billion TARP loan this month .
JPMorgan shares have gained 8 % this year , and bulls such as BernsteinResearch analyst John McDonald , who rates the stock a buy , see more good times ahead .
" The market may not fully appreciate the extent to which JPM has spent the cycle not just ' surviving ' -- but actually building , investing , and acquiring platforms for future growth , " McDonald wrote in a note to clients this month .
He said those gains should let the bank " emerge from the recession with greater earnings power and business momentum than it entered . "
JPMorgan 's momentum was especially apparent in Dealogic 's rankings of debt underwriters .
JPMorgan served as bookrunner , or lead arranger , on debt deals worth $ 185 billion in the first half .
That 's up from $ 172 billion last year .
By contrast , BofA Merrill 's debt underwriting volume dropped to $ 140 billion from $ 243 billion a year earlier , according to the Dealogic report .
The weak underwriting performance comes after a tumultuous period at Charlotte , N.C. - based BofA .
CEO Ken Lewis has come under fire for his decision to spend billions buying two struggling financial companies , Countrywide and Merrill Lynch , when their problems were getting worse .
Shareholders stripped Lewis of his chairman 's title in April , though he remains CEO .
He has also been questioned on Capitol Hill over the government 's role in the Merrill deal .
In January , the government provided BofA with $ 20 billion in capital and $ 118 billion in debt guarantees to ensure the bank would complete the purchase .
People of Ireland , vote ‘ Yes ’ for sex with eastern Europeans
... and other curious arguments for the Lisbon treaty .
Ireland ’s second referendum on the Lisbon treaty draws closer and the campaign groups have been re-mobilised , including Farmers for No and Solicitors for Europe .
Even comedians are having a go .
This week ( 25 August ) saw the launch of the book “ 100 reasons to vote yes to Lisbon II ” by sketch - writer Nick McGinley .
Some of it could have been posted on the European Commission ’s website or , worse , written by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing himself .
Entries such as “ Lisbon will improve R&D in European economies ” or “ the Lisbon treaty is an organic extension of the Union ” are unlikely to raise either a laugh or a ‘ Yes ’ vote .
But McGinley lets himself go occasionally .
Voters are urged to vote ‘ Yes ’ because , “ it will piss off the British Conservative Party ” , because “ Carla [ Bruni ] wants us to .
And what Carla wants , Carla gets ” and because “ it encourages a wider gene pool ” .
The latter reason is amplified as “ Voting yes for Lisbon … is the only act of patriotism left : if we want our sons and daughters to have green eyes , cheekbones you could skin a cat with , long legs and a musculature that ’s fit and svelte with bizarrely little need for exercise , then we have to do everything in our power to encourage more eastern Europeans to dull , grey Irish towns .
The only thing to do in these places , during a recession , when it rains , on a Sunday is to engage in copious amounts of Irish - Latvian , Irish - Polish , Irish - Lithuanian , Irish - Hungarian , Irish - Czech Republican sexual activity leading to planned , unplanned , phantom and glorious new Euro- pregnancies . ”
Well , the Irish voters might be persuaded , but Entre Nous predicts a backlash from Catlovers for No .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Internal Revenue Service announced Wednesday that it has reached a deal with the Swiss government , gaining access to thousands of UBS AG accounts that Americans might have used to avoid paying taxes .
" Thousands of taxpayers who avoided paying taxes in the past are being brought into compliance , " said IRS Commissioner Douglas Shulman in a teleconference with reporters .
" As this agreement demonstrates , the world of international taxes has drastically changed . "
An IRS press release stated that 4,450 accounts held by rich American investors were included in the settlement .
In the teleconference , Shulman said the IRS expects to gain access to a total of more than 5,000 UBS ( UBS ) accounts , through the IRS - UBS settlement , combined with a voluntary disclosure program and " other sources . "
He said these accounts have held $ 18 billion in assets at one time , though he did not have a current tally for their value .
A UBS spokeswoman would not comment on the value of the accounts and referred questions to a company press release .
In the release , UBS Chairman Kaspar Villiger said the settlement " helps to resolve one of UBS ' most pressing issues . "
" I am confident that the agreement will allow the bank to continue moving forward to rebuild its reputation through solid performance and client service , " said Villiger .
" UBS welcomes the fact that the information - exchange objectives of the settlement can be achieved in a lawful manner under the existing treaty framework between Switzerland and the United States . "
Deterrent :
The announcement is the result of a settlement that the IRS and Switzerland - based UBS reached earlier this month to track down and identify wealthy Americans who have avoided paying taxes by hiding their assets in offshore accounts .
Shulman said the deal should deter Americans from evading taxes in the future .
Shulman said investors who evaded taxes through UBS can avoid prosecution by reporting their tax activity by the Sept. 23 voluntary disclosure deadline , so long as they meet certain requirements .
" Although the clock is ticking , there is still time for you to come in and get right with your government , " said Shulman .
" Talk to your tax professional . "
Asher Rubinstein , an offshore attorney with New York - based Rubinstein & Rubinstein , said that some of his clients have participated in the voluntary disclosure program .
He said that taxpayers have to provide " complete and honest disclosure " and cannot participate if their funds are the proceeds of illegal activity .
" This is a government that is in need of cash , and the IRS is trying to raise the cash , " said Rubinstein , explaining the incentive for the program .
He said that the IRS was initially seeking 52,000 accounts and received about 5,000 , so it was n't a complete victory .
But still , he said the landscape has changed dramatically for U.S. - based tax evaders .
" The bottom line is that the days of tax havens are gone , " said Rubinstein .
" If you 're a wealthy American , you can't just expect to stash your money in the Cayman Islands or Switzerland or Liechtenstein and expect to be off the IRS radar . "
Shulman said during the teleconference that the IRS was " never interested in pursuing 52,000 accounts and this was never an IRS number .
" Remember , " he explained , " we filed this lawsuit when the Swiss government was taking the position that we could not have access to any of these accounts .
That posture changed in the past month and we were able to gain access to the accounts we wanted . "

Under the country 's draconian Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 , any drug trafficking offense garners a mandatory death sentence .
The ruling came Wednesday at the High Court in Kota Baru .
Judge Datuk Muhamad Ideres Muhamad Rapee ordered the sentence after the prosecution managed to prove a prima facie against Roseedah Cheubong , 41 , who was crying as the sentence was issued .
The court ignored the pleas of Roseedah 's attorney , Zamri Mat Nawang , who told it she was a single mother trying to fend for herself and her teenage child and that she was sorry for what she had done .
Instead , it listened to deputy prosecutors Wan Abad Razak Wan Hussin , who called for the mandated penalty because of the " gravity " of the offense .
Roseedah has been jailed since she was arrested in February 2004 for selling a kilogram of weed outside a gas station .
No word yet on possible appeals .
The provincial High Court sentence came little more than a week after the Malaysian Federal Court upheld the death sentence of a taxi driver for trafficking less than two kilos of marijuana .
According to the anti-death penalty organization Hands Off Cain , so far this year , Malaysian courts have imposed the death sentence 12 times .
Only two death sentences were for murder .
The other 10 were for drug trafficking , and eight of those were for trafficking marijuana .
Human rights and harm reduction groups have organized an international campaign to end the death penalty for drug offenses .
Read about it here .
Since Malaysia does not make a habit of publicly announcing executions , it is unclear how many of the marijuana traffickers sentenced to death have actually been executed .
Ms. Napolitano said in the interview that she would not call off immigration raids entirely as some Hispanic lawmakers have suggested .
“ We will continue to enforce the law and to look for effective ways to do it , ” she said .
“ That ’s my job . ”
Ms. Napolitano , who as governor of Arizona sparred with Republican legislators seeking tougher steps against illegal immigration , said she was looking for ways to make enforcement programs inherited from President George W. Bush less heavy - handed .
She also wants to put the enforcement focus on illegal - immigrant gang members and convicts and on employers who routinely hire illegal immigrants so as to exploit them .
Immigration authorities have started audits of employees ’ hiring documents at more than 600 businesses nationwide .
If an employer shows a pattern of hiring immigrants whose documents cannot be verified , a criminal investigation could follow , Ms. Napolitano said .
She has also expanded a federal program , known as E - Verify , that allows employers to verify electronically the identity information of new hires .
Immigrant and business groups have sued to try to stop the program , saying the databases it relies on are riddled with inaccuracies that could lead to American citizens ’ being denied jobs .
But officials of the Homeland Security Department say technological improvements have enhanced the speed and accuracy of E - Verify .
With 137,000 employers now enrolled , only 0.3 percent of 6.4 million queries they have made so far in the 2009 fiscal year have resulted in denials that later proved incorrect , the officials say .
That , opponents note , still means false denials for more than 19,000 people .
In addition , Ms. Napolitano has expanded a program that runs immigration checks on every person booked into local jails in some cities .
And she recently announced the expansion of another program , known as 287 ( g ) for the provision of the statute authorizing it , that allows for cooperation between federal immigration agents and state and local police agencies .
In extending 287 ( g ) , federal officials also drew up a new agreement , which all of some 66 localities currently participating have been asked to sign , that is intended to enhance federal oversight and clarify the priority on deporting those immigrants who are criminal fugitives or are already behind bars .

I almost showed a bullish study this morning for all the bulls who 've been screaming for one .
But when an indicator like T21112 hits a new all time high , it deserves a mention .
T2112 measures the percent of stocks that are trading at least 2 standard deviations above their 40 - day moving average .
It set an all time - high in May and I noted it then .
It went on to peak 2 days later ( May 6 ) .
After that the market experienced a 3 - day pullback and a bit of a consolidation .
Monday it barely broke the old record .
To provide some perspective as to how extended this indicator is I 've shown below the full history going back to 1986 . ( click to enlarge ) Spikes anywhere near what we are seeing now have been unsustainable in the past .
This would seem to suggest a pullback is likely .
( Of course , as the bulls will point out - there have been a lot of things suggesting that lately and the market has ignored most all of them . )
P.S. I also noticed T2112 got a mention from Cobra in his last commentary
Today that changed .
My services as a Lead Paint Risk Assessor are being lent to another agency and I had to calculate how much I really cost per hour .
That was the first time I saw how much it costs to insure a healthy 39 year old who goes to the Doctor less than once per year .
$ 820 mother fucking dollars a month !
Call me naive .
I assumed it would be highway robbery at $ 400 a month .
In 3.5 years on the job I have paid approximately $ 34,440 into the private insurance system .
That is more than my take home pay for a year .
I figure I have cost the health care industry about $ 1000 ( and I think I 'm being generous here ) .
The thing about this that really pisses me off is that I would n't mind paying this much money one little bit , if I knew that the money not being spent on my health care was paying the healthcare bills for someone else and not going to make yacht payments for some CEO .
Medicare , I want you to have my money .
I promise I wo n't hardly even use you .
Maybe my money can get rid of that donut hole for a couple of seniors skimping on prescription drugs .
Maybe my money can pay for check ups for 8 kids every month .
Please just let me know where you want me to send the check and we can make a deal .
Rant Over .
Keep fighting for a Public Option .
It wo n't be Healthcare Reform without it .

Thanks for the rec list !
The real props go to slinkerwink and nyceve and all others who are working so tirelessly to keep the pressure on .

Do You Need an Attorney ?
Experienced Attorneys Fighting to Maximize Compensation for Injured Nebraskans
Personal injury is the area of law that determines your rights after suffering an injury caused by someone else ’s careless behavior .
In Nebraska , those rights include the right to monetary compensation for the pain , distress , and financial losses you have suffered as a result of your injury .
The individuals or businesses that caused your accident are liable for your damages .
If they have insurance — as is often the case — the insurance company may be responsible for covering your financial compensation .
Unfortunately , insurance companies do n’t always offer the full and fair compensation that victims deserve .
At Hauptman , O’Brien , Wolf & Lathrop , we fight for the rights of unfairly injured people in Nebraska .
As Omaha personal injury lawyers , we understand that personal injury is just that — personal .
A single accident can affect every area of your life .
Your financial recovery should reflect that .
You are entitled to a full and fair recovery under the law , and we are here to fight for exactly that .
What is a Personal Injury Lawyer ?
A personal injury lawyer is an experienced legal professional who looks out for you , represents your best interests , and handles every single aspect of your injury claim .
When you hire the Omaha personal injury lawyers at Hauptman , O’Brien , Wolf & Lathrop , you get the benefit of an entire team of attorneys who work together , combining their resources and cumulative years of experience to protect your interests at every turn .
Here are some of the things we do for our clients :
Investigate your accident
Consult with accident reconstruction specialists & other experts
Review your medical records to fully understand the scope of your injuries
Negotiate with the insurance company ’s adjusters and attorneys
Research Nebraska legal precedent to find persuasive authority that strengthens your claim
Deal with creditors , collectors , adjusters , and all the paperwork and phone calls associated with a personal injury claim ( so that you do n’t have to )
Give you honest , practical , real - world advice about your legal rights and the best strategies for getting the outcome you deserve
Represent you in court , in the event that your claim goes to trial
Our Omaha personal injury attorneys have a long track record of challenging even the biggest insurance companies and corporate defendants .
We have been successful in achieving a favorable settlement in the majority of our cases , and we also have a robust record of success at trial .
How Much Does a Personal Injury Lawyer Cost ?
At Hauptman , O’Brien , Wolf & Lathrop , we represent personal injury clients on a contingency fee basis .
Here ’s what that means :
You hire us without paying anything upfront .
If we are n’t able to recover financial compensation for you , you do n’t have to pay us anything .
Period .
We take that risk so you do n’t have to .
If we do succeed in recovering financial compensation for you , our fee will only be a percentage of your total recovery .
You never have to pay anything out of pocket .
We will also advance the costs of pursuing your claim ( e.g. paying for consultants , expert witnesses , court costs , filing fees , etc. ) .
We believe that working on a contingency fee basis gives us an incentive to work really hard to get you the best possible result .
Why ?
Our fee is based on how much you recover .
And if you do n’t get paid , we do n’t get paid .
In this way , we work as partners in your success .
It also means that there is truly nothing for you to lose .
You can hire us without having to put a single penny on the table , and there is no risk to you if we do n’t succeed .
When Do I Need a Personal Injury Lawyer ?
While some very minor accidents may not benefit from an attorney ’s involvement ( more on that below ) , there are other situations where it is extremely important that you consult with a personal injury lawyer before making any decisions or entering into an agreement with the insurance company .
Signs that you should talk with an Omaha personal injury lawyer include :
You suffered a physical injury as a result of your accident .
Your injuries required a hospital stay or significant medical expenses .
Your accident required you to miss a significant amount of work .
The insurance company unfairly denied your claim .
The insurance company is creating unreasonable delay .
It is n’t clear who is at fault for your accident .
Your accident involved multiple parties .
The insurance company is urging you to accept a settlement offer for less money than you expected .
If any of these statements is true in your situation , or if you believe your case could benefit from hiring a personal injury lawyer for any other reason , we encourage you to contact our office and request a free consultation .
Studies have shown that people who hire a personal injury lawyer tend to recover larger sums of financial compensation than those who do n’t .
Insurance companies do not always handle claims fairly , but once you have an aggressive team of attorneys on your side , the insurance company ’s strategy may change .
We believe that hiring the right lawyers can make a world of difference in the outcome of a claim .
Do I Need a Personal Injury Lawyer for a Minor Accident ?
Some accidents are so minor that there is n’t much an attorney can do to help with them .
For example , if you were in a fender bender with minimal property damage and no physical injuries whatsoever , your claim might not benefit from an attorney ’s involvement .
In more moderate accidents , however , it might make sense to talk with an experienced Omaha personal injury lawyer .
You may be entitled to more than you realized .
After any accident or injury , the most important thing you can do is seek medical attention right away .
Sometimes , an accident appears to be minor at first , but symptoms develop slowly , or complications set in over time .
Even in those cases , it will be important to have a documented medical examination soon after the accident .
For this reason — and to make sure that you are getting the care that you need — even the most minor accident should prompt an appointment with your doctor ’s office .
What Is Pain and Suffering ?
“ Pain and suffering ” is a legal term that refers to the non-economic damages you might suffer after a personal injury accident .
Pain and suffering damages include losses that are hard to put a price on , such as :
Mental anguish
Emotional distress
Post - traumatic stress ( PTSD )
The physical experience of pain
Anxiety and / or depression
Loss of sexual intimacy / sexual dysfunction
Disfigurement or disability
Public embarrassment or shame
Loss of enjoyment of life
Nebraska personal injury law recognizes that pain and suffering damages are very real .
They deserve to be taken seriously .
Personal injury victims in Nebraska are entitled to make a claim for financial compensation for pain and suffering .
However , calculating an appropriate monetary value for these damages can be challenging .
Unfortunately , insurance companies are notorious for attempting to downplay or deny pain and suffering damages .
An experienced Omaha personal injury lawyer can advocate zealously for a full and fair pain and suffering award .
In many cases , these damages represent a significant part of the accident victim ’s recovery , so it is important to work with lawyers who have experience in making persuasive demands for pain and suffering compensation in Nebraska .

( CNN ) --
When James Huberty walked into a McDonald 's restaurant 25 years ago this month , he knew he was going to kill somebody .
He probably did n't know his murderous rampage would change how police departments work .
Police help a wounded customer out of a California McDonald 's where a man killed 21 people in 1984 .
At 3:40 p.m. on July 18 , 1984 , Huberty carried a long - barreled Uzi , a pump-action shotgun and a handgun into a McDonald 's in San Ysidro , an enclave of San Diego , California .
Witnesses said the unemployed welder and security guard started shooting immediately , and kept on shooting for 77 minutes until a police sniper on a nearby rooftop ended the siege with a bullet through Huberty 's heart .
When the carnage ended , Huberty and 21 victims -- including grandmothers , an infant , children on bicycles and teenage McDonald 's employees -- lay dead inside and outside the restaurant .
Nineteen others were wounded .
San Diego police Capt .
Miguel Rosario , a patrol officer back then , was the first cop on the scene , believing he was responding to a single accidental shooting .
Carrying a standard - issue .38 - caliber revolver with six bullets , the Marine Corps veteran was in for the fight of his life against a much - better - armed opponent .
" Talk about feeling inadequate , " Rosario said .
" He 's got an Uzi , I 've got a .38 , and I 'm thinking it 's a robbery gone bad and his buddies are going to encircle me . "
Rosario would later play a key role in beefing up officers ' weaponry and training to stop violent criminals .
When Rosario arrived at the McDonald 's , he saw people hiding behind cars in the lot .
He did n't know what was going on , but " I got that little sick feeling in the pit of my stomach , " he said .
Watch the chaos outside the McDonald 's »
He looked up to see a man -- Huberty -- open a side door of the restaurant , the Uzi across his chest .
The two men eyed each other , and then Huberty moved aggressively .
The SWAT - trained officer ducked behind a parked pickup truck , " and he started opening up on me , " Rosario said .
He was badly outgunned and knew it .
Worse , he believed he had more than one adversary .
" I would n't have minded taking him on one - on - one , " Rosario said in his transplanted South Bronx accent .
" But if he had buddies in there and they had shoulder arms , I would have been in a world of hurt . "
Huberty fired about 30 armor - piercing rounds at the officer , who could hear them striking metal posts and skipping off the asphalt .
From behind the truck , Rosario radioed in a Code 10 -- " send SWAT " -- and seconds later a Code 11 -- " send everybody . "
San Diego's SWAT team then consisted of patrol officers with extra training who carried their special equipment in their squad cars , Rosario said .
Huberty retreated inside as other police units arrived .
Rosario ran back to his car to retrieve his Ruger Mini - 14 military - style rifle .
Two patrol officers fired shotguns to cover Rosario while he took up position .
But he could n't get a clear shot .
Reporter Monica Zech had a bird 's - eye view of the scene .
She was giving traffic reports from a small airplane for local TV and radio stations .
" I looked down and could see that there was people ducking for cover , and there was a fire truck there with everybody behind it , " she recalled .
She saw two boys lying on the ground , tangled in their bicycles after being shot by Huberty , and people hiding behind the low walls of the restaurant 's playground .
Circling at 3,000 feet , Zech alerted authorities to close nearby Interstate 5 and the Tijuana border crossing a few blocks away because drivers were heading straight into the line of fire .
The bright sunshine and the eatery 's smoked windows made it hard for police to see inside , but eventually Chuck Foster , a police sniper on the post office roof next door , got a clear view of Huberty near the counter .
Foster dropped him with a single shot through a glass door .
The battle was over , but the lessons were just beginning .
Police clearly needed more firepower and a new strategy , Rosario said .
" The time had come where you had to have a full - time , committed and dedicated , highly trained , well - equipped team ... that were committed to shooting , being in shape and being able to respond rapidly anywhere in the city , " he said .
" We did n't have what we have now , " Rosario said .
" We have a special response team -- hostage rescue -- very elite , well - trained .
It 's an elite team within SWAT .
We have access to helicopters now and all of that kind of stuff .
We did n't have none of that back then . "
After San Ysidro , the department created a dedicated unit that trains continuously and uses much more formidable weapons and tactics .
" We became pretty much special forces specialists , if you will , " he said .
Police departments nationwide soon realized their own need for tactical specialists .
The San Ysidro massacre seemed to introduce a " cluster " of mass shootings in the ' 80s and early '90s , said James Alan Fox , a Northeastern University professor and author of six books on mass murder .
These included post office rampages in Oklahoma , New Jersey and Michigan , and culminated with the Luby 's restaurant slaughter in Killeen , Texas , in 1991 , in which 23 people were killed .
Michael T. Rayburn , an independent police firearms trainer in Saratoga Springs , New York , said the San Ysidro incident and others -- including gangland battles of the 1920s and more recent episodes like the infamous North Hollywood bank shootout in 1997 and the Columbine school massacre in 1999 -- force police to keep developing new weapons and tactics .
" As police officers , we do n't have wind tunnels or expensive laboratories .
We 've learned , unfortunately , out on the street , and we pay for it in blood and sometimes our lives , " he said .
After the McDonald 's massacre , other cities sought advice from San Diego on how to develop tactical teams .
Now , such elite units are part of most larger departments across the country .
Another change after San Ysidro is how departments handle officers who have been involved in traumatic incidents .
For the first time , San Diego debriefed all involved officers and provided professional counseling for those who needed it .
Now , it is common practice .
" We saw the benefit and the need for that , " Rosario said , though in 1984 he blew off steam in Las Vegas for two days in lieu of counseling .
Many departments still fall short , but awareness of the need for psychological services is much greater now than in the ' 80s , said Lynn Winstead Mabe , a police counselor and consultant in Grapevine , Texas .
" I truly think they 're beginning to care about the psyche of their people , " she said .

Washington 's journalistic Prince of Darkness has died .
My friend Tim Carney , who worked with Novak for years , has posted a remembrance :
That Novak would hire a leg - man to go around Washington sniffing out news reflected the virtue at the heart of his work :
His columns , while they resided on the op - ed pages , were built upon previously unreported facts that revealed and explained the machinations of government , the men and women in power , and the politics behind it all .
His job demanded he get a constant flow of new information , but curiosity and a thirst for knowledge were natural traits for him .
Bob Novak was , above all , a reporter .
Watching him work was a delightful education in reporting .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Local banks in Georgia , Minnesota and California were closed Friday by state regulators , bringing the total number of failed banks this year to 45 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
The financial crisis has taken a heavy toll on small banks across the nation as losses in the housing market mount and unemployment dents household wealth .
Analysts expect the trend to continue even as larger banks stabilize and the overall economy begins to recover .
Community Bank of West Georgia , which operated one branch in Villa Rica and another in Kennesaw , had total assets of $ 199.4 million and total deposits of $ 182.5 million , according to the FDIC .
The failed bank had roughly $ 1.1 million in deposits that exceeded the FDIC's $ 250,000 insurance limit for individual accounts .
However , this amount is expected to change as the agency obtains more information from uninsured customers , the FDIC said .
The FDIC will mail checks to insured depositors of the failed bank on Monday morning .
Direct deposits from the federal government , such as Social Security and Veterans ' payments , will be transferred to United Community Bank of Blairsville , Ga .
Georgia regulators also shuttered the four branches of Neighborhood Community Bank , which is based in Newnan .
The FDIC said CharterBank of West Point will assume all of the failed bank 's $ 191.3 million deposits and the majority of its $ 221.6 million assets .
So far this year , nine banks in Georgia have failed .
In Minnesota , Horizon Bank of Pine City was closed and will be taken over by Stearns Bank , NA of St. Cloud .
It was the first bank to fail in the Gopher State this year .
The failed bank , which operated two locations , had total assets of $ 87.6 million and total deposits of about $ 69.4 million .
Stearns Bank paid a premium for all of Horizon Bank 's deposits and agreed to acquire $ 84.4 million of its assets .
The remaining assets will be sold by the FDIC later .
Meanwhile , the sole branch of Irvine , Calif . - based MetroPacific Bank was closed Friday and Sunwest Bank , of Tustin , Calif. , agreed to assume all of its non-brokered deposits .
MetroPacific had total deposits of approximately $ 73 million .
Sunwest Bank will purchase nearly all of the failed bank 's $ 80 million worth of assets , the FDIC said .
The FDIC said it would pay about $ 6 million directly to brokers for deposits held in MetroPacific brokered accounts .
Later Friday , the FDIC said Mirae Bank of Los Angeles was closed .
The bank 's five offices will reopen Monday as branches of Wilshire State Bank .
Mirae Bank had total assets of $ 456 million and total deposits of approximately $ 362 million .
Wilshire State Bank will buy about $ 449 million of the failed bank 's assets .
The FDIC will hold the remaining assets to dispose of later .
California has had six banks fail so far this year .
The FDIC said it entered a loss - share agreement with the acquiring banks for a portion of the failed banks ' assets .
The agreement is intended to maximize returns on the assets and minimize disruptions for loan customers , the FDIC said .
The total cost of Friday 's bank failures to the FDIC is $ 264.2 million , bringing the total for this year to $ 11.94 billion .
That compares with $ 17.6 billion in all of 2008 .
The number of bank failures so far this year has already exceeded last year 's total of 25 , with an average of 7 failures per month .
Over the next 5 years , the FDIC expects roughly $ 70 billion in losses due to the failures of insured institutions .
The FDIC , which is funded primarily by fees paid by banks , insures individual deposits up to $ 250,000 .
The amount was increased from $ 100,000 late last year in response to concerns about the stability of the nation 's banks .
Before DC politicians -- Republicans and Democrats alike -- impose an individual health insurance mandate without a public option , here 's a Harry and Louise scenario that they had better start wrapping their minds around :
LOUISE ( shaking head ) : I can't believe it !
They 've raised prices again !
HARRY : And they still wo n't pay for your procedure .
LOUISE : It makes me so angry .
What are we going to do ?
HARRY ( throwing hands in air ) : What choice do we have ?
If Congress had just passed the public plan , then we'd have another option ...
LOUISE : ... and the health insurance industry would n't be holding us hostage .
HARRY ( leaning back in chair ) : Instead , we 're stuck with this expensive insurance plan ...
LOUISE : ... and we 're paying higher taxes than ever to subsidize their profits .
HARRY ( leans back towards table ) : Congress should have gotten it right when they had a chance .
LOUISE : But they did n't , and now we have no choice .
Matthew Fitch learned it the hard way : Sometimes you 've got to look -- twice ! -- before you leap .
Fitch , 38 , is the owner of Aerial Adventures Demos in Hopewell , Va. , one of a handful of national parachuting companies that drop skydivers into outdoor events , with clients including San Francisco 's Emerald Bowl and the Atlanta Braves .
Last summer
Fitch got national press after jumping into Duke University 's football stadium .
The problem ?
He was supposed to be at the stadium of the team 's archrival , the University of North Carolina , about eight miles away .
The experience left him undeterred .
" We 'll jump into anything , " he says .
That includes a new business venture .
Last month the former Navy communications officer opened No Limits Skydiving , a parachuting school .
After eight years his event - jumping business had hit a plateau of about 30 appearances per year , which generated $ 100,000 in annual revenues .
He hopes that the school , which will charge $ 225 per tandem jump , will quickly grow to double his business .
For Fitch , investing in the school included a $ 10,000 down payment on an airplane .
He also purchased several $ 10,000 tandem parachute rigs and spent thousands more building a Web site and printing flyers .
But that does n't guarantee a smooth ride .
" This is a tough business , " says Ed Scott , executive director of the United States Parachute Association .
" You are totally dependent on the weather , because you can't jump in high winds or low clouds .
There 's a lot of overhead , including airplane operation , skydiving - gear maintenance and insurance . "
Fitch will continue his event jumps , which provide free publicity for his school .
And precision is no problem now , says client Ryan Oppelt , assistant executive director of the Emerald Bowl .
" When you do a television event , you follow a script , " he explains .
" The Aerial Adventures guys had perfect timing . "
Fitch hopes his new business will make an equally flawless landing .

Horror and moral terror are your friends .
The genius , the will , and the strength .
The total revulsion , the total repulsion , the ability to sacrifice one ’s own flesh and blood .
These are not monsters .
They fight with their hearts .
They are filled with love .
Moral .
Primordial .
Without judgment .
Because it ’s judgment that defeats us .
No noble savage , no exoticism , no civilizational superiority , no modernity , no backwardness .
No emic , no etic , no “ being there , ” no words .
Impossible to describe in words , as Col. Kurtz says .
Not the kind of “ teachable moment ” most academic anthropologists would look for , or choose .
We do n’t have the words for this : this goes beyond mere cultural relativism , it is going beyond going native , it is even deeper than an inconceivable emic detachment .
It goes beyond the boundary .
It ’s not “ constructive academic engagement , ” because it ’s better .
It is truth beneath the truths .
There may be lessons for anthropology , but there are also some very wise words for coming to an understanding of resistance groups that are routinely demonized , turned into monsters , judged to be irredeemable by the international , “ civilized community of nations ” ( i.e. , usually the white ones ) , whose sole fate is to be extirpated by those who would judge them .
For those who see it as their mission to be in Afghanistan , to remove the Taliban from this world , they have already lost .

Listen up , James Inhofe , because this might be the only compliment Grist ever pays you :
You ’ve got a decent website .
Despite your wacked - out view that climate change is a “ hoax ” and your opposition to a climate bill , inhofe.senate.gov does a fair job of making your climate and energy positions clear and accessible to the Oklahomans who voted to send you to Washington .
In fact , your website is more transparent than the sites of many senators who completely disagree with your views on global warming , including Democratic leaders Harry Reid ( Nev. ) and Richard Durbin ( Ill. ) , along with two of the most influential senators when it comes to environmental policymaking — Barbara Boxer ( Calif . ) and Jeff Bingaman ( N.M. ) .
Illustration by Tom Twigg / GristFor citizens looking for information on their senators ’ positions on energy and climate change policy , official Senate websites are a logical place to start .
After all , senators get taxpayer money to produce the sites .
And at the other end of Pennsylvania Ave. , President Obama has pledged to boost government transparency online through the new data.gov , usaspending.gov , and the revamped whitehouse.gov .
And , well , it ’s the 21st century .
You would think a U.S. senator would put up a useful site as a basic way of communicating with constituents .
You would think .
In the interest of transparency , Grist combed the official websites of 99 senators ( Al Franken did n’t have one at the time of our review ) and rated them on how well each explained a senator ’s positions on climate change and energy policies .
Our grading system gave senators points for stating whether or not he or she agrees with the scientific consensus on climate change , whether a site lists the criteria for how the lawmaker will evaluate a climate bill , and whether it describes a senator ’s positions on a variety of energy policies — including renewable research incentives , “ clean coal ” research , expanded use of nuclear energy , increased offshore and domestic oil and gas drilling , and incentives for biofuel production .
Again , the focus was on transparency ; senators who oppose climate legislation or doubt the science of global warming were not penalized for their views , only if they failed to make those views clear and accessible on their sites .
Help Grist raise $ 20,000 by 9/30 .
Just click the image above ☝️
The results are n’t pretty .
We found a distinct lack of information among Democrats and Republicans alike , senators with and without strong environmental voting records , and from all regions of the country .
See our full methodology and results for each senator on the next page .
Under our grading scale , 53 senators scored a C or worse .
Twenty - five sites had no mention of climate change or global warming .
Only 60 offered an opinion of cap - and - trade — the leading approach in Congress for reducing carbon emissions — on their energy or environment pages .
Sheldon Whitehouse ‘s ( D - R.I. ) environment page still refers to “ President Bush . ” Lamar Alexander ‘s ( R - Tenn . ) “ Energy and Environment ” page brought up an error message .
Robert Byrd ‘s ( D - W.V. ) climate page does not appear to be linked to the rest of his site .
Three senators posted no information at all on climate or energy issues : Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , Thad Cochran ( R - Miss . ) , and Roland Burris ( D - Ill . )
Two sponsors of past climate legislation , John McCain and Joe Lieberman , had sharply diverging scores .
Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) scored 20 on the 25 - point scale — a relatively high score .
McCain ( R - Ariz . ) scored a 7 .
The examination also revealed sharp regional differences .
Senators from Pacific states ( California , Oregon , Washington , Alaska , and Hawaii ) had the highest - scoring sites , averaging 17.3 points out of 25 .
Next were Northeastern senators , with an average score of 17.1 .
Southern senators scored the lowest ( 9.2 ) , with the Southwest ( 11.4 ) , Midwest ( 11.9 ) , Plains ( 13.8 ) , and Mountain West ( 13.8 ) falling in the middle .
More highlights :
Democrats generally scored higher than Republicans , but not by much .
They averaged 14.5 out of 25 to the GOP members ’ 11.9 .
There was a small correlation between a pro-environment voting record and a useful website .
Out of returning senators who were rated by the League of Conservation Voters ’ 2008 National Environmental Scorecard , the 26 senators with a perfect LCV score ( 100 ) averaged 16.8 on our transparency scale .
Those receiving the lowest LCV scores ( 0 , 9 , or 18 points ) averaged 11.7 in transparency .
Looking at specific energy sources , senators were most willing to comment on increased funding for renewable sources ( wind , solar , etc. ) , with 88 including some mention on their sites .
Eighty - six mentioned biofuels .
Forty addressed expanded use of nuclear energy and 55 “ clean coal ” technologies .
Only nine mentioned mountaintop removal ( MTR ) coal - mining , and only of two of them are from states where the practice is common — Alexander of Tennessee and Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia .
Prefer letter grades ?
By assigning each grade a 5 - point range , we would have handed out 14 A’s , 32 B’s , 22 C’s , 19 D’s , and 12 F’s .
Many students would find this grading to be very generous .
If we used a more common academic scale in which less than 60 percent is a failing grade , 50 senators would have flunked .
So as to not reward mediocrity , Grist did not grade on a curve .
Illustration by Tom Twigg / GristThe range of information on climate and energy , from useful to useless , is par for the course for congressional sites , according to John Wonderlich , policy director of the Sunlight Foundation , a Washington group that works to promote transparency in government .
“ This is something we should expect senators to do on their websites , ” he said .
“ But there ’s no requirement that they do so .
That actually makes it more interesting because it reflects their priorities — what they choose to put on their sites , what they choose to talk about . ”
In the House of Representatives , many lawmakers considered to be key swing votes on the landmark Waxman - Markey bill last month withheld their opinion up until the last minute .
Wonderlich said there is motivation for senators to do the same .
“ There ’s an incentive to not have a clear position , ” he said .
“ For a senator whose vote is going to be courted , it ’s in their interest to be a little bit coy , because their vote becomes a bargaining chip …
It ’s all about jockeying for clout within your caucus , or trying to get a committee seat , or trying to secure support for some other measure . ”
Of course , that comes at the expense of citizens trying to find a senator ’s views , he said .
Here ’s our full grading criteria , followed by a list of how senators scored .

WASHINGTON  The Energy Department strives to be a leader in championing energy efficiency .
Its Web site lists energy - saving tips , while Secretary Steven Chu calls conservation one of the department ’s most important goals .
But at many of the agency ’s buildings , even at national laboratories where talented scientists seek technological breakthroughs to save energy , the department has failed to use one of the most effective tools available to any ordinary household : thermostats that automatically dial back the temperature when nobody is around .
A recent audit found that the department could save more than $ 11.5 million annually in energy costs by properly employing these “ setback ” controls to adjust the heat and air conditioning at night or on weekends .
The Energy Department ’s inspector general found that the department , which spends almost $ 300 million annually on utilities , could save enough energy to power more than 9,800 homes each year by doing what experts say every household in the country should also be doing .
Andy Reid threw a haymaker at the press on Monday .
Yesterday , the media countered with a few uppercuts .
This heavyweight bout reminds me of the classic pugilist flick Raging Bull .
Which got me thinking .
If you have n’t guessed by now , I ’m a bit of a movie buff .
In my mind , sports and film go hand in hand .
So , I ’ve decided to combine two of my favorite things :
The Eagles and the films of Martin Scorsese .
Each of Reid ’s ten seasons in Philly has had its share of intriguing subplots .
Scorsese ’s career is chock - full of memorable narratives .
Time to pair up the football field and the movie set .
1999 Eagles – Bringing Out The Dead
I do n’t think it ’s a coincidence Dead was made in ’ 99 .
The flick had glimpses of brilliance , but was mired by a slumping Nic Cage .
Ultimately , it failed to find its groove .
Reid ’s debut season ended with a record of 5 - 11 .
It starred journeyman Doug Pederson and the fading Mike Mamula , but introduced the incredible talents of Donovan McNabb .
2000 Eagles – The Color of Money
Paul Newman finally got an Oscar reprising his role as pool shark Fast Eddie Felson .
The cinematography was inventive , but without Newman , it would have been unwatchable .
Reid ’s second season was McNabb ’s coming - out party .
He carried a young team on his back to an unlikely 11 - 5 record and a trip to the playoffs .
Take away Don , they win four games .
2001 Eagles – Mean Streets
The film that put Scorsese on the map and showcased his skills behind the lens was Mean Streets .
It also began a long , successful collaboration with a feisty young actor named Robert De Niro .
The ’01 Birds let the NFL know they were a force to be reckoned with .
Reid seized his first NFC East crown and together with McNabb guided the midnight green to their first NFC Championship Game appearance since the 1980 season .
2002 Eagles – The Gangs of New York
Scorsese ’s powerful 19th century epic was a favorite to bring home Oscar glory with ten nominations .
Sadly , it lost out to a musical , Chicago .
An effing musical !
The Birds returned to the mountain top as the team to beat in ’ 02 .
They were supposed to close the doors on Veterans Stadium with a victory in the title game .
Instead , they lost to the Bucs .
The effing Bucs !
2003 – The King of Comedy
Rupert Pupkin wants so bad to be a TV talk show host .
He thought he belonged in the same class as Jerry Langford ( Jerry Lewis ) .
In reality , he was a deluded fool who lived inside his own fantasies .
The Eagles would once again win their division and advance to their third consecutive championship game , only to have their dreams dashed by the expansion Carolina Panthers , proving once again they were not legit contenders .
2004 Eagles – Goodfellas
Goodfellas is arguably Scorsese ’s best film .
It ’s gritty , gutsy and brash .
It also features a kick - ass cast led by an over - the - top Joe Pesci .
Despite its greatness , it still came up short in the Best Picture department .
The ’04 Eagles cast a villain to be their star — Terrell Owens .
His dynamic play and infectious personality provided the team the extra punch needed to finally reach the Super Bowl .
Unfortunately , there would be no storybook ending .
2005 – Taxi Driver
Watching Taxi Driver is like dropping acid while riding a roller - coaster .
It ’s all kinds of crazy .
Travis Bickle is a one - man wrecking crew who ruins everything he touches .
T.O. unleashed an eight month long campaign of destruction that ended with his suspension for conduct detrimental .
It was one of the most bizarre and agonizing periods in the history of the franchise .
2006 – After Hours
After Hours is probably the least heralded of Scorsese ’s films .
Who knew Griffin Dunne would make a compelling lead character ?
The strange and twisting plot points toward a not so happy ending , then makes a sharp turn and ends up okay .
After McNabb tore his knee up in week 11 , the ’06 season looked doomed .
But backup Jeff Garcia donned his cape and guided the Birds to five straight wins and a surprising playoff berth .
2007 – The Aviator
The Aviator received much praise , but it was hardly a great film .
It was n’t bad , just merely okay .
Unlike others in Marty ’s catalog , it does n’t warrant repeat viewings .
Essentially , it ’s forgettable .
The best word to describe the Iggles 2007 campaign would be , average .
An 8 - 8 record .
No playoffs .
It was meh .
Easily the most uneventful season since Reid arrived .
2008 – The Last Temptation of Christ
Like all groundbreaking Directors , Scorsese does n’t shy away from controversial subjects .
However , he stirred up a super - sized hornet ’s nest when he chose to adapt author Nikos Kazantzakis ’s acclaimed novel .
The film was beset by protests across the globe .
Controversy aside , it ’s an amazing achievement .
One of Marty ’s best .
Not since 2005 has an Eagles ’ season been as theatrical as in 2008 .
Star quarterback gets benched , makes a triumphant return , and engineers a miraculous drive to a fifth NFC Championship game .
Hollywood could n’t have scripted it better .

President Obama is taking a new approach to tackling terrorism
President Barack Obama 's chief counter - terrorism adviser said the US government is forging a new approach to tackling violent extremism .
In a major policy speech , John Brennan said Washington would no longer use terms like " war on terror " .
Nor would it employ interrogation tactics like water - boarding , which he said had only played into the hands of terror groups like al - Qaeda .
He said it was time to use diplomacy and dialogue to solve problems .
Mr Brennan - who is Mr Obama 's assistant for homeland security and counterterrorism - said the United States would not be defined by what it was against , but by what it was for .
Soft power
He said there had been a fundamental shift in policy as well as language .
As proof , Mr Brennan cited the president 's efforts to reach out the Muslim world .
And , Mr Brennan said that while safeguarding the American public remained Mr Obama 's priority , the US would not be relying solely on military might and counter - terrorism operations .
" We will use our power to demonstrate that seemingly intractable problems and legitimate grievances can be resolved through diplomacy , dialogue and a democratic process . "
He said " soft power " would be the focus of the Obama administration .
BBC Washington correspondent Jonathan Beale said that of as much interest as the new approach was Mr Brennan 's condemnation of past techniques used by the CIA .
Mr Brennan was one of a small number of people President Obama considered for appointment to head the intelligence agency .
But the former CIA officer withdrew from the running when critics questioned his role in the interrogation of terrorist suspects .
In Thursday 's speech Mr Brennan said tactics like water - boarding were " a recruitment bonanza " for extremists , and he said such techniques had undermined America 's national security .
Several leading opposition Republicans - including the former Vice - President , Dick Cheney , have expressed concern that this reversal in policy could make Americans less safe .
PITTSBURGH ( AP ) |
They wish he ’d done more in his first eight months , but the liberal bloggers who helped propel Barack Obama to the White House are far from giving up on him .
Gathered in Pittsburgh for the annual Netroots Nation convention , they say they ’re not disappointed .
At least not too disappointed .
Yet .
If politics is a meal being served up by the new president , they ’re just looking for something to at least sweeten the bland , sometimes bitter fare they ’ve grown to expect in Washington .
“ He ’s making some strides … but I think there needs to be more action , ” says Los Angeles - based blogger Lisa Derrick , who writes daily about politics , entertainment and pop culture on Firedoglake.com under the name La Figa .
Rumblings on the left could spell trouble down the road for the president and for other Democrats .
The group MoveOn.org is threatening to run ads against moderate and conservative Democrats who do n’t toe the line on Mr. Obama ’s health care overhaul push .
The president himself is giving too much ground on health care , in the eyes of some of the bloggers here .
Some also think he ought to be getting out of Iraq faster .
And they want him to do away with the military ’s “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” policy .
“ There ’s a degree of accountability that ’s necessary , ” Ms. Derrick said .
The White House has n’t forgotten the bloggers Mr. Obama courted in the presidential campaign , elevating the Internet presence of the White House to new heights .
And senior Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett will be here in Pittsburgh to address the Netroots convention .
Denim everywhere , the convention ’s informal atmosphere reflects the vast election support Mr. Obama garnered among youngish , tech - savvy people , many of whom became involved in the political process for the first time .
After actively helping usher Mr. Obama into the Oval Office - often employing Web - based organizing - many now refuse to relinquish their newly discovered role in democracy , determined to remain vigilant in ensuring the president makes good on campaign promises .
“ I will wait and see .
I will watch , but I do n’t see myself at the point of completely disappointed , ” said Karen Johnson , a Portland , Ore. , “ lurker ” on the Daily Kos Web site , meaning she comments and reads daily , but does n’t blog .
Still , there is disappointment , many say , that Mr. Obama has failed to actively pursue what they call Bush - era crimes - from torture in the terror war to a blurring of lines at home between the Department of Justice and the White House .
And they view the health care debate with trepidation , saying Mr. Obama has not provided a clear plan or spoken out strongly enough against hard - line critics who have turned some lawmakers ’ town - hall meetings into screaming matches .
Now , they say , Mr. Obama is on the defensive , weakening his attempt to overhaul the system .
“ They ’re compromising too easy , too soon , ” said Pittsburgh - based blogger David DeAngelo , who writes on the Web site 2 politicaljunkies .
“ But on the other hand , it ’s going so much better than a McCain presidency would have , ” Mr. DeAngelo added .
Mr. DeAngelo ’s blogging partner , Maria Lupinacci , who initially supported Hillary Rodham Clinton , said if Mr. Obama does not provide a viable public health care option to compete against the private sector , he will lose the support of progressive liberals .
Despite their criticism , the blogging duo stops short of outright disappointment .
“ I always saw him as a good , liberal Democrat .
I never saw him as progressive , so he ’s doing what I expected , ” Ms. Lupinacci said .
“ So , I ’m not necessarily surprised , disappointed or happy . ”
Sean Wong , a Los Angeles - based blogger who writes under the name Bruin Kid on the Daily Kos Web site , said Mr. Obama has also improved U.S. standing internationally , reversing in just the first few months of his presidency much of the damage done by Bush administration policies .
Mr. Wong wishes Mr. Obama would have taken strong measures early on that he feels could have been done without the loss of significant political ground - such as repealing the military ’s ban on open gays - he echoes the general feel in the convention corridors .
“ I ’m still happy with what he ’s done , ” he said , grinning .

Paul Krugman appeared on MSNBC to discuss his latest op - ed Republican Death Trip .
Paul reiterates some of the points he made in his article .
Krugman :
The way I look at it , these people are unappeaseable .
It 's not really about what it 's ostensibly about .
It 's not actually about the end of life provisions .
It 's not about the specifics in the bill .
They 're just going to grab onto anything and try to turn some it into something awful .
So they saw this .
It seemed to have something to do with end of life and so they said , you know , death panels .
It 's not about the substance , and that you can't actually satisfy the crazies by offering substantive concessions .
What they hate is the whole idea of any kind of health reform and more broadly what they hate is the whole idea of Democrats actually , you know , holding the White House .
Harwood : Interesting point Paul and I 've got to tell you one White House official told me today , our problem right now is if we tell some of the Republican opponents in the Senate you can have everything you want in the bill , they still wo n't vote for it .
So ... Krugman :
That 's right .
So why are they still reaching out to them ?

At least 20 people have been killed by a bomb at a police station in Russia 's southern republic of Ingushetia .
The suicide attack in Nazran , Ingushetia 's main city , injured more than 138 people , including children .
The republic borders Chechnya and has seen a spate of shootings , bombings and other attacks on police and government .
Ingushetia 's leader blamed militants , but Russian President Dmitry Medvedev sacked the region 's interior minister , saying the attack had been preventable .
" This act of terror could have been averted , " Mr Medvedev said .
" The police must protect the people and the police must also be able to defend themselves . "
Escalating clashes Monday 's bomb attack was the deadliest strike in Ingushetia since 2004 , when some 90 people were killed when hundreds of gunmen staged a raid on the centre of Nazran .
ANALYSIS Sarah Rainsford , BBC News
This attack is part of a recent surge in violence in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus region of Russia .
The large - scale separatist conflict that ravaged Chechnya has now ended after 15 years .
In April , the Russian president declared Chechnya to be stable enough to ease security restrictions , and lower the number of Russian troops .
But the insurgency in the Caucasus has gradually changed form into an Islamist uprising , and spread beyond Chechnya 's borders .
Militants have targeted government officials and the security forces in particular , with a combination of deadly gun battles and suicide attacks .
President Yunus - Bek Yevkurov was appointed by the Kremlin to head the autonomous republic of Ingushetia - and arrived vowing to end the violence and combat serious corruption .
He 's still recovering from an attempt on his life .
Images from the scene showed devastation within the compound and a 4 m ( 13 ft ) wide crater .
Nearby homes were also badly damaged and burned - out cars were strewn nearby .
The suicide bomber was reported to have rammed his explosives - packed vehicle into the gates of the police compound as officers were reporting for inspection , government spokesman Kaloi Akhilgov said .
Police fired shots at the truck , but failed to stop it .
" Practically all the cars and buildings in the yard of the police headquarters were completely destroyed , " Reuters news agency quoted him as saying .
Mr Akghilov told the AFP news agency that all of the dead were police , but 10 children were among those injured .
Many of those hurt were living in residential buildings adjacent to the police station , he said .
Many of the injured were said to be in a serious condition .
They were taken to hospitals in Nazran , but Mr Akghilov said the authorities were struggling to cope with the casualties .
" We have not had such an attack for a long time , " he said , adding that hospitals did not have enough blood to treat the injured .
Much of the violence in Ingushetia has echoed the continuing unrest in Chechnya , with escalating clashes in the past year between pro-Russian security forces and armed militants .
In pictures : Russian bomb attack Human rights activists and opposition politicians in Ingushetia told the BBC last year that the republic was now in a situation of " civil war " .
In the most high - profile recent attack , Ingush President Yunus - Bek Yevkurov was severely wounded when a suicide bomber attacked his motorcade in June .
He has not yet returned to work but is said to be recovering .
In a statement , he blamed Monday 's attack on militants angered by recent security operations along the border with Chechnya .
" It was an attempt to destabilise the situation and sow panic , " he said .
Less than a week ago , Ingushetia 's construction minister was shot dead by masked gunmen .
That followed the shooting dead of three employees of Russia 's emergencies ministry .
In Chechnya , Russian forces were engaged in heavy fighting with separatist rebels until a few years ago , though the fighting has become much less intense recently .

Someone should remind Michael Bloomberg that free does not always mean free lunches .
The billionaire New York City mayor recently rolled out a transit proposal that sounds too good to be true – probably because it is .
In order to speed up the pace of Manhattan ’s famously slow crosstown buses , mayor Bloomberg suggested eliminating the $ 2.25 fare on a few of the buses , as it would put an end to all the time passengers spend fumbling for their MetroCard and cash at the bus door .
It would mean free bus rides for all , but without much additional cost to the city , he reasoned , since the majority of crosstown passengers are already riding for free , using their MetroCards to transfer from the subway .
If we are n’t charging folks anyway , it ’s not a big money loss , is the gist of his claim .
In short : win-win .
Except , there ’s a flaw to his argument .
If bus fare falls to zero , it ’s likely that more people ( many more people ) will start riding the bus , which will lead to even worse congestion and potentially require the city to spend on introducing more buses .
In other words , mayor Bloomberg is harboring under the assumption that demand for the cross town bus will not change as the price drops .
In all likelihood , however , the number of bus-riders will go up dramatically because free is exciting .
In fact , according to our research on free , such a change will cause many people who now walk a few blocks , to switch their ways and hop on the free bus .

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION :
In order to secure and protect all documents on display in the National Archives Experience ( NAE ) from unnecessary exposure to the harmful effects of flash photography and to improve the overall visitor experience , NARA is proposing to ban all photography from exhibit areas in the NAE .
The 2003 renovations to the Rotunda exhibit area included the installation of new exhibit cases , which were designed with special glass with high clarity and no colored filters , to improve the ability to see the documents on display .
The new display cases provide little protection from the damaging effects of photographic flash .
While NARA staff goes to great lengths to adjust the Rotunda light levels to protect documents on display from excess light , public photography with attendant flash works against the efforts to protect the documents .
The NAE exhibitions primarily contain paper and parchment documents that are susceptible to the harmful effects of light and in particular to the cumulative effects of photographic flash .
While all original documents on display are at risk from excessive light exposure , the Declaration of Independence , Constitution and Bill of Rights ( known collectively as the Charters of Freedom ) are especially susceptible to the damaging effects from photographic VerDate Nov<24>2008 16:28 Jul 30 , 2009 Jkt 217001 flash because these documents are on permanent display .
Currently , signage , pamphlets , and security officers inform visitors that flash photography is prohibited in the exhibit areas .
Most photographic flash occurs from accidental acts rather than intentional action .
However , over the past six years it has proved to be an impossible task to prevent visitors from intentionally or accidentally using additional light .
Security officers do escort those visitors out of the building who continue to use flash photography after being warned .
But , by the time a security officer makes that decision , at least two or three flashes have already occurred , needlessly exposing documents to excessive light .
Numerous visitors ’ remarks in the informal visitors ’ comment log as well as letters to NARA include apologies for inadvertent flash ; complaints that flash disrupts their visit ; that flash rules are not effectively enforced ; and , that camera use should be banned .
This proposed rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order 12866 and has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget .
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act , I certify that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities because it affects individuals .
This regulation does not have any federalism implications .
List of Subjects in 36 CFR Part 1280 Archives and records , Federal buildings and facilities .
For the reasons set forth in the preamble , NARA proposes to amend part 1280 of title 36 , Code of Federal Regulations , as follows : PART 1280 — USE OF NARA FACILITIES 1 .

Approval and Promulgation of Air Quality Implementation Plans ; West Virginia ; Determination of Clean Data for the 1997 Fine Particulate Matter Standard AGENCY : Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
ACTION : Proposed rule .
SUMMARY : EPA is proposing to determine that the West Virginia portions of three nonattainment areas for the 1997 fine particulate ( PM2.5 ) National Ambient Air Quality Standard ( NAAQS ) have clean data for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS .
These are Berkeley County , part of the HagerstownMartinsburg MD - WV nonattainment area ; Wood County , part of the Parkersburg - Marietta WV–OH nonattainment area ; and Marshall County and Ohio County , part of the Wheeling WV–OH nonattainment area , hereinafter referred to in this notice as the West Virginia portions of the Hagerstown - Martinsburg , ParkersburgMarietta , and Wheeling PM2.5 nonattainment areas .
This proposed determination is based upon quality assured , quality controlled , and certified ambient air monitoring data that show that these areas have monitored attainment of the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS based on 2006 – 2008 data .
In addition , quality controlled and quality assured monitoring data for 2009 that are available in the EPA Air Quality System ( AQS ) database , but not yet certified , show these areas continue to have clean data for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS .
If this proposed determination is made final , the requirements for these areas to submit an attainment demonstration , associated reasonably available measures , a reasonable further progress plan , contingency measures , and other planning State Implementation Plans ( SIPs ) related to attainment of the standard shall be suspended for so long as the area continues to meet the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS .
DATES : Written comments must be received on or before August 31 , 2009 .

Obama may be willing to drop the “ public option ” on healthcare reform
Publicly Democrats have a united message on the protesters that are appearing at the town hall meetings across the country ; they claim that the insurance companies are funding the protesters , they claim that the GOP is organizing the protesters , ( as if the GOP has been successful at organizing anything in recent years ) , they claim that the protesters are being bused in and paid for their outbursts , they claim that the protesters are lying evil - mongers , but privately they know the truth .
And the truth is that the American people just do not support the idea of the government running the healthcare industry , it is as simple as that .
They can try to spin the protests any way that they see fit but the American people see the way that Medicare and Medicaid are run and they do not want the government extending their role in healthcare .
In public they can lie about the protesters and they can try to minimize them in an effort to win their propaganda war but the truth is that they are losing that war .
In private they realize this even as they demonize the protesters .
In the end they may not like it but they understand that if they want to stay in power they will have to listen to the protesters , especially when the polls back up the protesters .
A vast majority of Americans ( 85 % ) are happy with their healthcare coverage and are leery of any changes to it .
A majority of Americans oppose Obama ’s healthcare reform bill .
The politicians realize this and today for the first time the White House has acknowledged that the president may be willing to drop the “ public option ” from the healthcare reform bill .
This is an admission by the White House that the protesters are legitimate , this is an admission by the White House that our calls and our emails may be taking their toll on our representatives .
This is an admission that the people just do not support the “ public option ” portion of the healthcare reform bill .
The administration has n’t come out and said it yet , and they probably will never admit it but , the fact of the matter is that these protesters are average Americans and they do represent the views of average Americans and that is why the “ public option ” is suddenly negotiable in the president ’s eyes .
We are beginning to turn the tide on this bill .
Politicians all the way up to the president , whether or not they are willing to admit it or not , are going to be forced to listen to us .
We have spoken and we are not happy !
BOSTON , Massachusetts ( CNN ) --
In his first public appearance since the " Beer Summit " at the White House , Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates joked about his controversial arrest last month in Cambridge , Massachusetts , and said he likes police Sgt. James Crowley .
Sgt. James Crowley and professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. sit for beers with the president and vice president Thursday .
" I offered to get his kids into Harvard if he does n't arrest me anymore , " Gates said .
Gates was speaking Sunday at the Martha 's Vineyard Book Festival where he signed copies of his book , " In Search of our Roots . "
The professor said he plans on meeting with Crowley again .
" I offered for the two of us to have lunch together , one - on - one , or go to a Red Sox game , or a Celtics games , or maybe the families can get together for dinner .
Why not ? "
Gates had a face - to - face meeting and a beer with Crowley at the White House last week , a move orchestrated by President Obama in an attempt to defuse racial tensions that had erupted following Gates ' arrest .
Gates called the president 's gesture " brilliant . "
Crowley arrested Gates on July 16 when the officer responded to a call of a possible home break - in at the Cambridge residence .
Gates was charged with disorderly conduct for allegedly yelling at the officer and protesting his actions .
But Gates , who is black , claimed he never raised his voice and accused Crowley of racial profiling .
Charges against the professor were later dropped .
The tone at the book fair turned more serious when someone asked Gates how the arrest has affected him .
" I 'm still trying to figure that out and processing it .
It was stressful .
I was worried about my daughters . "
Fortunately , he said , the press was not camped out at his family home like they were at the Cambridge residence , which is owned by the university .
He admitted to receiving bomb threats and deaths threats and said the university is encouraging him to move .
" I have n't been back to the Cambridge house since I got arrested so I have to make that decision . "
He also said he has had to change his phone numbers and close his public e-mail account .
" I received thousands of fan letters but some of the e-mails were from crazy wacko people who wrote ' You should die , ' ' You 're a racist , ' "
Still , Gates said he does n't want to exaggerate the trauma of the arrest .
" A lot of people go through far worse .
I was in jail for four hours , not four years or four months or four days , " he said .
" The night before I went to the White House , I had a dream that I got arrested in the White House , " he said .
Then he joked , " But it 's cool ; I was OK . "

HARTFORD , Connecticut ( CNN ) -- Principal Steve Perry does n't believe in cursory inspections .
For him , every single detail matters .
T's are always crossed , I 's are always dotted .
Shirts are always buttoned and tucked in .
Principal Steve Perry 's demanding approach , tough love and high expectations have paid off at Capital Prep .
During his daily morning hallway inspections , he reprimands a student not wearing the Capital Prep school approved sweatshirt with a " That 's not our gray . "
He then quickly peers into another classroom to witness a student acting up .
" Do n't do it !
Do n't do it !
Do n't do it ! " he warns sternly .
The student retorts " Why not ? "
Perry knowingly looks at him and simply says , " You 're the upperclassman " and with that , the student sheepishly walks away .
It 's all part of the daily routine of tough love and high expectations at Capital Preparatory Magnet School in downtown Hartford , Connecticut .
It 's a public magnet school , with a college prep school attitude .
As Perry says , " If you do n't want to go to college , do n't go to Capital Prep .
Go somewhere else . "
Perry 's demanding approach has yielded big results .
The school of just under 300 sixth - through 12th - grade students boasts a near 0 percent dropout rate .
That 's a stunning achievement considering Hartford is one of the lowest performing districts in Connecticut , a state with one of the largest achievement gaps between black and white students in the nation .
According to the Connecticut Coalition for Achievement NOW , an educational advocacy group , black students in Connecticut are , on average , three grade levels behind their white peers .
Capital Prep , a year - round school that is more than 80 percent black and Latino , can boast of sending every graduating member of its senior class on to a four - year college .
In the four years since Perry founded the school , he has sent 80 students on to college .
See how Capital Prep is defying the odds »
Perry founded the school with the specific purpose of creating a school that would serve students with backgrounds similar to his .
Born to a teenage mother , Perry grew up impoverished in a public housing project just outside Hartford .
He recalls , " I had to be a principal at some point , or a prisoner , because I spent more time in the principal 's office than the principal . "

But it was Perry 's fourth - grade teacher , Mr. Kensel , who saw the potential in Perry and set him straight .
Perry knew he wanted to do the same for others .
" We decided we were going to open a school .
We were going to serve mainly black and Latino children , but the only color I was looking at was the color of success , " says Perry .
Perry has achieved that by holding staff and students to the highest expectations .
Breonna Arnum , 17 , a senior at Capital Prep , believes it works .
" It makes a difference because everybody has the same goals as you .
So it 's not like anyone is there to pull you back .
Everyone is going forward , " Arnum says .
Her mother , Waynette Arnum , agrees .
She believes it 's a particular boon for students of color to be immersed in an environment with high demands .
" When you 're in a school system and people look like you , and they 're just as bright as you are , and they 're kicking those
As out and those 96s and 97s like you , you also know that you 're surrounded by people just like yourself who are achievers , " says Waynette Arnum .
" And it 's not an anomaly ; it 's not something that 's rare . "
She believes that seeing success is imperative , because black children need role models who look like them .
Sound off :
How can we keep our kids in school ?
" For students of color , for black students , first of all , when you look at who your role models are , when you look at people that look like you , it tells us that we can do things , " says Waynette Arnum .
In addition , she says black children are too often overlooked .
" I think that students of color are automatically stereotyped sometimes when they go into school systems that are predominantly white , " says Waynette Arnum .
" The stereotype that there 's no father in the home , that the parents do n't care ; we have a plethora of stereotypes -- that the kids have behavioral problems , that the boys should all be put on Ritalin or something of that sort .
Yes , these are definitely issues . "
These are issues all black parents must face , says Angela Burt - Murray , editor - in - chief of Essence Magazine .
Burt - Murray is the mother of two black boys and she and her husband are not only parents , but also advocates for their children .
" It starts with formulating that relationship with the teacher , letting the teacher know that you are an involved and concerned parent , " says Burt - Murray .
Waynette Arnum agrees that parents have to speak up .
That 's exactly what she did .
" I definitely had to sit there and let the teachers know , let the school system know , let the parents know and let my daughter know that yes , I am an advocate , " says Arnum .
" And , all students deserve to learn equally . "
Arnum believes Breonna was overlooked in elementary school , simply because of the color of her skin .
It prompted her to not only stand up for her own daughter , but also to join a Students of Color Committee in the town of Manchester , Connecticut .
" There were definitely issues that were particular to my daughter that later I knew would be particular to all students of color .
So that 's how come I had to be involved , " recalls Arnum .
Arnum believes if she had n't stood up for her daughter , things could have turned out differently .
" I feel as though if I had n't started off the way I had , Breonna still would have slipped though the cracks , even though we push her at home , " Arnum says .
Perry , the dedicated principal , agrees that black children can frequently be the victims of stereotypes .
It 's the reason he pushed so hard to create an environment where everyone was held to the same expectations .
" In our school , it 's college prep for everybody ; it does n't matter if you 're black or white .
They can see that it 's OK for them to be smart and black , " says Perry .

[ Source : Ford % Video - 637 % Fact Sheet : Ultra-High - Strength SteelsVideo : Will It Blend ?
SUMMARY :*
Do n't try this at home !
Blendtec® , maker of the Total Blender® , recently tried but failed to crack , cut or crush a piece of boron steel used in the Ford Fiesta on its " Will It Blend ? " viral video *
More than 50 percent of the all - new Fiesta 's body structure will be made from high - strength and ultra - high - strength steel including boron steel , which helps deliver great fuel economy and low CO2 emissions *
Not only is boron useful in making steel stronger , the element also serves an array of household and industrial uses ranging from the ordinary ( detergents , insecticides and glass ) to the extraordinary ( pyrotechnics , rocket fuel , nuclear reactors ) CONTEXT / BACKGROUND : Ford Fiesta Movement agent Ryan Dembroski of Milwaukee recently traveled to the " Will It Blend ? " studio in Orem , Utah , to put a piece of the Fiesta 's ultra - high - strength boron steel to the Blendtec Total Blender test .
Having decimated objects including an Apple iPhone , marbles and magnets , Tom Dickson , founder of Blendtec and host of the popular YouTube videos , tried but failed to crack , cut or crush the steel .
While boron steel wo n't blend , it will help protect occupants of the Fiesta and many other Ford vehicles .
DETAILS : Has there ever been an element better named than boron ?
Antimony ?
That 's a Greek goddess , right ?
Californium ?
Do n't the USC Trojans play there ?
And is n't Xenon an alien planet ?
The chemists who named boron , on the other hand , hit the nail on the head .
It actually sounds strong , hard and elemental – like iron or krypton .
It 's probably some superhero's Achilles ' heel .
Boron is used to make steel super strong , which is what Blendtec found out the hard way .
The element is used to strengthen car parts , aerospace structures , even golf clubs and fishing rods .
It is extremely versatile , serving an array of household and industrial uses .
Boron is used in :* Detergent * Antiseptic * Cosmetics * Insecticide * Enamel glaze * Ceramics * Glass * Pyrotechnics * Rocket fuel *
Flame retardant * Nuclear reactors *
Punching tools * Spades * Knives and saw blades According to Wikipedia , boron is relatively rare , representing only 0.001 percent of the Earth 's crust .
The worldwide deposits are estimated as 10 million tons , with nearly three quarters of it coming from Turkey .
The element also is found in the Mojave Desert in California .
Nearly all boron ore is extracted for refinement into boric acid for antiseptic , insecticide and flame retardant , or borax for detergents , cosmetics and enamel glazes .
Boron and beyond Ford uses boron and other ultra - high - strength lightweight steels in various structural areas on several of its current models , including the Ford Taurus F - 150 and Focus , as well as the Lincoln MKS .
Boron will also be extensively used in the all - new 2011 Ford Fiesta to help protect occupants in the event of a collision .
The Fiesta uses an exceptionally high level of cold - and hot - formed high - strength steels in its body structure .
More than 50 percent of the body structure is high - strength steel , including grades of very high - strength , dual - phase steel and ultra - high - strength aluminized boron steel .
Yet , despite its additional strength , the all - new Fiesta body structure overall is lightweight .
This means advancements in safety are achieved in harmony with fuel economy and CO2 emissions .
Fiesta reinforcement
High - strength steels are used in areas of the 2011 Fiesta where structural strength and reinforcement are essential for crashworthiness .
This includes the floor structure , front rails and beams , and the vehicle 's integrated body - side reinforcement to help protect against side impact .
High - strength materials are used to create a very strong B - pillar section and a strong rocker section fore and aft in a crash .
Impact loads are also transferred laterally to the opposite side of the car via under - body crossmembers to maximize dissipation of side - impact forces .
This integrated body - side reinforcement resists side intrusion in the event of a collision and helps the body structure manage the energy of other impacts effectively – be they frontal , offset or rear .
Elements of the body - side reinforcement include the slim A - pillar forming the forward part of the vehicle 's stylish roof arch , the intrusion - resistant B - pillar , the rocker panels or lower rails to which the B - pillar is fixed , the stabilizing rocker baffles , side roof arch and the lower A - pillar .
These individual high - strength elements are formed into an integrated subassembly during manufacturing before they are joined to the vehicle on the production line .
This process ensures better joint strength and a more efficient body structure .
Even more high - strength steel
High - strength steel can be found in other areas of the all - new Fiesta 's body structure , including : *
The dual - phase steel front and side frame rails feature structural actuation points – or " trigger points " – to initiate predictable collapse in crush zones .
Forming the triggers hardens the dual - phase material , giving it unique twin characteristics of energy absorption and energy resistance .*
Under - floor structural beams – or " sled- runners " – also are formed from dual - phase steel , as are lateral floor reinforcements , which help manage front and side - impact forces .
Reinforcements in the vehicle 's roof , doors and floor are made from other gauges of high - strength steel , including boron steel beams .

In an attempt to track progress in a measurable way , the Rakudo people count the number of passing tests each night ( ok , they do n't do that manually :-) and write that into a CSV file .
The next step was n't far : generate a chart from it , put it on a website , and tell everybody about it .
Here 's a snapshot :
Old news so far , as an eager Perl 6 follower you surely know that already , nothing new here .
But the other day somebody asked me why the green ( PASS ) and the grey ( number of spectests available ) seem to be parallel .
My first reaction was " no , they are n't parallel " because the big jumps do n't happen at the same time , but still there are large areas where they do seem to grow roughly at the same rate .
So what 's up ?
As far as I can tell there are two mechanism at work here .
The first one accounts for much of the past behaviour : tests were moved from the old part of the pugs test suite to the official test suite ( where they are counted towards the grey line ) , and at the same time people also tried to get it to run under Rakudo - mostly successfully , as the green line shows .
Now most test files are actually moved to the official Perl 6 test suite , there are less than 200 tests left to move ( as opposed to 17 k already moved ) , and this mechanism is drained .
The second mechanism is that as soon as Rakudo implements a cool new feature , we realize that we need more tests for it , and people write more tests for it .
( It 's rather hard to write tests for language feature that does n't run yet .
" test first " is a nice idea , but it only works to some extent in reality ) .
Also people explore the new features , find bugs , and bug tickets are only closed if there are tests for them , so even more spec tests that coincide with passing Rakudo tests .
In the list of world challenges , global warming might be at once the most alarming and the most controversial .
According to some predictions , climate change caused by human activity could cause mass extinction in the oceans , redraw the planet ’s coastlines , and ravage world food supplies .
At the same time , a significant portion of the American public questions whether global warming will really cause any major harm ; many still doubt that human - driven warming is happening at all .
How can we settle the debate ?
And can we intervene in the process or find ways to adapt to the new conditions ?
In conjunction with the National Science Foundation and the San Francisco Exploratorium , DISCOVER brought together four experts to discuss the reality and meaning of climate change .
In a highly nuanced exchange of ideas , these researchers weighed the various scenarios and laid out a road map for navigating the warmer world to come .
The conversation was moderated by DISCOVER ’s editor in chief , Corey S. Powell .
POWELL : One question I hear all the time is whether the current change in climate is truly extraordinary .
Even if humans are contributing to global warming , is n’t this just like the natural variations that have happened many times in the past ?
Robin Bell :
A little background first .
I spend a lot of time studying the ice sheets at the bottom of the planet — how they form and how they collapse .
The poles are like the planet ’s air conditioner .
When things are working well , the poles keep the planet nice and cool and we do n’t think about it .
When things stop working , the poles can start to melt and there ’s a puddle on the floor .
Today both poles are getting warmer ; in Greenland and Antarctica you can see the surface of the ice dropping , and you can see there ’s less mass when you measure the ice from space .
The process has been ongoing , but it looks like it ’s happening faster than it was .
We know the ice sheets have come and gone in the past .
Why is this any different ?
One of the most compelling reasons is that in the past the ice sheets from the two poles did n’t move together — one would lead and the other would follow .
This time , both the north and south are spewing ice into the global ocean , accelerating at the same time .
Ken Caldeira : Another indication of how unusual all this is can be seen by looking at ocean chemistry .
When we drive our car and carbon dioxide comes out of the tailpipe , within a year it has spread throughout the atmosphere and is integrated with the surface ocean .
When carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater , it forms carbonic acid , and in high enough concentrations carbonic acid is corrosive to the shells and skeletons of many marine organisms .
To measure the impact , people go out in ships and drill holes in the ocean floor , where shells of marine organisms have settled throughout geologic history .
What we see is that if we continue in our current trends in burning fossil fuels , the ocean will become more acidic than it has been at any time in the past 65 million years .
The last time the ocean was as acidic as it has the potential to become in the coming decades , we saw a mass extinction event .
POWELL : Yet as you note , the earth got warm in the past , too .
Caldeira :
That ’s true , but it got warm over millions of years , and ecosystems had a chance to adapt .
What we ’re seeing are rates of increase in greenhouse gases and warming that exceed natural rates by a factor of 100 .
So what we ’re doing is really unusual when seen from a geologic perspective .
POWELL : Humans are doing in centuries what natural processes do over millions of years ?
Caldeira :
Yes , and the other timescale mismatch is that what we do over the next decades will affect life on this planet for hundreds of thousands of years , if not millions of years .
We are at a critical juncture in earth history .
If we do n’t do the right thing and there are geologists around 50 million years from now , they ’ll be able to look at cores and see the remnants of a civilization that developed advanced technology but did n’t develop the wisdom to use it wisely .
POWELL : What about the impact of global warming on agriculture ?
As the climate changes , will people have enough to eat ?
Bill Easterling :
One of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century was the way we were able to increase the global food supply in pace with unprecedented population growth .
We will have to raise the food supply another two times to feed all of the people that we think will be alive by the latter third of the 21st century .
We have reason to be somewhat sanguine about doing it if climate stays more or less the same , but how will we do it with the climate change ?
Based on our simulations and on 25 years of research , what bothers us most is that in the tropics , where the majority of poor people live today , crops are currently raised at temperatures pretty close to their photosynthetic optimums .
POWELL : Meaning that higher temperatures will make it difficult for us to produce the amount of food we need ?
Easterling :
If you go any higher , yields begin to fall .
On the other hand , in the midlatitudes — in the temperate zones where we live and where many of the grain belts of Europe and North America are located — a little bit of warming in some cases is not a bad thing , at least not at first .
These are regions where crops are currently cold - limited .
In other words , if you warm the temperatures , you actually might get a little bit of additional yield .
So you ’ve already begun to set up a kind of haves and have - nots , an imbalance where the poorest people in the world who vitally depend on agriculture as a development tool , in addition to providing food security , are now being even further disadvantaged .
But there really are n’t many winners in the long run because even if the higher latitudes are given an advantage , they still are faced with moving food across large distances and making sure that it ’s done in such a way that the farming systems in the receiving countries are not put out of business because of the inundation of free or subsidized food .
POWELL : Climate change is such a huge issue that people tend to feel paralyzed by it .
Stephen , you ’ve framed it in a helpful way as a problem of risk management .
What does that mean ?
Stephen Schneider : I often testify before Congress and talk to the media , and they always ask the same question :
Is the science settled enough for us to have policy ?
Do we know enough to spend money fixing this ?
But science , and especially system science , is very complicated .
Now , in any system that ’s complicated there are some components that are well established .
In other words , they ’re relatively settled .
We know that the world is now 0.75 degrees Celsius warmer than it was a century and a half ago .
We know that the ice sheets are decreasing .
But then there are other components with competing potential outcomes — for instance , will a change of three degrees make crop yields go up or down ?
POWELL : So how should we separate out the well - established parts , and how do we evaluate the ones that are not so certain ?
Schneider :
When you ’re covering climate change , you do n’t get somebody from a deep ecology group to tell you we ’re near the end of the world and then somebody from the Competitive Enterprise Institute who ’s going to tell you carbon dioxide is a fertilizer while forgetting about ocean acidification .
If you do that , the two lowest - probability outcomes get most of the time in the media and you get this dumbed - down debate .
It ’s bipolar , and that ’s not how system science works .
There are multiple potential outcomes .
What we do is whittle out the relative likelihood of each of these outcomes so we can make a value judgment about whether or not the risks are adequate to move forward .
Risk is what can happen , multiplied by the probability of its happening .
That ’s what we call an objective or scientific assessment .
We try to make the risk aspects clear and then leave the risk management where it properly belongs , which is out among the public and in the political world .
POWELL : In the news , climate change is often described in terms of legislation and treaties .
So I was surprised , Ken , when I heard you call it a “ hardware problem . ”
Can you explain that ?
Caldeira :
Many people have been looking at this as a problem of getting international cooperation and international agreements .
We ’ve had the Kyoto Protocol and the Copenhagen Round Table coming up .
But when China builds a power plant that ’s going to spew carbon dioxide into the environment for at least the next 75 years , what ’s important is that we build it correctly .
To me the risks are so clear .
Economists estimate that transforming our economy into having an energy system that does not emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere might cost 2 percent of our wealth each year .
Now , I can go to any group of people and say , “ Let ’s pretend we already have energy systems based on solar , wind , and other sources that do n’t emit greenhouse gases . ”
Then I say , “ You can make 2 percent more money each year , but in return for being 2 percent richer we ’re going to have to melt the ice caps and acidify the oceans and shift weather patterns .
Now , would you trade all that environmental risk in order to be 2 percent richer ? ”
I ’ve asked this of climate skeptics .
Even they say , “ Well , if we already had this carbon - neutral energy system , I would go with it . ”
That makes me think it ’s not the cost of transforming our energy system — it ’s that we do n’t have the cooperation we need to start doing the job .
If we wait until we have international cooperation , it will be too late .
What we need is leadership that will say , “ We have to stop building devices that emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere . ”
POWELL : What does “ leadership ” mean in this context ?
Caldeira :
We need to say we ca n’t afford to have gasoline cars that emit carbon dioxide — so can we have an electric car system with swappable batteries ?
We ca n’t afford to build a coal - fired power plant with CO2 coming out — so can we develop carbon capture and storage technologies , or should we be looking at solar - thermal ?
We have to start building the new energy system , and we need the political leadership to say we ’re going to start doing this .
We need research and development to come up with the technology because it ’s not all on the shelf .
I think if the United States started doing this in a serious way , Europe would follow .
If the United States and Europe did this , I think it would not be long before China and India joined us .
POWELL : Snap poll :
Do you consider yourselves fundamentally optimistic or pessimistic about whether we have the technological and political will to fix this problem ?
Bell : I ’m an optimist .
Oh , we are changing the planet .
We may have already changed the ice sheets to a point that some parts of them may go , but we have the ability to stop changing it more and to adapt to what we have already done .
Caldeira : I ’m also optimistic about our abilities .
Unfortunately I ’m pessimistic about our wisdom .
We have the capability to do amazing things in a short amount of time , but it takes a political decision with follow - through .
I ’m not confident we ’ll get it .
Easterling : I temper my optimism by saying that we ’re probably looking at an adaptive challenge .
That is , we ’re going to have to adapt to a certain amount of warming no matter what , even if we were to bring global emissions of greenhouse gases back to year - 2000 levels , and that adaptation would be draconian if we were to do it all at once .
Schneider :
The first time I was asked that question in a public place was sometime in the 1970s in front of a congressional committee .
My answer was a little bit like Ken’s .
I said , “ I ’m technologically optimistic and politically bleak . ”
That proved to be a pretty good forecast for the next 35 years .
But now I ’m getting more optimistic because there ’s getting to be some alignment of the stars between Congress and the White House .
The tough problem is going to be China , India , Indonesia , Brazil , Mexico , and the countries that are even poorer than that .
Can you imagine telling this current Congress that we need half a trillion dollars ’ worth of technology transfers to help developing countries go through the transition ?
POWELL : That raises a good question :
How much money do we need to spend on addressing global warming ?
Schneider : I think we ’ll need $ 500 billion to get going .
Over time , it will be trillions .
Caldeira :
But we ’re talking about something that ’s small compared with the money we invest in medical care .
It ’s smaller than what we invest in the military budget .
I think we need to start looking at climate change as the kind of threat that we must spend real money on to address .
POWELL : Have you all adjusted your personal lifestyle in response to climate change ?
What measures are important ?
For instance , will driving a hybrid car or turning down your thermostat really be meaningful , or is this just a drop in the ocean ?
Bell : Personally , I ’ve done all the easy things .
We ’ve changed our lightbulbs [ to compact fluorescents ] .
We got rid of one of our cars .
But the work I do is an energy hog .
I travel to events like this to talk about the changing climate .
I go to Antarctica and I burn a lot of carbon to do what I do .
So professionally I ’m a pig when it comes to carbon .
The really hard thing is airline travel .
My husband wo n’t get on a plane for fun anymore .
But he ’ll go anywhere on a sailboat .
Easterling : I ’m the dean of a college at Penn State , and I am notorious for being in a charcoal gray suit riding my bicycle in three inches of snow .
I try to set an example , and I have n’t fallen yet .
Caldeira : I ’ve done some things , like I now drive a little scooter instead of a car to work , but I really think that this emphasis on the personal carbon footprint plays into the interests of the people who would like to see our current energy system continue .
We wo n’t solve this problem by telling people not to have toast .
Schneider : This is the hypocrisy question .
Yeah , Senator Inhofe loves to ask that one of Al Gore , and I get it all the time too .
In fact , I ask it of my freshmen and sophomores : “ Is your professor a hypocrite ? ” I live in a green house with twice the legally required insulation and a heat recovery ventilator , and I drive a hybrid and I bike and I live two miles from work , but then there are those 170,000 miles up there on United Airlines , and that is 90 - odd percent of my footprint , just as Robin said .
Audience member :
What is the most compelling evidence you have that human behavior is actually warming the planet ?
Caldeira :
To me the most compelling evidence is the fact that the stratosphere — the upper atmosphere — is cooling while the lower atmosphere and the land surface are warming .
That ’s a sign that greenhouse gases are trapping energy and keeping that energy close to the surface of the earth .
I mentioned that in ocean acidification , you actually see animals that should make shells unable to make shells anymore .
You could demonstrate the same kind of effect in a bell jar in the lab .
There is a level of certainty about it .
POWELL : What about you , Bill ?
You ’re looking not at climate records but rather at agriculture .
Do you see a real break from the past there , indicating a unique signature of global warming ?
Easterling :
One of the problems with agriculture is that it ’s a highly managed ecosystem .
So it ’s often tricky to try to separate out the climate change signal from what might be a host of other things relating to how we manage crops and livestock .
But we have seen an increase in the length of the frost - free season .
We have seen changes in the incidences and the life cycles of critical agricultural pests , which can be explained only by a general warming .
Of course , this is all circumstantial .
What made all this come into sharp focus for me was not what we were observing but what we were able to simulate on a computer .
Over the past 10 to 15 years , we have been running experiments with very complex and increasingly reliable global climate models .
When we entered into the computer all the various things that forced the climate to change , we were able to faithfully reproduce the temperature record of the past 100 years globally .
When you take out the component of human - generated carbon dioxide , the models do n’t work at all .
There are all these people who say , “ Well , what about the sun ?
Why do n’t they think about solar variability ? ”
Of course we think about the sun .
The models think about all these things , but the models work only if you put all the components in , and one of the big components is us .
POWELL : How you deal with skeptics , both in Congress and in the public , who always seem to have a contrary statistic ?
Schneider : First , with regard to your due diligence as a publisher , why has n’t DISCOVER published a compelling account of the other side ?
Because there is n’t any .
That ’s a pretty good reason .
There are a lot of things in that speculative and competing explanations category , but there is no preponderance , and that is what is compelling to me .
For example , take the evidence that Robin cited .
If you were a cynic and you asked about the probability of the ice sheet in the north going up , it ’s 50 percent .
Going down ?
Fifty percent .
And the South Pole going up ?
Fifty percent .
Going down ?
Fifty percent .
Probability they are both going together ?
Twenty - five percent .
What ’s the probability of the stratosphere cooling while the earth gets warmer ?
Again , assuming we knew nothing , 50 percent .
Troposphere warming ?
Fifty .
The probability that one will go up while the other goes down ?
Twenty - five percent .
Same thing for other patterns , like the way high - latitude continents are warming more than low - latitude ones are .
With any single line of evidence , you can say , “ Oh , well , there ’s still a 25 percent chance it ’s random , ” but what happens when you put all these events together ?
The probability of all these events ’ lining up the same way is pretty darn low unless we are dealing with global warming .
Caldeira : Climate science has reached the point that plate tectonics reached 30 years ago .
It is the basic view of the vast majority of working scientists that human - induced climate change is real .
There is a real diversity of informed opinion on how important climate change is going to be to various things that affect humans , and there is a diversity of opinion on how to address this problem , but the debate over human - induced climate change is over .
Audience member : I work in a hard - rock mining industry , and the majority of my colleagues tell me I ’m crazy when I talk about climate change .
Where are some good sources of information that rationally discuss all of these different naysayers ’ theories ?
Caldeira : One useful Web site is realclimate.org .
Schneider : I have a contrarian section on my Web site , which is climatechange.
net .
We ’re about to triple it because we had to deal with those famous climate professors , you know , professors Limbaugh and Crichton .
[ Laughter ]
They have a standard technique , doing much the same thing that the American Tobacco Institute did for a long time , which is to cite the three studies that were equivocal and ignore the 33 studies that were definitive .
They use the argument that we still do not , to this day , understand the detailed biological connections between smoking and cancer , but the evidence and data are so overwhelming you ’d have to be nuts not to act on it — unless you ’re in the business .
Caldeira :
There was a climate contrarian who testified before the Senate last week .
He made the claim that climate scientists were some kind of club and they all made money by somehow supporting each other ’s findings .
The reality of science is that a scientific career is made by showing that all the people around you believe something that ’s not true .
If a scientist could provide evidence that the climate theory is incorrect and that global warming is not a product of human activities , he or she would be held up as the Darwin or the Einstein of climate science .
We ’re highly incentivized to show that all our colleagues are wrong .
If we could come up with good evidence that they ’re wrong , we would be out there publishing it .
The evidence just does n’t exist .
Easterling : Even science is not value neutral .
We make decisions and we have values in our judgments , but at the end of the day we have a code of ethics that says we look at the data and , using our prior knowledge , we make our best judgment .
That ’s all it is .

Corey Powell
Someone suggested today on one of my listservs that President Obama ought to be campaigning as hard for health - care reform as he did for his election .
I do n't know if that 's a fair shot , but you have to say , after watching his performance today in New Hampshire at the town hall meeting on health care , they may have a point :
He was electric , charming , persuasive , and powerful .
The major thesis :
This is not about putting the government in charge of your health insurance .
I do n't believe anyone should be in charge of your health insurance decisions but you and your doctor .
( Applause . )
I do n't think government bureaucrats should be meddling , but I also do n't think insurance company bureaucrats should be meddling .
That 's the health care system I believe in .
Making it personal :
And I have to say , this is personal for Lori but it 's also personal for me .
I talked about this when I was campaigning up here in New Hampshire .
I will never forget my own mother , as she fought cancer in her final months , having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment .
And by the way , this was because the insurance company was arguing that somehow she should have known that she had cancer when she took her new job -- even though it had n't been diagnosed yet .
So if it could happen to her , it could happen to any one of us .
And I 've heard from so many Americans who have the same worries .
One woman testified that an insurance company would not cover her internal organs because of an accident she had when she was five years old .
Think about that -- that covers a lot of stuff .
( Laughter . )
They 're only going to cover your skin .
( Laughter . )
Dermatology , that 's covered ; nothing else .
( Laughter . )
Another lost his coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because the insurance company discovered he had gall stones that he had n't known about when he applied for insurance .
Now , that is wrong , and that will change when we pass health care reform .
That is going to be a priority .
( Applause . )
Under the reform we 're proposing , insurance companies will be prohibited from denying coverage because of a person 's medical history .
Period .
( Applause . )
They will not be able to drop your coverage if you get sick .
( Applause . )
They will not be able to water down your coverage when you need it .
( Applause . )
Your health insurance should be there for you when it counts -- not just when you 're paying premiums , but when you actually get sick .
And it will be when we pass this plan .
( Applause . )
Now , when we pass health insurance reform , insurance companies will no longer be able to place some arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage you can receive in a given year or a lifetime .
And we will place a limit on how much you can be charged for out - of - pocket expenses , because no one in America should go broke because they get sick .
( Applause . )
And finally -- this is important -- we will require insurance companies to cover routine checkups and preventive care , like mammograms and colonoscopies -- ( applause ) -- because there 's no reason we should n't be catching diseases like breast cancer and prostate cancer on the front end .
That makes sense , it saves lives ; it also saves money -- and we need to save money in this health care system .
So this is what reform is about .
For all the chatter and the yelling and the shouting and the noise , what you need to know is this :
If you do n't have health insurance , you will finally have quality , affordable options once we pass reform .
( Applause . )
If you do have health insurance , we will make sure that no insurance company or government bureaucrat gets between you and the care that you need .
And we will do this without adding to our deficit over the next decade , largely by cutting out the waste and insurance company giveaways in Medicare that are n't making any of our seniors healthier .
( Applause . )
Right .
( Laughter . )

Here ’s the deal :
There ’s a company called National Public Advertising Outdoor that puts up advertisements on sides of buildings and other public places in New York and other big cities .
The ads they put up are illegal .
They do not have a permit .
They city is not getting paid .
Instead , they pay the landlords of the buildings they use .
Citizens are forced to look at advertising all over NYC because this company has illegally plastered their ads all over town .
For whatever reason , the city looks the other way and rarely cracks down on them .
This spring , Jordan from The Public Ad Campaign blog organized a massive grassroots retaliation against the illegal billboards .
See our coverage here and here .
In short , an army of artists whitewashed 120 different illegal billboards and replaced them with art .
NPA Outdoor was furious and sent out teams to put their ads back up in a matter of hours .
A few artists even got arrested after being caught in the act by police .
Since the takeover , NPA Outdoor has added a new notice to all of their billboard sites .
As you can see in the photo above , it reads , “ Coming soon to this location : a chance to win these posters and other prizes inside . ”
They are trying to find a loophole in their bullshit illegal business .
It ’s illegal for a landlord to put an advertisement on the side of his building , but it ’s not illegal to put up a sign advertising products that are for sale inside .
So by putting up this bullshit notice that claims you can win the posters inside the store , NPA is trying to get around the law .
They ’re smart to add the phrase “ coming soon , ” because if you go in ANY of the stores that have this notice , you ’ll find that there are no posters .
It ’s all bullshit .
I ’ve personally asked people in a half - dozen stores for more information on “ winning ” the posters and every clerk has looked at me like I was an idiot .
They had no idea what I was talking about , because there is no drawing for posters .
It ’s bullshit .
Recently Posterchild and Jason Eppink set out to call NPA Outdoor on their bullshit .
The duo replaced NPA ’s notice with one of their own .
Why wo n’t the city crack down on New York ’s true graffiti problem ?

WE ALL NEED A GURU SOMETIMES
" 110 over 70 ...105 over 60 ... 120 over 80 ... "
The doctor called the figures out loud as he read on my blood pressure .
It could not have been easy for he was standing several feet away , was not using any equipment -- there being nothing wrapped around my arm -- and his hands were flaying wildly in the air as he concentrated .
I was before him because I get these knots in my back , the upper middle part feeling like it is caught in a vice grip .
So , like the millions of other Americans without health insurance , I do what I can to figure my way on my own , which means self diagnose , be it herbal supplements , holistic remedies or , in my case , good old fashioned green bud .
I had been offered medical marijuana a few years before by a M.D. but since I was leaving California at the time , I instead opted for some pills .
The pills made my legs wobbly for about 20 minutes and otherwise lazy so when I returned to the state , a new diagnosis was in order .
This time my evaluation occurred in a private apartment , one with a Buddhist feel to it , the type of place where you take your shoes off at the door , sit on mats and the air is peaceful .
The visiting doctor - an osteopath - I was informed was the guru to another guru , the host , who lived there .
I had been referred by a friend .
Three others , a woman and two men , all early 20s , were already waiting when I arrived , each carrying the necessary $ 125 in cash for the visit .
I was given three forms to fill out , essentially asking me to detail my medical condition and history .
To give us a backing to write on , the host had scattered several hardcover books on the floor .
I chose a coffee table - sized version of the Wizard of Oz .
Our host strummed a guitar as we waited for the doctor in the adjacent room .
When I was called in , the doctor stood across the table from me .
He asked a few basic questions before the hand waving began .
He made crossing movements in front of me following the direction of my spine and vital organs .
Occasionally he would abruptly thrust his arms outward .
It made me think of healers I had seen from the South , the way they attempt to waive away bad energy .
After a minute , he asked me if I felt what he just did .
I had straightened up a few seconds earlier , so I shrugged and said maybe that had been due to him .
He nodded , and proceeded with the blood pressure reading .
After writing that on my chart , he then did the same for my pulse rate , still standing across the table from me .
After a short conversation , I produced my driver 's license as identification and the $ 125 , broken down into six twenties and a five .
He counted it the traditional way , his reading of aura obviously not extending to such material things .

10 Maya foods that changed the world 's eating habits
A salmonella strain found in a Mexican - grown Jalapeno at a Texas plant has prompted new FDA warnings .
A salmonella strain found in a Mexican - grown Jalapeno at a Texas plant has prompted new FDA warnings .

The ancient Maya civilization — which ranged from the Yucatán Peninsula to Chiapas and Tabasco states , part of Veracruz state and as far south as Honduras — is well known for perfecting architectural techniques that produced towering cities , and for developing an advanced written language and creating books centuries before anything comparable appeared in Europe .
The Maya also were gifted mathematicians who developed the concept of zero .
And their astronomers , through centuries of patient observation , created a 365 - day solar calendar that varies by less than 2 seconds from the one we use today — more accurate than what Cortés was using when he landed in 1519 .
Lost among the laurels heaped upon the Maya , though , is credit for their agricultural wizardry .
When the conquering Spanish started carrying Maya food staples back to Europe and to the Caribbean , Asia and Africa , it changed the world 's eating habits .
We 're not talking about the Yucatán 's deliciously exotic lime - and - achiote concoctions but food you buy every day in Safeway 's produce aisles .
Just try to get through a day without :
1. Chocolate
Legions of chocoholics would argue that the Maya's " food of the gods , " made from the toasted , fermented seeds of the cacao tree , is the New World 's greatest gift to civilization .
Though Cortés learned of chocolate from the Aztecs , they had acquired it through trade with the Maya , who first cultivated it about 3,000 years ago .
Maya and Aztec aficionados drank their chocolate bitter and spicy ; sugar was unknown before the conquest .
Even today , chocolate in the Yucatán may be flavored with paprika , annatto or even pepper .
But it was more than a drink to the Maya , who believed it came from the gods and formed a bridge between heaven and earth .
Cacao seeds were an early form of money , and archaeologists have uncovered counterfeit seeds made of clay .
2. Vanilla
( vainilla )
The elixir from the world 's only known edible orchid , probably first cultivated by the Totonaca in neighboring Veracruz state , had become a common flavoring for the Maya 's chocolate drinks by the 1500s .
Vanilla , too , was adopted by the Aztecs , who introduced it to Cortés .
Spanish and Portuguese explorers who brought it to Africa and Asia in the 16th century named it vainilla , or " little pod . "
Southern Mexico's jungle is still the only place the Vanilla planifolia orchid grows wild , pollinated by native , non-stinging bees that produce Maya honey .
Today 's prized Tahitian vanilla , which came from Mexican stock , requires hand - pollination .
3. Corn ( maíz )
Every elementary - school kid knows corn was the most important food in the Americas .
The Popul Vuh , the Maya " bible , " attributes humankind 's very existence to this domesticated strain of wild grass .
In its creation myth , the " Creators and Makers " fashioned man from tender kernels of yellow and white corn after failed attempts with mud and wood .
Though corn was a dietary staple in most of Mexico as long as 6,000 years ago , it was the Maya who first cultivated it around 2500 B.C. , abandoning their nomadic ways to settle in villages surrounded by cornfields .
4. Chiles
Chiles were cultivated in the Americas as long as 7,500 years ago .
Blame Christopher Columbus for mistaking them as relatives of black pepper , native to southern Asia , but give him credit for spreading them throughout the world .
The release of endorphins , increased heart rate , mental stimulation and euphoria provoked by chiles ' capsaicinoids — the ingredient that makes them taste hot — qualifies them as psychoactive plants .
Southern Mexico's Capsicum annuum species , with its many cultivars , is crucial to nearly every fiery cuisine in the world .
5. Tomatoes ( tomates )
Even the Italians had to make do without tomato sauce before Columbus set out for the New World .
Precursors originated in Peru , but the tomato as we know it came from the Yucatán , where the Maya cultivated it long before Cortés first encountered one in an Aztec market around 1520 .
Native versions were small , like cherry tomatoes , and probably yellow rather than red .
Two years after Cortés brought the tomato back to Spain , it made its way to Naples — then under Spanish rule — where invention of the pizza made tomato sauce a necessity of life .
Once believed poisonous because they are related to the deadly nightshade , tomatoes are now a staple of nearly every cuisine in the world .
6 . Black beans ( frijoles negros )
Archaeological digs indicate the black bean originated in southern Mexico and Central America more than 7,000 years ago .
With their meaty flavor and velvety texture , black beans are still the favorite in and around the Yucatán , where they may turn up in almost any dish .
They have spread widely throughout Latin America , the Caribbean , and the southern United States , becoming an important part of the many regional cuisines .
7. Avocado ( aguacate )
From its origins in southern Mexico , where it was prized as an aphrodisiac — the Aztecs called it ahuacatl , meaning " testicle , " and kept their daughters indoors during harvest season — the avocado spread north to the Rio Grande and south to central Peru before Europeans encountered it .
The sexual association carried through the 19th century , when growers who wanted to cultivate avocados commercially first had to mount a campaign to persuade the public that eating avocados did not equate to licentiousness .
Mexico is still the world 's main source of avocados .
8. Sweet potato( camote )
Sweet potatoes are native to the tropics from the Yucatán to Venezuela , and the Maya domesticated the plant at least 5,000 years ago .
By 2500 B.C. , sweet potatoes had spread throughout the Caribbean and South America .
Sweet potatoes belong to the genus Ipomoea , which includes morning glories .
Though commonly confused with the yam , what we know as yams are simply another variety of sweet potato .
True yams are native to Africa ; when slaves from that continent were deposited in North America they adopted sweet potatoes as a substitute for the tuber they had eaten in their homeland and called it by the familiar name .
9. Squash ( calabaza , calabacita )
Though corn and beans are better - known Mexican natives , squash predates them by several thousand years ; Maya people domesticated several varieties of squash as early as 8000 B.C.
Oils from these seeds were the main source of dietary fat before the Spanish introduced beef and pork .
Though the native plants included cucumber , zucchini , patty pan and butternut squash , great quantities of pumpkin — la calabaza grande — defines the Yucatán diet even today .
Toasted , ground pumpkin seeds still appear on menus even more than the flesh .
10 . Papaya
Though it 's more closely associated with Hawaii now , all indications are the papaya originated in the tropics of southern Mexico and Central America .
After the Spanish carried seeds to Panama and the Dominican Republic , cultivation spread throughout South and Central America , the Caribbean , Europe , the Pacific Islands , India and parts of Africa .
It has became naturalized in many areas and still grows wild along Mexican roadsides .
Hawaii , where papayas first arrived in the 1800s , is the only U.S. state to grow them commercially .
Shawn Hattingh gives an anarchist view on the community and workers revolt sweeping South Africa .
Over the last few weeks in South Africa , community protests and land occupations have once again erupted .
People are simply infuriated at continuously being ignored and treated as subhuman by the state and the elite , and for this reason they have been taking to the streets .
While barricades have literally been spreading from township to township , politicians of every sway – from the DA to the ANC – have been condemning these protests .
Along with thinly veiled threats , politicians have also branded the people involved as criminals .
Not to be outdone , a number of business and conservative church leaders have formed a 25 person council to work with the government to end the protests through embarking on a ‘ moral regeneration ’ campaign .
The fact that the elite have branded the protestors as evil and in need of moral regeneration should come as no surprise .
This is because the elite have a deep - seated contempt for the vast majority of people .
In fact , they have been waging an ideological , economic and physical war on the majority of people for years through neo-liberalism .
Indeed , the only reason why the elite are now so upset by the community protests and land occupations is because they have realised that they are now beginning to reap the whirlwind of this war .
Scorn and the war on the poor
It is not surprising that people in South Africa are so angry .
They have been the target of the elite 's war for years .
In fact , the elite in South Africa have truly relished the war that they have waged on the poor .
Freed from the status of apartheid pariahs , they have arrogantly attacked workers and the poor with a new found swagger .
As part of this , the elite have systematically driven workers ’ wages down .
Behind the veil of their well manicured suits , most of the corporate elite still also view workers through extremely racist and patriarchal lenses .
From their point of view , most workers are insignificant ‘ others ’ .
The onslaught on workers has also seen millions of people being retrenched .
Bosses want fewer and fewer workers so that they can make more and more money .
Thus , workers are also coldly viewed as costly inputs that need to be reduced .
The consequences : 40 % of South Africans are unemployed .
To make matters worse , under the current system , it is likely that most of these unemployed people will never be formally employed again in their lifetimes .
The elite have not been content with just waging a war on workers and forcing people into unemployment , but have literally attacked all township residents by snatching up the few commons that exist .
As part of this , vast sections of the public service sector has been privatised and handed over to the local and global elite to profiteer from .
This has seen the elite selling basic services , such as water and healthcare , in order to make a fortune .
Even when public services are not fully privatised , they have been commercialised by the state .
This means that the state runs the remaining ‘ publicly ’ owned services to maximise profits .
The poor and unemployed who ca n’t afford what corporations or the state now charge for these services are viewed as bad apples and simply cut - off .
In fact , over 10 million people have had their water or electricity cut in South Africa since 1996 .
Even when services are actually provided to townships , these are of an appalling standard .
This is due to the reality that the elite view township residents as being little better than animals .
Indeed , ANC officials have even admitted that they view providing services to the poor as a burden .
It is partially for this reason that the ANC government dramatically reduced funding for public services in the late 1990s and early 2000s .
Consequently , most townships are still defined by raw sewerage running down the streets and uncollected rubbish blowing in the wind .
Certainly , the maintenance of infrastructure or providing refuse removal in the townships is not viewed as a priority by the elite .
In these conditions , diseases such [ as ] tuberculosis have become rife and cholera outbreaks have occurred at regular intervals .
A similar story of ruthless exploitation and disdain is also evident in how the elite have come to view housing provision .
Since the early 1980s there has been a growing commercialisation of township housing .
Banks have been given free reign in the township housing market and they have made a fortune out of it .
When people have defaulted on their loans , these banks have evicted them without mercy .
Similarly , corporations have also been contracted to build the associated housing projects .
In order to maximise profits , these companies have literally taken short - cuts .
Most of the houses that have been built consist of only one or two rooms .
Added to this , the walls in these houses often crack because they lack proper foundations .
When people have used the state ’s formal channels to lodge complaints about this , they have usually been dismissed with contempt .
As part of the economic war on the poor , South Africa ’s inner cities have also undergone a process of gentrification .
This has seen hundreds of thousands of people being evicted from buildings and shacks in or near city centres , and then dumped kilometres away in the veld .
Indeed , the people involved are often evicted violently by private security forces known as the ‘ red ants ’ .
On being dumped , the evicted people are usually only given a few sheets of steel to build a shack .
This is what , in the lexicon of the South African law system , passes itself off as adequate alternative accommodation .
In most instances the land that people have been evicted from is sold off to developers .
These developers then build trendy loft apartments or town houses for the latest wave of yuppies wanting to experience inner-city life .
The countryside too has not been exempt from the war .
Over 80 % of the land in South Africa is still owned by the white elite – meaning that little has changed since the supposed end of apartheid .
Many white farmers have also unleashed a savage onslaught on farm workers .
In fact , since 1994 over 1 million farm workers have been fired and evicted from the farms that they used to work on .
In addition , racist attacks by farmers on farm workers have also continued .
In the most extreme cases workers have even been dragged to death behind farmers ’ cars .
It is due to the elite ’s ideological and economic war on the poor that South Africa is now the most unequal society in the world .
The white population still holds the vast majority of wealth .
As part of this , the traditional swish white suburbs still receive outstanding public services , while the traditionally under - resourced dilapidated black townships receive an appalling standard of service .
Likewise , CEOs reward themselves handsomely at the expense of workers .
This has seen the average wage gap between CEOs and workers in South Africa grow to the region of 700:1 .
When the poor complain about such issues , they are told by the local political elite to be patient , and in practice ignored .
Under such circumstances , most people are still forced to live in abject poverty , they have their few rights trampled everyday , and they are subjected to subtle and overt forms of racial abuse on an almost daily basis .
It is , therefore , little wonder that people are furious and embarking on protests
The state ’s war on protests
The recent protests , however , are not a new development .
From the earliest days of neo-liberalism in South Africa people have resisted .
Indeed , from as far back as the mid-1990s community protests against poor housing , unemployment , and water and electricity cut - offs have occurred .
Similarly , landless people have claimed land through direct action , and people have also resisted evictions .
The response of the state has also been consistent over this period .
The state elite have simply dismissed the protestors ’ demands and / or dealt with the protestors harshly .
The state elite have even regularly unleashed the National Intelligence Agency ( NIA ) to quell these protests or to seek out mysterious ‘ third forces ’ .
Likewise , whenever a community protest has occurred the police have responded immediately .
Their favourite weapons for putting down protests have been tear gas , rubber bullets and even live ammunition .
Underpinning this state repression has been the fact that the government has also continued to make use of apartheid era laws when dealing with demonstrations .
Under these laws , any type of protest involving more than 15 people has to go through a lengthy application process otherwise it is deemed illegal .
It has been this piece of law that the state has used in suppressing community protests and land occupations .
In fact , thousands of people have been arrested under this law in the post - apartheid period .
With the recent protests , we have once again witnessed the state elite using such mechanisms in an attempt to crush the communities involved .
In fact , the state and the elite are fighting a physical war on the poor .
The events that occurred during the recent protests in the Gauteng township of Thembisa highlight these repressive tactics that are used by the state .
The people of Thembisa organised themselves last year to demand decent housing , water , electricity and work .
In November , the community took these demands to the local councillor .
As happens in most South African townships , the local councillor arrogantly dismissed their demands .
In July this year , the community then mobilised and organised a peaceful march to the mayor ’s office where they put the same demands forward and also called for the local councillor to be removed from office .
Weeks later , they had still not received any response from the mayor .
Clearly , the mayor had simply ignored them .
On the 18th of July , the community then got wind that the local councillor was at a nearby school spending public money on a party to celebrate Nelson Mandela ’s birthday .
The community decided to go to the event and demand the councillor ’s resignation and effective service delivery .
The police , however , stopped the protestors confronting the councillor and a clash between them and the community ensued .
With this , the police opened fire with live ammunition and two of the protestors were killed .
The police then followed this up by unleashing an operation in the township to find the ‘ ringleaders ’ .
Two people were eventually arrested and charged with public violence .
Clearly , the two people arrested were being used as examples in order to intimidate the community .
The actions of the police during the recent protests , such as those that occurred in Thembisa , have been sanctioned at the highest levels of the state .
Various Ministers and politicians have called on the police to crush the protests without mercy .
Indeed , the President of South Africa , Jacob Zuma , called for even more arrests and said the ‘ instigators ’ of community protests must be dealt with harshly .
Added to this , the NIA has once again been unleashed and a special task team has been established to investigate the causes of the protests .
Clearly , a new round of arrests and repression is in the offing .
The protests and the left
Many of the people involved with the authoritarian left , like the elite , have also taken a very dim view of community protests .
In the past , the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) has repeatedly condemned community protests .
For example , the SACP ’s General - Secretary has often labelled the actions of community based organisations – such as the Anti-Privatisation Forum ( APF ) , Abahlali baseMjondolo ( ABM ) , and the Anti-Eviction Campaign ( AEC ) – as “ irresponsible ” and “ infantile ” .
Similarly , in the past , the COSATU leadership have also actively prevented and deterred workers from linking up with community struggles and protests .
A similar story has unfolded during the current protests .
Notably , the largest union in COSATU , the NUM , condemned the destruction of private and public property that accompanied the current protests .
They also said that instead of protesting , people should use the proper channels to have their grievances heard , such as phoning the government ’s call centre – the ‘ Presidential Hotline ’ .
Clearly , the union bureaucrats do n’t seem to realise that the official channels do n’t listen and do n’t care .
In addition , the ‘ Presidential Hotline ’ that the NUM are encouraging people to call is not even up and running yet .
Clearly the union bureaucracy has lost touch with reality .
Over and above this , the real reason why elements amongst the SACP and COSATU condemn community protests is because they see them as a threat .
This is due to the fact that they are not in control of them , and ca n’t impose their will on them .
In the past other elements of the authoritarian left , however , have tried to tap into the sentiments that have driven community protests .
Under this , these elements have tried to create their own organisations , which have taken up some of the issues raised by protests such as unemployment .
In fact , they do this instead of offering genuine support to community movements .
This authoritarian left has then controlled the organisations they created tightly .
The end result , naturally , was that these became highly authoritarian and undemocratic organisations .
The result has been that most of these organisations collapsed , and many of the activists involved – who were treated as mere foot soldiers – have become as disillusioned with the left , as they are disillusioned with the elite .
Over the last decade , however , some of the protests that have occurred have led to a number of genuine community organisations forming .
As such , past protests have been sights of self - organisation and self - education .
For this reason alone past protests have been highly important .
A similar story of self - organisation – outside the influence of any union , NGO or political party – is once again taking place in the current protests .
Indeed , it is likely that one or two new organisations could emerge from the current protests .
It is this self - organisation that carries great potential .
Added to this , a process of self - education is also evident in the current protests .
Many people involved in the current wave of protests have also explicitly stated that they have come to realise that direct action , like blockading roads , is the best way to get a response from the authorities .
The people involved have also started to articulate their desire for a more participatory society , where their views and grievances are not squashed by the elite .
Hopefully , this desire will also begin to extend towards creating self - managed , non-hierarchical and participatory organisations that are pre-figurative of a better society .
It is in this context that anarchists and libertarian socialists , who are involved or linked to the protests , can also make a huge contribution .
Unlike the authoritarian left – who wish to capture and dominate organisations emerging from protests – this contribution could revolve around sharing our visions and ideas around a free , non-hierarchical , and self - managed society : a society which is the antithesis of the oppressive one we are currently forced to live in .
Indeed , libertarian socialists could also play a role in sharing ideas about how we could possibly get to such a society , and how the means and the ends should be compatible .
In fact , the ideas associated with libertarian socialism and anarchism can make a massive contribution to the new struggles that are emerging in South Africa , as these ideas were themselves born in struggle .
Conclusion
The actions of the elite , defined by their attack on the poor , have created the environment in which the current wave of protests has occurred .
Indeed , it has been the attack by the corporate and state elite on the poor that has led to peoples ’ anger .
In fact , the elite have literally driven people deeper and deeper into poverty , and then condescendingly blamed the people for their poverty .
It is also the elites ’ failure to even acknowledge peoples ’ demands , and to continuously treat people with utter disdain , that has driven the current protests .
Nonetheless , despite the elites ’ violent repression , these protests will continue .
Hopefully , these protests will strengthen existing community organisations and perhaps even lead to newer ones being formed .
Certainly , anarchists and libertarian socialists involved or linked to the current protests could play an important role in this .
Already , certain ideas associated with libertarian socialism have come to play key roles in the current protests , such as direct action .
In this context , other ideas of libertarian socialism , such as community and worker self - management , could also come to play a vital function , as clearly the people involved in the protests want a more participatory society .
It is this desire for a more participatory society that could also lead to organisations becoming pre-figurative .
In this context , the vision of libertarian socialism could make a huge contribution towards challenging the current system , which is defined by neo-liberalism , state repression , extreme racism , extreme exploitation , patriarchy , and all manner of other hierarchies .
Hopefully , the community protests that we have been witnessing are also the start of a road to a better world that is created by workers and the poor themselves .
Such a world would hopefully be a world where there are no bosses ; where hierarchies do n’t exist ; where workers and communities manage themselves , and where the economy is collectively planned through assemblies for the benefit of everyone .

In lemming - like fashion , so - called conservative talk radio hosts and news network anchors have predictably voiced their outrage over the decision to release Abdel Baset al - Megrahi , the Libyan patsy convicted of killing 270 people in the 1988 airline bombing over Lockerbie , Scotland .
Fox ’s Greta Van Susteren called al - Megrahi a “ cold - blooded mass murderer ” while the washed - up neocon John Bolton placed all the blame on the Clinton administration .
Bolton lamented that the United States did n’t get to prosecute al - Megrahi and give him the death penalty .
So contentious is the topic of the terminally - ill al - Megrahi ’s return to Libya , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Adm .
Mike Mullen , weighed in on Saturday .
Mullen said he was “ appalled ” by the release and deemed it a “ political decision . ”
FBI Director Robert Mueller sent a scathing letter Scotland ’s Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill saying the decision “ gives comfort to terrorists ” around the world .
“ I am outraged at your decision , blithely defended on the grounds of ‘ compassion , ” ‘ he wrote .
BBC coverage of the release of the patsy Abdel Baset al - Megrahi
As usual , amidst all the chest - beating and hoopla , the facts in the case get conveniently sidelined .
In fact , the facts did not receive a fair shake in the corporate media because the point was at the time to demonize Libya ’s Muammar al - Qaddafi , not get at the truth and track down and prosecute the real terrorists behind the downing of Pan Am flight 103 .
Evidence produced but ignored in the United States reveals that Libyan secret agent al - Megrahi and al - Qaddafi were not behind the bombing .
It was the notorious terrorist and intelligence asset Abu Nidal .
“ Former Labor MP Tam Dalyell and Edinburgh law professor Robert Black urged the Scottish and UK governments to answer reports there is evidence Abu Nidal , aka Hasan Sabri al - Banna , was a U.S. agent , ” the Scotsman reported on October 27 , 2008 .
“ They have long believed Abu Nidal , who died in Iraq in 2002 , and his Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command were responsible for co-ordinating the bomb that blew up Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie on 21 December , 1988 with the loss of 270 lives . ”
“ Intelligence reports , said to have been drawn up for Saddam Hussein ’s security services , said Kuwaitis had asked Abu Nidal , whose real name was Sabri al - Banna , to find out if al - Qaeda was present in Iraq , ” David Maddox wrote for the newspaper .
The reports referred to Abu Nidal ’s “ collusion with both the American and Kuwaiti intelligence apparatuses in co-ordination with Egyptian intelligence . ”
MP Dalyell said the reports added weight to the theory that Lockerbie was a “ tit - for - tat ” attack for the shooting down of an Iranian passenger airliner by the warship USS Vincennes in 1988 , and was allowed by the U.S. administration .
He said the claims that Abu Nidal was working for the Americans would explain some of the mysteries that surrounded the Lockerbie outrage .
These included a notice that went up at the American embassy in Moscow warning diplomats not to travel on Pan Am flights , and senior South African figures being “ hauled off ” the plane before its final flight .
Expendable students replaced the diplomats on the doomed flight .
“ If the American public had known of a link with Abu Nidal , and had known that the US government knew enough to pull VIPs off the plane and let home - going students take their place , there would have been fury at a time of transition between the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Bush Senior , ” Dalyell and Black explained .
In May of 2000 , a gag order added weight to the theory that Libya was not behind the Lockerbie bombing .
Dr. Richard Fuisz , a CIA agent and a potential key trial witness , was gagged by the U.S. government under state secrecy laws and faced 10 years in prison if he revealed any information about the terrorist attack , the Sunday Herald reported .
Fuisz , a multi-millionaire businessman and pharmaceutical researcher , was , according to U.S. intelligence sources , the CIA ’s key operative in the Syrian capital Damascus during the 1980s where he also had business interests .
An alternative view of the facts surrounding the Lockerbie bombing .
“ One month before a court order was served on him by the US government gagging him from speaking on the grounds of national security , he spoke to US congressional aide Susan Lindauer , telling her he knew the identities of the Lockerbie bombers and claiming they were not Libyan , ” Neil Mackay wrote .
“ Fuisz ’s statements to Lindauer support the claims of the two Libyan accused who are to incriminate a number of terrorist organizations , including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command , which had strong links to Syria and Iran , ” in short Abu Nidal .
Nidal was either killed by the Iraqi secret police for his role as an American double agent or he committed suicide after the Iraqis learned of his betrayal , according to the Independent .
Respected Middle East expert and author of Abu Nidal : A Gun For Hire ( Random House , 1992 ) , Patrick Seale , suggests Nidal also worked for the Israeli Mossad .
In 2003 , it was reported by Gordon Thomas of The American Free Press that Bill Clinton ’s close friend — the billionaire fugitive from justice , Marc Rich , who had personal knowledge of the identity of the Israeli spy in the White House known as “ Mega ” – played a crucial role in helping the Bank of Credit and Commercial International ( BCCI ) arrange for Nidal to receive “ hundreds of millions of dollars for illegal arms transactions in an effort to persuade its wealthy Middle East backers that the bank was staunchly pro-Arab . ”
This evidence was presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee in January of 2003 .
[ efoods ] ” British weapons secretly destined for Abu Nidal were financed through BCCI offices and shipped under export documents that Marc Rich knew to be phony .
My role at the bank was to handle the Nidal account .
I later became a spy for the CIA and MI6 , ” Ghassan Quassem , who was a senior officer with BCCI for nearly two decades , said in a sworn affidavit .
None of this information was reported by the corporate media in the United States .
Greta Van Susteren and the corporate media whores — for decades now in the pocket of the Pentagon and the CIA — are revisiting the propaganda they pushed in late 2001 when the patsy al - Megrahi was convicted of murder by a panel of three Scottish judges and sentenced to 27 years in prison .
So busy are Van Susteren and the corporate media whipping up outrage over the fiction of Libyan terrorism , they did n’t bother to mention that the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission looked at al - Megrahi ’s conviction and found he may have suffered a miscarriage of justice .
Finally , it should be noted that Libya was on the receiving end of U.S. Terrorism , not the other way around .
At the foundation of the Lockerbie fiction is the claim that al - Qaddafi had Pan Am flight 103 blown of the sky as revenge for Reagan ’s 1986 bombing of Triopli , allegedly in response to the bombing of a night club in West Berlin that killed one U.S. soldier .
Reagan ’s illegal attack on October 18 , 1985 , was at the time the largest air assault since the Vietnam War. 120 aircraft rained destruction on points around the cities of Tripoli and Benghazi .
At least 100 civilians were killed , including al - Qaddafi ’s 15 - month - old adopted daughter , Hana .
Former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky revealed the truth behind the criminal Libyan bombing in his 2002 book , By Way of Deception : The Making of a Mossad Officer — it was orchestrated by Israel .
A special communications device , Ostrovsky claims , was planted by naval commandos deep inside Libya by the Mossad .
“ The device would act as a relay station for misleading transmissions made by the disinformation unit in the Mossad , called LAP , and intended to be received by American and British listening stations , ” write Ostrovsky and Claire Hoy .
“ The listeners would have no doubt they had intercepted a genuine communication ” and “ the content of the messages , once deciphered , would confirm information from other intelligence sources , namely the Mossad . ”
“ After the bombing of Libya , our friend Qadhafi is sure to stay out of the picture for some time .
Iraq and Saddam Hussein are the next target .
We ’re starting now to build him up as the big villain .
It will take some time , but in the end , there ’s no doubt it ’ll work , ” a Mossad agent told the author .
Ostrovsky ’s revelation is another bit of history the corporate media will never tell you as it continues its dutiful service to the ruling elite to manufacture outrage against official enemies .

While Microsoft 's submission Monday of driver source code to the Linux kernel is monumental on its face , under the covers it leaves a few unanswered questions about virtualization .
" This submission is goodness , but the question now is how much goodness , " said Chris Wolf , an analyst with the Burton Group .
On Monday , Microsoft submitted source code for inclusion in the Linux kernel under a GPL v2 license .
The code consists of four drivers that are part of a Microsoft technology called Linux Device Driver for Virtualization .
The drivers , once added to the Linux kernel , will provide the hooks for any distribution of Linux to run on Windows Server 2008 and its Hyper - V hypervisor technology .
Microsoft stuns Linux world , submits source code for kernel
Virtualization , cloud underlie Microsoft 's Linux kernel submission
One of the drivers is a virtual hypervisor bus that talks to the Windows Hyper - V platform that will sit underneath Linux .
The other three are positioned on top of that and address performance and storage .
One is for virtual networks , one for virtual SCSI and the last is virtual block , a storage mechanism similar to SCSI .
Wolf said there are a few things the virtualization user base is going to want to know , such as whether users will see similar driver compatibility that exists between Microsoft and Citrix today .
" I can install power virtualized drivers on Xen server and they include the driver libraries for Hyper - V so that if I move a Xen server virtual machine to Hyper - V I can just run it without any modification .
I am hopeful that with these open source drivers I will have similar compatibility between Hyper - V , Xen and KVM .
That would be ideal , " he said .
KVM is the hypervisor technology that is already a part of the Linux kernel .
Wolf said one other pressing question is how fast Novell and Red Hat will backport the new Microsoft virtualization drivers to their distributions .
Greg Kroah - Hartman , the Linux driver project lead and a Novell fellow , said Novell wo n't hesitate .
" We will have to backport the driver to our enterprise kernel , and that will happen quickly .
One of our requirements to get code into our kernel is that it must be accepted upstream and it is now accepted upstream and we can backport it .
I do n't know a delivery date , " he said .
Microsoft 's open source driver technology will first appear in December as part of the 2.6.32 release of the kernel .
Wolf said another issue will be performance , specifically around the fact that Microsoft 's Hyper - V support for Linux guest operating systems allows only for a single virtual CPU .
" For some applications that run on Linux that is not going to be enough compute power , " he said .
" Microsoft would need to increase its support to multiple CPUs for Linux guests . "
Wolf said that while the issues are more of a platform , support and certification matter it is still an important point of clarity in grading out Microsoft 's driver submission to the Linux kernel .
" Microsoft needs this if they are going to be a serious platform for Linux guests , " he said .

A Guide To The Scientific Basis Of Vastu
Vastu is based on the premise that there are two kinds of energy that interact to produce a third energy .
The two energies are the positive and negative energies .
They combine to form the energy of life .
Positive and negative energies are all over the earth 's surface , constantly colliding .
When you build a structure in a certain place , the vibrations of these energies are disturbed .
They enter the structure and continue with their cosmic dance .
The problem with this is that these two energies are not equal .
Sometimes , you might have more of the positive than the negative energy , and vice - versa .
If you have more negative energy than positive , you will be unhappy in your home .
This is where vastu comes in .
Vastu helps to balance out the energies present in a structure with simple modifications .
The house is filled with more positive vibrations and you end up feeling much happier and healthier .
But is vastu a science ?
Yes it is .
Vastu principles are based on the theories of electromagnetism .
The amazing thing is that these principles were developed thousands of years before electromagnetism was discovered !
Apart from noise , water and air , electromagnetism is another pollutant in our environment .
None of us can really escape from it .
Vastu plays an important role by using space to decrease our exposure to this magnetism .
More space helps in reducing electromagnetism .
Emphasis is also placed on the different directions and the five main elements of earth , water , air , fire and sky .
The wise men in ancient times studied the movements of the sun and laid down very specific rules regarding the construction of any structure .
The eight directions - north , south , east , west , north - east , north - west , south - east and south - west , are very important in vastu .
The principles of vastu are also based on the balance of the five basic elements - earth , sky , water , fire and wind .
Earth symbolizes the stability of the mind and body .
Fire symbolizes energy .
Water symbolizes purity .
Air symbolizes movement and space represents creativity .
As modern researchers dug deep into the theory of the Unified Field of Natural Law , they found that vastu is in complete accordance with the Natural Law .
This Law is the intelligence that guides the evolution of every single atom in the universe .
It is the architect of all life in the universe .
Vastu is a natural extension of this Law .
It helps support Natural Law and enables you to have a better quality of life .
For example , every room in a house has its appropriate space .
It is important to have the different room of a house or office in the place that 's meant for it .
If this is not done , Natural Law is interfered with and you will be out of balance with the environment around you .
Vastu will not make all your problems disappear magically .
It will help you to deal with the problems better and come up with faster solutions .

Last week ’s announcement of World of Warcraft : The Magazine appears to have garnered interest and skepticism in equal regard .
Not surprisingly , much of it centers around the ongoing “ print vs online ” / “ print is dead ” type debates but most commentators seem to miss a significant point .
That one of the largest magazine publishers in the world is actively pursuing this experiment is surely in itself a tacit admission that traditional gaming magazines do not have a rosy future .
Arguing the toss over what this means for them could be said to be a bit redundant .
The bigger picture here is a quest to find a way to pay good writers to write about games , in a world where the ability and even need to do so is diminishing .
WoW : Magazine ’s experiment along these lines has its arguments for success as well as failure .
For me , the decline of print media has been a question of “ when , not if ” ever since I read Clay Shirky ’s excellent Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable .
I can only encourage you to take the time to read and digest it yourselves as I could n’t possibly hope to do it justice here .
In short though , Shirky ’s thrust is that upon accepting that print as an industry is visibly going to go away , the imperative is to preserve journalism , not the paper it ’s written on .
It makes increasingly less sense even to talk about a publishing industry , because the core problem publishing solves — the incredible difficulty , complexity , and expense of making something available to the public — has stopped being a problem .
Clay Shirky – Newspapers and Thinking the Unthinkable
Whilst the focus is clearly on newspapers , the parallels for games journalism and traditional magazine publishing are obvious .
Within that debate , many are keen to emphasis the “ strengths of print ” ( termed by former OXM US editor Dan Amrich as “ presentation , insight , access , tone “ ) but really these are irrelevant to the problem at hand .
The quote above encapsulates a fundamental truth that will still apply even when the gaming magazine , as we know it , is executed to it ’s maximum potential .
It can be said that the publishers already realise this as they increasingly choose not to leverage these “ strengths ” or pursue this ideal in their products .
For them it ’s no longer about the quality , it ’s about cutting costs in an attempt to garner a stay of execution .
There are no signs either that the few who attempt to buck this trend are reaping any rewards .
That Future declined the opportunity to reveal EDGE ’s recent circulation numbers , apparently also because of cost cutting , is damning .
Society does n’t need newspapers .
What we need is journalism .
For a century , the imperatives to strengthen journalism and to strengthen newspapers have been so tightly wound as to be indistinguishable .
That ’s been a fine accident to have , but when that accident stops , as it is stopping before our eyes , we ’re going to need lots of other ways to strengthen journalism instead .
As a growing and maturing industry , games need and deserve greater quality writing and more of it .
Regardless of what you think about print , right now the prospects of it expanding to meet this need are unlikely .
So where does it come from ?
The GameSpots , Kotakus and IGNs of this world , secure in the knowledge they are part of the future will naturally profess to have the answers .
Certainly , the strengths of print are perfectly transferable to their online world .
It is not the physical medium that gives words greater weight after all .
However , despite the fact that some of these online properties are past or nearing their tenth birthday ’s , they often choose not to live by these ideals either .
What struck me the most about Phaethon ’s Rest in Print – Gaming Journalism op ’ ed was how many of the same criticisms can be laid at the feet of some of the magazine ’s online equivalents .
Haughty , selfish , fearful , riddled with advertising ?
Print has exclusivity on none of these .
The fundamental conflict of interest between the ad funded online games mega sites and game publishers was ruthlessly exposed by the GameSpot / Gerstmann fiasco and subsequently well articulated upon by N’Gai Croal .
New media kids like Kotaku and Joystiq are more independent but they have their flaws , perhaps different ones , too .
The relentless drive to be “ first ” and consume traffic often comes at the expense of depth , due diligence , substantive investigation or indeed , a pause for thought .
The latter does n’t prevent them from being tardy ether .
If these news aggregators consider letting the news come to them and regurgitating PR into news snippets as a primary function then they are already way behind Twitter .
If the old model is broken , what will work in its place ? ”
The answer is : Nothing will work , but everything might .
Online media has it ’s place of course .
In pointing out some of the flaws I do n’t mean to detract from that or fail to acknowledge the many occasions where online really works to our benefit .
That a journalist of the caliber of Stephen Totilo works for Kotaku is brilliant and it would be folly to tar his work with too broad a brush .
If you want to read a sharp , to the point , catch - all news service you need look no further than Pat Garratt ’s VG247 .
What is clear though , is that collectively online is not always offering the superior product or fully replacing what we are losing with print media , at least not yet .
Until they do , every experiment is of interest , potentially viable and should be given a shot .
On the face of things , the team behind World of Warcraft : The Magazine make a good case for its success , mostly because it ’s sufficiently different from the traditional business model that came before it .
There are no advertisements , the print - on - demand format reduces printing costs to a minimum .
It ’s editor - in - chief ( the aforementioned Dan Amrich ) may be an impassioned defender of print but he ’s a smart guy who equally understands it ’s strengths and weaknesses .
No doubt , his experience at OXM , another official license , will stand him in good stead and allow them to leverage the exclusive access and content they will get to the fullest extent .
Pleasingly , there seems to be a drive for quality and as an idea it is n’t even without precedent .
CCP , of EVE
Online fame produce a similar quarterly offering .
The skeptics misgivings are not without foundation either mind .
Many point to the high up - front price ( $ 40 / € 35 / £ 30 per annum for 4 issues ) and lack of a news - stand presence as significant barriers to a substantial take up of the product .
Whilst World of Warcraft might have a headline subscriber base of over 11 m , over 50 % of them are in Asia and for the time being , WoW : Magazine will only be produced in English , French , German and Spanish .
Successful or not , it ’s difficult to see it ever reaching the Far East so there is a much smaller potential target audience than it might initially appear .
General opinion then on whether this is going to work would appear to be divided .
Having only briefly flirted with World of Warcraft , I do n’t know enough about this most online of communities to gauge it ’s potential interest either way but one can be assured that it ’s appeal to said community is exactly what it will live and die on .
EVE Online is therefore an interesting comparison .
Any game which can produce stories like this and essentially support an entire espionage industry outside of itself is ripe for the production of a large amount of quality in - depth material covering it .
The difference with EVE however , is that their EON ’s magazine is largely produced by it ’s community and not published by a company who ’s primary interest is selling magazines .
This distinction may be key .
EVE ’s offering did n’t have to compete with and win over an incumbent community nor support a separate business paying it ’s employees to produce the content .
EON has a much lower number of potential subscribers ( around 300,000 play EVE online ) but arguably less constraints too .
Perhaps our opinion can be informed a little more if we consider whether this model is applicable to other games .
It ’s less helpful to everybody else if it turns out that WoW : Magazine is simply a special case .
Future were quick to point out their focus was on making this experiment work first and subsequently almost as quick to reveal they are “ open ” to other opportunities should they exist , the very next day .
Undeniably , it ’s on their agenda so for arguments sake , lets suppose they have a short - list of viable IP ’s to try this with .
What would be the odds that Halo might be on it ?
With 10 m or so copies of Halo 3 sold and still attracting over 1 m unique players a day .
A rich and deep universe , ( maybe a much smaller scale than WoW but with no less a fanatical following ) .
On the surface at least , is seems to fit .
Would a Halo : Magazine venture succeed ?
Knowing a bit more about Halo , than either of the two MMO ’s , I ’m going to suggest that it would not .
Like EVE , the definitive resource for the Halo community is …the Halo community itself .
Bungie have supported and nurtured what they term as their “ Seventh column ” long before job titles like “ Community manager ” were common place in the gaming industry .
Bungie.net is the bristling hub of it all that would never likely be undermined and the depth of content on fan sites such as Halo .
Bungie .
Org , Rampancy .
Net and Ascendant Justice would be just as intimidating to anybody coming into this space , online or off .
Even Microsoft ’s forthcoming official Halo “ destination ” , Halo Waypoint will have work to do to establish itself in this environment .
It ’s not just magazines that will face such problems either .
By way of example , take the recent internet bluster about Gearbox supposedly making Halo 4 .
Halo fans at HBO or NeoGAF barely batted an eyelid , they had seen it before and worked it out already .
Somewhat agitated by the games media continuing to recycle old information we even threw up a post ourselves , attempting to bring some reasonable analysis of the evidence to the party .
A short while later , the speculation was officially debunked via Twitter .
Community moves on , we updated our post accordingly and that you would think would be that but the games media carried on oblivious for a good few hours .
When they did eventually catch up , some of them still could n’t get their facts right even when it was corrected in their comments !
( Bonus point if you can spot it ) .
This is a relatively small beans example but clearly demonstrates a community trumping the “ professional ” media .
None of this is complicated , the conjecture we posted does not make us geniuses or “ journalists ” but hey , there was at least bit of research and thought put into it .
More importantly though , paying attention to an official source you would think should just be basic stuff .
Surely it ’s the job of the Kotakus and Joystiqs to be absolutely all over it , why are n’t they ?
Stories like this for me , give a glimpse of where the future really lies .
In a series of articles on MCV , Colin Campbell articulates it into words much better than I can .
That his motivation is clearly his new business and the marketing opportunities it may create should not be ignored but it does not invalidate what he is saying when calling for more games websites ;-
But I am not so sure we really need to pay hundreds of people to tell us if such - and - such a game is worth playing , or how development is going on project X or the ten best games featuring gardening implements .
People can , and do offer up this service for free , and often , with every bit as much ability as the professionals .
The number of journalists being paid by large media organizations to write about games is going to drop significantly in the next few years , while the number of people writing about games – for free or under new revenue models – is going to explode .
More so than a magazine or a link blog that chases traffic , you and the network are the future and this applies to everyone ; consumers , developers , publishers and the Major Nelson ’s of this world equally .
It ’s about “ people and voices ” and the value comes from the conversations that arise .
That some of the voices in the conversation are marketers or just plain noise is acknowledged and understood .
The more voices that there are , the better we can filter it , the healthier things will be .
The communities of Halo and EVE are finding less of a need for the traditional games media , online or off with every passing day .
How much of what continued interest there is can be pinned down to content still being kept embargoed under an ‘ exclusive ’ lock and key ?
What would happen if all that went away ?
A real example of this exists right now , the iPhone ; -
My favourite games machine right now is my iPhone .
The three games I ’ve played the most this year have been Rolando , FlightControl and Drop7 .
I found out about all three via iTunes or from social media ; blogs , Twitter , Facebook .
Not one of the recommendations came from some third - party dude being paid to communicate with me ; some fellow I had paid , via a magazine subscription , for their pearls of advice .
i Phone games , like all games of the near - future , are distributed digitally .
There is no iPhone games magazine nor , so far as I know , any commercial websites making vast profits from iPhone game advertising .
Of course , Campbell is n’t suggesting that we do n’t need a games media or games journalists at all , just that in the future , we ’ll need less of them and should think what we actually need them to write about and how we ’re going to enable that .
Unless the publishers of WoW : Magazine are purely concerned with making it a physical thing , whether it ’s on print or not is a side issue .
Perhaps what they really need to be asking themselves is what role will it play that could not be fulfilled by the community itself ?
Where are they adding something that could not be produced as a result of a conversation between Blizzard and it ’s users ?
Questions left that do not yet have definitive answers ,
Shirky offers the best we have right now “ We do n’t know , nobody knows . ”
Maybe that ’s what experiments like World of Warcraft : The Magazine are destined to find out .
By : Peter Chamberlin
Have we really become “ We the sheeple , ” or are we still human beings ?
The planet is dying under the thrall of a small minority of men who think of the rest of the human race as “ cattle , ” livestock for them to buy and sell .
The ruling class behaves much like a spoiled child , if they do n’t get to have everything their way all of the time , they throw this massive temper tantrum and threaten to upset the whole game .
They have gotten their way in everything for so long that they have fallen under the spell of their own propaganda .
They believe that we are sub - human animals , who should be herded into the best outcome possible .
But , have the rest of us begun to accept this as well ?
As members of the human herd , most of us recoil at the bovine suggestion , but consider just how much we do behave like a herd .
We willingly accept being treated like a herd , trusting our lives to politicians because we appreciate not having to make hard decisions for ourselves , being contented as cows , as our leaders and their hired hands drive us down a path to destruction , for the sake of them making a few dollars more in profit .
Preserving profits for the ruling elite is the only motivation ( other than media - manipulated patriotism and nationalism ) compelling us to fight our resource wars in Asia and Africa .
The leaders of the entire world pretend that we are there to fight against terrorism , even though they know that the terrorism comes with us , their hope being their own little “ piece of the action . ”
The American way is to wage war with dollars , as well as bombs .
What the hell is the matter with people ?
Has everyone so bought - in to the propaganda that leads them to their own deaths that they believe the lies that control us ?
Willfully following sell - out leaders , who are leading their own countries to death and slavery is more than merely suicidal , it ’s something a dumb animal would do .
Does the herd even think of itself as human anymore ?
Would it really matter what the herd thought about anything , anyway ?
Nothing will change as long as we willingly accept this idiocy .
We have not changed .
We are still human beings .
Our feelings and concerns for ourselves , our families and our friends are legitimate , and just as real and as valid as those shared by the ruling class elitists who send our sons and daughters into battle to control the gas and oil , just like everyone who is being targeted by our government as it sends forth Special Forces and their “ Islamist ” counterparts to kill , not in the name of freedom , but to seize unfair economic advantage !
The entire “ conflict ” within the “ arc of crisis ” that is schemed over by Brzezinski and friends is manufactured for our entertainment and distraction .
It is foolishness to look at “ militant Islamists ” and the CIA Special Forces teams who are sent in to fight them as two separate entities , without realizing that they are one and the same .
In Central Asia , the scary “ Islamists ” appear , as if by magic , wherever the oil companies have an interest .
Theories are floated that the sudden rush of militant extremists in western China and the former countries of the Soviet Union is explained as an unfortunate by - product of Pakistan ’s anti-Taliban offensive , as militants trained in Pakistan ’s FATA Region return to their native countries .
From Russia to China and southwards , attacks begin in targeted nations and then someone appears in the national media to warn of the “ Islamist ” threat .
News stories begin to appear of running gun battles and explosions , linking all of them to the “ militant ” threat .
Attacks are made upon adversaries of the United States and those countries then become blacklisted as unstable for development and the subservient , media dutifully reports that our enemies have been attacked by our other enemies .
Whose interests does this serve — crazy militants , with their warped dreams of a “ caliphate , ” or American oil companies , who are trying to undermine China , Iran and Russia ?
The “ powers that be ” are playing a very dangerous game with all of our lives .
How long will the countries targeted by American / Islamist limited warfare continue to tolerate this bold assault ?
China , in particular , is presently bound by the economic chains that have been forged with the United States .
How much longer will it continue to abide provocations in Xinjiang and other Chinese interests from Central Asia , to Pakistan , to Africa ?
It would be extremely unprofitable right now for China to haul the United States before the UN Security Council or to take military actions in retaliation for this low - intensity war that has been waged upon them .
But that will not always be true .
When the American house of cards finishes collapsing all bets will be off .
Our new administration in Washington has been empowered with a mandate for change , yet the only change that they have opted for is to accelerate the plans for world conquest in Central Asia .
The only real impediment to that plan is the American people .
Will the people continue to tolerate Obama ’s impersonation of Bush and allow this obscene escalation of the neocon wars ?
The ruling class fears an aware , vigilant majority .
They know the people ’s power and they tremble before it .
It is only the people themselves , the “ sheeple , ” who fail to realize the awesome powers delegated into our hands .
It upsets the self - appointed whenever anyone begins to regain any measure of that control back , depriving the secret rulers of their illegitimate power to dictate the terms of our lives .
The worst thing of all for them would be if all people everywhere were suddenly allowed to start thinking for themselves , with everyone making their own decisions .
The human race finds itself in an extremely unusual dilemma ; if the best - laid plans of mankind ’s finest minds succeed , then humanity may cease to exist .
If the plan that has been crafted by the finest minds , financed by the world ’s greatest “ benefactors ” and supported by nearly every government on the face of the planet , succeeds , then “ humankind ” may cease to exist , to be replaced by a new master - race parasitic species and its new sub - human host species ( the living remainder of the “ useless eaters ” ) .
A great moment of crisis has been manufactured for us .
The decisions that have been made have maneuvered us into a kill box , so that the harvesting of the “ useless eaters ” may begin .
If mankind as a whole cannot embrace a new benevolent identity and move forward together , then , thanks to our enslavement to technological advancements , our old malevolent identities are positioned to destroy all life on this planet .
A decision to change must be made on a societal level .
The world cannot change , humanity cannot evolve to the next level , until someone leads the way .
The self - appointed leadership of the “ free world ” has to either lead the way or get out of the path of others who understand the path to mankind ’s salvation .
The way of force must be replaced by the path of cooperation .
This is not a direction that is presently coming from the United States ; it is entirely an Asian phenomenon .
The Western Darwinian world of domination by the strongest has brought us to the point of economic collapse and unimaginable humanitarian catastrophe .
The rulers of this old order have one solution to all problems — more force , the closed fist .
There is a better way .
Wherever the models of supply and governance are breaking - down , force is the immediate solution , the only solution offered .
If all the people cannot be fed , then obviously ( only to inhuman thinkers ) there must be too many people , therefore , we must thin - out the herd of “ useless eaters ” ( non-productive members of society ) .
Simply helping the people in need would not be “ profitable . ”
It is common belief that the United States , as the leader of the developing world , must have more energy and other strategic resources available to it than the rest of the world , therefore , we are justified in moving those resources out of the Middle East and Central Asia into our hands , whatever is required to do so ( taking by force ) .
Likewise , in domestic policies such as health care and education reform , it is “ wasteful ” of limited resources to supply high - dollar medical treatments to those patients whose health will never improve , or expensive educations to students who are less than “ exceptional . ”
The way of force embraces such cost - cutting ideas as “ Reaganomics ” , depicting them as moral choices , for ensuring that limited funds are not “ wasted ” on life - supporting treatments for the terminally ill , or on educational opportunities for mediocre students ( those should be wasted on the ignorant cousins of the elite ) .
This is the thinking of the old order that has put us in our current dilemma .
The “ selfish man ” having his way when he really should n’t , has created a real threat to all mankind .
The selfish must give way to the needs of the entire community .
A new generation of selfless leaders is arising to meet the challenges posed by the dying order .
Where “ selfish man ” cannot conceive of anything but a profit - based international order , “ new man ” cannot accept thinking that does not contain a human element , a compassionate , merciful direction .
The old malevolent thinking is violence based , whereas new man cannot conceive of killing his fellow man .
Selfless leaders of the humanity movement have great difficulty in understanding the thinking of the heartless corporate extortionists .
There is a basic disconnect between the thinking of the old man and the “ new man ” who is rising - up amongst them .
This gives the new man the advantage , if he can only take advantage of it .
This brings the situation down to where we witness a rising minority of “ new men ” facing - off against an entrenched , persevering minority of the super - wealthy , who are perhaps even more dedicated to preserving their old selfish order over mankind , whatever the potential costs .
The leadership of the rising humanitarian order is trying every reasonable means at its disposal to overturn the old order , while the leadership of the house of profit is using every means in its limitless bag of tricks to destroy the threat .
Through economic and military coercion the United States has persuaded the world into allowing it almost free rein in shaping international institutions and the ideas that are acceptable to world opinion .
We have created an illusory image of ourselves which hides American war crimes and crimes against humanity behind a hypocritical mask of humanitarianism and “ foreign aid . ”
Membership in America ’s club requires a sell - out of their countrymen from the leaders of the nations that are seeking our “ aid packages ” or entrance into our economic system .
The sell - out is to embrace our manufactured image , blinding themselves to the reality that our leaders create .
The real image of America , one of double - dealings and secret wars , is hidden from the world by common consent .
The pay - off for these leaders is the personal fortunes that each of them has acquired and gained notoriety for in their home countries .
By letting Americans determine which words and opinions are “ politically correct ” in acceptable discussion in the media , crimes are hidden and false realities become the foundation of public debate .
In this way , internal debate bends to accommodate the false American reality .
This American power to simultaneously bully and seduce their way in the world , extending into the basic rights of the Nations involved , has allowed our inept leaders to force upon the world the situation we face today .
Further bullying and super - scheming by Obama and Brzezinski will not achieve American objectives of total power .
Another way must be found .
It is only a matter of time before America is taken out of the world ’s way .
It is inevitable that the world will embrace the way of international cooperation , over the American way of secret and open conquests .
The only alternative to a world centered on meeting its own needs is the present course we are trapped on , one wherein the victor claims all the spoils of war .
That world cannot be attained within our technological environment ( do the math ) .
Nature will continue , either with us , or in spite of us .
The world needs a life - changing moment , one that will force all thinking humans to make life - changing decisions , so that we can all emerge from it as a different people , new men and women .
Everything is now black and white , not black or white , as it seemingly should be .
The way forward is for each of us to begin to see both sides , or all sides , of contentious issues .
Life has conditioned us to divide everything new into categories , based on determinants of fear , greed , or other motivators .
We have to understand that these are the motivators of children , or animals , not adult human beings .
There are so many simple solutions to be found by those without blinders , with two eyes to see .
The world will solve its problems and go on , as long as we do n’t prevent that from happening .
The question of whether we will continue to seek to force the world to accept American domination , or if we will learn to play well with others , will determine whether or not we are accepted into the new order that is now emerging in Asia and beyond .
The energy supplies and other natural resources that are being fought over will be moved to markets , no matter what .
Fighting to claim them , or to keep others from obtaining them , is a backwards policy , meant to enrich the few at the sake of the many .
All of this will change .
Whether or not this Nation will be part of the new world alliance is a question that each of us must answer .
Will we passively allow the United States to perish from the face of the earth or develop into the full - blown pariah nation that have been becoming ( that we will deserve for impeding the advancement of the human race ) , or will we stop the madness and deception by altering our leaders ’ commitment to their present path ?
Or , will we interfere with their petty plans ?
Barack Obama has a very clear choice to make , whether he is going to be remembered as humanity ’s emancipator from war or as history ’s last tyrant ?
Obama has to decide what means more to him , pursuing a path that will engender hope in the entire human race , or pursuing his own ambition .
Will he take a stand for freedom and human decency by ending all of our wars right now , with the stroke of a pen , or will he continue to drag us down the path of total war in Central Asia , the path that we were bound to by the former tyrants , Bush and Cheney ?

A followup on this earlier BB post about the wacko blog and gadget hallucinations of kidnapper / rapist ( now also a murder suspect ) Phillip Garrido .
Weighing in on that post , an astute BB commenter noticed that if you do a Google Maps search for 1554 Walnut Avenue , Antioch , CA — the address of the Antioch home where Garrido detained Jaycee Dugard ( and her children , fathered by rape ) — you can see an overhead view of all the tents , tarps and sheds that Garrido's parole officer (s ) and local police were too incompetent to bother checking , despite the fact that the guy was a convicted rapist .
The overhead view in Google Maps has since been widely reported and blogged , so that 's old news 4 days later .
But not this .
Check out what another commenter noticed .
When you 're at that address in Google Maps , switch over to Street View mode .
You 'll see something chilling .
Right in the 1554 Walnut Avenue driveway , you see a beat - up van with a rusty , trashed exterior , and what looks like a man behind the steering wheel .
Follow the van .
Pull your POV out of that driveway , moving away on Walnut toward Bown , and look backwards toward the house on Street View .
For what I think is , like , 6 blocks or more , that guy in that van is following the black Google VW with cameras mounted on it .
Was that Garrido in the van ?
Is it possible he saw the Google van with all the gear on top , freaked out about being surveilled , and followed it for a while with interest and fear ?
Maybe , maybe not .
IANALEO ( I am not a law enforcement officer ) so I do n't know .
Maybe I 'm imagining this , and I probably need to stop obsessing about this story .
But it 's the creepiest thing I 've ever seen on Google Street View .
Photos :
Here 's the Flickr set I created of the sequence within Google Maps .
The final shot , before the van veers away , is at the top of this post .

Forget about the birthers , and the nutty claims that Barack Obama was not born in the United States .
More and more , we are hearing from people who might best be described as anti-birthers .
Their claims have nothing to do with long - versus short - form Hawaiian birth certificates .

So you decided to try out Windows 7 ’s Release Candidate and you ’re already dreading the day it expires and you have to format your computer and start fresh .
You were probably disappointed to hear that you could n’t upgrade your Release Candidate to the full Windows 7 version once it came out .
Thankfully , you were being lied to .
There is only one thing stopping you from upgrading to the Release to Manufacturer version of Windows 7 , and it is a mere text file .
That ’s right , you wo n’t need to bust ouf the hex editor or download any cracks to get this working .
Start off by extracting your ISO to a folder .
Once that is done go into the sources folder and look for a file named cversion .ini .
Open up this file and you should see the following :
[ HostBuild ] MinClient=7233.0 MinServer=7100.0
Now edit the value for MinClient so that it is slightly less than what build you are currently running .
You can determine your build number by looking at the bottom right corner of your desktop .
So for example if you are running build 7100 you could set this to 7000.0 or lower .
I have not tried this upgrade procedure with the earier Beta builds but as far as I am aware it will work as well .
Unfortunately I was not aware of this method several weeks ago when I moved from Beta 2 to the Release Candidate .
After editing the file , simply save it then either burn it to a DVD , or run setup.exe right from the folder to begin your upgrade process .
If all goes well , you should be greeted with the following screen :
No More ’50s and ’ 60s
Few economists expect the country to return to the relatively flat income distribution of the 1950s and 1960s .
Indeed , they say that inequality is likely to remain significantly greater than it was for most of the 20th century .
The Obama administration has not proposed completely rewriting the rules for Wall Street or raising the top income - tax rate to anywhere near 70 percent , its level as recently as 1980 .
Market forces that have increased inequality , like globalization , are also not going away .
But economists say that the rich will probably not recover their losses immediately , as they did in the wake of the dot - com crash earlier this decade .
That quick recovery came courtesy of a new bubble in stocks , which in 2007 were more expensive by some measures than they had been at any other point save the bull markets of the 1920s or 1990s .
This time , analysts say , Wall Street seems unlikely to return soon to the extreme levels of borrowing that made such a bubble possible .
Any major shift in the financial status of the rich could have big implications .
A drop in their income and wealth would complicate life for elite universities , museums and other institutions that received lavish donations in recent decades .
Governments — federal and state — could struggle , too , because they rely heavily on the taxes paid by the affluent .
Perhaps the broadest question is what a hit to the wealthy would mean for the middle class and the poor .
The best - known data on the rich comes from an analysis of Internal Revenue Service returns by Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez , two economists .
Their work shows that in the late 1970s , the cutoff to qualify for the highest - earning one ten - thousandth of households was roughly $ 2 million , in inflation - adjusted , pretax terms .
By 2007 , it had jumped to $ 11.5 million .
The gains for the merely affluent were also big , if not quite huge .
The cutoff to be in the top 1 percent doubled since the late 1970s , to roughly $ 400,000 .
By contrast , pay at the median — which was about $ 50,000 in 2007 — rose less than 20 percent , census data shows .
Near the bottom of the income distribution , the increase was about 12 percent .
Some economists say they believe that the contrasting trends are unrelated .
If anything , these economists say , any problems the wealthy have will trickle down , in the form of less charitable giving and less consumer spending .
Over the last century , the worst years for the rich were the early 1930s , the heart of the Great Depression .

* Deadliest day in Iraq this year
* Follows U.S. troop withdrawal from urban centres
* Iraqi security forces acknowledge negligence
( Adds U.S. State Department , paragraph 18 ) By Aseel Kami and Suadad al - Salhy
BAGHDAD , Aug 19 ( Reuters ) - A series of blasts in Baghdad killed 95 people and wounded 536 in Iraq 's bloodiest day this year , prompting a rare admission of culpability from Iraqi security forces struggling to cope without U.S. help .
At least six blasts struck near government ministries and other targets at the heart of Iraq 's Shi'ite - led administration , weeks after U.S. combat troops withdrew from urban centres in June , thrusting Iraq 's security forces into the lead role .
" We must face the facts .
We must admit our mistakes , just as we celebrate our victories , " Defence Ministry spokesman Major General Mohammed al - Askari told a group of U.S. and Iraqi military officials on Wednesday through an interpreter .
His comments echoed earlier remarks by Baghdad 's security spokesman , Major General Qassim al - Moussawi .
" This operation shows negligence , and is considered a security breach for which Iraqi forces must take most of the blame , " Moussawi told Iraqiya state television .
The sectarian war that savaged Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion has abated and Iraq celebrated the restoration of its sovereignty in June when U.S. troops withdrew from cities .
The government this month ordered most blast walls in Baghdad to be removed within 40 days , a sign of faith in its troops and police before a national election in January .
But Wednesday 's coordinated attacks on heavily guarded targets shattered a growing sense of optimism about Iraq 's stability .
In one blast , a massive truck bomb close to a checkpoint for the heavily fortified Green Zone blew out the windows of the foreign ministry .
Dozens were mown down in a blizzard of glass .
" The windows of the foreign ministry shattered , slaughtering the people inside .
I could see ministry workers , journalists and security guards among the dead , " said a distraught ministry employee who gave her name as Asia .
SECURITY REVIEW
The explosion was powerful enough to blow in some windows of Iraq 's parliament building in the Green Zone .
The attacks could undermine confidence in Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki before the parliamentary election , and could also deter foreign investors , especially oil companies , which might have started to think of Iraq as a place to put their money .
Maliki called an emergency meeting to reevaluate the defence of Baghdad .
He said in a statement that the attacks were aimed at " raising doubts about our armed forces , which have proven themselves very capable of confronting terrorists " .
Analysts and members of the public disagreed .
" Today 's attacks reveal a major deficiency and weakness of the security forces .
They were organised and huge , " said analyst Hameed Fadhel of Baghdad University .
Baghdad 's normally busy streets emptied , and the few people still outside poured scorn on the security forces .
" The security forces do n't provide security , they just cause traffic , " labourer Haythem Adil said .
No group claimed responsibility , but Moussawi said two members of al Qaeda were arrested when another car bomb was intercepted .
Iraqi television later showed a truck loaded with water tanks stuffed with explosives that had been disarmed .
U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly in Washington said past coordinated incidents bore the " hallmark " of al Qaeda .
" But I do n't have any hard information by way of al Qaeda , " he said .
Sunni Islamist groups like al Qaeda consider Shi'ites heretics , and have been blamed for a series of blasts in the last two months at mostly Shi'ite venues like mosques , both in the capital and in northern Iraq .
Iraqi politicians and other officials have accused neighbouring states , including Saudi Arabia , Iran and Syria , of fomenting violence in Iraq .
Analysts say that could be a ploy to distract attention from domestic failings .
POWERFUL BLAST
The second truck bomb in Baghdad 's Waziriya district close to the finance ministry killed at least 28 people and caused huge destruction .
Part of a raised highway nearby collapsed .
" Suddenly a powerful blast shook the building and glass flew ...
Most employees were wounded by the flying glass and others , including myself , suffered concussion ...
I awoke with blood all over my face , " said ministry worker Batoul al - Amri .
Another explosion was close enough to Reuters ' offices in central Baghdad 's Karrada district to burst open windows and doors .
Columns of smoke could be seen rising from several sites .
The Baghdad provincial government building came under mortar attack , police said , as did the Salhiya district in central Baghdad , home to army bases and a television station .
At least one suspected mortar round landed near the United Nations compound in the Green Zone , startling U.N. workers marking the sixth anniversary of the destruction of their previous Baghdad headquarters by a truck bomb which killed envoy Sergio Vieira de Mello and other staff , U.N. guards said .
The U.S. military said it had no reports of mortar fire .
In Bayaa , in southern Baghdad , a blast killed two people .

The extraordinary story of how Peru's Indians and English priest Brother Paul are fighting to the death to protect their way of life and their rainforest
Usain Bolt , sprinter from Jamaica , currently holds the world record in the 100 meter sprint with a time of 9.69 seconds .
Whenever new records are set , people ask ' what is the limit on human performance ?
' So how fast can a human run ?
Two econometricians from Tilburg University in the Netherlands , Professor of Statistics John Einmahl and former student Sander Smeets , say have calculated the ultimate records for the 100 - meter sprint .
The good news ; there is still room for improvement in both the men's and women 's times in the near future .
They used extreme value theory to calculate by how much the current records for the 100 meter sprint could be improved .
Extreme - value theory is a sub-sector of statistics , which tries to answer questions about extreme events ( which by definition are uncommon ) , using information about less extreme events .
The theory is normally applied within the financial and insurance world to estimate the risk of extreme damage resulting from storms , earthquakes or the bursting of a dyke , for example , in order to calculate premiums .
With a little modification , they say it can apply to sports as well .
Einmahl and Smeets analyzed the records of 762 male and 479 female athletes .
Each athlete was listed once , and the times were recorded between January 1991 and June 2008 .
Times run before 1991 were discounted on account of the inadequate doping controls before this date .
The men's times varied between 9.72 and 10.30 seconds , and the women 's from 10.65 to 11.38 .
According to Smeets and Einmahl , , which knocks 0.18 seconds off Usain Bolt 's current world record .
For female 100 m sprinters , another 0.16 seconds can be knocked off the 10.49 run by Florence Griffith - Joyner , which would mean a time of 10.33 .
In a more cautious estimate ( with a 95 % confidence interval ) , the predicted times are 9.21 for the men and 9.88 for the women .
Sander Smeets studied Finance and Actuarial Sciences at Tilburg University and now works as a junior actuary at AZL , in Heerlen .
John Einmahl is Professor of Statistics at Tilburg University .

Favre 's a Selfish Jerk
CLICK TO REACT
I know they 'll never say it on the record so I 'll say it for Tarvaris Jackson and Sage Rosenfels : Brett Favre is a jackass .
I do n't know Brett .
I 've never met him .
But what he 's shown us over the last year and change leads me to believe Brett 's a selfish - jerk .
All of his " I 'm retired .
Wait , I still wanna play .
I quit .
I 'm gonna come back .
I 'm finished .
I 'm having surgery .
I 'm done .
Psych , I 'm back . " is BS .
If Brett really wanted to play he should 've been on the field working with his teammates like the rest of the guys in the league .
But no , Brett believes he 's bigger than the NFL so he can do what he wants when he wants .
How else do you explain his behavior ?
Without question Favre 's resume is better than that of Tarvaris Jackson and Sage Rosenfels combined , but Jackson and Rosenfels are n't jerking their team around .
They 've been in camp , training and building with their receivers .
They 've acted like teammates while the Favre talk has swirled around them .
Meanwhile , Brett 's treating the NFL like the PGA .
He wants to play one week , take a week off .
He 'll tune - up for the majors ( The games against the Packers . ) , and do what he feels is best for Brett Favre .
Super Bowls are not won this way .
A couple of Jets players complained at the end of last season about Favre being a bad teammate .
Brett 's flip - flopping , last - minute decision in Minnesota probably has his new teammates torn on his return .
I spoke to Adrian Peterson a few weeks before camp opened and asked him how he would feel if the Vikes brought in a famous running back to take his spot when he 's already holding down the position .
Purple Jesus said " If I was holding it down , it would bother me . "
The tone in his voice implied that the position was up for grabs in his mind .
I wonder if he feels that way now that the Vikings have gone through training camp and two - a - days while Favre was hanging out with high school kids in Mississippi .
Back in 1993 the 49ers traded Joe Montana to the Kansas City Chiefs to clear the way for Steve Young to take over the team .
The decision might 've pissed off Montana , but he did n't try to work his way to St. Louis or Arizona so he could face the ' Niners twice a season .
He sucked it up and took the Chiefs to the playoffs , and now we remember Joe as a ' Niner , and as the greatest QB of all - time .
Brett should 've studied Joe .

Assessing the effect of different programming languages and programming styles on programmer productivity is of critical interest .
In his paper , Gilles Dubochet , describes how he investigated two aspects of programming style using eye movement tracking .
He found that it is , on average , 30 % faster to comprehend algorithms that use for - comprehensions and maps , as in Scala , rather than those with the iterative while - loops of Java .
Interestingly , he also finds that for within small scopes , 2 to 16 lines of code , there is no advantage to having intermediate variables with " comprehensible " or " meaningful " names :
Dense code with no such names , using arbitrary short names , is just as good .
There is a well established understanding that moving from assembler level languages to languages offering higher levels of abstraction results in significant gains in productivity , described , for example , in an empirical comparison of languages by Lutz Prechelt .
Gilles finding , that subjects take a constant time per token read , suggests that a significant part of this gain should be attributed to language conciseness .
Experience with Scala shows that it typically takes one half to one third of the lines of code to express the same application as Java yet executes at about the same speed .
From the research it also appears that Scala better matches the way programmers think , and it seems to be a view supported by experienced Scala programmers too .
Alex McGuire , who writes mission critical projects in Scala for power trading companies , says of Scala " The conciseness means I can see more of a program on one screen .
You can get a much better overview .
When I have some mathematical model to write with Java I have to keep two models in my head , the mathematical model itself and the second a model of how to implement it in Java .
With Scala one model , the mathematical one , will do .
Much more productive . ”
With more work , like that of Gilles , the influence of programming style and language design may become more quantifiable .
Gilles Dubochet presented the paper “ Computer Code as a Medium for Human Communication : Are Programming Languages Improving ? ” at the 21st Annual Psychology of Programming Interest Group Conference , Limerick , Ireland , June 24 - 26 , 2009 .

Pour la première fois de son histoire , le monde développé va devoir renoncer pour partie à une avancée médicale majeure .
La production internationale de molybdène 99 ( 99 Mo ) , un radio - isotope utilisé dans 80 % des procédures de diagnostic de médecine nucléaire - en cardiologie et en cancérologie - est au bord du chaos .
Sur les cinq réacteurs dans le monde fournissant le 99Mo nécessaire à 35 millions d'examens chaque année , le principal est à l'agonie : le réacteur canadien NRU , entré en service en 1957 , qui assurait à lui seul 45 % de la production mondiale , est à l'arrêt jusqu 'au printemps 2010 à cause d'une fuite - mais il se murmure que , trop corrodé , il pourrait ne jamais reprendre du service .
Le réacteur HFR de Petten , aux Pays - Bas , n'est guère mieux loti .
Stoppé pendant un mois pour maintenance en juillet , il a redémarré le 18 août , au grand soulagement des autorités sanitaires européennes .
Il produit 31 % du 99 Mo utilisé dans le monde et assure 73 % des doses issues d'Europe .
Mais le répit ne sera que de courte durée , car il doit subir de lourds travaux de près de six mois à compter du 1er mars 2010 .
Kevin Charlton , responsable commercial de ce réacteur entré en service en 1961 , convient qu'" il y a toujours un risque de retard " lors de telles opérations .
En France , le réacteur Osiris , exploité par le Commissariat à l'énergie atomique ( CEA ) à Saclay ( Essonne ) , est actuellement à l'arrêt pour cinq mois de maintenance .
En service depuis 1966 , il devra à nouveau subir cinq mois de travaux en 2010 , s'il veut obtenir l'autorisation de poursuivre ses activités jusqu 'en 2015 .
Osiris ne représente que 5 % de la production mondiale , mais désormais , chaque curie - unité de mesure de la radioactivité - compte .
Restent un réacteur en Belgique , un autre en Afrique du Sud , qui ne peuvent assumer qu'au mieux 20 % des besoins mondiaux , même avec le secours d'un sixième réacteur australien , dont l'entrée en production est imminente .
" Nous sommes clairement dans une crise dont l'issue dépendra des capacités à réparer ces réacteurs et , au - delà , à décider d'investissements économiques viables " , constate Thierry Dujardin , directeur adjoint de l'Agence de l'OCDE pour l'énergie atomique ( AEN ) .
Cette " crise des isotopes " couvait en fait depuis plus d'un an .
Depuis que le Canada a annoncé , en mai 2008 , avoir renoncé à achever les deux réacteurs Maple qui devaient assurer 80 % des besoins mondiaux .
Pour des raisons encore obscures , leur comportement s'est en effet révélé trop instable .
Qu'importe , avaient indiqué les autorités canadiennes , le HFR pourra être prolongé - jusqu'à ce qu'elles soient vite démenties par des pannes toujours plus préoccupantes .
" FLUX TENDU "
Pour comprendre la fragilité de la sécurité de l'approvisionnement mondial , un petit rappel scientifique s'impose .
Les radio - isotopes sont des atomes dont le noyau est instable .
Ils émettent des rayonnements , précieux en imagerie médicale , ou pour détruire des tissus cancéreux ciblés .
Mais pour éviter qu'ils ne lèsent les tissus sains , il faut employer des radioéléments à courte durée de vie , dont la radioactivité décroît rapidement .
C'est le cas du technétium 99 m ( radioactivité diminuée de moitié en 6 heures ) , issu du 99Mo ( 2,75 jours de demi-vie ) , lui - même obtenu à partir de cibles d'uranium hautement enrichi disposées dans les réacteurs de recherche .
Cette décroissance radioactive impose des délais très serrés , une logistique sans faille entre le réacteur , les usines d'extraction du molybdène , les générateurs du technétium finalement livré aux centres de médecine nucléaire .
" C'est du flux tendu : une journée perdue , c'est 20 % du produit qui disparaît " , souligne Alain Alberman , responsable des irradiations au CEA Saclay .
Le corollaire , c'est qu'on ne peut stocker ces produits en vue des périodes de disette .
Il est donc impératif de coordonner la production .
Un objectif auquel s'emploie une association des producteurs d'isotopes médicaux basée à Bruxelles , l'AIPES .
" La crise est en passe de devenir une maladie chronique " , reconnaît son directeur général , Jean - Pierre Cabocel .
Ces efforts de coordination butent parfois sur le secret des accords commerciaux .
Et la loi de l'offre et de la demande a conduit à " une multiplication du prix du molybdène depuis le début de la crise " , constate Olivier Legrain , président de la médecine nucléaire chez IBA Cisbio , une des rares entreprises transformatrices du 99Mo en radiopharmaceutique .
Les Etats - Unis , qui n'ont pas de moyens propres de production , mais représentent 50 % du marché mondial , commencent aussi à souffrir de la pénurie .
Ils ont pourtant des arguments de négociation : ce sont eux qui fournissent les quelque 30 kg d'uranium hautement enrichi , de qualité militaire , qui servent de matière première à l'essentiel de la production .
En France , l'Agence de sécurité sanitaire des produits de santé ( Afssaps ) veille à ce qu'un seuil minimal de 30 % des besoins des 220 centres de médecine nucléaire reste couvert à tout moment .
" Nous avons défini six indications essentielles pour lesquelles il n'y a pas de solution de remplacement " , indique Philippe Lechat , directeur de l'évaluation des médicaments de l'agence .
Il précise que les activités de traitement , ne nécessitant que très peu de produit , ne sont pas menacées .
En revanche , pour l'imagerie , les épisodes de pénurie récents ont été " gênants " , souligne Etienne Garin , chef de service du centre Eugène - Marquis à Rennes .
S'ils devaient se prolonger , dit -il , " nous serions mis en difficulté pour des examens pour lesquels il n'y a pas de substituts satisfaisants " .
Dans le cancer des os , par exemple , le scanner est moins performant que la scintigraphie .
Que faire ?
Plusieurs réacteurs pourraient venir à la rescousse , en Pologne , en Allemagne , en Egypte ou encore en Russie .
Mais il faudra plusieurs années avant qu'ils entrent en production , à l'instar du réacteur Jules - Horowitz , qui doit être achevé à Cadarache ( Bouches - du - Rhône ) en 2014 - 2015 .
Aucun Etat , et encore moins les industriels , n'envisage pour l'heure d'investir dans un réacteur dédié .
L'utilisation d'accélérateurs de particules pour produire des radioéléments est une alternative .
Mais lourde en temps et argent .
" Il faut trouver une meilleure articulation entre public et privé .
Nous avons vécu pendant des années sur un modèle économique qui ne tient plus " , souligne M. Dujardin .
Aux deux bouts de la chaîne , des acteurs le plus souvent publics : l'hôpital et les réacteurs exploités sur fonds d'Etat .
Entre les deux , des intermédiaires privés , dont certains cotés en Bourse , qui pouvaient espérer extraire 90 % de la valeur ajoutée de ce marché de 1 à 2 milliards de dollars par an .
Lors de réunions internationales prévues en septembre , l'OCDE appellera ses membres à imaginer un autre système .
En attendant , dans les années à venir , il n'y aura pas de solution miracle pour les malades , sommés de patienter ...

Evidence that church schools are routinely discriminating against Christians as well as those of other faiths and of no faith , came to light today with the news that a girl has been turned down for a place at a Wrexham faith school because she is the wrong kind of Christian .
Aston Padley , who is 11 years old , has been trying for some months to get into St Joseph 's Catholic and Anglican School in Wrexham .
The local paper , the Evening Leader , reports that Aston has been refused admission , despite the fact she comes from a Christian family and her father is a lay preacher .
Her parents said Aston had been turned down on the grounds that she was not a from a Catholic or Anglican family .
Their experience is one shared by many other families who are rejected by church schools up and down the country because they are not Christians .
Under British law , church schools , although funded almost entirely by the taxpayer , can give priority in admissions to families who attend churches linked to the school .
Aston 's parents have both been Christians for some time and along with their daughter , regularly attend the evangelical King 's Christian Centre in Mold , which is a member of the Evangelical Alliance .
" Although he has not been ordained , my husband has been a lay preacher for a number of years and has preached at a number of churches in the area ” Mrs Padley told the local newspaper .
" Given this , we find it bizarre that we cannot get our daughter in St Joseph's . "
She added : " We have appealed against the decision but a few weeks ago , we lost the appeal .
" The situation seems so unfair when I have heard it said that some other parents get places at faith schools by simply having their child baptised and then taking them along to church a couple of times .
" Aston is a very bright child and has had a glowing report from her headteacher and we wanted to get her into St Joseph 's for its Christian ethos .
" I know we are not the only parents in this position and it seems like discrimination against other Christian faiths . "
Mr Padley said : " During the appeal the headteacher of St Joseph 's defined a Catholic child as a baptised child .
" But , in my view , baptism might mean a great deal or it might mean nothing to some people .
" Our foremost reason for applying for St Joseph 's was because of its Christian ethos rather than its academic record .
" I want to see the admission policy to faith schools changed locally and nationally . "
Christian campaigning groups which highlight alleged discriminination against Christians are unlikely to take up the case , as the same groups have also vigorously defended the right of church schools to discriminate in admissions .
Some religious groups however , including the religious thinktank Ekklesia , are part of the coalition Accord which aims to make admissions policies fairer for faith schools and eliminate discrimination against Christians , as well as those of other religions and of no religion .
Jonathan Bartley , co-director of the religious thinktank Ekklesia said : “ It is n’t just those of no faith who lose out as a result of the discriminatory policies of faith schools .
" The reality is that churches have fought hard to maintain the right of church schools to discriminate , not just against those of other faiths , and no faith , but against their own .
Hopefully now through this case more people from the churches will realise that the law needs to change ” .

While football has been taking a summer break , teams of programmers have been taking part in a league of their own , the 13th annual Robocup .
The ultimate goal ... is to pit human players against a dream team of robot counterparts
Football brings nations together in a celebration of the beautiful game , but what if the football players did not need to train , or even get paid ?
At the Robocup , recently hosted in the Austrian city of Graz , athletic automata have been doing battle on and off the pitch .
It is not as easy as humans make it look , in particular getting a robot to appreciate the finer points of the offside rule is a whole new ball game .
Robocup teams come in many forms , the physical characteristics range from R2D2 through to C3PO via a strange robot puppy hybrid .
Human skills Robot players receive constant instructions from a virtual coach Creating technology , be it hardware or software , that is good at football requires a lot of effort .
It requires mastery over team work , real - time perception and decision making - difficult enough for some human players , let alone mechanical ones .
The robotic players in a team either talk to each other on the pitch , like a real game , or they all listen to a central computer which issues instructions , formulates tactics , and then controls them via radio - a football manager 's dream .
A typical match at the Robocup involves four robot players and one goalkeeper .
The camera above the pitch gathers information and sends it to the central computer for guidance .
Alongside the real robots , Robocup also runs a software competition , where programmers make use of their own AI code to create the ultimate simulated soccer team .
Ultimate goal Fancy footwork is a software challenge Majid Gholipour , professor of the Mechatronic Centre at Iran 's Azad University of Ghazin claims that the Robocup is a much friendlier version of the game than human football .
" The goal in sport is usually to win , but here the goal is to make a leap forward in programming , " he said .
" For example , in the Software League , everyone is expected to release their codes , and place them at the disposal of the other teams .
" Some teams even set up workshops , and tell the other teams : ' look guys , we have made inroads in these areas , so if you want to use them for next year to make progress , you can . ' "
The ultimate goal of the competition 's creators is to pit human players against a dream team of robot counterparts within the next few decades .
For Gerald Steinbauer of Graz University of Technology , the main goal is to the continuing development of the technology : " If we reach this goal , it 's not so important , " he said .
" More important is what we are doing on this road to 2050 and if you look back at the last 13 Robocups , there was such good technology and approaches developed , that there is hope that we will have another useful development in the future . "

( Try saying that ten times fast . )
Most Indo-European languages have multiple tenses , to differentiate things that have happened from things that are happening right now from things that will happen , plus some to define what had happened before that , not to mention some that are a bit less identifiable in their everyday uses ( we doubt that most people have understood the Pluperfect Subjunctive ) .
It mostly works fine when your timeline is a strict progression from cause to effect .
Unfortunately , when you are watching the San Dimas Time , winding through the threads of the Timey - Wimey Ball , chasing another time traveler who is always one step ahead of you , it can become awkward .
As a result , time travelers will often stumble over their wording , leading to use of tenses that can be torturous to understand .

Usually this is an experienced traveler explaining in eloquent yet incomprehensible terms that they did n't " just succeed " , when you return from an adventure in the future .
Alternatively , a less experienced character will attempt to explain what 's going on , and struggle with their terms .
If your Future Me shows up , there may be pronoun trouble on a similar style , especially if there 's several versions of future characters knocking around .
This is related to Meanwhile , in the Future , Anachronic Order , Non-Linear Character .

Mikuru from Haruhi Suzumiya is aware of the tense trouble , but she keeps flubbing it anyway .
Considering that Mikuru is spacey and Moe , this leads to Adult Mikuru showing Kyon a mole on her breasts while saying something like " But you were the one who told me about it ... wait , has that not happened yet ?
oops ... " .
Later in that episode Kyon casually asks Mikuru if she has a mole " right about here " and points to the location on his own chest .
She turns around , checks , and starts trying to beat the information out of him .
That would be where Kyon " told her about it " — it 's a bootstrap paradox .

I mean ... what am I talking about ?
A frequent out - of - universe problem when trying to describe events crossing Crisis on Infinite Earths , due to the major differences in how the retcon affected different characters and different past events .
A few characters were rebooted as completely new characters ( Wonder Woman ) , some were made so that they had been around before the Crisis , but their personalities and histories suddenly had always been very different from what all previous comics portrayed ( Superman ) , some were erased from history ( Supergirl ) , and some had basically the same history and memory that they had had before the Crisis ( The Flash , Green Lantern ) .
Therefore , there 's both the reader 's perception of what " Pre- Crisis " and " Post - Crisis " means ( Pre-Crisis : Silver - and the Bronze Age , Post - Crisis : Dark - and Modern Age ) , and there 's the characters ' perception of what " Pre Crisis " and " Post Crisis " means ( basically : Pre Crisis : Before Barry and Kara died , Post Crisis : after Barry and Kara died ) .
This leads to descriptions like " After the Crisis , Batman changed so that he had been dark and brooding both before and after Barry died . "
Also , Barry 's life , career and friendship with other characters , as well as the vague event note from the characters ' point of view : that Really Big Deal that no one really remembers but no one ever wonders about that caused his death , are all perfectly compatible ( as far as their memories are concerned ) with their personal histories and timelines that had been established after the Crisis was written .
So basically , the characters can all recall and talk about events that as far as they are concerned , occurred when Barry Allen was still alive , but most of those events are significantly different from how they were reported by comic books written before the Crisis was published .

Continuum invents a time - travellers ' jargon with terms regarding your personal ' spanner ' timeline being separate from terms used in the general ' leveller ' timeline .
Things in your subjective past are in your " age " , while things in your subjective future are in your " yet " .
When talking about objective time , things are either " Up " or " Down " ; the year 2000 , for example , is Up from the year 1990 .
All events except those in your personal past require the present tense , since in a second , they may be your " now " too .
Averted in one place in Gurps Time - Travel by saying that there are two timelines for the adventurer , the time he came from " hometime " and the time he is adventuring in ; and Hometime keeps going while the adventurer was adventuring .

The Transgression runs into this once it starts talking about time travel ; when discussing the consequences of changing the past it says that " what used to happen ( and here the past tense gets into a bit of trouble ) , is that you got your ass kicked by the transsapient gods who live at the end of time . "
In Time Agent the objective is to have always been winning by using time travel to have changed the past , while never having had time travel invented .

Also , in the game 's intro , Robert notes that the player " does n't row " .
He means that ( looking from a future perspective ) the player never rows , in any of the timelines .
Rosalind misinterprets this as " The player does n't know how to row , is n't a rower " .

Real Life
In an effort to keep lakes and streams clean , municipalities around the country are banning or restricting the use of phosphorus - containing lawn fertilizers , which can kill fish and cause smelly algae blooms and other problems when the phosphorus washes out of the soil and into waterways .
But do the ordinances really help reduce phosphorus pollution ?
That 's been an open question until now , says John Lehman , professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Michigan .
" It 's one of those things where political organizations take the action because they believe it's the environmentally conscious thing to do , but there 's been no evidence offered in peer - reviewed literature that these ordinances actually have a salutary effect , " Lehman said .
Now , such evidence exists in a study published by Lehman and students Douglas Bell and Kahli McDonald in the journal Lake and Reservoir Management .
The paper , published online Aug. 14 , shows that phosphorus levels in the Huron River dropped an average of 28 percent after Ann Arbor adopted an ordinance in 2006 that curtailed the use of phosphorus on lawns .
Phosphorus is naturally plentiful in southeast Michigan soils , so fertilizing established lawns with the nutrient is generally unnecessary .
Lehman was in an ideal position to assess the effectiveness of the Ann Arbor ordinance because he and undergraduate student Julie Ferris were already studying nutrient levels in the Huron River and two downstream lakes , Ford Lakes and Belleville Lake , for a different research project .
Ferris used some of the data from that project in her senior honors thesis , and she and Lehman published a paper on the Ford Lake and Belleville Lake research , but they were n't sure what to do with the rest of the data from the Huron River around Ann Arbor .
" As we were talking about it , I got a phone call from Ann Arbor environmental coordinator Matt Naud , who knew about the work we had been doing , " Lehman said .
" He said the city council had enacted an ordinance that would reduce the use of phosphorus - containing fertilizers , and he wondered if we would be able to detect any change that might occur as a result . "
Using statistical models , Lehman and Ferris figured out how much sampling would be required to confidently detect a 25 percent decrease in phosphorus concentrations .
" We came up with the result that for most of the river that runs through Ann Arbor , we should be able to detect a change of that magnitude by sampling once a week for one summer or two summers , depending on the sampling station . "
Naud found funding to pay a student to do the work over the next two summers .
By that time , Ferris had graduated and gone on to medical school , so Lehman recruited Bell to do the sampling and chemical analyses .
When Bell graduated and took a job measuring phosphorus on research cruises around Bermuda , McDonald joined the project .
" Right away , we started to see decreases , " Lehman said .
After the first year of data collection , it was clear that phosphorus concentrations were lower after the ordinance was enacted than before .
But did the ordinance cause the drop ?
Though that explanation seems likely , public education efforts and general increased environmental awareness among Ann Arbor residents also may have entered in .
At any rate , the study already has attracted the attention of the Southeast Michigan Council of Governments ( SEMCOG ) , which invited Lehman to present the study results at a meeting earlier this year , and may well generate interest beyond Michigan 's borders .
" Although the science was n't difficult , its ramifications in a political sense and in an environmental sense will not be insignificant , " Lehman said .
The research was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency , the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the city of Ann Arbor .
The dark world of Frank Castle and Marvel returns to gaming , using Epic ’s Unreal engine 3 and taking advantage of a completely different genre than its predecessor .
The game brings a few features that we have n’t seen in gaming for a while , i.e. unlockables for which there are over 100 of .
But is this game Punishable , or does it show mercy in the end ?
The story is told through short cutscenes made up of comic book scenes , which were drawn and written by Mike Deodato .
It ’s important to note that Deodato has experience working on a few other Punisher comics , as well as other big franchises from Marvel and DC .
While this should instill some degree of confidence , the story is shockingly bad .
It probably fits somewhere in the Punisher universe , but I have no idea why I was asked to hunt down Jigsaw .
Did this guy murder Frank ’s wife and kids ?
Did he disgrace Frank at a game of poker ?
The way the game is written , it ’s impossible to know .
However if you like the style of Punisher , you ’ll probably like how the story is presented , as the overall structure is similar to that of a comic book .
The art style , although not as interesting as other titles , is dark , broody and suits the character well .
The story takes 30 minutes to complete and offers just over 20 minutes worth of gameplay .
The story is split into 4 chapters , which goes to show just how small the story is .
And considering the fact that comicbook style cutscenes are used shows how barebones this game is .
For those who have played Unreal Tournament 3 , you ’ll probably have a good idea of how Punisher : No Mercy is built .
The short single - player campaign is essentially a tutorial for the online mode .
It ’s a warmup that did n’t recieve much differentiation from its corresponding online mode .
Though the Punisher : No Mercy does have a lot of features packed into its small , 400 MB download , it looks and plays exactly like a UT3 mod .
The weapons are more reality - based than those from Unreal Tournament , but as with UT the levels are full of power ups , such as bonus points , health packs , and shield pickups .
This applies to both single - player and multiplayer .
There are 15 weapons split into four categories : Sub-Machine Gun , Shotgun , Pistol , and Rifle .
There are also hidden weapons that require 200 kills in multiplayer to unlock , such as the Crossbow and Grenade Launcher .
Each of these weapons have their own set of upgrades , which often make the item lighter .
This in turns speeds up the character ’s movement , though to be honest there are n’t that many characters to choose from .
Seeing as how the multiplayer mode only supports 8 players at once , the developers only created 8 characters to choose from .
Customization of these characters is boiled down to strictly weapons and powerups , not visual appearance .
Powerups are similar to the perk system seen in Call of Duty 4 .
There are over 10 abilities available to choose from , for a total of two mods for your selected character .
One becomes an Active mod , while the other becomes a Passive Mod .
Both options have a degree of usefullness , especially active mods , which can turn a boring match into something a little more fun , with players having a set time limit on Invulnerability and Invisibility .
The game modes included are
Vigilante , Team Deathmatch , Punish the Punisher , Elimination , Time Trial and Survival .
There are 8 multiplayer maps included , which is pretty good number .
It ’s just too bad that the matches are boring and subject to framerate drops when the action ramps up .
There is n’t anything particularly fun about this game .
The single - player campaign is an absolute joke , and only lasts for about half an hour .
And on top of that , it ’s really just a tutorial for the multiplayer modes .
The difficulty level is fine , but do n’t play against the A.I. as it pales in comparison to human opponents .
It really is n’t worth a purchase unless you a die - hard FPS fan .
I recommend staying away from this , even if you enjoy reading the comics .
Greg Sargent dug a little deeper into the latest Washington Poll / ABC News poll , which was released today .
As John noted earlier today , this poll is especially bad for Obama among independents .
But , that ’s not the real story , as far as I ’m concerned .
Greg learned more from the Post ’s polling analyst Jennifer Agiesta about the numbers for Democrats and liberals .
Those results show a growing problem for Obama with his base , which includes many of us :
The numbers tell the story :
In three key cases where Obama has dropped significantly , he ’s also dropped by sizable margins among Dems and liberals .
Let ’s take the major findings driving the discussion today , and compare them with his drop among Dems and libs :
* The WaPo poll found that “ 49 percent now express confidence that Obama will make the right decisions for the country , down from 60 percent at the 100 - day mark in his presidency . ”
On that question , among liberals , Obama has dropped a surprising 12 points , from 90 % to 78 % , in the same time period .
Among Dems , he ’s dropped eight points , from 90 % to 82 % .
* The WaPo poll found that “ forty - nine percent now say they think he will be able to spearhead significant improvements in the system , down nearly 20 percentage points from before he took office . ”
On that question , among Dems , Obama has fallen a surprising 11 points during that time period , from 90 % to 79 % .
Among liberals it was even steeper : A drop of 13 points , from 84 % to 71 % .
( This could also partly be a referendum on Congress , but it ’s still suggestive . )
* The WaPo poll also found a steep drop in approval of Obama ’s handling of health care , which now stands at 46 % , down 11 points from 57 % in April .
But guess what :
The drop during that time period was the same among liberals : Down 11 points , from 81 % in April to 70 % now .
Among Dems overall , Obama fell six points , from 83 % to 77 % .
WaPo polling analyst Agiesta cautioned that independents were likely a greater factor , but she said Obama ’s problems among Dems and liberals were clearly playing a key role : “ This is the first sign that something is going wrong with his base . ”

Why did Scotland really release Libyan Lockerbie bomber ?
In 2007 , the London Review of Books published a piece entitled “ Inconvenient Truths ” about the conviction and subsequent appeals of Libyan intelligence agent Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi for the bombing of Pan - Am flight 103 .
The article , written by Hugh Miles , explained that even at the time of the conviction there were many questions , and that al - Megrahi ’s appeal ( which he withdrew in order to be released on medical grounds last week ) had a chance of succeeding .
Lawyers , politicians , diplomats and relatives of Lockerbie victims now believe that the former Libyan intelligence officer is innocent .
Robert Black QC , an emeritus professor of Scottish law at Edinburgh University , was one of the architects of the original trial in Holland .
He has closely followed developments since the disaster happened and in 2000 devised the non-jury trial system for the al - Megrahi case .
Evenbefore the trial he was so sure the evidence against al - Megrahi would not stand up in court that he is on record as saying that a convictio nwould be impossible .
When I asked how he feels about this remark now , Black replied : ‘ I am still absolutely convinced that I am right .
No reasonable tribunal , on the evidence heard at the original trial , should or could have convicted him and it is an absolute disgrace and outrage what the Scottish court did . ’
In this context the outrage over al - Megrahi ’s release by Scotland last week –because he has terminal cancer – might need to be reevaluated .
The same goes for resultant anger over Libyan leader Muammar al - Qaddafi ’s visit to the U.N. and New York in September .
Following up on the London Review of Books ’ blog this week , Glen Newey makes the astute , if impolitic point that the release , and drop of al - Megrahi ’s appeal , was likely best for the political fortunes of everyone involved :
It served nobody ’s interests to have the Lockerbie bombing conviction debated in open court .
Hence the great good fortune of al - Megrahi ’s terminal prostate cancer , which sped his release from Greenock .
With a ‘ compassionate ’ wave of the biro , the SNP administration has rid itselfof a high - profile prisoner with an unsafe conviction and enhanced , orcreated , its international profile .
The UK government can keep in withthe Libyans and protect its commercial contracts , on the plea ofrespecting devolved powers .
Meanwhile , in a rerun of the Cold War great game , we need to oil our way into the Colonel ’s tent ahead of the Bear : recently Russia has been angling for a naval base in Benghazi .
So even the Obama administration has reason to mute its complaints .
It ’s almost enough to make one believe in divine providence .
None of this , of course , is any consolation to the families of the bombing victims , but it gives a very plausible explanation for what might be going on behind the scenes .
To be clear , it is unlikely officials could fake the cancer diagnosis and Al - Megrahi does not look very well in the photos of his departure from Scotland .
But well , who knows ?
Maybe he ’ll make a miraculous recovery at home in Libya .

One of the most challenging tasks for new GTK + application developers is figuring out how to present and manipulate data in a TreeView widget .
The widget itself is not particularly complicated , but the sophisticated architecture behind it can be difficult to grok .
The TreeView and its underlying data store work together in a classic model - view - controller pattern .
This approach necessitates a lot of extra boilerplate code , but it 's very powerful when used to its full potential .
In this article , we are going to briefly look at how to bind a TreeView widget to a TreeStore and then we are going to show you how to bind the same store to a text entry widget with autocompletion .
The underlying data behind a tree view widget is stored in a tree model .
The TreeModel defines a high - level interface that describes how view widgets communicate with underlying storage data .
There are several standard storage classes that conform with the tree model API .
These are the GtkListStore , used for flat data , and the TreeStore , which is used for nested hierarchal data .
In this example , we will be using the TreeStore .
The following example in Python demonstrates how to instantiate the TreeStore and populate it with nested data .
It uses a simple recursive function to traverse the filesystem and then put the file and directory names into the TreeStore .
import os , stat , gtk # Instantiate the tree store and specify the data types store = gtk.
TreeStore ( str , gtk.gdk .
Pixbuf , int , bool ) def dirwalk ( path , parent =None ) : # Iterate over the contents of the specified path for f in os.listdir ( path ) : # Get the absolute path of the item fullname = os.path.join ( path , f ) # Extract metadata from the item fdata = os.stat( fullname ) # Determine if the item is a folder is_folder = stat .
S_ISDIR ( fdata.st_mode ) # Generate an icon from the default icon theme img = gtk.icon_theme_get_default().load_icon ( " folder " if is_folder else " document " , gtk.ICON_SIZE_MENU , 0 ) # Append the item to the TreeStore li = store .
append ( parent , [ f , img , fdata.st_size , is_folder ] ) #
If the item is a folder , descend into it if is_folder : dirwalk ( fullname , li ) dirwalk ( " /home/username / whatever " )
When we instantiate the TreeStore by calling the gtk .
TreeStore constructor , we use the parameters to specify the type of data for each of the TreeStore object 's columns .
In this case , the first column is the filename ( a string ) , the second column is the icon ( a Pixbuf ) , the third column is the file size ( an integer ) , and the fourth column is a boolean value that specifies whether the item is a folder .
It 's important to note that the TreeStore columns do n't necessarily map directly to TreeView columns .
The mapping is defined later in the program .
The store . append method is used to add an item to the TreeStore .
The first parameter is the parent item , which you need to specify if you want to nest your new item hierarchically inside of an existing one .
If you are creating a top - level item in the TreeStore , then the parent will be None .
The second parameter of the store .
append method is a list of values that you want to put into the TreeStore item 's columns .
Each value in the list corresponds with one column .
You want these to match the types that you specified when you instantiated the TreeStore .
Now that we have created a TreeStore , we want to display it in a TreeView .
To do this , we have to create the TreeView widget and then bind values from the model to actual columns in the TreeView .
The following example demonstrates how to do this :
# Create a TreeViewColumn col = gtk. TreeViewColumn ( " File " ) # Create a column cell to display text col_cell_text = gtk.CellRendererText ( ) # Create a column cell to display an image col_cell_img = gtk.CellRendererPixbuf () #
Add the cells to the column col.pack_start( col_cell_img , False ) col.pack_start(col_cell_text , True ) #
Bind the text cell to column 0 of the tree 's model col.add_attribute( col_cell_text , " text " , 0 ) # Bind the image cell to column 1 of the tree 's model col.add_attribute(col_cell_img , " pixbuf " , 1 ) col2 = gtk.TreeViewColumn ( " Size " ) col2_cell_text = gtk.CellRendererText( ) col2.pack_start(col2_cell_text ) col2.add_attribute(col2_cell_text , " text " , 2 ) # Create the TreeView and set our data store as the model tree = gtk.
TreeView ( store ) # Append the columns to the TreeView tree.append_column( col ) tree.append_column( col2 )
The CellRenderer objects are responsible for rendering the data in the tree .
Each column can have any number of cell renderers .
In the example above , we want the first column to have the icon and filename .
The second column displays the size of the file .
The column .
add_attribute method is used to connect the cell renderers to the underlying data that is stored in the model .
The method takes three parameters .
The first is the cell renderer object , the second is the specific attribute of the cell renderer that you want to bind to a value , and the third is the index of the column in the TreeStore that contains the data you want to display in the cell renderer .
When we instantiate the TreeView with the gtk .
TreeView constructor method , we pass it our TreeStore object as a parameter .
This will make it use our store object as its data model .
If you ever want to swap out the model later , you can use the tree .
set_model method .
Now that we have our TreeView and we have bound it to a TreeStore , we can display it to the user by packing it into a scrolling window :
scroll = gtk.ScrolledWindow( ) scroll.add ( tree ) window = gtk.
Window ( ) window.connect (" destroy " , gtk.main_quit ) window.add( scroll ) window.show_all ( )

The first meeting between North and South Korean officials in nearly two years has taken place unexpectedly in the South Korean capital Seoul .
A spy chief said to be close to the North 's leader Kim Jong - il met Seoul 's Unification Minister Hyun In -taek .
Later , a South Korean government official announced the envoys would meet President Lee Myung - bak on Sunday .
The delegates from the North have said they want better relations on the Korean peninsula .
They are in Seoul to pay respects to late ex-President Kim Dae-jung .
The Northern official in charge of inter-Korean relations , Kim Yang - gon , said there was an urgent need to improve the frosty relations between the two countries .
" After meeting with several people [ in the South ] , I felt the imperative need for North - South relations to improve , " Mr Kim said ahead of his talks with Mr Hyun .
Conciliatory gestures Saturday 's meeting is the first between officials from the two Koreas since the conservative Mr Lee came to power in Seoul in February 2008 .
Relations soured when Mr Lee made South Korean aid conditional on North Korea 's nuclear disarmament .
In the past few months , North Korea has fired a long range rocket over Japanese territory and conducted an underground nuclear test .
But more recently , there has been a series of conciliatory gestures .
Two US reporters and a South Korean worker were released from detention and Pyongyang said it was interested in resuming cross - border tourism and industrial projects .
Some observers believe that , with UN sanctions beginning to bite , the North is keen to boost cross - border tourism and trade that bring in badly needed foreign currency , our correspondent adds .
On Friday , the six officials from North Korea 's ruling Workers ' Party , wearing black suits and ties , placed a wreath of flowers on the steps of South Korea 's National Assembly , where Kim Dae - jung is lying in state .
Mr Kim - who died on Tuesday at the age of 85 - devoted his presidency to improving relations between the two Koreas , still technically at war .
He reached out to the North with aid - the main thrust of his " Sunshine Policy " that earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 , and held a historic summit with Kim Jong - Il in that year .
Mr Kim 's funeral is to be held on Sunday .

How to Publish a Scientific Comment in 12 3 Ea sy S te ps
Prof. Rick Trebino Georgia Institute of Technology School of Physics Atlanta , GA 30332 rick.trebino@physics.gatech.edu www.physics.gatech.edu/frog
The essence of science is reasoned debate .
So , if you disagree with something reported in a scientific paper , you can write a “ Comment ” on it .
Yet you do n’t see many Comments .
Some believe that this is because journal editors are reluctant to publish Comments because Comments reveal their mistakes — papers they should n’t have allowed to be published in the first place .
Indeed , scientists often complain that it can be very difficult to publish one .
Fortunately , in this article , I ’ll share with you my recent experience publishing a Comment , so you can , too .
There are just a few simple steps : 1 .
Read a paper that has a mistake in it .
2 .
Write and submit a Comment , politely correcting the mistake .
3 .
Enjoy your Comment in print along with the authors ’ equally polite Reply , basking in the joy of having participated in the glorious scientific process and of the new friends you ’ve made — the authors whose research you ’ve greatly assisted .
Ha ha !
You did n’t really believe that , did you ?
Here ’s the actual sequence of events : 1 .
Read a paper in the most prestigious journal in your field that “ proves ” that your entire life ’s work is wrong .
2 .
An Evaluation will certainly assist you to find out if the regulation was …
The Sims 3 was leaked out a few days before the official release date .
Normally , this will cause for an alarm in EA which leads them to take legal action on this to stop the game from being downloaded .
However , EA CEO John Riccitiello was not even fazed by this , but was even sort of happy that it got leaked .
Ironic .
EA CEO John Riccitiello said the game that everybody downloaded was just a demo version and not the full game .
Ha !
“ You identified our secret marketing campaign ! ” stated by John Riccitiello .
“ A huge amount of the gameplay is an overlay for the community , ” he said , “ where you are sampling assets created by other people .
So for the pirate consumer , they do n’t get the second town , they do n’t get all the extra content , and they do n’t get the community .
It was only concentrated on Poland and China , but I think of it as not being that different than a demo . ”
Yup , for a person that downloaded the leaked version , there was a message stating they would n’t have access to all of the content available in the game and purchase of the retailed version will be required for updates and all the goodies to come .
“ I ’m a longtime believer that we ’re moving to selling services that are disc - enabled as opposed to packages that have bolt - ons . …
If you see what we ’re doing with Madden Online , FIFA Ultimate Team or Sims 3 , and Dragon Age is probably a 100 - hour game by itself , but what comes post - release [ for these games ] is bigger still .
So the point I ’m making is , yes I think that ’s the answer [ to piracy ] .
And here ’s the trick : it ’s not the answer because this foils a pirate , but it ’s the answer because it makes the service so valuable that in comparison the packaged good is not .
So you can only deliver these added services to a consumer you recognize and know ; people do n’t pirate servers very often , but it has happened .
So I think the truth is we ’ve out - serviced the pirate . …
By the way , if there are any pirates you ’re writing for , please encourage them to pirate FIFA Online , NBA Street Online , Battleforge , Battlefield Heroes … if they would just pirate lots of it I ’d love them .
[ laughs ]
Because what ’s in the middle of the game is an opportunity to buy stuff .
I increasingly believe that ’s the way the market ’s going because that ’s how the consumer wants to consume .
And by the way , [ regarding ] my competitor , do you think Blizzard gets upset when someone pirates a disc of one of their online games ?
While we do n’t want to see people pirate Warhammer Online , if they ’re going to give us a year ’s subscription it ’s not exactly a total loss . ”
Guess EA did have an answer to piracy after what happen to Spores .
So you heard the man go pirate “ FIFA Online , NBA Street Online , Battleforge , Battlefield Heroes ” .

Developed and developing nations have agreed that global temperatures should not rise more than 2C above 1900 levels , a G8 summit declaration says .
That is the level above which , the UN says , the Earth 's climate system would become dangerously unstable .
US President Barack Obama said the countries had made important strides in dealing with climate change .
But the G8 failed to persuade developing countries to accept targets of cutting emissions by 50 % by 2050 .
On Wednesday , the G8 agreed its own members would work towards 80 % cuts by the same date .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said the G8 had not done enough and should also set 2020 targets .
He said that while the G8's Wednesday agreement was welcome , its leaders also needed to establish a strong and ambitious mid-term target for emissions cuts .
See how global temperatures have risen
The second day of the summit , in the Italian city of L'Aquila , opened its discussions to take in the so - called G5 nations - Brazil , China , India , Mexico and South Africa .
Egypt is a special invitee .
In other developments :
The world 's biggest economies have agreed to work to reach a global trade deal by 2010
Leaders of major developed and developing nations have agreed not to resort to competitive currency devaluations
In a joint statement , President Obama and UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the detention of British embassy staff by the Iranian authorities was unacceptable Significant step
The latest declaration was issued by the Major Economies Forum , of 16 developed and developing nations - the G8 , G5 , Australia , South Korea and Indonesia - plus the European Union .
The group accounts for about 80 % of the world 's total greenhouse gas emissions .

" We recognise the scientific view that the increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels ought not to exceed 2 C , " it said .
It added that the economies would work towards a global goal for substantially reducing emissions by 2050 between now and December , when the UN holds talks in Copenhagen on a successor to the Kyoto treaty .
President Obama , who chaired the meeting , said the countries had had a candid and open discussion about the growing threat of climate change and what must be done both individually and collectively to address it .
" I believe we 've made some important strides forward as we move towards Copenhagen , " he said .
" I do n't think I have to emphasise that climate change is one of the defining challenges of our time .
The science is clear and conclusive and the impacts can no longer be ignored . "
Early agreement ' unlikely ' RK Pachauri , who chairs the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change , praised the declaration 's mention of the 2C limit but said more details were needed .
" It certainly does n't give you a roadmap on how you should get there but at least they 've defined the destination , " he told the BBC World Service Newshour programme .
G8 KEY ISSUES / TIMETABLE THURSDAY : Climate Change Brazil , China , India , Mexico , South Africa , Egypt join talks 1230 GMT - Junior G8 1300 GMT - Major Economies Forum meeting FRIDAY : Development 0630 GMT - crisis ' impact on Africa with African leaders attending 0830 GMT - food security 1100 GMT - final news conference G8 members : Britain , Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , Russia , US
Deal highlights divisions
At a glance : summit agenda Mr Berlusconi's G8 Party Climate change around the world Climate targets : Global pledges Full text : Climate declaration Mr Obama added that the United States , as a major polluter , had not met its responsibilities in the past , but those days were over .
But his scientific adviser , John Holdren , told the BBC it was unlikely that the US could come to any early agreement on tough reductions in emissions by 2020 proposed by the EU .
" If we had not wasted the last eight years , we could probably achieve that target , " he said .
" But we did waste the last eight years and in consequence , it does n't make a lot of sense for us to officially embrace a target that is not realistically within reach . "
BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin says the declaration is a significant step , with all big countries rich and poor agreeing there is a scientific limit on the amount we should warm the climate .
But there is still a huge way to go , he says , as developing nations like India will not sign up to any 2050 targets unless rich nations show more determination and offer more cash .
The G8 summit began in L'Aquila on Wednesday , with the first day largely taken up with discussion of the fragile state of the global economy .
The leaders also issued a statement reaffirming that they were " deeply concerned " by Iran 's nuclear programme and condemning North Korea 's recent nuclear test and missile launches .
African leaders will join the summit on Friday to push for a new initiative to fund farming in the developing world and tackle global hunger .

COMING SOON : DREAMS
My new webcomic series , “ Dreams ” , is going to debut on Instagram very soon !
Join me in this journey of exploration of real - life dreams with their daily mix of surrealism , crazyness , and introspection !
Enjoy a fresh , fun point of view of the most absurd part of our everyday life ..
The idea that the Obama administration can advance the Middle East peace process by having Israel freeze its construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank stretches credulity .
Does any serious observer of the region believe that Israel 's appetite for land – owned and occupied for generations by Palestinians – is going to abate ?
The Israeli land grab has continued for four decades , in defiance of international law and most US presidents .
US Middle East envoy George Mitchell has been trying to secure a halt , but his efforts follow a well - worn path that typically ends in charade .
Just weeks ago , the Israeli government evicted two extended Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem , clearing the way for more houses for Jews in traditionally Palestinian neighborhoods .
Israeli settlements have become a kind of concrete kudzu to Palestinians .
The Fatah party recently renewed its commitment to resisting them , holding that " the Palestinians have the right to resist the Israeli occupation by all possible means . "
But for the Jewish state , the settlements are eminently sensible and their growth is almost certain to continue , either openly or stealthily .
As Interior Minister Eli Yishai put it Aug. 10 , expanding settlements near Jerusalem is vital for " security , national interests , and is just and necessary . "
Every new Jewish apartment complex enlarges and deepens the Jewish footprint on occupied land .
The California - style townhouses atop the hills of ancient Samaria and Judea are seen as security buffers for an Israeli island in a hostile Islamic sea .
Israel 's feeling of vulnerability is intensified by the growing Arab population already within its borders .
The settlements have become affordable suburbs for Israelis otherwise priced out of the metropolitan markets .
More than 300,000 Jewish settlers now call the West Bank home .
Further , religious and ultrareligious Jewish settlers insist they have divinely bestowed title to the land .
Few passages in the Bible are more frightening to Arabs than Deuteronomy 11:24 :
" Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours : from the wilderness and Lebanon , from the river , the river Euphrates , even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast be . "
Palestinian Arabs are too weak to legally or militarily challenge the Jewish state 's internal expansion .
An Israeli court recently ruled that Israel can now confiscate land belonging to Palestinians who once resided in an area but are now refugees pending final settlement .
Having lived in Jerusalem for five years during the salad days of the peace process in the 1990s , I watched settlement builders nibble away at what were once Palestinian homes , villages , and pastures .
From Jerusalem southward , the construction of the Har Homa settlement crabs outward to the doorsteps of Palestinian Bethlehem .
From the air , these settlements appear a terrestrial octopus , extending out to ultimately link up with the more militant Jewish settlements farther south in Hebron , another city with a large Palestinian majority .
Settlement building resembles military flanking and encirclement maneuvers , isolating Palestinian population centers .
In Jerusalem , there are at least half a dozen Arab neighborhoods , including the Mount of Olives , threatened by Israel 's voracious hunger for land .
Quoted in the newspaper Haaretz , Sarah Kreimer of Ir Amim , a group specializing in Israeli - Palestinian relations , says , " In each of these places , plans are being advanced for construction whose ultimate purpose is to disconnect the Old City from Palestinian Jerusalem . "
Israelis have brilliantly created a sense of inevitability to all this .
Yet , the moral difficulties of moving indigenous peoples off the land by subterfuge or force are obvious .
When in the past I 've raised the ethical implications of these land appropriations , Israelis have dismissed me , saying , " Hey , you Americans did it to the Indians . "
American presidents have often quietly nudged Israel to freeze the settlements , but their actual leverage has been minimal .
Israelis have elected both doves and hawks as prime minister , but virtually all Israeli governments supported settlement expansion in varying degrees .
Jewish political clout in America ought not be underestimated .
A former chairman of the American Israel Political Action Committee once boasted to me , " We got [ Sen . ]
Chuck Percy [ an Illinois Republican who was narrowly defeated in 1984 ] when he crossed us on the Palestinians . "
President Obama will face a similar threat at election time if he defies Israel 's expansionist instincts .
US presidents have so frequently pledged unshakable support for Israel that it's created the illusion that US and Israeli interests are identical .
It might be useful for Mr. Obama and his Middle East team to publicly point to serious differences with Israel when they arise .
If the US can have public disagreements with its allies , including Britain , why should Israel be exempted from what could be a healthy debate ?
Jewish settlement construction may temporarily downshift into neutral .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton may hail " a building freeze . "
But if the past is prologue , the first time Obama is distracted by another domestic or international crisis , and Washington is n't looking , the Israeli bulldozers will be back at work .
Walter Rodgers served as the CNN bureau chief in Jerusalem for 5 - 1/ 2 years .
He writes a biweekly column for the Monitor 's weekly edition .
For a different perspective , read David Wilder 's Mr. Obama , Hebron is an eternal home for Jews .
gOS 3.1 Google Gadgets - Linux with style
Updated : August 3 , 2009
This is the second time I 've taken gOS for a spin .
I have reviewed the distro approx .
a year and a half ago in an article aptly named gOS Linux - a very good OS .
Indeed , gOS was a great treat .
Based on Ubuntu , it hailed stability and ease of use .
Running the Enlightenment desktop , it offered beauty and style on par with Mac OSX , using the magical powers of 2D compositing to achieve smoky , glassy effects even on meager VESA cards .
It also came with a range of useful programs , a Mac - like dock with zoom - in icons , quick access to modern - era Web needs , be they Google apps , Facebook or Youtube , and then some .
All in all , it was a pleasure .
The current version of gOS , named Google Gadgets , ups the ante with new delights .
It runs Gnome and uses the Avant Windows Navigator ( AWN ) to achieve stylish , modern looks .
It also boasts great compatibility with low - end netbooks , and brings in a slew of new programs , including WINE , Picasa - and naturally - Google Gadgets .
I decided to test gOS and see how well it fares against the crowded competition of the teeming , growing Linux world .
And even more importantly , see if gOS can chew into the McPie and Wincookie markets .
What are we going to do ?
Truth to be told , pretty much everything ...
We 'll boot gOS on my olden T42 and see how well it handles older hardware .
But we 'll also place it on the newer T61 and check Wireless connectivity , which turned out to be tricky for most distros on this laptop , test Bluetooth , Compiz if Gods of the Internet are willing , web camera - and we have Skype for that already installed , multimedia support , and we 'll play a whole lot with applications and gadgets the distro offers .
And more ...
Let 's do it .
Laptops , here I come
gOS maintains elegance from the first moment you boot .
The boot menu is simple and clean .
And like Foresight , gOS sports fresh , green reinvigorating colors .
Desktop & Gadgets
The live desktop is pleasant , albeit cluttered with Google Gadgets , haphazardly arrayed .
For someone with a slight case of OCD , I found this solution somewhat inadequate and in fact detrimental to the otherwise professional looks and style .
The things are even worse on smaller resolutions .
While 1440x900 resolution permits enough space for the gadgets , on 1024x768 setting the things start to border on chaotic .
Another issue is the lack of consistency in looks among different gadgets .
Some are purely graphical , with casual effects for the curious eye ; some are text - only with rather bland HTML styles that do not sit well with the rest .
Then , if you 're not connected to the Web , as is the case with encrypted Wireless networks on laptops , you end up with a few errors that make the overall impression marred .
Luckily , a single click on the Google Gadgets icon in the system area on the top panel will clear them out , leaving a clean , beautiful desktop .
Arranging the gadgets takes time and effort and can be fun - or frustrating , depending on how you take it .
Then , there 's the purpose to consider .
The gadgets can be entertaining , but in the end , you probably want to use them in some way .
The first thing you want to do is check out the available assortment of gadgets .
Right - click on the icon and start your exploration .
The Gadget Browser offers a wide range of gadgets , which you can sort by category or language .
Once you find the stuff you like , simply click on the thumbnails to add them :
After quite a bit of tweaking , I managed to concoct a few reasonable layout with a number of good - looking , unobtrusive gadgets arranged in the corners of the desktop .
I also mostly opted for more conservative and practical items available .
If you 're looking for spartan efficiency , Google Gadgets are probably not the best way to decorate your desktop .
If you 're more of a Web 2.0 kind of person , the actual audience that gOS aims at , you will probably appreciate the bank of colors and shapes and might spice up your desktop with a few innocent items .
Still , I would change the default layout .
Maybe one , but no more than two or three gadgets , carefully placed and fine - tuned to display resolution .
The way it is , the gadgets are shown for the sake of show , with little regard to the artistic impression .
But this is just the perks .
Let 's see how well gOS manages the real stuff .
Wireless & Bluetooth
On T42 , things worked as expected .
There 's no Compiz , which is understandable , since gOS aims to work on netbooks as well .
You can probably install it from the repositories .
Since gOS is based on Ubuntu , I believe there should be no issues .
Wireless and Bluetooth worked well , too .
One small thing that did put me off was the Wireless Network menu ; it is squashed up at the bottom , with the three options barely spaced out .
Oh , and the fact 3 out of 6 available networks were unencrypted .
On T61 , the Wireless would not work .
However , the web camera via Skype worked as expected .
Taking the screenshot using the built - in utility did not show the camera image , probably because of the X settings .
This is consistent with my findings from approx .
9 months ago , when I tested web camera support in Linux .
Multimedia support
There were no ill surprises .
Flash worked out of the box .
Going to Youtube and playing Crockett 's
Theme was a breeze .
Windows video also played without any problems .
There were no MP3 playback available , due to legal hurdles , but in the simple tradition of Ubuntu , the distro suggested to search for suitable codecs .
I have demonstrated this simple procedure in my MP3 tutorial .
Samba sharing
In fact , before I could show you the multimedia support , I had to browse my network and pluck the media files off a Windows share .
There were no problems here , either .
Applications
gOS comes with a rich assortment of programs .
It even includes a number of proprietary applications , which definitely add to the spirit of the distro .
As we 've already seen , you have Skype VoIP available .
Google 's influence on this distro is quite evident .
Many of the icons in the dock point out to Google programs , like Google Maps and Google Docs , which open as single site applications in Prism .
For those of you wondering what Prism is , well you may want to read the linked article .
More importantly , Prism allows you to run individual sites and their content as in - browser applications , separate from other content , with no menus or toolbars to distract you .
For example , compare Youtube as seen in Prism , when launched via the dock icon versus the Firefox case earlier .
In the menu , you 'll find lots of useful stuff , including the standard Gnome bundle like GIMP , OpenOffice , Thunderbird , Pidgin , plus some extras like WINE , and others .
And if there 's anything missing , you just need to open the omnipotent Synaptic package manager and enjoy yourselves .
Appearance
gOS is definitely a very beautiful , streamlined distro with a distinctive OSX - like feel .
Some of you will find the positioning of Windows control buttons in the top left corner slightly confusing .
But that 's smoky grace for you - polished , clean lines , with very little unnecessary details to annoy the eye .
The choice of colors is also well executed , screaming soft elegance all over .
This also manifests in the choice of icons , for example , Windows network when you start your Samba sharing .
Or perhaps the AWN dock , with the zoom - in functionality , all this without any need for fancy 3D accelerations - works well and true on the most basic VESA cards :
Even the Firefox default homepage is classy :
So far , everything was working perfectly , except Wireless on T61 , a sore issue across the Linux distro board .
Google Gadgets also proved to be a Feng Shui problem , requiring lots of taming to bring into visual harmony , but this is a matter of taste .
One issue that did arise at the end was the restarting of the Gnome session .
There were no problems , but there was no automatic login either .
And I could not find the right combination of username / password to resume my session .
I tried root , guest , user , gos , and ubuntu , all without success .
And I did not chance upon any documentation suggesting what the magic words might be .
But I was pleased , very much pleased .
gOS had everything its forefathers created and then some .
Stability , ease of use and plenty of functionality at the snap of your fingers .
What more , good looks and Web 2.0 approach to appease the modern user .
Next , I installed gOS .
Installation
I did not expect any surprises - and there were none .
Ubuntu and its derivatives are known for being extremely simple to configure and install .
You have to bear through a simple wizard - like menu , pay some attention to partitioning and that 's it , you 're done .
The installation took only about 15 minutes .
And very soon , I was staring at the serene , beautiful gOS login session .
Finally , I tried to update the system .
As smooth as oil .
Conclusion
gOS Linux is definitely one of the better - looking distributions available .
Even if looks mean little to you , you 'll find its functionality of great use .
Most everything works out of the box or takes mere seconds to configure .
There 's no need to dabble in the command line , even though you can treat gOS as any other Linux .
Wireless , Bluetooth , web camera , codecs , all there and ready for you .
On top of these , you get quick links to the whims of the modern youth , Blogger , Youtube and whatnot , and some Google products .
On top of all these , you get the adamant stability and simplicity of Ubuntu and the tremendous APT / Synaptic package management .
Gadgets turned out to be a double - edged sword , so if you 're not keen on desktop widgets , then you should turn them off and save the eye tease .
Better hardware support is always desired , so I hope Wireless support for my cursed T61 will be sorted in the next release .
One thing I heard from colleagues is the issue is the contrast and clarity of fonts and colors used .
While I find them sufficiently pleasing , Mac users will most likely point out that they fall short of their operating system .
Honestly , I 'm in no position to argue this , but it's a valid point to consider for future versions .
Overall , gOS is an excellent choice for new users , Windows converts or people with a keen sense of aesthetics .
If you 're looking for a hassle - free distro that has the looks one step ahead of the rest , then gOS is the right Linux for you .
Enjoy !
Cheers .
Our ugly , but incredibly savory , delicious and popular umami loaded burger recipe ( umami hamburger ) now has an update .
This time , it became the ultimate umami loaded cheeseburger , which is updated in the recipe .
For the longest time , we ’ve been making the best darn umami hamburger recipe on the face of this earth ( insert personal bias . )
We ’ve never had a specific name for our homemade umami loaded burger recipe until someone tagged it as the “ magic meat ” , but not as in “ mystery meat ” or “ I ca n’t tell if this is chicken or beef . ”
Rather , it was to describe the magical flavor sensations that everyone experienced when they bit into one of our patties .
That “ magic meat ” term described the juicy , flavorful and savory burger patty that everyone fought over .
Sometimes the buns were tossed to the side or forgotten because the meat was just so delicious and satisfying .
Watch the video making these Ultimate Umami Hamburgers :
It was n’t until recently , with all the discussion on Umami ( the rich , savory taste in foods ) that our umami hamburger recipe was re-named as the hamburger loaded with umami .
Our hungry friends were always stumped to figure out the secret ingredient and could never , ever pinpoint that “ magic ” flavor that made our patties so unique .
It ’s the ultimate burger that is so satisfying and savory , no one can eat just one .
Make it a double , please .
But this umami rich burger recipe is n’t a new invention , nor is it a trendy recipe to keep up with the popularity of umami rich foods .
It ’s a family recipe that started from a Vietnamese family back in the early 80’s , in a 2 - bedroom apartment , in the middle of Southern California .
our ultimate umami loaded burgers are the highlights of our outdoor gatherings
Diane –
That Vietnamese family is obviously mine .
Growing up in a Vietnamese family of 6 kids who were always hungry and thirsty for more American foods , my parent had to figure out a way to feed their hungry pack of kids .
Back then , hamburgers were the “ American ’s food ” , “ that sandwich with that big piece of meat in it , with the red and yellow sauces and the sour cucumber slices . ”
My siblings and I wanted to eat “ Ham - buh - guh ” all day long and we wanted it NOW .
My parents figured out that it was much more economical to make burgers at home and did exactly that by created their own recipe for the patties .
Of course , being Vietnamese , they marinated the beef in the only way they knew how — splash fish sauce to it .
Fish sauce is the golden elixir to us Vietnamese , take it away and you drain the blood out of our cuisine .
Fish sauce is the fermented salvation from the food gods above , and it ’s pure umami brings out the savory depth in all foods .
With their batch of beef , my parents ’ splashed fish sauce as the one and only marinade into the burger recipe .
With the addition of a little sugar for balance , garlic for more aromatic love and black pepper for bite , their simple recipe has evolved into what our friends call today as “ The Ultimate Umami Burger . ”
This recipe is n’t unique by any means , especially in a Vietnamese household .
I ’m certain there are many Vietnamese - American families who splashed their burger meat with fish sauce !
Todd –
I know what a lot of you non-Asian people are thinking , “ Fish sauce ?
Um , hell no . ”
But wait , my dear skeptics , and listen to my confessional .
For many years when I first joined up with my beautiful Asian girlfriend , I avoided fish sauce .
Let ’s face it , it stinks like something most of us are not used to .
It is , after all , fermented anchovies .
Mmmm , tasty !
Not .
At least so I thought , but man , was I ever wrong .
One fine meal while dining on a grilled shrimp ball , I dipped it into the Vietnamese classic Nuoc Cham ( Viet Fish Sauce Dip ) and I suddenly saw the umami .
There was no nasty weird fishiness , instead the fish sauce ’s own flavor virtually disappeared and many of the other flavors within the grilled shrimp ball became heightened .
Everything was good before , but after the addition of the the fish sauce everything was incredible .
I was instantly converted .
Ever since I ’ve never hesitated in grabbing for the bottle of fish sauce .
It was my brother - in - law , a classic mid-west guy , who dubbed the fish sauce laden ground beef as the “ Magic Meat . ”
It was that damn tasty .
And now we have another believer in the umami .
Sure everything will be tasty without the umami adding fish sauce .
However , it will be even better with the magic sauce .
Oh btw - our forever family burger recipe was not inspired by any burger chains bearing a similar name .
This is definitely not an endorsement for anyones burger other than this one that Mom and Dad have been making for decades .
Our umami hamburger is way more simple , clean , un- fussy , un-pretntious and way more delicious because the ultimate umami comes from the fish sauce that we ’ve been using for decades .

Organic light emitting diodes , or OLEDs , promise to bring a great deal of flexibility to where we can put a display — literally .
Because of their organic components , it should be possible to create flexible and transparent displays , opening up a large number of potential uses .
But now , just as OLEDs may finally be ready for the consumer market , some engineers have figured out a way to get many of the same properties using inorganic LEDs ( ILEDs ) , using a method that 's so simple , even a biologist could understand it .
It 's a few years away — at least — from commercialization , but it 's a significant advance .
The paper that describes the process will be published today in Science .
The basic idea is that , since LEDs are so efficient at converting electrical charges to light , the human eye can detect the light of very small LEDs .
As a result , it 's possible to make a display out of a surface where only a small fraction is occupied by the actual LEDs , which can be small enough to be invisible to the naked eye .
Under these conditions , the display will take on the properties of whatever material the LEDs are embedded in : bendable , transparent , etc .
Unfortunately , although we 've gotten rather good at depositing the layered structure needed for making a normal ILED , the manufacturing processes we use do n't scale down to the size of individual pixels in a typical display , which need to be on the order of 100 �m or less .
So the researchers came up with a simple solution : make a big one , and then chop it into little pieces .
The researchers started with a permanent substrate topped with aluminum arsenide , and layered on all the typical materials ( gallium , indium , phosphorous , etc. ) needed to create an LED that would glow red .
When that was completed , they used a technique called plasma ion etching to cut a rectangular grid into the slab , leaving behind small squares , approximately 50�m across , held in place by the AlAs substrate .
The squares were then anchored in place by a small bit of material in two corners , and the AlAs substrate was etched away with hydrofluoric acid .
What was left was a grid of small LEDs held in place by two small posts that could be broken away easily .
This array , however , is packed so tightly that it would completely obscure any surface it was transferred to .
So the authors crafted printing devices from a flexible material that only contains slots for a subset of the total LED square ( say , every third one ) .
The elastic material can pick up the LEDs , " print " them onto a separate surface , and then return to the original source and pick up the next set over .
By adjusting how far apart the LED slots are — every second LED in the grid , or every fifth — it 's possible to print out devices with different spacing .
The authors prepared a flexible plastic surface by laying down a grid of wiring , printed the LEDs on it , and then locked them in place with epoxy ; a second mesh of wiring completed the circuit .
Given an adhesive , the plastic could be applied to just about anything .
For demonstration purposes , the authors stuck it to a glass cylinder .
They also created a wiring grid that acted as a passive matrix , allowing them to activate individual LEDs in the grid .
For these applications , the LEDs only took up about one percent of the total surface , enough to leave it transparent ( provided they were n't lit , obviously ) .
The authors also demonstrated how to create a bendable display .
By pre-stretching the flexible plastic substrate before laying down the wiring , the wiring would buckle within the material when tension was relaxed .
This provided enough slack to accommodate a fair degree of flexibility in the final material .
If , at this point , you think you 're missing something , you 're not — it really is that simple .
That said , it 's still a long way from being ready for the market .
The authors say that none of the LEDs failed during testing , but some of the wiring leading into the device was n't up to the strains of their test procedures .
As a result , most of the individual devices they made had rows of dead pixels .
All the devices only worked in red , as well .
Still , the process uses well - understood materials and techniques , so there 's no reason it can't be rapidly improved on , and the transition to a production environment does n't seem to face any major stumbling blocks .

UNDER THE MICROSCOPE : THE DOMESTIC cat may be the most popular pet , with more than 600 million in homes worldwide .
The cat was a cult animal in ancient Egypt and until recently it was believed it was first domesticated there about 3,600 years ago .
However , recent research indicates that domestication of the cat began about 10,000 years ago when agriculture was beginning .
The story is told by CA Driscoll , J Clutton Brock , A Kitchener and SJ O’Brien in Scientific American , June 2009 .
It was long suspected that all varieties of domestic cat are descended from the wild - cat species Felis silvestris , which is scattered throughout the Old World .
Researchers ( Driscoll , O’Brien and others ) recently analysed DNA from wildcats and domestic cats across the Old World to determine which subspecies of Felis silvestris gave rise to the house cat .
The DNA clustered into five groups , each coming from a specific region – Europe , central Asia , southern Africa , China and Middle East .
Domestic cats grouped only with Felis sylvestris lybica , the Middle Eastern wildcat , showing that all house cats are descended from Fs lybicaalone .
When was the house cat domesticated ?
In 2004 the National Museum of Natural History in Paris reported that adult human remains were found in a shallow 9,500 - year - old grave in Cyprus and 40 cm away in its own little grave was an eight - month - old cat whose body was oriented in the same direction as the human .
Cats are not native to most Mediterranean islands and must have been taken there by boat .
Together with the archaeological data , this indicates that people had developed a special relationship with cats almost 10,000 years ago , about the time agriculture was beginning in the Middle East .
There is good reason to wonder why cats and humans developed a special relationship .
Driscoll and colleagues point out that cats are unlikely candidates for domestication for a number of reasons .
First , other wild animals were domesticated to supply humans with food , clothing or labour , but cats contribute neither sustenance nor work to humans .
Second , cats would be difficult to domesticate .
The ancestors of most domesticated animals lived in herds with hierarchical structures .
Humans simply supplanted the dominant herd individual .
Cats , however , are solitary hunters that defend their territory .
They are obligatory carnivores and cannot be fed on easily available plant foods .
And cats certainly do not take well to instruction .
It is therefore highly likely that cats chose humans rather than the other way around as with other domesticates .
Settlements at the dawn of agriculture about 10,000 years ago provided new opportunities for animals capable of exploiting them , for example the house mouse who moved indoors to feed on stores of wild grain .
These mice attracted cats , as did trash heaps on the outskirts of settlements .
Natural selection favoured the survival of those cats capable of collaboration with humans .
Cats would have appeared attractive to humans since they got rid of mice and snakes .
Also , wildcats have “ cute ” features – snub face , large eyes and high rounded forehead – known to elicit nurturing feelings in humans .
The authors explain that as agriculture spread out from the Fertile Crescent , so too did the now tame
Fs lybica , occupying the same niche everywhere they went , thereby preventing the local wildcat population from fulfilling that role .
The high - point of the domestic cat came during Egypt ’s golden era , which began 3,600 years ago .
Paintings from that period show that cats were fully domesticated .
The cat became the “ official deity ” of Egypt in the form of the goddess Bastet .
Egypt banned the export of cats for centuries , but by 2,500 years ago cats had reached Greece , from where they spread throughout the Roman Empire .
Cats spread to the east about 2,000 years ago along trade routes .
These cats evolved along their own trajectory in the absence of native wildcats with whom to interbreed .
Isolated groups of oriental domestic cats developed distinctive coat colours and other mutations through a process called genetic drift , leading to the emergence of “ natural breeds ” such as the Siamese cat .
The Mayflower brought cats to the US and cats reached Australia with European explorers in the 1600s .
Serious efforts to produce novel breeds of cat did not begin until relatively recently .
Nearly 60 breeds of domestic cat are now recognised .
Genetic differences between domestic cat breeds are slight , comparable to that between adjacent human populations such as French and Italians .
We do not see the wide variety of size , shape and temperaments in cats as we do in dogs , eg Great Dane and chihuahua .
Humans have selectively bred dogs since prehistoric times to do useful things such as herding , guarding , hunting and so on , but cats show no inclination to do tasks that are useful to humans and consequently were never subjected to much selective breeding pressures .

Conwy
Still surrounded by its original medieval town walls , Conwy abounds with attractions for all ages .
Whether you 're interested in historic buildings , museums , wildlife or the pursuit of outdoor adventures , you 'll find it in all in Conwy .
It is simply an ideal tourist destination for all ages at any time of the year !
Step over a wall , slide down an embankment and tread carefully along a slime - covered path and you are in Habib Nalah - a shadow world of heroin addiction fuelled by the opium boom across the nearby Afghan border .
More than 500 men , from teenagers to grandfathers , are gathered at the edge of a giant drain that snakes through central Quetta .
The scene has a nightmarish quality .
Black sewage water oozes down the middle and dried excrement litters the path that runs alongside .
A suffocating stench clogs the air .
Clusters of addicts hunker by the stream , under a line of gloomy pillars supporting the shops overhead .
They are " chasing the dragon " : delicately burning brown heroin powder on foil paper , sucking the pungent fumes with a pipe , then slouching backwards , eyes rolling .
In one corner a moaning man is crouched in a ball , head gripped in his hands .
Whether immersed in a personal heaven or hell , it is hard to tell .
Another begs money for treatment .
" Just one last chance , " pleads Muhammad Daud , 22 .
" Otherwise , just shoot me now . "
Record crop
Most of this year 's bumper opium crop from Afghanistan - worth a record $ 2.8 bn ( £ 1.45 bn ) - will find its way to lucrative European markets .
Peddled on back streets from Manchester to Moscow , it will cause more than 10,000 deaths , according to a recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime .
But as the drugs pass along age - old smuggling routes , some spill over into local markets , with devastating consequences .
Pakistan has about 500,000 chronic heroin addicts ; Iran has 1 million , according to the UN .
The problem was born of the 1980s opium boom .
Now it appears unstoppable .
Junkies from across Pakistan flock to Quetta , 60 miles south of the lawless border .
Here heroin costs just 70 rupees ( 60 p ) for a sachet , and the supply is abundant .
Muhammad Jawaid arrived from Multan , 500 miles to the south , seven months ago .
Once a painter , he now collects rubbish to feed his habit .
" At home it costs 200 rupees for a sachet , " he says .
" Still , I want to go back .
But I can't . "
Habib Nalah 's heroin dens have an air of permanency .
Sheets strung between the pillars divide the drain into compartments .
Ragged posters of Indian film stars are pinned to the greasy walls .
Vendors sell sweet tea , matches and tranquilisers .
A whiff of hashish drifts through the air .
The addicts wash under a leaking water pipe .
The " saqis " hover nearby .
These are the dealers who divide up the heroin smuggled from Afghan refugee camps .
They also mediate disputes , bribe police and maintain social order .
When an addict dies a saqi pays four men one sachet each to haul the body up to the street .
Up to 800 addicts live here during the summer season , says Aftab Ali , a courageous social worker known by all the addicts .
There are no age limits .
One compartment has grandfathers with whiskery beards and kindly smiles .
The next has a teenage boy .
Nassir , a grubby - fingered 15 - year - old , says his mother carried him here nine years ago .
Now she is dead , Nassir has become an addict , and Habib Nalah is home .
" My brother has given up , but not me , " he shrugs .
" Can you give me some change ? "
The flood of Afghan opium has swamped Pakistani security forces .
Breaking the supply pipeline is near impossible , says Brig Anwar ul Haq , head of the Anti-Narcotics Force for Balochistan province .
Smugglers flit across the long , leaky desert border using ancient wiles and modern technology .
Donkeys , camels and heavily armed convoys carry the drugs .
The criminals outfox border surveillance with satellite phones and , if necessary , shoot their way out of trouble with rifles and rockets .
" They are highly mobile and technically advanced , " he says .
In 2004 the Balochistan force confiscated seven tonnes of morphine and 157kg ( 346lb ) of heroin .
In contrast , Afghanistan 's opium harvest was estimated at 4,200 tonnes , and the traffickers earned $ 2.2bn .
One problem is the lack of cooperation between security forces .
" Until intelligence is shared across the border we are always in a reactive mode , " says Brig Anwar .
Bribery is another weakness , admits Shoukat Haider Changezi , chief of the Levies , a tribal - based rural police force .
" An officer earns 3,500 rupees .
Then his cousin , who is from the same tribe , offers him 10 times as much to turn a blind eye .
It 's a fortune , " he says .
The best heroin - known as " rose quality " - is re-exported from smuggling ports on the Arabian sea , or spirited across the border into Iran .
The lower - grade drug is sold locally .
HIV infection
Soaring HIV rates linked to increasing needle use is the latest worry for authorities in Karachi , Lahore and smaller cities .
In Habib Nalah most addicts still " chase the dragon " , but say they want to stop .
The lucky ones make it to the Milo Shaheed Trust , one of five rehab centres in Quetta .
The " cold turkey " treatment is tough - three months of forced withdrawal with only multi-vitamins as a substitute - and the relapse rate is 75 % .
Abdul Rehman is in rehab for the 15th time .
A junkie since 1978 , he checked in 70 days ago .
" This is my last chance , " he says .
Muhammad Zia , 26 , came from Ghazni in central Afghanistan .
" A friend introduced me to heroin five years ago .
He said it 's like entering paradise .
But believe me , I have gone through hell , " he says .
Mr Zia came to Quetta after his father expelled him from home .
He knew dozens of other addicts , he says .
" There are many people with the same problem , even women , in Ghazni .
They just stay in their houses and smoke , smoke , smoke . "
For some , though , there is no last chance .
The following day Mr Ali , the social worker , carries the body of Mohsin Ali to a local mosque to be washed before burial .
The 28 - year - old Afghan refugee died earlier in the morning , four days after entering the Milo Shaheed centre .
" He had been eating and smoking opium for years .
Yesterday he became very sick with swollen lungs , " says Mr Aftab , carefully pulling the blue gown off the corpse .
" We called the doctor to come and help .
But it was too late . "
It is a rite of passage for teenage boys - the often ridiculed appearance of a first moustache .
But when Akaash Iqbal , 14 , came into school with a slightly hairy upper lip it turned out to be no laughing matter .
He was sent home and told not to return unless he shaves it off .
But he and his family say the school is overreacting over a ' bit of fluff ' and refuse to remove it .
Akaash has now missed nearly two weeks of schooling and last night his parents accused the school of jeopardising his education .
His father Asif Mahmood , 42 , said : ' It 's a nonsense .
He 's not shaving - he 's only 14 and if he starts now he 'll have to do it for the rest of his life .
' They told us the moustache was not part of the uniform .
I thought it was a joke at first .
'
It is only a bit of fluff - you could hardly call it a moustache but he is just a child and should n't have to shave this young .
' They should make it a girls ' school .
I 'm honestly staggered by it .
'I had a call telling me to have a razor on standby , shave Akaash when he got home and send him back .
'He added : ' I was n't going to do that .
He 's just a growing boy .
He 'd end up with stubble all over his face by the time he 's 16 .
' Mr Mahmood said his son is still at home and he is due to meet school officials soon to discuss the matter .
The incident happened at Manchester Academy in Moss Side , Manchester .
The charity - run school has a uniform policy that even staff are expected to comply with .
Akaash , of nearby Fallowfield , is a Muslim , so unlike Sikhs he has no religious reason to avoid shaving .
However , the teenager says he does not want to start shaving regularly at his age as it will ruin his skin .
He said all his schoolmates are supportive and have vowed not to shave if they are targeted by the teachers .
The schoolboy , who is due to take his GCSEs next year , said : ' They 've embarrassed me and they 've embarrassed my family .
I was walking down the corridor to registration and one of the teachers took me into a room .
'I was made to stay there for an hour .
They then told me that my moustache was against the uniform rules and told me to go home and shave it .
'I 'm not shaving it at my age .
It will ruin my face .
I 've got a GCSE to sit and am taking the rest of them next year but I can't go to school .
It 's just not nice .
I feel left out .
'A spokesman for Manchester Academy , which has more than 700 pupils , said it was a standard requirement that all children are clean shaven .
She said : ' We do not believe it is appropriate to comment on individual students within the Academy .

While Walmart reported earnings that topped analysts ' forecasts Thursday , its UK unit Asda saw sales surge 7 % as millions of customers flocked to pick up goods at discount prices .
Asda CFO Judith McKenna discusses the chain 's cautious outlook .
20th Century Fox has followed in Universal 's footsteps by yanking its DVDs out of Redbox , the bargain - basement - priced DVD rental kiosks .
Ars was tipped off by a reader that the studio , which has never entered into an agreement directly with Redbox , has ordered its wholesalers not to sell its DVDs to Redbox until 30 days after release .
The move reflects the movie industry 's fear and loathing of this new DVD rental market , reducing people 's visits to places like Blockbuster and reducing the studios ' ability to try and sell DVDs to customers .
Redbox is jointly owned by Coinstar and a subsidiary of McDonald 's and acts as a self - service DVD distributor that operates kiosks at over 10,000 retail locations in the US ( including McDonald's , Walmarts , Walgreens , and grocery stores ) .
The kiosks , which each house more than 600 DVDs , rent out movies for $ 1 per day and sell used movies for $ 7 .
The company 's Web - based inventory system makes it possible for consumers to select their movies over the Internet and reserve them in advance at a specified Redbox kiosk .
The company has more kiosks than Blockbuster has stores , and each kiosk rents out an average of 50 movies per day .
The company does not , however , have any sort of partnership with most of the major movie studios .
Sony is the only one that has recently struck a distribution deal with Redbox — the company otherwise obtains its DVDs through wholesale movie suppliers , such as Ingram and VPD , that have contracts with the movie studios .
Movie giant Universal was the first to pick a bone with this arrangement , threatening to sever contracts with distributors unless they stopped providing DVDs to Redbox until 45 days after release .
Redbox then sued Universal for engaging in anticompetitive behavior and abusing copyright law , as well as trying to use coercive tactics to get Redbox to shell out 40 percent of its total gross revenues in exchange for new releases .
Universal responded by countersuing , and a decision on the case is expected to land very soon .
Fox apparently liked Universal 's tactics , and is following suit with its own orders to distributors .
According to an unnamed source from Fox speaking to the Wall Street Journal , Fox said that it 's still open to making DVDs available on their release dates if Redbox agrees to " better economic terms , such as sharing rental revenue , " but that Redbox had declined the offer .
Another source speaking to Reuters said that the company is prepared for a lawsuit from Redbox in response to its decision to withhold DVDs .
Officially , Fox 's parent company News Corp. acknowledged that the reason for the move is because it believes outlets like Redbox are essentially ruining its business .
" Having our [ movies ] rented at $ 1 in the rental window is grossly undervaluing our products , " News Corp COO Chase Carey said on a conference call yesterday .
" We are actively determining how to deal with it . "

Interesting FACT
The Truth About Energy Drinks
Added by Division on Aug 20 , 2009 | Visited by 9398 | Voted by 51 persons
The other day I had an interesting chat with my friend from Mozambique about our kids .
Obviously we also discussed children ’s ’ health issues .
My African counterpart complained that nowadays more and more kids ( and people in general ) in their country have diabetes , cancer , overweight problems or other illnesses , which 25 - 30 years ago were quite rare or affected mostly the elderly .
Since Africa is not so much “ suffering ” from industrialization , we came to the conclusion that these hazardous trends have been caused by massive inflow of various colored drinks and fast foods .
If fast food has got a massive coverage about its unhealthiness , the wide variety of beverages still is a kind of shadow zone , continuously having massive advertising and promotion .
The fact that on most labels of those drinks one can find probably half of the Mendeleev table chemical elements ( colorants , preservatives , emulgators , taste enhancers , and so on ) seems not to bother too much neither parents , nor kids .
Above that , the plastic bottles are now said to be quite harmful , too , especially when the liquids are stored for quite a while in them and if those bottles get under direct sunlight .
If with these fizzy chemical drinks we all just get slowly poisoned , the new kind of energy drinks that appeared about a decade ago and are steadily getting widespread , will probably not only poison us , but also affect our hormonal and psychological well - being .
Since their introduction at the end of the 20th century , energy drinks have continuously gained popularity , especially among students , who have been consuming Red Bull to stay awake when learning for exams .
Since then a number of studies have been carried out on energy drinks and most of them showed that Red Bull along with other energy drinks can be hazardous for health , containing high amount of caffeine and sugar .
The caffeine content in some drinks equals 14 cans of soda .
Obviously the producers of energy drinks doubt such study results , claiming that the amount of caffeine in energy drinks is the same as in a cup of brewed coffee , large cappuccinos or lattes served in Starbucks , the difference is that no one asks Starbucks to put a warning label on their products .
This is , however , the only defense argument brought by the energy drink manufacturers .
The truth is that these companies will never recognize that one small shot of their energy drink can lead to serious health problems .
Some healthcare experts proposed the introduction of warning labels on energy drinks .
In response Maureen Storey , PhD , a spokeswoman for the American Beverage Association said that if energy drink companies put labels on their drinks , the same labels should be put on coffeehouse coffee .
Some companies add herbal ingredients , for example taurine and guarana , along with different vitamins and minerals , but all of these are just part of a marketing campaign that aims towards persuading people that the drinks are healthy .
It is worth mentioning that today only in the United States the energy drink market is a $ 5.4 billion a year business .
Due to the fact that the high amount of caffeine in energy drinks raises blood pressure , people get a temporary feeling of energy , which lasts for a very short period of time .
Then the human body suffers a fast drop in energy as a result of caffeine and sugar leaving the bloodstream .
As a result of the fast energy decrease , people can experience sluggishness , mood changes , and a burned out feeling .
Sometimes the feeling of energy is false .
The poison control centers in the United States reported on several cases of bad reaction on energy drinks .
Some of the outcomes from energy drink consumption were published in the journal \ " Drug and Alcohol Dependence\ " ; these include nausea and vomiting , high blood pressure , tremors , dizziness , and numbness .
Other studies found that the possible health risks from consuming energy drinks such as Red Bull and Burn also include depression , poor sleeping habits , additive behaviors and even premature aging .
Sometimes young people combine energy drinks with alcohol ( vodka in particular ) , which can have very serious consequences and even lead to death .
After a number of deaths have been registered in France and Denmark among young people that mixed energy drinks with alcohol , the governments of both nations decided to ban the sales of Red Bull and the like .
According to nutrition coach Josh Rubin from San Marcos , California , energy drinks are \ " a scam to get people to keep coming back .
When you eat sugar , gluten , etc. your body releases opiates .
Then when you stop drinking this crap , you body craves it and you need more . \ "
In addition , the company producing energy drinks do not inform people that these drinks can cause addiction and those who stop consuming caffeine can suffer from headache , fatigue , depressed mood and difficulty concentrating .
Some people consume energy drinks when they \'re thirsty , without being aware of the fact that high levels of sugar thicken their blood , while caffeine leads to dehydration , which means that you need to drink even more again to quench your thirst !
Thus , you create a vicious circle , which is quite hazardous for those who regularly do physical exercises .
Energy drinks can worsen insulin sensitivity , leading to diabetes , obesity and chronic illness , with children considered to be the most vulnerable .
Still , companies such as the Austrian Red Bull GmbH , continue producing their drinks and young people continue consuming them for different purposes .
Hope it won\'t require a lot of victims to finally understand the serious problem behind the energy drinks .
Having established the above , I did a small experiment on myself : one day in the gym and after sports I was consuming Red Bull , and I obviously felt energetic , though it was somewhat an unnatural feeling , like it was not me inside .
Then it happened exactly , how it is described above : sudden loss of energy , very bad overnight sleep , and next day I felt ruined .
In a few days I took a bottle of natural well water from the countryside , and drunk only that .
Men , that was not only the true thirst quencher , but also a tasty truly healthy drink , which felt like passing the energy of Earth into the body !

COLUMBIA , S.C. — South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford , still clinging to office after admitting to an extramarital affair , wrote in an opinion piece released today that God will change him so he can emerge from the scandal a more humble and effective leader .
“ While none of us has the chance to attend our own funeral , in many ways I feel like I was at my own in the past weeks , and surprisingly I am thankful for the perspective it has afforded , ” Sanford wrote in the opinion piece distributed statewide for newspapers today .
Sanford , a two - term Republican , returned from a mysterious , nearly weeklong disappearance last month to reveal a romance with a longtime friend in Argentina .
In a series of Associated Press interviews , he described the woman as his “ soul mate ” but said he would work to repair his relationship with his wife , Jenny , the mother of their four sons .
Some lawmakers have called for Sanford to resign , and one state senator plans hearings on whether state money was used to facilitate the trysts .
A criminal probe found nothing illegal .
Sanford and his wife left the state earlier this week for an undisclosed location and are expected to return Sunday evening , spokesman Joel Sawyer said .
In the opinion , Sanford vows to work with lawmakers he ’s long fought and cites scripture and his faith in God — just as he ’s done in his few public appearances since admitting the affair .
“ It ’s in the spirit of making good from bad that I am committing to you and the larger family of South Carolinians to use this experience to both trust God in his larger work of changing me , and from my end , to work to becoming a better and more effective leader , ” he wrote .
The promise comes as the term - limited governor approaches his final legislative session .
Even before the scandal , he admitted the session would offer him little chance of success in pushing a small - government agenda that sought to give his office more authority .
The possibility of a White House run in 2012 has all but disappeared .
He ’s known for slamming fellow Republicans who control state government — once by carrying two piglets to the door of the House chamber to protest spending .
More recently , a court order forced Sanford to seek federal stimulus money he refused to accept because of his libertarian principles , despite warnings from education officials of massive teacher layoffs .
Legislators said the governor ’s previous pledges to work together always quickly disintegrated .
“ We ’ve heard it every year , ” said House Labor Commerce and Industry Chairman Bill Sandifer .
He said he told the governor , “ You have gone out of your way to make enemies .
You ’ve done absolutely nothing to make friends , and now you want us all to be your friends ?
That ’s a pretty tough pill to swallow . ”
Sanford , who has long fought to give the governor ’s office more control in the legislatively strong state , wrote that he would continue to push his agenda .
Senate Minority Leader John Land , also frequently at odds with Sanford , doubts the governor can change .
“ If he did n’t get his way , he ’d take his balls and go home , so he left a lot of things on the table , ” the Democrat said .
“ You do n’t all of a sudden have a midlife crisis and suddenly get along with people . ”

I sit in my hotel room .
Michael is two days late for our meeting ( which is normal ) , when he suddenly bursts in the door and immediately starts talking .
I scramble for my notebook .
Bay : Okay I 'm gonna hit you with it right off !
Ready ?
Last night while I ’m coked out of my gourd and wrestling with these hookers - all 10’s - I see my sack in one of the mirrors I have set up and I realize , Bay , bro , we gotta see some robot balls in the movie !
Blam !
I look at him patiently , waiting for the rest of the idea .
Bay : Blam !
Me : Oh .
Um , balls ?
Like the Transformers have testicles ?
Bay :
They would right ?
They 're badass dudes !
Me :
So will this be a joke then ?
You want one of the Autobots to get kicked in the nuts or something ?
Bay : Nah .
Just put balls in the movie somewhere .
Like , just have one of the characters point out the robot 's sack .
Done .
Me :
What ’s the point then ?
Bay :
Things do n’t need points .
Bay :
Things do n’t need points .
Me : Gotcha .

Bay : Oh !
And I was watching that movie ZULU in my Hummer just now and it hit me - that old robot they meet in the Smithsonian , he should be like an old - school ZULU British dude .
( attempting accent ) .
Whaza all dis den ?
( he laughs ) Blam !
Me : I can work with that .
Although , last time you said you wanted Jetfire to be a SR - 71 Blackbird .
Should we make him an old WWII British fighter or something now ?
Bay : The Blackbird is tits .
What ’s the problem ?
Me : Nothing really , but that plane is from the 60’s and it ’s American .
Why would Jetfire have taken on a British accent if he was posing as an American machine ?
Bay :
Do n’t be a fag .
The audience does n’t care about shit like that .
They ca n’t think with all their blood stuck in the rock - hard boners I ’m giving them .
( looks at watch ) I wanna hit the buffet at the strip club .
Anything else we need to jam on ?
Me : Oh .
Um , well , I ’m still a little concerned about the Autobot Twins .
I got your email suggesting they be illiterate .
That …. are n’t you worried that people will say they ’re racist stereotypes ?
Bay : Racist against what ?
Robots ?
Me : Black people .
In the first movie you had a jive - talking black Autobot and he was also the only Autobot to die .
It kinda seems like you ’re doing this on purpose .
Bay : I ’ll have a white guy do one of the Twin ’s voices .
Fixed .
Me : I think that makes it worse actually - Michael suddenly throws a hand up to silence me .
He is making a weird face .
Finally he farts loudly , then he cups his hand to his ass and wafts the fart in my face .
He laughs , then his eyes light up : Bay : Oh !
Bro! Farts !
Make the old British robot fart !
Old people ca n’t control their ass .
My grandma shit her pants once when we visited her .
Fucking hilarious .
I look at my notes .
They now read “ robot balls ” and “ robot farts . ”
I look back up at Michael , sullenly .
He ’s smiling .
Bay :
Mint that shit !
Blam !
( CNN ) -- Chastity Bono , gay - rights activist and child of performer Cher and the late entertainer and politician Sonny Bono , is in the early stages of transitioning from a female to a male and will be known as Chaz , his spokesman said Thursday .
Activist Chastity Bono is transitioning from female to male and will be known as Chaz .

" Chaz , after many years of consideration , has made the courageous decision to honor his true identity , " Howard Bragman said in a written statement .
" He is proud of his decision and grateful for the support and respect that has already been shown by his loved ones .
It is Chaz 's hope that his choice to transition will open the hearts and minds of the public regarding this issue , just as his ' coming out ' did nearly 20 years ago . "
Someone 's decision to transition does not necessarily mean they are undergoing gender reassignment surgery , and in many cases they do not , said Mara Keisling , executive director of the Washington - based National Center for Transgender Equality .
" The whole media fixation on surgery is kind of misplaced , " she said .
" Almost no transgender people ever have surgery .
We do n't have any idea how many do . "
iReport.com :
Do you have a transgender story ?
An estimated one - quarter to one - half percent of the American population is transsexual , however , Keisling said .
" It 's sort of a general term that encompasses both or either a social transition or a medical transition . "
Do n't Miss Oprah.com : Pain of being born in wrong body
Keisling said she was unaware of the specifics in Bono 's case , but speaking generally , a transition means that he will now want to be " known , seen , viewed " as a male .
" The actual details depend on his needs and wants and his doctor 's needs and wants , " she said .
Bragman asked that the media " respect Chaz 's privacy during this long process , as he will not be doing any interviews at this time . "
Now 40 , Bono as a little girl made regular appearances on her parents ' show , " The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour . "
As an adult , he has been a longtime gay - rights advocate and been closely associated with the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation .

It will also force private ones to reserve at least a quarter of their places for poor children .
Currently about 70 million children receive no schooling , and more than a third of the population is illiterate .
The bill was passed by the upper house last month .
It now needs presidential assent - a mere formality , correspondents say - to become law .
' New era ' India 's Minister for Human Resource Development Kapil Sibal described the passage of the bill as " harbinger of a new era " for children to meet the challenges of the 21st century .
" We as a nation can not afford our children not going to schools , " he said .
The minister said the bill covers children with disabilities and that the government is planning to set up special schools for them .
" This bill provides for the inclusion of children who are disadvantaged because of disability .
The government is not only setting up special schools for them but doing all it can to provide education to them in all types of schools , " Mr Sibal said .
The bill also ends widespread practices by which schools impose admission fees on parents to guarantee their children a place and bureaucrats enjoy discretionary powers on deciding who to let in .
Achieving universal education is one of the UN's Millennium Development Goals to be met by the year 2015 .
Critics of the bill , however , say it is not clear how the government plans to pay for this .
Also , they say it does not cover children below the age of six and therefore fails to recognise the importance of the early years of a child 's development .
They say it also does little to address India 's inequitable school system under which there are vast discrepancies between well - funded private schools and state - run schools with poor quality teaching staff and infrastructure .
At the moment India spends a little over 3 % of its GDP on education .

Married women in the U.S. do about 70 to 80 percent of the housework .
When women marry , the number of hours they spend on housework increases ; for men , it stays the same .
When couples have children , her housework increases three times as much as his .
Feminist women do less housework than non-feminist women ; men married to feminist women do the same amount of housework as men married to non-feminist women .
All this and more , including some data on Portugal , China , Russia , South Africa , Italy , Britain , and the Netherlands , can be found at this fact sheet at the blog Social Studies .
The discrepancy between the number of hours wives and husbands contribute to housework decreased between 1965 and 1995 :
According to the fact sheet :
… in the 1990s , U.S. women spent about half the time on housework as they had 30 years earlier ( 17.5 hours down from 30 each week ) , while men , on the other hand , were spending just over twice the time they had spent ( 10 hours up from 4.9 ) .
Women , however , still do nearly twice the amount of housework as men .
You may notice that the increase in hours that husbands now spend on housework does not match the decrease in hours that wives now spend on housework .
This means that we have dirtier houses ( no , really , we do ) .
We also now hire housecleaners , and that makes up some of the difference .
It may also be true that our gadgets ( e.g. , washers and dryers ) save us time .

While the rest of the world spent yesterday lounging in the sun , the music fans went online to hunt for the secret behind Radiohead 's new song .
As previously reported , a track called These Are My Twisted Words appeared online around midday on Wednesday .
Now , internet sleuths are following the breadcrumb trail – imagining the leak could lead to Thom Yorke himself .
Here is what is known : These Are My Twisted Words first appeared via the filesharing website What.cd .
The file was called " 01 radiohead these are my twisted words ( advance ) 2009 woi.mp3 " .
It was the first post from a user called " crza " , offering an MP3 and " info " file , typical of pirated music leaks .
crza has been a member of What.cd for just under a year and a half .
His previously downloads include Animal Collective 's Merriweather Post Pavilion , Eddie Kendricks 's People ... Hold On , and plug-ins for the post - production software Shake .
crza changed his privacy settings shortly before uploading the song , making it hard to learn more about him .
The " info " file is just text , formatted to contain a picture .
You can view it here .
Like most info files , crza 's version includes technical information on the song – its length , file size and quality .
Unlike most info files , it also includes an inscrutable poem .
The poem reads as follows :
i just wanted to reassure readers
that following representations
seeking confirmation
that before your very eyes
behind the wall of ice
that the box is not under threat
however they are set to remove
other boxes
in fact i have the list in front of me
i went to a briefing on their plans
and challenged them to tell me
exactly what the cost would be
they spoke in broad terms
The info file – and the song 's original filename – have references to a mysterious " Wall of Ice " or " WOI " .
Though this could be the name of a release group that stole and leaked the track , no group with that name seems to have acted before .
Some Radiohead fans have suggested that Wall of Ice is the name of a forthcoming Radiohead EP – possibly due on 17 August , the " release date " listed in the info file .
They point to Thom Yorke 's recent interview with The Believer magazine , where besides criticising CDs and proposing that Radiohead forego the album format , Yorke also said that the band had a " good plan " for releasing new singles and EPs .
" We 've got this great idea for putting things out , " he said , " but I can't tell you what it is , because someone will rip it off . "
Elsewhere in the February interview Yorke described a model proposed by producer Nigel Godrich : " He says , like , OK , we book in for three days , and at the end of the three days we put two tracks up every week and we do it for six weeks .
I mean , it 'll never happen , but that idea of , we put it out even if we do n't know what it is and then , oh dear , it 's out . "
Could These Are My Twisted Words be the first of these songs ?
Might Radiohead be pretending to be a release group , deliberately leaking their own music to torrent sites ?
A few things make it unlikely .
First of all , there are all these silly aliases : crza , sca [ GG ] er ( listed as the " ripper " in the info file ) , racy 251 ( who drew the info - file 's ASCII picture ) .
None of these names seem like Radiohead 's style .
Other aspects of the info file are similarly do not seem like Radiohead .
The rippers describe their favourite genres as " doomcore , folktronica , ukf " , which would n't be true of the band – or even a particularly good joke .
Besides , Radiohead have a popular website and a successful digital music store .
Why resort to illegal torrent sites like what.cd ?
Then again , there is apparently evidence that connects the file data ( specifically , the ISRC field ) of These Are My Twisted Words with the only " official " recent Radiohead release , Harry Patch ( In Memory of ) .
Some fans say they were created on the same computer .
And the info file is suitably mysterious when it describes the sort of people Wall of Ice are " looking for " .
Whereas most release groups would specify things like , " people who work in CD pressing factories " , this document says they want " talented puppeteers , worms , disgruntled executives , sacked flies " .
They might as well be Radiohead lyrics .
Though we will find out soon enough whether a new Radiohead EP is due on 17 August , fans have also proposed one more theory .
After all , Yorke was recently said to be writing a track for the next Twilight film , New Moon .
Could the film 's crew simply have been indiscreet with the song , resulting in its leak ?
Radiohead have yet to comment on the song .
The Nobel laureate Sir William Golding , whose novel Lord of the Flies turned notions of childhood innocence on their head , admitted in private papers that he had tried to rape a 15 - year - old girl during his teenage years , it emerged today .
Golding 's papers also described how he had experimented , while a teacher at a public school , with setting boys against one another in the manner of Lord of the Flies , which tells the story of young air crash survivors on a desert island during a nuclear war .
The revelations will appear in a forthcoming biography of the writer , who died in 1993 at the age of 81 .
John Carey , the emeritus professor of English literature at Oxford university , was given access to a personal journal kept by Golding – who carefully guarded personal information during his life – for 20 years .
The book also draws on an unpublished memoir written by Golding for his wife , Ann , who died in 1995 and is buried beside him at Salisbury , Wiltshire .
The couple were married for 54 years , and Golding felt the honesty of his account would explain what he described as the " monstrous " side of his character .
The memoir , entitled Men and Women Now , makes no attempt to hide the author 's regular dependence on drink to fight his demons .
He was also explicit about problems with his parents , and suggested that the girl he tried to rape had later plotted to get his father , a grammar school teacher in Marlborough , to watch them having sex in a field through binoculars .
Carey outlined his findings in the Sunday Times , for which he is the chief reviewer , in advance of extracts from the biography which will be published next week .
The attempted rape involved a Marlborough girl , named Dora , who had taken piano lessons with Golding .
It happened when he was 18 and on holiday during his first year at Oxford .
Carey quotes the memoir as partially excusing the attempted rape on the grounds that Dora was " depraved by nature " and , at 14 , was " already sexy as an ape " .
It reveals that Golding told his wife he had been sure the girl " wanted heavy sex " .
She fought him off and ran away as he stood there shouting : " I 'm not going to hurt you , " the memoir said .
Two years later , the pair met again and had sex in a field , with Golding again introducing crudity by quoting the girl 's foreplay remark : " Should I have all that rammed up my guts ? "
The author was convinced her approach to his father was a deliberate attempt to discredit him and his older brother who , coincidentally , was having sex with his girlfriend in the same field .
The literary archives opened to Carey also include a second autobiographical work and three unpublished novels .
Golding 's written estate has already been productive : his last novel , the Double Tongue , was published in 1995 , two years after his death .
The author 's psychological experiments with his classes at Bishop Wordsworth 's school , in Salisbury , caused his eyes " to come out like organ stops " , according to his private journal .
He divided pupils into gangs , with one attacking a prehistoric camp and the other defending it .
In the process , Simon , Ralph , Piggy and the other characters in Lord of the Flies may have been born .
* Canadian video game studio to open later this year
* Ontario gov’t to invest C$ 262 million in Ubisoft
TORONTO , July 6 ( Reuters ) - French videogame maker Ubisoft Entertainment SA UBIP .
PA is set to open a Toronto studio that will create 800 jobs over 10 years , the Ontario government said on Monday .
The Canadian province said in a statement it will invest C$ 263 million ( $ 227 million ) over 10 years in the company .
It added that Ubisoft will invest over half a billion in the video game studio , expected to open later this year .
Ontario , Canada ’s manufacturing heartland , has been losing jobs in the midst of the nagging global economic downturn .
The announcement comes just one month after data showed Canada ’s unemployment rate hit an 11 - year high in May as the recession resulted in big layoffs .
The unemployment rate in Toronto was 9.3 percent in May .

BIG INSURANCE GIVES OUT AWARDS FOR SCARIEST LIES ABOUT HEATH CARE REFORM
" Since big government prohibits us from feeding Muslims to the lions , what better way to keep people 's eyes off the ball with a fun contest ? "
-- Ed Hanway , CEO of CIGNA
Satire by R J Shulman
BETHESDA , Maryland - ( PTSD News ) -
Two heath insurance giants have announced the winners of their " Scare Health Care Reform to Death " contest .
Starting in March , UnitedHealthcare and CIGNA Health Insurance joined forces to create a contest that would award prizes to American citizens who came up with the scariest talking points against health care reform , slogans that would most likely turn public opinion against any changes to the current system .
Truth was not a requirement -- in fact , it was discouraged for blocking the creative process .
" We had to distract the public from the fact that a whopping portion of America 's wealth has been flowing into a few big insurance and pharmaceutical companies , " said Stephen Hemsley , CEO of UnitedHealthcare .
" We especially wanted to keep them from finding out about my bonus , my salary and my stock options , said Ed Hanway , chairman and CEO of CIGNA , " and since big government prohibits us from feeding Muslims to the lions , what better way to keep people 's eyes off the ball with a fun contest ? "
The response has been decent , according to CIGNA , if a bit derivative .
" About 95 % of the entries said , ' it costs too much taxpayer money ' and included a tea bag , " said Hanway .
The winners were announced earlier today on " Fox and Friends . "
Fifth place honors , and the recipient of an " I Killed Health Care Reform " button , went to Frank Pharr of Henderson , North Carolina .
Mr. Pharr entered , " Kiss your granny good - bye before Obama 's plan does . "
Fourth place went to Floydene Spangler of Big Spring , Texas , who won a picture of Hanway 's $ 134 million dollar mansion on the Jersey shore .
She entered , " Obama 's heath care plan will force you to give up your kidney to a Chinaman . "
Third place was won by Scott Lee Priestly of King of Prussia , Pennsylvania , who said " Before you can get any health care in Obama 's plan , you will have to convert to being an A - Rab Muslim . "
Mr. Priestly will receive $ 5 dollars off his $ 1500 deductible on his health plan , but must cash it in before he gets canceled due to having a serious illness .
Second place was captured by Paul Pope , of Tooele , Utah , who won a chance to have one preexisting condition excused before he was canceled , unless the illness cost more that $ 3,500 .
Paul sent in a talking point that said , " Obama 's health care plan will force your wife , girlfriend or daughter to be sold into slavery in Kenya . "
The grand prize went to Loulene Swift of Paradise Valley , Arizona , who said , " Obama 's health care plan will ration health care so only illegal gay immigrants will get to see a doctor , and these same gay illegals will be awarded your house and your guns . "
Ms. Swift won a free pass not to have to wait in the doctor 's big waiting room before she is asked to wait in the doctor 's small room .
In other words , she gets to go directly to the small room to wait .
The contest seems to be working as the support for health care reform has been steadily falling .

Never try to introduce the same product twice .
That was the lesson from the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May .
A year earlier , at E3 2005 in Los Angeles , Sony had wowed the videogame industry with demonstrations of the upcoming PlayStation 3's unprecedented graphical muscle .
The machine would n't be available until months after Microsoft 's next - gen console , the Xbox 360 .
Yet based on the spectacular preview , many gamers had no problem waiting for the PS3 .
Then , early this year , Sony dropped a bombshell : The PS3 release would be pushed back until November .
So when E3 came around again this spring , everyone trooped out to the retro Hollywood lotusland of the Sony Pictures lot – only to view the same console they 'd been promised the year before .
Not great .
Delays are nothing new in tech , but Sony seemed intent on making the worst of it .
The crowd was kept waiting nearly an hour .
Then Kaz Hirai , who heads PlayStation in North America , took the stage to declare , " The next generation does n't start until we say it does ! "
He meant it as a dig at Microsoft , but to gamers who'd been salivating for a year , his words were like a bitch slap .
The demos that followed were no more impressive than those the year before .
Finally , PlayStation chief Ken Kutaragi came forward to make the one announcement everyone wanted to hear : the price .
$ 600 for the high - end model ?
The room gasped , then fell silent .
Almost immediately , the blogosphere lit up with denunciations :
Sony has turned its back on gamers .
The PS3 will be a failure .
Kutaragi and Hirai are idiots .
PR fiascoes tend to be a sign that nobody 's thinking about the customer .
E3 was Sony 's second in seven months .
Last October , a security researcher reported on his blog that CDs from Sony BMG – the music label half - owned by Sony – contained antipiracy software that covertly embedded itself in computer operating systems , spying on their owners and leaving the machines themselves vulnerable to identity theft and zombie takeover attempts .
Sony BMG pooh - poohed the problem and released a software fix that made it even worse .
Millions of CDs had to be recalled .
As class actions multiplied and even the Department of Homeland Security warned music labels against undermining computer security , angry consumers declared themselves ready to boycott anything with the Sony name on it .
Sixty years after its founding in the ashes of postwar Tokyo , the company that gave us the transistor radio and the Walkman portable music player is deeply wounded .
Only once in the past five years has Sony 's all - important electronics division posted a profit ; during that same period , the company 's share price has fallen by nearly half .
Its hit products of the '90s – Handycams , WEGA TVs , VAIO computers – were succeeded by stillborn wonders like the AirBoard , a $ 1,000 videoscreen that could be carried around like a laptop , and the Net MD Walkman , a too - little - too - late attempt to challenge Apple 's iPod .
Neither this latter - day Walkman nor Sony Connect , the online music store The New York Times once called " Sony Disconnect , " would have anything to do with MP3 files – only Sony 's cumbersome and proprietary Atrac3 format would do .
Now , having ceded to Apple the portable - music - player market , Sony desperately needs to stay on top in videogames .
It 's not just that Sony needs a win ; PS3 is critical to its entire strategy .
The PS3 is much more than a game box .
Kutaragi likes to say it 's actually a computer , one that 's designed to lie at the center of the networked home , serving up films , navigating the Internet , doing nearly everything a PC can do , and delivering jaw - dropping videogames besides .
The new console relies on two extremely ambitious yet untested technologies .
At its core is a highly sophisticated microchip that can cruise at teraflop speeds ( equal to the fastest supercomputers of less than a decade ago ) and that might someday revolutionize home electronics .
Also built into the machine is Sony 's new Blu-ray hi-def disc player , which is proudly incompatible with a rival format from Toshiba – and which represents a bold , some would say reckless , attempt to control the multibillion - dollar market in next - generation video discs .
All this makes for a daring strategy , but not one that plays to Sony 's strengths .
Sony has always been at its best as a personal hardware company , coming up with nifty gadgets that delight consumers .
In recent decades , though , it 's become oddly fixated on imposing its own standards – Betamax for VCRs , the Mini -Disc for digital music players , the Universal Media Disc for PlayStation Portable , the Memory Stick for anything you can think of – despite the world 's unwavering rejection of those standards .
And Sony has never displayed an aptitude for software or had great success with networking , the key feature Microsoft has built into the Xbox .
Yet Sony has to face Microsoft not just in videogames but across the entire panoply of home electronics , which Microsoft is determined to control through software .
And Sony has to do this with cash reserves of $ 6 billion – compared to Microsoft's $ 38 billion hoard – while losing hundreds of dollars in manufacturing costs alone for every PS3 sold .
Eventually , Sony 's costs will come down .
But in the meantime , Goldman Sachs projects , Sony will lose nearly $ 2 billion on the PS3 by the end of this fiscal year in March .
Sony lovers – and they are legion – have been watching all of this with awe and trepidation .
It 's not every day that a $ 64 billion - a - year corporation puts its future on the line .
" It 's very un - Japanese , " observes Rishad Tobaccowala , who tracks the entertainment business as a future - of - media specialist at the global ad giant Publicis .
" It 's betting the company .
If this thing bombs , there is no second coming .
Everything else about Sony is a sideshow .
This is the show . "
How did it come to this ?
There were missteps aplenty , but at their root is a common dynamic :
What once made Sony great has worked against it in the digital age .
Sony 's course was fixed in the 1946 prospectus drawn up by cofounder Masaru Ibuka , when he set forth the new company 's purposes of incorporation .
Number one on his list : " To establish an ideal factory … where engineers with sincere motivation can exercise their technological skills to the highest level . "
To succeed , engineers would need to form small development teams and compete to build the next great gadget .
Teams of hardware engineers locked in competition : " It 's the principle Sony is built on , " says Shin'ichi Okamoto , PlayStation 's former CTO , now a Tokyo entrepreneur .
" Personally , I believe it's not such a good principle nowadays .
I got this impression in the ' 80s , with the technological shift to semiconductors and software " – both of which require enormous development teams that collaborate with the hardware units their work is intended for .
" At Sony , most engineers want to invent something new by themselves .
That 's a very different goal . "
Phil Wiser , the former CTO of Sony's US operations , reached a similar conclusion after he was tapped to salvage Sony Connect .
" With digital entertainment , you have to think about hardware , software , and services that tie them all together , " says Wiser , who managed to heave Sony onto the MP3 bandwagon before leaving earlier this year for a Silicon Valley startup .
" But it 's very hard to quantify the advantage of good software .
If you 're in a hardware company and you analyze it from a financial perspective , you just want to do it as cheaply as you can .
Software and services are an afterthought . "
The need to replace small competitive teams with large collaborative ones did occur to a few key Sony executives .
Toshitada Doi , a legendary engineer , set up a computer science lab in 1988 because he saw that the future would require networked devices and large - scale software development .
Years later , then - CEO Nobuyuki Idei reorganized Sony into a series of " network companies " and charged a promising lieutenant , Yuki Nozoe , with pulling together random broadband offerings into an all - encompassing networked future .
But all this talk of networks was anathema to Sony 's entrenched engineering cadre .
Today , Doi , Idei , and Nozoe are all gone , victims of their failure to make a difference , swept away in the boardroom coup that in spring 2005 put Howard Stringer , a longtime media exec who'd been heading Sony 's US operations , in charge of the company .
The culture of the lone - wolf hardware engineer reached its apex when Ken Kutaragi triumphed over internal opposition to create the PlayStation .
In the early '90s , Kutaragi burst forth with a seemingly reckless scheme to take on Nintendo and Sega , the ruling powers of the game world .
Yet even then he viewed Microsoft as the ultimate enemy .
Shuji Utsumi , a former PlayStation exec who now heads the Tokyo - based game developer Q Entertainment , recalls an exchange in which Kutaragi declared , years before the Xbox was introduced , that his competitor was Microsoft .
" I thought , what is he talking about ? " Utsumi says .
" Is he nuts ?
But even before PlayStation was born , he was predicting a big war for the living room . "
PlayStation 3 is hostage to that prediction .
Because technology can be decisive in war , Kutaragi loaded the PS3 with the biggest , baddest armaments yet : the Blu-ray disc drive and the Cell microchip .
He and his team had barely gotten PlayStation 2 out the door when they started conceptualizing the silicon for its successor .
The result , developed in partnership with IBM and Toshiba , features a central processing unit and eight coprocessors on the same chip , working in parallel .
It 's optimized for high - speed networking and fast decoding of encrypted and compressed data – copy - protected video for HDTVs , for example .
Game developers now have to figure out how best to unlock its powers .
Sunlight on water , creatures half - hidden by fog , age lines on a human face – " for every pixel , you can do more to synthesize reality , " says Steve Pearce , CTO of Activision .
" But it 's a big challenge – our engineers have to start thinking in a new way . "
As a result , the Cell has caused a lot of headaches for developers .
The Xbox 360 , with its three - core PowerPC processor , has already made game development far more complicated and expensive than before .
Tim Sweeney , cofounder of the North Carolina - based developer Epic Games , figures it will take at least twice the effort to fully exploit the PS3's potential as to take the Xbox 360 to the max .
Until that happens , it 's unlikely there 'll be much discernable difference between games on the two platforms .
" The Cell has more theoretical computing power , " says Sweeney , " but it might be years before we see that reflected in actual performance .
So it 's a fundamental question whether the long - term direction in computing is with architectures like the Cell . "
Blu-ray is equally fraught .
For starters , the whole business of high - definition disc drives seems designed to invite cynicism .
With DVD players now in 85 percent of US homes , sales fell in 2005 for the first time – so some manufacturers may need a next - gen disc player , but it 's not clear consumers do .
Especially after August 2005 , when talks aimed at averting a standards war with Toshiba 's rival HD - DVD format ended in a stalemate .
Andy Parsons , who heads advanced product development at Pioneer USA ( a Blu- ray supporter ) , says compromise was impossible : " It 's kind of like saying , ' LCD and plasma – why do n't you combine the two ? ' "
True enough – but it's also true that Blu-ray offers
Sony yet another chance to establish a proprietary format .
During the '90s , a similar conflict over the original DVD ended with Sony 's surrender and Toshiba 's collection of most of the royalties on every DVD and DVD player sold .
This time , Sony had the support of the big US computermakers , most of Hollywood , and nearly all the Asian consumer electronics giants – so why not call Toshiba 's bluff ?
Then there was the decision to build Blu-ray into the PlayStation 3 .
Sony 's logic seemed ironclad :
Not only would the hi-def drive 's huge storage capacity allow for far - more - realistic and complex games , the PS3 would carry Blu-ray into millions of households and drive sales of HDTVs as well .
As it turned out , however , Blu-ray has done nothing good for the PS3 .
Blu-ray was the main reason gamers were n't able to get the new machine last spring :
The launch had to be postponed because the new format 's digital rights management system did not yet satisfy every Hollywood studio .
Blu-ray was also a big factor in the PS3's high price tag .
Of course , with stand - alone Blu-ray players starting at $ 1,000 , the PS3 is actually a bargain – if a Blu-ray player is what you really want .
If not , $ 600 is a lot of money .
" For rich , older people it 's attractive , " Utsumi observes .
" But I do n't know if they are gameplayers . "
Kaz Hirai has heard it all before : the jitters about a new disc format , the complaints from game developers , the charges of hubris .
When you 're this far ahead – more than 200 million PlayStations sold worldwide , compared to just 30 million Xboxes – it comes with the territory .
" With every generational change , there are going to be challenges for the development teams , " he says .
" If everybody said it 's a piece of cake , that 's telling me it's not a future - proof console , that it has no headroom to grow . "
And that remark at E3 ?
" I wanted to say , look – we 're the leadership company , and we take that responsibility seriously .
The next huge leap in technology does not come until we launch PlayStation 3 . "
Hirai has a point : PlayStation 3 is as high tech as it comes in gameland .
Thanks to the Cell , the console can transform raw computer code into imagery that looks startlingly , almost disturbingly , real – just ask the Tiger Woods simulacrum that popped up at E3 .
It can render virtual worlds of shimmering beauty and mesmerizing intensity , as Warhawk , the forthcoming update of Sony 's classic flying shooter , amply demonstrates .
Nonetheless , Hirai 's upbeat assessment of the PS3's prospects seems dangerously at odds with the feeling in the videogame business .
One prominent industry figure , not associated with a console maker , recalls having lunch a couple of months ago with a game - company development chief who wondered aloud if Sony was going to pull a Sega – that is , go from number one console manufacturer to out of the business .
At the root of Sony 's precarious position – not just in the industry , but with gamers at large – is the company 's overweening ambition .
The PS3 is all about power .
Sony has said curiously little about whether this amped - up Linux über - computer will actually be fun to play .
Meanwhile , Nintendo wowed everyone at this year 's E3 with the Wii , a console you can play simply by waving a wand at the screen .
And Microsoft has upped the fun quotient by making it easy to play with all your buddies online .
Sony 's response to online gaming is revealing .
When Microsoft launched its Xbox Live online service in 2002 , console gaming went from solo affair to global meet - up .
Back then , Sony was actually the leader in online gaming , with over 400,000 subscribers to EverQuest , its massively multiplayer online game .
But MMOGs were played on a computer , not a game console , and there was little communication between the San Diego - based EverQuest group and the Tokyo - based PlayStation group .
Xbox Live now has more than 3 million subscribers worldwide ; the only place it is n't big is Japan .
Kutaragi never fully developed his PlayStation 2 online service , which still requires game publishers to run multiplayer titles on their own servers , because it was n't something he saw as lacking .
Yet game developers certainly saw the need for technology that would take their games online .
" It 's a very important function , " says Ichiro Otobe , chief strategist of the Tokyo - based game publisher Square Enix , " and we want it coming from the platform developer – otherwise , we have to build it ourselves . "
Eventually , PlayStation execs got the idea .
For more than a year , San Diego and Tokyo have been working together to come up with an answer to Xbox Live .
Even so , Hirai says , " the fundamental approach is different from Microsoft's .
They name it Live and it's a big to - do .
We look at it the other way :
There 's the entertainment experience , what you have in the box , all those good things , and – oh , by the way – we have an online component . "
In Sony , Microsoft may have found the ideal opponent : large , slow , still fixated on hardware , still trying to find its footing in the networked world .
When Microsoft decided to move into the game business , it was because a handful of execs saw an opportunity to do for gaming what Windows had done for personal computing : transform it from a hardware - defined industry to one governed by software .
J Allard , the team 's leader , argued that the success of DirectX – a Microsoft software suite that made it easy to program a PC – meant the company could simplify game development , too .
Allard was just as committed to online services :
If Microsoft could hook up players worldwide , it could change the nature of gameplay and make Xbox the way of the future .
" This business used to be about hardware and a cartridge you popped in , " says Peter Moore , the new leader of Xbox , at his headquarters in an office park in Redmond , Washington .
" But hardware is a tough business .
You need it , but you also need great software and innovative services . "
A Liverpool native with an office full of autographed soccer memorabilia and a sleek new Aston Martin coupe in the parking lot , Moore knows the vulnerabilities of hardware all too well :
He headed Sega of America when PlayStation 2 overwhelmed its Dreamcast machine and pushed Sega out of the business .
Now he spends much of his time on what Microsoft calls " Dev Luv , " an all - out effort to give game developers the software tools and engineering support they need to make Xbox the platform of choice .
Meanwhile , Xbox Live keeps gaining new features – most recently , user profiles that allow other players to check out your skill level and reputation within the community .
( Too many " avoid this player " raps and you could find yourself shunned . )
And because the Xbox 360 acts as a bridge to Windows Media Center PCs , the console can serve up music and video from your hard drive and play it on any device in the house .
Still , Moore notes , " we 're not driving the 360 as the hub of the home .
Editing and manipulating media is better done with a keyboard and mouse . "
Like the PlayStation 3 , the Xbox 360 will get a hi-def disc drive , but it wo n't be built in , and it wo n't be Blu-ray .
Last September , Microsoft and Intel announced they were throwing their weight behind Toshiba 's HD - DVD , a move that prompted several companies from the Blu-ray camp to hedge their bet by accommodating both standards .
Amir Majidimehr , Microsoft 's point man on the decision , cites several reasons for siding with Toshiba , chief among them Blu-ray 's move – largely at the behest of some copyright cops at Fox – to supplement the already draconian DRM mechanism adopted by both camps with yet another layer of protection .
" We worry that this program could be hacked to do bad things , " Majidimehr says , alluding to last year 's Sony BMG fiasco .
Blu -ray partisans say that 's impossible – but in any case , Majidimehr argues , " if one or the other of these layers decides it does n't like what you 're doing , it wo n't let you play the movie . "
Was the competition with Sony a factor , too ?
" Of course , " he says .
" But our strategy is , people want to play games , so we build a game console .
Sony is like , all or nothing .
They 're going to have a world of hurt waiting for them at the end of this year . "
A couple of months ago , Howard Stringer and Ryoji Chubashi , Sony 's president , reported to a luxury hotel in Tokyo's Shinagawa district to face 7,200 shareholders at Sony 's annual meeting .
It was not an enviable assignment .
With the company in the red yet again in its most recent quarter , Japanese investors were in an unhappy mood .
" I bought shares in mighty Sony , " cried a woman whose holdings had lost nearly two - thirds of their value .
" What are you going to do about this ? "
It was hardly an unexpected question , and Stringer answered as best he could .
Citing runaway ticket sales for Sony Pictures '
The Da Vinci Code and the remarkable success of the Bravia digital TV line , he argued that Sony has entered a period of reemergence .
But The Da Vinci Code will have no more lasting effect on the bottom line than earlier Sony blockbusters like Spider - Man , and Bravia relies on LCD technology that Sony ignored for years – until finally it had to partner with its Korean archrival Samsung to get back in the TV business .
So while each was good news , they do n't add up to a sign that mighty Sony is back .
Stringer 's new mantra is " Sony United . "
It 's meant to get the company to perform in the digital world , to shed its antiquated ways and embrace network thinking .
Most of all , though , it 's meant to get Sony to perform as a single unit .
Blu-ray is the first product to get the full treatment , not just from PlayStation but from the film and music divisions as well .
This will be the test of the theory that was used to justify the billions
Sony spent to get into the entertainment business in the ' 80s – that Sony could have won the Betamax - VHS war if only it had had enough " content . "
Sony has had rah -rah moments in the past – too many of them .
Before " Sony United " there was " Transformation 60 , " which cut 20,000 jobs in hopes of returning the company to health by its 60th anniversary .
Before that there was " Symphony , " which was supposed to get all the different divisions to play the same tune .
But the megaproducts
Sony has come up with , whether the AirBoard portable TV / Internet screen or the PS3 , have n't sought to fill some simple , unrecognized need , as the Walkman had done ; they 've sought to do many things in the best way imaginable .
Simply reading their spec sheets is enough to make you suspect they were designed not to please customers but to beat Microsoft .
They make you long for Nintendo 's Wii , a game console whose singular appeal is that it 'll be fun to play .
The Wii is a product Sony might have developed in its heyday .
It does n't try to outdo anyone on graphics muscle or computational power – in fact , it opts out of the arms race entirely .
Faced with a shrinking videogame market in Japan even as it was being elbowed into third place worldwide by Microsoft , Nintendo had to do something fresh , so company president Satoru Iwata and game designer Shigeru Miyamoto put their heads together and came up with a gyroscopic controller that looks and feels like a TV remote .
The Wii transforms gameplay from an exercise in button - pushing to something you do by swinging the controller through the air – pretty nifty when you 're engaged in swordplay .
No wonder gamers use words like " wow " and " amazing " when they try it out .
All this makes you wonder if united is the way to go .
In 30 years , Sony has transformed itself from a consistently profitable consumer electronics company with annual sales of $ 1.6 billion to a dangerously wobbly consumer electronics - entertainment - financial services behemoth 40 times that size .
Sony Electronics needs to embrace the networked world , obviously , but does it really need to be allied with a Hollywood film studio and a consumer - wary global music label in a global campaign against Microsoft ?
Probably not .
It just needs to make cool products for the century we live in .
That shareholder in Tokyo had the right idea : Bring back mighty Sony .
Please .
That does n't mean gargantuan Sony or megalomaniac
Sony or rule - the - universe Sony ; it means a Sony that 's fun again .
And for God 's sake , no more wars in the living room – not unless they 're the kind we can play with our friends .
