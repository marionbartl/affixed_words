Last summer 's outbreak of E. coli contamination in packaged spinach that killed at least three people and sickened more than 200 others has now been confirmed to have come from a 50 - acre organic farm in California 's San Benito County .
According to the Associated Press , at a legislative hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday , California Department of Health Services officials said that " investigators identified the grower who was farming that plot , which was in the second year of a three - year transition to organic production . "
At the time , many observers speculated that such was probably the case , given that organic farmers may not use synthetic fertilizers and are therefore the primary users of animal manure on food crops .
Still , that was not at all clear , given that the contamination could not be definitively traced to spinach labeled as organic .
Now , however , we know that the farm had been using organic practices for two years , but needed one additional year before its produce could be certified as organic .
The organic industry poo-pooed the suggestion that the contamination arose on an organic farm , insisting that such a thing could only have happened on a big , conventional , " factory farm " .
The fact of the matter is , however , that , while microbial contamination will likely always be with us , so - called factory farms tend to be cleaner , not dirtier , than anachronistic organic farms .
Having been on lots of farms , organic and conventional , on all six inhabited continents , I am much more willing to trust my family 's health to the products of a typical factory farm than a typical organic one .
The California Department of Health Services plans not to identify the farm until the release of its report on the E. coli outbreak in a few weeks .
However , the Hollister , California Free Lance reported yesterday that " Seattle - based attorney Bill Marler , who is representing 90 plaintiffs in a suit related to the E. coli outbreak , added Salinas [ California ] grower Mission Organics to the defendants in his lawsuit on Tuesday .
On Wednesday , Marler told the Free Lance he has known since November that the E. coli contamination occurred on land farmed by Mission Organics and leased from Paicines Ranch , and that the state agency 's investigation only confirmed that . "

A woman who was blind for a quarter of a century has baffled doctors by regaining her sight after suffering a heart attack .
Great - grandmother Joyce Urch , 74 , awoke from a coma to find her vision restored .
Doctors are describing it as a ' miracle ' because they can find no medical explanation for the phenomenon .
Mrs Urch , from Coventry , lost her sight in 1979 , apparently because of glaucoma .
After more than 25 years , she was admitted to the city 's Walsgrave Hospital with chest pains .
A few days later , she suffered a cardiac arrest and was not expected to live .
But she recovered - and left doctors and her 77 - year - old husband Eric astounded when she shouted : " I can see , I can see , I can see . "
Mrs Urch said : " Eric came over and I said , " Oh , you 've got wrinkles on your face .
You must be old .
" And I said , " Well , I must be old as well then . "
The last time the mother of five from Coventry could see , Margaret Thatcher had just been elected Prime Minister and Nottingham Forest were European football champions .
Now she says that every time she looks out at her garden she cannot believe her luck .
' Is that really me ? '
" I love going out now .
I can look around and see the trees and squirrels and pigeons .
The first time you look in the mirror you look at yourself and think , " Is that really me ?
I never used to be like that . "
" A lot of things , such as shops , have changed .
Coventry has changed .
There are roads everywhere where they were n't before . "
Mrs Urch has seen her three great - grandchildren for the first time and last weekend celebrated her golden wedding anniversary .
Her husband , a former miner , said : " I did n't believe it at first , she was still alive for one thing and all I could think was , well , somebody up there must love Joyce .
" When she said she could see me , I said , " What colour pullover am I wearing ? "
She said " grey " .
And she was right .
It must be some sort of a miracle because I never thought Joyce would ever see again . "
Mrs Urch went blind after she was diagnosed with glaucoma - a complex group of disorders which involve damage to the optic nerve and can lead to permanent blindness .
She is also arthritic and diabetic .
Dr Martin Been , her consultant cardiologist , said he could not explain her sight returning .
Asked whether it was a miracle , he said : " It seems so .
I am baffled . "
Ian Murdoch , a consultant at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London , said the blindness might have been caused not by the glaucoma but by cataracts - where the lens of the eye becomes cloudy .
" The heart attack itself or the treatment she received as a result could have put pressure on her eyes , causing the cataract to drop away to the back .
" But if this was the case , I would expect Mrs Urch only to have regained unfocused sight , such as being able to perceive between light and dark . "
Recent analyses have documented bias in pharmaceutical studies funded by industry .
Now , an analysis from Children 's Hospital Boston finds a similar phenomenon in scientific articles about nutrition , particularly in studies of beverages .
The analysis - the first systematic one performed on nutrition studies - found that beverage studies funded solely by industry were four to eight times more likely to have conclusions favorable to sponsors ' financial interest than were studies with no industry funding .
Findings are published online in the January 9 issue of the journal PLoS Medicine .
David Ludwig , MD , PhD , the study 's senior author and director of the Optimal Weight for Life ( OWL ) program at Children 's Hospital Boston , believes that bias in nutrition studies may have far greater effects than bias in pharmaceutical studies .
Not only do the findings of nutrition studies receive frequent media attention , but they influence governmental and professional dietary guidelines , the design of intervention programs , and FDA regulation of health claims on foods and beverages .
" We do n't all take drugs , but we eat every day , " Ludwig says .
" If the science base is compromised by conflict of interest , that 's a top - order threat to public health . "
Because the researchers focused their analysis on soft drinks , juice and milk , they are n't sure whether their findings extend to nutrition studies as a whole .
" We chose beverages because they represent an area of nutrition that 's very controversial , that 's relevant to children , and involves a part of the food industry that is highly profitable and where research findings could have direct financial implications , " Ludwig says .
The researchers began by conducting a Medline search of all existing scientific literature about soft drinks , juice and milk published during a five - year period ( 1999 - 2003 ) .
They retrieved 538 articles , of which 206 were eligible for analysis .
Eligible articles had to look at health outcomes or disease markers , had to involve humans or human tissue , had to be classifiable as an interventional or observational study or a scientific review , and had to explicitly state the beverages ' effects on health measures .
Of the 206 eligible articles , 111 declared financial sponsorship .
To guard against bias , the studies were analyzed independently .
One investigator selected the articles for inclusion according to pre-established criteria .
Another two investigators , who had no knowledge of the financial sponsors , and who were not told the article 's author , title or journal of publication , classified the articles ' conclusions as " favorable , " " neutral " or " unfavorable . "
A fourth investigator , who had no knowledge of the conclusions , determined the funding source ( 22 percent were funded entirely by industry , 47 percent had no industry funding , and 32 percent had mixed funding ) and classified articles as to whether a favorable finding would be beneficial , negative or neutral to its funder 's financial interests .
When analyzed statistically , article conclusions were significantly related to funding source .
Interventional studies with all - industry funding were much less likely to have unfavorable conclusions than those with no industry funding ( 0 vs. 37 percent ) .
Among all types of studies , comparing all - industry versus no-industry funding , the odds ratio for having a favorable versus unfavorable conclusion was 4.37 , increasing to 7.61 when beverage type , publication year and examination of authors ' personal conflicts of interest were taken into account .
The researchers note that during their five - year study , the overall proportion of papers declaring their funding sources increased , as journals tightened their disclosure requirements .
However , taking publication year into consideration did n't weaken the study 's findings .
" This is n't an effect that 's disappearing , " Ludwig says .
The bias may take several forms , Ludwig adds .
Although false data could be present in some studies , more likely the biases reflect subtle manipulations , such as framing the questions in a way that make the results more favorable to a sponsor .
In other cases , papers with unfavorable results may simply go unpublished .

Having conquered cat flu , triumphed over tapeworm and braved behavioural quirks , it is time to focus attention on some oft - observed , but little - documented , afflictions of cats .
COLLAPSIBLE LEGS
Symptoms :
The affected cat places one side of its head on the ground as though cheek - marking the concrete , carpet etc .
After several such manoeuvres , the legs on that side of the cat suddenly collapse , leaving the cat waggling its feet in the air .
Treatment :
This involves placing the palm of one hand on the exposed belly and rubbing gently .
There are side - effects though - some feline sufferers attack the rubbing hand while others recover spontaneously , often after prolonged treatment .
This condition is probably incurable and any cat which requires prolonged treatment after an attack will most likely suffer repeated attacks of collapsible legs throughout its lifetime .
SNUDGING
Symptoms :
The affected cat repeatedly headbutts any available part of a readily available human and turns its head slightly so that the lips and cheek are rubbed against legs , arms , clothing etc .
This condition gets its name from a contraction of the phrase " soggy nudging " .
Snudging may well be a form of excessive scent - marking .
A bad attack can result in soggy clothing .
Treatment :
Give the sufferer lavish affection .
Most attacks subside between 10 minutes to 1 hour after onset of symptoms .
You may need to dry off snudged clothing or skin .
Attacks recur frequently , usually when the most readily available human is engrossed in a TV program , book or telephone call .
BED -HOGGING
Symptoms :
The cat spreads to take up all available free bed space at night .
It then expands a bit more until any human occupants occupy the smallest possible area of bed .
It may do this on top or underneath the covers or on the pillow .
It is highly contagious - any other cats on the bed will also develop symptoms of bed - hogging .
Treatment :
The most obvious solution is to evict the cat from the bed .
If this is morally unfeasible , train yourself not to give way as the cat expands .
Buying a bigger bed is probably pointless as most affected cats can easily expand to fill standard , queen - sized and king - sized beds .
Otherwise , simply train yourself to sleep while hanging precariously off the side of the bed .
Attacks of bed - hogging have been known to last up to 23 hours ( in one case a 3 - day attack was noted by a cat - owner who was confined to bed with flu ; the cat thoughtfully kept her company during this time ) .
NON - SPECIFIC INSECT INFESTATION
( also NON - SPECIFIC SPIDER INFESTATION )
Symptoms
A disorder more prevalent among outdoor - going cats and cats with access to conservatories and garden rooms .
Symptoms range from minor ( the odd greenfly in tail , money - spider on fur ) to severe ( entire ecosystems of insects living on cat , spider webs spun between ears / whiskers , cat so weighed down with spider webs that it has difficulty walking ) .
Treatment
Minor symptoms can be treated by simply removing the infesting agent ( aphid , ladybug , spider etc ) and combing webs out of fur .
If the cat suffers recurrent or severe symptoms an exercise regime is highly recommended since highly mobile cats appear to attract fewer greenfly ( research into this factor continues ) .
FUFFLING
Symptoms
The cat lowers its nose into water and exhales .
This is followed by whiffling , spluttering , sneezing , snorting , head - shaking and a generally confused expression .
Bath - foam appears to trigger attacks of fuffling in some cats .
It may also be linked to interesting items seen in the water e.g. goldfish , food - crumbs , greeblingz .
Fuffling is most common during kittenhood although even quite elderly may suffer an occasional bout .
Treatment
None .
Snorkelling apparatus or scuba suits are possibilities , but cats do not readily accept such treatment .
Kittenhood fuffling generally subsides as the cat grows older , possibly due to some acquired immunity ( or greater common sense ) .
IRRITABLE LAP SYNDROME
Symptoms
The cat appears unable to settle comfortably on laps , instead treading , kneading , rearranging itself , fidgeting , vocalising , getting up and turning around , falling off lap and getting back on again , attacking magazines , needlework , computer keyboard , telephone etc .
Treatment
Immediate treatment is essential .
Drop whatever you are doing ( literally if need be ) and give 100 % attention to the sufferer otherwise symptoms may escalate and become quite distressing to the lap - owner .
Only prolonged attention will cure an attack of Irritable Lap Syndrome .
Like Collapsible
Legs this syndrome is incurable , although attacks may be effectively treated as and when they occur .
LAP FUNGUS DISORDER
Symptoms
Having taken over a human lap , the cat proceeds to ' spread ' in all planes .
This may be accompanied by secondary symptoms such as high volume purring , dribbling , kneading and snoring .
The condition is highly contagious and several ' fungoid ' cats may infest a lap simultaneously .
Treatment
Topical treatment with proprietary anti-fungals is ineffective .
Prompt treatment ( as per Irritable Lap Syndrome ) is required to alleviate the worst symptoms although in a number of cats , such treatment actually aggravates the condition .
This disorder manifests itself periodically through the affected cat 's life and there is no long - term cure .
SMURGLING
Symptoms
Varied :- sucking at clothing , owners earlobes / nose / fingers / skin , drooling , glazed expression .
Often accompanied by kneading and high volume purring .
Treatment
Ultimately incurable .
It is possible to remove smurglable items from around the cat .
The ailment may be transmitted to humans in the form of large laundry bills , mis-shapen clothing and chapped skin .
GREEBLINGZ
Symptoms
Random dashes through to helter - skelter running through house in pursuit of unseen prey .
Greeblingz are believed to be non-visible entities and some authorities have linked them to UFO sightings or feel that they may be diminutive other - dimensional beings .
Cats suffering from greeblingz typically have wild - eyed expressions .
There is a minor danger of greeblingz attaching themselves to humans ; if a cat tackles such greeblingz , injury to humans may result .
A very few cats are naturally immune .
In some areas , this condition is known as the Flaming Kahooties .
Treatment
None known .
Anti-epileptics are ineffective as the condition appears unrelated to other forms of seizure .
Avoid getting in the way of a cat engaged in greebling hunting .
Attacks usually subside spontaneously , perhaps as greeblingz return to their own dimension .
These irritating creatures are not visible to human eyes , but no doubt the superior sight and hearing of cats enables them to see them .
MARSHMALLOW PAWS
Symptoms
Over a period of time , the paw pads change from tough skin to soft squishy marshmallow paws .
The cat shows no sign of distress , however it may exhibit a preference for being carried everywhere .
This condition is most often noticed in inactive cats .
Afflicted cats may sleep excessively , often in a belly - up position with the marshmallow paws waggling in the air .
Possibly , paw softening is due to lack of contact between paw and floor .
In technical terms , the paw pads are ' kitten - soft ' .
Treatment
Increased paw - to - floor contact is essential .
The cat must be encouraged to use its own feet instead of its human 's feet .
The use of a treadmill , while effective , may lead to SPCA investigations .
Many old , inactive cats suffer from irreversible marshmallow paws .
If a regime of exercise is adopted , it must be maintained for the rest of the cat 's life - marshmallow paws is a recurrent condition .
HAPPY COAT ( also HAPPY TONGUE )
Symptoms :
Most often noted in sleek - furred cats .
The cat proceeds to fluff up its fur in pleasure , starting at the base of the tail and working forward towards the nose .
In extreme cases the cheeks and forehead fluff up and the cat is said to have ' purred itself fuzzy ' .
Happy Tongue is typified by a small part of the tongue protruding from the mouth until the cat remembers to tuck it away again .
Happy Coat and Happy Tongue are frequently accompanied by Irritable Lap Syndrome or Smurgling and may be a prelude to an attack of Collapsible Legs .
Treatment :
None known .
Spontaneous attacks of Happy Coat are most distressing to exhibitors of slinky - haired cats .
Happy Tongue in Persians is sometimes misdiagnosed as a malformed mouth .
It is , of course , possible to make the cat unhappy , but this is not recommended .
Some cats grow out of these conditions .
IRRITABLE BOWL SYNDROME
Symptoms :
The cat seems discontent with what is in the foodbowl .
In multicat households this is manifested by cats going from one bowl to another in search of something more enticing .
Afflicted cats may also follow the owner to cupboards and demand to investigate every opened can or packet in the hope of a better meal .
In severe cases , cats show excessive interest when the owner opens a can of baked beans .
Treatment
An ever - changing selection of gourmet meals is the cat 's preferred solution .
This entails enrolment on cookery courses and animal nutrition courses .
Alternatively , offer a buffet selection of both canned and dry kitty foods purchased in small packages while advising it that its ancestors had to make do with nothing but mouse .
Explain that Big Sid , the local feral with the appetite and table manners of a furry bulldozer , will be joining the cat at meal times .
Most modern cats will opt for the buffet rather than risk losing it to Big Sid .
SEASONALLY AFFECTIVE DOOR INTO SUMMER SYNDROME
Symptoms
This condition was first described by Robert Heinlein in his book of the same name .
It manifests at times of inclement weather .
The afflicted cat wanders around the house demanding that each external door it comes to be opened .
On discovering that the weather there is just as nasty as the weather outside the last door , it resumes its search for a " door into summer " .
The cat remains convinced that one of the doors will , on the umpteenth time of opening , have a summer 's day on the other side of it .
This affliction is more prevalent in younger cats of an active disposition and is frequently contagious in multi-cat environments .
Treatment
Immediate treatment of symptoms i.e. opening the selected door has only short term effect and must be repeated .
Symptoms abate during summer , but the cat will suffer seasonal relapses .
Some owners have reported that application of a localised heat source e.g. a log fire , gas fire or electric fire is effective in reducing frequency of attacks .
Though not guaranteed , elderly cats may acquire an immunity to this affliction .
STATIONERY INTOLERANCE ( FELINE INFECTIOUS KEYBOARDITIS )
Symptoms
The affected feline reacts adversely to desks , paper , pens , pencils and keyboards .
This is most noticeable when the keyboard , pen or pencil is in use .
The addition of a cat is detrimental to writing or typing .
Papers , photos and objects may be shuffled around a desk .
In the latter stages of the reaction , the cat may collapse into a stupor among papers .
Feline Infectious Keyboarditis is a specific form of Stationery Intolerance and is reported to be on the increase .
Treatment
It is generally best to keep a susceptible cat away from office materials and keyboards .
Though the sudden onset of symptoms suggests an allergy to or intolerance of office materials , in multicat households , these conditions frequently show an infectious component .
The only cure is to immediately stop using office materials .
The condition is liable to recur every time the cat is exposed to certain office materials .
ATTENTION DEAFNESS DISORDER
Symptoms
An affected cat ignores all attempts to deliberately attract its attention , in particular showing no recognition of its name .
This is generally episodic .
Triggers have been identified , such as mentioning " vet " , " vaccination " , " curfew " or " cattery " .
Curiously , the cat continues to respond to other sounds e.g. a tuna can being opened .
Treatment
When the cat is having an Attention Deafness Disorder attack , avoid using its name (s ) .
Instead , attract attention by pretending you are not interested in it .
It will normally come running to find out what is going on and how best to participate .
UPSIDE -DOWN LEGS
Symptoms
Several instances of upside - down legs were reported by a cat - owner in Bristol , England .
The cat 's legs appeared to have been fitted upside down .
On further investigation , the cat was found to be suffering from an advanced case of collapsible legs and had become fully inverted .

Undoubtedly you have all seen photographs of people on TV and online who have been blurred to hide faces .
For example , here 's one of Bill Gates : For the most part this is all fine with peoples ' faces as there is n't a convenient way to reverse the blur back into a photo so detailed that you can recognise the photo .
So that 's good if that is what you intended .
However , many people also resort to blurring sensitiveand .
I 'll illustrate why that is a BAD idea .
Suppose someone posted a photo of their check or credit card online for whatever awful reason ( proving to Digg that I earned a million dollars , showing something funny about a check , comparing the size of something to a credit card , etc. ) , blurring out the image with the far - too - common mosaic effect to hide the numbers :
Seem secure because nobody can read the numbers anymore ?
WRONG .
Here 's a way to attack this scheme :
There are two ways of doing this .
You can either Photoshop out the numbers in your existing image , or in the case of credit cards , you can get an account with the same organization and take a photo of your own card from the same angle , and match the white balancing and contrast levels .
Then , use your own high resolution photo to photoshop out your numbers .
This is easy in these example images , of course : Use a script to iterate through all the possible account numbers and generate a check for each , blocking out the various sections of digits as sections .
For example , for a VISA card , the digits are grouped by 4 , so you can do each section individually , thus requiring only 4*10000 = 40000 images to generate , which is easy with a script .
Identify the exact size and offset , in pixels , of the mosaic tiles used to blur the original image ( easy ) , and then do the same to each of your blurred images .
In this case , we see that the blurred image we have 8x8 pixel mosaic units , and the offset is determined by counting from the top of the image ( not shown ) :
Now we iterate through all the images , blurring them in the same way as the original image and obtain something like this :
What does this mean ?
Well , let 's take the mozaic version of 0000001 ( zoomed in ) : ... and identify the brightness level ( 0 - 255 ) of each mozaic region , indexing them in some consistent fashion as a= [ a_1 , a_2 ..., a_n ] :
In this case , the account number 0000001 creates mozaic brightness vector a( 0000001 ) =[ 213,201,190 , ... ] .
We find the mozaic brightness vector for every account number in a similar fashing using a script to blur each image and read off the brightnesses .
Let a( x ) be the function of the account number x. a ( x ) _i denotes the ith vector value of the mozaic brightness vector a obtained from account number x.
Above , a( 0000001 ) _1 = 213 .
We now do the same for the original check image we found online or wherever , obtaining a vector we hereby call z= [ z_1,z_2 , ...z_n ] : Identify the mozaic brigtness of the original image , call it z= [ z_1,z_2 , ...z_n ] , and then simply compute the distance of each account number 's ( denote by x ) mozaic brightness vector ( normalizing each first ) : where N ( a( x ) ) and N( z ) are the normalization constants given byNow , we then simply find the lowest d(x ) .
For credit cards , only a small fraction of possible numbers validate to hypothetically possible credit card numbers , so it 's an easy check as well .
In the above case , we compute , for example , and then proceed to calculate the distances : Might the account number just be 1124588 ?
In the real world we have photos , not fictitious checks made in Photoshop .
We have distortions of the text because of the camera angle , imperfect alignment , and so on .
But that does n't stop a human from determining exactly what these distortions are and creating a script to apply them !
Either way , the lowest few distances determined can be considered as candidates , and especially in the world of credit cards , where numbers are nicely chunked out in groups of 4 , and only 1 in 10 numbers is actually a valid number , it makes it easy to select from your top few lowest distances , which the most likely candidates are .
One important thing that one would need to do in order to implement this on real photos is to improve the distance algorithm .
For example , one can rewrite the distance formula above to normalize the standard deviations in addition to the means to improve performance .
One can also do the RGB or HSV values independently for each mozaic region , and one can also use scripting to distort the text by a few pixels in each direction and compare as well ( which still leaves you with a feasible number of comparisons on a fast PC ) .
One can also employ algorithms similar to existing nearest - shape algorithms to help improve the reliability of this on real photos .
So yes , I used an image against itself and designed it to work here .
But the algorithem can surely be improved to work on real stuff .
I do n't have the time nor desire to improve this any further , though , because I 'm not the one after your information .
But one thing is for sure : it 's a very easy situation to fix .
Do n't use simple mosaics to blur your image .
All you do is reduce the amount of information from an image containing only log ( 10 ^N ) / log ( 2 ) effective bits of account data .
When you distribute such images , you want topersonal information , not obscure it by reducing the amount of visual information in the image .
Think about creating a 100x100 graphic on the screen .
now lets say i just averaged out the entire graphic and replaced every pixel with the whole average ( i.e. turn it into a single pixel " mosaic " ) .
You have just created a function that starts with 256 ^ ( 10000 ) possibilities and hashes it to 256 possibilities .
There is obviously no way with the resulting 8 bits of information you can possibly reverse it to the original image .
However , if you know that the original image was one of 10 possibilities , you can easily have success at determining which of the original images was used from just knowing the resulting 8 - bit number .
Most UNIX / Linux system administrators know that /etc / passwd or /etc / shadow store passwords encrypted using one - way encryption such as Salt or MD5 .
This is reasonably secure since nobody will ever be able to decrypt the password from looking at its ciphertext .
Authentication occurs by performing the same one - way encryption on the password entered by the user logging in , and comparing that result to the stored one - way result .
If the two match , the user has successfully authenticated .
It is well known that the one - way encryption scheme is easily broken when the user picks a dictionary word as their password .
All an attacker would have to then do is encipher the entire English dictionary and compare the ciphertext of each word to the ciphertext stored in /etc / passwd and pick up the correct word as the password .
As such , users are commonly advised to pick more complex passwords that are not words .
The dictionary attack can be illustrated like this :
The similary to the dictionary attack on the blured image attack lies in the fact that blurring an image is a one - way encryption scheme .
You are converting the image you have into another image designed to be unreadable .
However , since account numbers only typically go up to the millions , we can assemble a " dictionary " of possible account numbers - that is , all the numbers from 0000001 to 9999999 , for example , use an automated image processor to photoshop each of those numbers onto a photo of a blank check , and blur each image .
At that point , one can simply compare the blurred pixels to see whatclosely matches the original blurred photo we have .
The solution is simple : Do n't blur your images !
Instead , just color over them :
Remember , you want to leave your visitors with NO information , not blurred information .
COWBIRDS , like cuckoos , are brood parasites — that is , they lay their eggs in the nests of other birds and leave those others to do the hard work of raising their changeling young .
But there is a difference .
A cuckoo chick usually pushes the original nestlings out , so that it can monopolise the food brought by its unwitting adoptive parents .
Cowbird chicks , by contrast , seem to tolerate their nestmates .
That seems odd .
So odd , in fact , that Jeffrey Hoover of the Illinois Natural History Survey and Scott Robinson of the University of Florida decided to look into the matter .
What they found , as they report in this week 's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is that the host bird 's real chicks are pawns in a protection racket of a sort the Sicilian Mafia would be proud to have invented .
The victims of the racket are prothonotary warblers .
These birds do not reject cowbird eggs even though they look quite different from their own .
That in itself is intriguing , for cuckoos , again in contrast to cowbirds , lay eggs that mimic those of their hosts .
Dr Hoover and Dr Robinson demonstrated what was going on by erecting 182 warbler nestboxes at the top of narrow , greasy poles .
( The grease stopped any ground - dwelling predators getting close to the nests . )
The first phase of their study was observational .
Over the course of six years , they watched 472 nests in which warblers had laid their eggs .
Almost half of these were parasitised by cowbirds .
But , parasitised or not , almost all — protected as they were from ground - based predators — successfully produced fledgling warblers .
Then the experiment began .
In the following seasons Dr Hoover and Dr Robinson removed cowbird eggs from some of the parasitised nests .
At the same time , they reduced the diameter of the entrances to some of the nest boxes , in order to deny admission to cowbirds ( which are larger than warblers ) .
Warblers whose nests were thus protected did well , raising an average of four chicks to maturity in the absence of a cowbird parasite .
Nests from which cowbird eggs had been removed , but which lacked protection , did badly .
In fact , more than half of them were attacked .
The eggs were pecked open and the nests themselves torn to pieces .
Nests thus attacked yielded , on average , but a single fledgling , whereas those with a cowbird egg in them yielded three warbler fledglings .
Paying protection money in the form of food for the cowbird nestling thus looks a good deal from the warbler 's point of view , and explains why cowbirds do not need to disguise their eggs to look like those of prothonotaries .
The cowbirds ' dastardly tricks do not stop at this protection racket , either , for a fifth of those warbler nests that had never had cowbird eggs in them also got destroyed .
Dr Hoover and Dr Robinson ascribe this behaviour to a strategy they call “ farming ” .
If warblers lose a clutch , they will often produce a second .
If a cowbird female fails to lay in a warbler nest in time for her egg to hatch with those of the host , she can reset the clock in her favour by killing the first clutch .
Even the Mafia never thought of that one .
The Ontario government has recently been emphasizing its green credentials , particularly in relation to small - scale renewable generation , in the run up to a provincial election this fall .
The Standard Offer Program ( SOP - previously discussed here ) is claimed to provide a framework for bringing a substantial array of new embedded generation on to the grid - generation based on different energy sources and varying widely in size .
This is exactly what needs to happen if Ontario is to avoid a painful energy squeeze in the future , due in part to the approaching decline of natural gas supplies in North America .
However , achieving it is proving to be far more difficult than one might reasonably expect .
The Regulatory Landscape
The Ontario Power Authority ( OPA ) , which administers the SOP is clearly intent on minimizing the cost to Ontario electricity consumers by strongly favouring the cheapest renewable alternative .
However , this position is at odds with the priorities of other government agencies , notably the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs ( OMAFRA ) , which is keen to promote various forms of farm - based generation as a means of securing rural development .
In addition , the Ministry of the Environment ( MOE ) has its own priorities , which are not necessarily in accordance with those of other agencies .
Zoning and taxation are also issues .
The net result is the development of a regulatory obstacle course threatening to derail the development of valuable technologies such as anaerobic digestion .
Given the considerable collateral benefits of agricultural biogas production , such an outcome would represent a significant own - goal .
The Benefits of Anaerobic Digestion
Anaerobic Digestion
The Importance of Total Solids Content
Anaerobic digestion ( AD ) is well established in Europe and is increasingly being developed in America ( see for instance the Agstar Handbook and software from the US EPA or this Minnesota case study ) .
In combination with power generation from the resulting biogas and waste heat recovery , it has significant potential for recovering energy from agricultural operations in Ontario .
Approximately 4 - 5 kWh per milking cow per day ( equivalent to 2 - 3 kWh per head of dairy livestock per day ) can typically be generated , meaning most farmers for whom it would be economical to install a system would be able to cover their own electricity demand with a surplus available to feed into the grid .
In winter , the recovered heat would also typically be sufficient to provide for all the heating needs of the farm , including heating the digester itself in order to maintain the required temperature range .
AD also has a number of important collateral benefits that have made its development a priority for the farming community .
Improved manure management
Pathogen reduction ( typically 95 % or more )
Reduced greenhouse gas emissions ( methane , nitrous oxide )
Reduced odour ( 90 % reduction of VFAs )
Chemical fertilizer substitution
Rural economic development
Treatment of off - farm organic waste streams as co-substrates
Digested solids
Combining digestion of manure with other wastes - green waste , commercial food waste , waste fats and oils , grease trap residues - can enhance methane production , typically by up to a factor of four .
The surplus power available for sale is therefore greatly increased and the economics of the project substantially improved .
At present , farmers may also be offered a tipping fee to take off - farm materials ( tipping fees currently paid for composting or landfill are $ 40 - $ 90 per tonne ) , although that is unlikely to continue once there is competition for energy - rich waste streams .
AD of these off - farm waste streams is a very much better option than the landfilling , which often occurs now .
According to OMAFRA , a fully developed AD sector is predicted to result in $ 1.4 billion of investment in Ontario agriculture and infrastructure , with an anticipated $ 434 million in annual income for farmers in exchange for generating 2 % of Ontario ’s power demand .
However , a string of bureaucratic obstacles stands in the way , and is proving to be a huge source of frustration for early adopters and their backers .
Grid Connection Obstacles
For projects under 50 kW which are planning to net meter , the connection process is straightforward , however , most AD systems , including any based on co-substrates , would be larger than this .
For larger systems , the process of establishing a grid connection is extremely long , complicated and expensive .
Although time - scales are set by the Ontario Energy Board ( OEB ) in the Distribution Code - 15 days for an initial feasibility study and 60 days for a Connection Impact Assessment ( CIA ) and Connection Cost Estimate ( CCE ) for generation less than 500 kW - these time - scales are not even close to being met , partly due to the avalanche of applications resulting from the dash for wind under the SOP .
Projects currently submitting an application to Hydro One - the relevant utility in almost all cases as it deals with rural Ontario - can expect to wait for months before their application will be assessed .
The initial feasibility assessment is free , but the CIA costs in excess of $ 3000 and the CCE in excess of $ 4000 .
After completion of the CIA and CCE , a cost recovery agreement will be offered , based on deep entry .
In other words , the prospective generator is liable for the full cost of all necessary distribution system upgrades , however far downstream these may occur , and however disproportionate they may be to the economics of the project .
Once the necessary upgrades have been performed and paid for , which could potentially extend the timeline considerably , a connection agreement would be offered .
Hydro
One is legitimately concerned about the potential for islanding , for which the standard solution would be a $ 200,000 transfer trip scheme to ensure that feeder lines are not energized when power is restored after a momentary outage ( the typical restoration time is approximately 1 second ) .
If a feeder line is energized and significantly out of phase on reclosure , equipment damage is on the feeder side is a distinct possibility .
This problem could potentially be addressed by increasing the reclosure time - to perhaps 5 seconds - in order to ensure that the embedded generation would have sufficient time to disconnect .
Hydro
One has so far been disinclined to do this , however , as restoration time appears to be one of their reportable performance measures .
Insisting on a transfer trip instead for a $ 300,000 farm - based AD project , would render almost all such projects uneconomic .
A working group has been set up between the Ontario Federation of Agriculture ( OFA ) and Hydro One to discuss ways of moving forward , but solutions will take time .
Power Purchase Obstacles
Embedded generation with a two - way connection to the grid can choose to net meter or to sign a 20 - year contract under the SOP .
Net metering would not be an attractive option for a generator commonly out - producing his own demand , as any surplus power would have to be put on to the grid for free .
Most prospective biogas generators are hoping to sign a SOP contract , but the rate currently being offered is not attractive .
Critics of the SOP point out that the program is essentially designed for commercial wind power as the lowest cost form of renewable energy .
Although the SOP rate of 11 cents per kWh is supplemented by 3.52 cents per kWh during peak period - a supplement for non-intermittent generation - the overall price still averages out at only about 12.5 cents per kWh .
OMAFRA ’s work suggests that an effective price of 13 - 22 cents per kWh , depending on the project , is required to make AD economic under prevailing conditions in Ontario .
The OPA is said to be considering a price review within two years , which could significantly disadvantage early adopters .
In practice , potential AD generators may well decide to wait for the price review before committing themselves to a 20 year contract , which could substantially delay the adoption of AD technology .
Renewable generation projects may be eligible for additional incentive programs intended to enhance their viability - for instance the proposed federal ecoenergy renewable power program which would provide an additional cent per kWh for renewable generators larger than 1 MW .
However , under the SOP contract , the provincial OPA is able to claw back half of any such incentive .
This form of regulation at cross-purposes adds pointless complication to the process .
An additional complication is the demand charge for demand customers using more than 50kW .
Whereas smaller demand customers pay an energy charge , a fixed charge and a distribution charge proportional to their energy use , larger customers pay an energy charge , a fixed monthly component and variable amount proportional to their peak power consumption rather than their energy use .
The variable component is referred to as the demand charge .
Essentially , the distribution charge , comprised of both fixed and variable components , represents the utility ’s cost recovery strategy for installing a standard connection , which the standard demand customer does not have to pay for up front .
Generators are , however , expected to pay the full cost of the connection upfront .
Hydro
One is apparently planning to apply the demand charge to the generator ’s own demand , despite the fact that the generator will not in practice be drawing his peak demand from elsewhere , but generating it himself locally .
This would arguably amount to generators double paying for the cost of their connection - paying upfront as well as per billing period thereafter .
This aspect of the cost structure would make a very significant difference to the economics of AD projects .
Designing AD projects to include handling off - farm high - energy waste streams would make projects viable at a lower price per kilowatt hour for the electricity sold .
However , attempting to obtain permission to process off - farm materials opens another regulatory can of worms .
Zoning and Taxation Obstacles
Property tax assessments are under the control of municipalities , meaning that tax liabilities as a result of changes in land use can vary .
Although the OPA currently only advises potential generators to contact their local municipality for details , they have previously advised prospective generators that establishing a grid connection for the purpose of selling electricity is likely to result in the farm being zoned industrial and taxed accordingly .
In addition , the inclusion of off - farm wastes in the project design is likely to result in rezoning of the farm as a waste disposal site by the municipality , even though the materials to be handled would mostly be harmless food wastes .
As rezoning is a process open to public consultation , and the label of ‘ waste disposal site ’ is an emotive one , the opportunity for local opposition to develop would be considerable .
The level of regulation , and therefore the cost , would increase substantially , assuming the project was allowed to proceed at all .
Food Waste
Environmental Obstacles
AD based on the use of co-substrates requires certificate of approval from provincial Ministry of the Environment ( MOE ) .
However no regulations have been developed to deal with the situation despite on - going discussions since 2005 between the MOE and OMAFRA .
To date , OMAFRA has agreed to fund , at significant cost , a waste pasteurization facility and a gas flare at one prospective site in order to gain approval .
Despite these concessions - the cost of which will have to be built into the project funding for all subsequent projects as OMAFRA will only cover the first one - a certificate of approval has yet to be issued for any project .
It is likely that legislation will be required in order to establish an appropriate regulatory framework for AD with co-substrates .
However , such legislation would be controversial and is unlikely to be introduced in the run up to the Ontario provincial election due in the fall of 2007 .
The regulatory delay would therefore be expected to continue for at least another year , if not longer depending on how high a priority the next government places on seeing AD become established .
The Issue of Insurance
Insurers are becoming increasingly sensitive to potential risks and are increasingly likely to impose high premiums on any activity that could be considered unusual .
Although AD is an established technology in Europe and has not proven to represent an insurance risk there , the industry here may choose not to take experiences gained elsewhere into account .
Resolving the Regulatory Obstacle Course
The current regulatory impasse is effectively preventing the development of an important technology by withholding permissions and imposing disproportionate costs at every turn .
This fractured and contradictory state of affairs clearly does not serve the interests of Ontario .
Although there are informal working groups attempting to diffuse the various conflicts between the priorities of the different bureaucracies involved , it is unlikely that a full resolution will be possible in the absence of political will at the provincial level .
The province requires a coherent policy on AD , based on a comprehensive professional assessment of risks and benefits .
It needs to integrate the various regulatory strands in order to ensure that the priorities of various regulatory bodies are not in conflict and that the overall regulatory burden is reasonable .
Here is a shocking story of Russian pilot , now living in the USA who was on the air 9th September 2001 and have made photos right from the air when planes crashed the WTC .
He worked at that time as a programmer in one of the dot coms and had some free time which usualy he spent flying Cessna 172SP plane around NYC .
We have this photos today .
Just when he took off he spotted a smoke coming from WTC towers .
He was very surprised and headed in that direction :
When he approached to George Washington Bridge he tuned to a local 1010 WINS news radio station .
He says that at that time there was news that “ a small plane hit WTC ” .
Then he switched to hear what other pilots flying above Gudson are talking about , but they discussed same thing “ a small commuter that hit WTC ” .
So little by little he was approaching the Manhattan .
He met a few small planes like his Cessna , and pilots were saying something like “ Oh man there is something really bad happened ! ”
He got even more closer and noticed another BOEING 737 .
He says that the BOEING was flying the same way it usualy does when going to landing from La Guardia destination , probably a little bit lower than usual .
And then suddenly this BOEING 737 changes his course making a very sharp curve , targeting the South WTC tower .
He shot it at the moment it hit the building .
The author of the photos says he does n’t believe at all that this maneur could be done by some rookie who just graduated from “ Florida Flight School ” .
According to his opinion it was some very experienced millitary pilot making his last kamikaze mission .
After that he decided to find a place to land but all the places around NYC did n’t accept him so he had to fly to NJ and land there .
He hid the camera so that nobody could know he was filming .

That clearly was a whole lot a lot more to sports betting trends gambling compared to the majority of folks believe .
The powerful athletics betters are n’t alcoholics that simply sit around the casinos and also live off chance .
Each one of the powerful ones whom I understand has become computing and possess a meaningful and purposeful approach that logically guides each of these conclusions .
Like a newcomer , you can find certain affairs which you got to understand from your start .
For many novices , it ’s intelligent to wholly avoid gambling in your own favorite club .
A lot of men and women get all confusing whenever they take to gamble on their preferred groups .
They normally need their groups to acquire so poorly that it clouds their ruling .
There certainly are a lot of feelings and biases which be from the film and nearly consistently blur your own judgment .
This typically results in making inadequate choices and shedding lots of your own hard - won funds .
Beginners additionally often believe that they need to start building an entire crapload of stakes as they are , to get some unusual purpose , genuinely believe this is the way the experts do this .
This really is really not exactly what they need to do and I do n’t really know one powerful sports bettors who started out earning plenty of stakes concurrently .
You should find out the art of self - control and just gamble about the matches along with match - ups that you just know a lot about .
You ’ve got to totally know and examine the match prior to putting a stake onto it .
Keep in mind , the further bets you put , the higher your chances are of earning profits .
Possibly you would like to know if it ’s actually easy that you make money as you perform sports betting gambling .
Clearly , possible .
But , you do have greater odds of shedding weight .
Everyone needs to .
The very effective of bettors undergone enormous reductions inside their own years of betting .
Afterall , it ’s the essence of gaming .
It ’s insecure and there ’s not anything on earth which will change this .
The exact same happens whenever individuals utilize a few roulette profitable applications .
But , there really are lots of folks who gain out of you each single time you gamble , if you win or lose .
Even your bookie , as an instance , has managed to ship his own kids to college due to your continuous gaming .
But even when gaming is just a risky match , it ’s still true that you get plenty of possibilities to create prudent decisions and also earn a lot of wins because you can find strategies accessible to aid you .
For many novices out there - there , even your decision at which to position stakes may already be described as a bewildering job .
And , aside from getting Forged to know all of the gaming jargons that every match gets , additionally you need to be on the lookout for individuals that have each option they are able to utilize to earn a fool from you personally and also your own winnings .
So , as a way in order to prevent getting cheated and most of the different issues in betting earn certain that you just did your lesson quite very well .
Allot Dollars for Betting
An amazing hazard that a lot of gamers confront is paying longer than they really should .
In the event you understand far better , you know that this is n’t the thing to do in the event that you only mean to possess pleasure .
As they eventually become overly targeted in needing to secure the huge lottery decoration , they are inclined to get rid of their work and wind up dropping whatever they ’ve .
Yes , there could be several instances which many individuals could experience lousy fortune ; nevertheless , it ’s wise to employ a little attempt in compensating to the unfortunate streak any particular you get .
You might certainly be alarmed just how much money you may store in the event that you only bet sensibly .
Besides that , it might help save you away from the issue of drowning in money and also losing all of the men and women that you like many .
First thing initial thing which you should not forget is the fact that drinking does n’t mix effectively with betting .
Sports gambling , blackjack along with other designs of gaming games will be best played when a person really is at their own best perceptions .
Preventing the Band - wagon
Lots of men and women still do n’t receive it whenever they view the most those gambling people are gambling to a favorite workforce .
Rather than linking the pun , perform differently .
Heal it being confirmed match for the own side .
Lots of folks are inclined to vote for the particular team in the event the end result is actually apparent .
If this could be the situation , you then usually do not take part because betting anymore since it does n’t provide you considerable wins .
Know Crucial Matters regarding the Overall Game
Oddsmakers are famous characters in sports gambling .
They ’re recognized to create determined predictions of this results of matches utilizing different vital elements .
It ’s possible to compare these into roulette chances .
Laborious and time swallowing it might appear , you need to do some track record test into those teams being searched to get .
You want to understand special details around the likely things that may transform the results of the match .
You might need to analyze to the groups ’ in general operation during the entire year , teaching , moderate scores along with recent back to back games .
Otherwise , you would likewise go past the standard professional lifetimes of those games .
It ’s mandatory that you incorporate what ’s going on in their own lives which may impact the people ’ performances .
These can be uncomplicated notions in regards to the groups nevertheless they ’re sufficient to impact how that they play with .
Do n’t forget that a proficient bettor will not need to really be quite a fantastic sportsperson .
This could be the typical misconception which gambling fan happen once they take to their own fortune into sports gambling .
The reality is the fact that even in the event that you understand which workforce is far better with respect to functionality , then you wo n’t ever have the ability to foresee the results of the match .
Yes , even sports consciousness could arrive inconveniently .
However , it will not earn some excellent in sports gambling .

Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses , polyester , and air conditioning .
02 ) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay , in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall .
03 ) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior .
People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract .
04 ) Straight marriage has been around a long time and has n't changed at all ; women are still property , blacks still can't marry whites , and divorce is still illegal .05 ) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed ; the sanctity of Britany Spears ' 55 - hour just - for - fun marriage would be destroyed .
06 ) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children .
Gay couples , infertile couples , and old people should n't be allowed to marry because our orphanages are n't full yet , and the world needs more children .

Obviously gay parents will raise gay children , since straight parents only raise straight children .08 )
Gay marriage is not supported by religion .
In a theocracy like ours , the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country .
That 's why we have only one religion in America.09 )
Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home .
That 's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children .

Kyle MacDonald氏は、一見したところ不合理以外の何ものでもないプロジェクトをまもなく成功させようとしている。このプロジェクトで、同氏はブログの力を借りながら、赤いペーパークリップを手始めに物々交換を重ね、1軒の家を手に入れようとしている。
昨年から家探しを始めたMacDonald氏は、カナダや米国の人々と物々交換を重ね、現在はアリゾナ州フェニックスの家を1年無料で借りている。
同氏は 「 one red paperclip 」 という自分のブログで、自分が履歴書を留めるのに使ったペーパークリップを手はじめに物々交換をしながら、最終的に家を1件手に入れるという意図を発表した。そして、同氏は目標達成までもうあとわずかのところまで来ている。
「 これが病みつきになっている。自分が物々交換を続けて最終的に家までたどり着きたいという話は、あまりにも多くの人に知れ渡ってしまった。ここまで来て失敗したら惨めすぎる。世界中のどこでもいいから家を手に入れたい。交換を続けて家を手に入れ、そこに引っ越すなんてめったに経験できることではない」（MacDonald氏）
26歳のMacDonald氏は現在モントリオールで暮らしているが、昨年はフリーターを続けながら旅をしていた。このプロジェクトは、もともと同氏が子どものころ友人と遊んだ「わらしべ長者」ゲームのネット版として始まったものだが、いまではこれが同氏の本業になってしまった。また、そこから同氏の成功を願うインターネットカルトも生まれている。人気の高いboingboingなどのブログも数カ月前から、同氏の進展具合を追っている。
MacDonald氏のこれまでの経過は以下のようになっている。
- ペーパークリップを魚の形をしたペンと交換
- 魚の形のペンを面白い顔の付いた陶製のドアノブと交換
- 陶製のドアノブをキャンプ用のコンロと交換
- コンロを発電機と交換
- 発電機をビヤ樽付き 「 パーティーセット」と交換
- 「 パーティーセット」をスノーモービルと交換
- スノーモービルをカナダのブリティッシュコロンビアへのパッケージ旅行と交換
- 旅行を小型トラックと交換
- 小型トラックをレコーディング契約と交換
- レコーディング契約をフェニックスにある賃貸住宅と交換
MacDonald氏は、物々交換のたびに新しく手に入れたものを公開し、これを見ただれかが次の問い合わせをしてくるのを待つ。そして、自分のブログの読者からの意見を参考にどの申し込みを採用するかを判断している。

Google ’s supremo stunned the British Conservative party ’s annual conference — and thousands of politicians in Western democracies — when he said the next step in cyberspace was the “ truth predictor . ”
Within five years , new software will allow voters anywhere to check in real time the probability that political statements are factually correct .
“ Think about having every one of your voters online all the time , inputting ‘ is this true or false ? ’ ” said Eric Schmidt , Google ’s chairman and chief executive officer .
The software will put a serious crimp on the many politicians running for election or re-election with a steady diet of speeches peppered with untruths .
This could make politics unrecognizable , hopefully for the better .
But the electronic truth squad may provide only a brief respite of enlightenment before yet another gigantic leap in human evolution .
Fred C. Ikle , one of America ’s foremost strategic thinkers , in his latest book “ Annihilation from Within ” ( Columbia University Press ) , sees the ever - faster advances in brain science and computers merging to build superhuman intelligence systems .
Brain - computer - interface ( BCI ) research projects are proliferating among universities in the G - 8 major industrial countries and China .
And when this quest succeeds , Mr. Ikle says it will trump the latest supercomputers ( already up to 73 trillion operations per second ) and the best human experts .
In a nanosecond of history , the evolution that took millions of years from primates to Homo sapiens will jump into the unknown .
Homo connectus will relegate the obsolete nation - state and its dysfunctional institutions to artifacts of history , quaint but useless .
This gigantic leap of history will “ obliterate all previous notions about military power , pose a fundamental challenge to all religions , and eventually upend human civilization . ”
Thus , it previews the annihilation of a country ’s political order from within .
At 107 pages , Mr. Ikle ’s tome is a quick , expertly crafted , fascinating read , at once forward - looking and historical .
It covers a wide variety of topics from how science and the political order have been marching out of step to different drummers , from Galileo to the birth of Homo connectus , to the triggering of an act of terrorism employing a weapon of mass destruction , an event that in turn could hoist an unscrupulous dictator to supreme power .
Today ’s Global War on Terror , says Mr. Ikle , is fixated on the remnants of al Qaeda , the killing in Iraq and Afghanistan , the danger of new terrorist attacks in the U.S. and friendly countries , the nuclear program in Iran and related dangers , all of which he looks at in the rearview mirror of history .
Because once a couple of clandestinely delivered nuclear bombs have shattered the political order of a country from within , political leadership of every major nation will suddenly find itself in a world without guideposts .
As Mr. Ikle sees it , the war on terror is only a tactical response to tactically clever attacks .
“ It does not prepare us for a strategically cunning use of WMD that is designed to annihilate our government from within , ” he writes .
One of the grim scenarios , penned by the theoretician of the early 1980s Reagan defense buildup : “ An aspiring dictator who is an insider endowed with political charisma and extraordinary strategic vision might have his henchmen obtain a couple of nuclear weapons .
With a carefully timed use of these weapons the sudden nuclear devastation would cause great shock and widespread despair .
The morning after , the new dictator could exploit this despair and political crisis to grab total power — much like Lenin exploited the misery and chaos of war - ravaged St. Petersburg . ”
From decade to decade , modern science coupled with the technological revolution has become a self - sustaining force that sets it apart from all other fields of human endeavor .
But , says Mr. Ikle , no such momentum is discernible in society , government and international affairs .
“ Disparate faiths in the world remain deeply divided ” and “ irreconcilable disagreements often lead to … the extraordinary savagery and cruelty of religious wars . ”
Are rows over cloning and the therapeutic uses of stem cells preliminary skirmishes in a titanic global struggle over the ineluctable power of biotechnology and computer science to “ alter the innermost sanctuary of our existence , the mind that makes us human ? ”
Religious resurgence , Mr. Ikle notes , has “ spread through Africa , lit fires throughout the Muslim world , and can be observed in the United States . ”
And for mankind he foresees that “ its cultural split will become wider , unless the calamity of annihilation from within forces societies to close the chasm between the two modes of human activity .
Short of such an upheaval , the societal and religious modes of human activity cannot catch up with the ceaseless momentum of science . ”
By clinging to government structures designed for 4 million in the age of nanotechnology with 300 million people , institutions are as useless as Model - T Fords in a NASCAR race .
Mr. Ikle notes the growth of computer capabilities during the last 50 years has been greater than the growth of the brain ’s intellectual capability during hundred thousands of years .
The quest is now on for superhuman intelligence .
Its attainment , says Mr. Ikle , will revolutionize all prior considerations about national security .
The door would then be open to a fundamental transformation of the human condition .
“ We can no more imagine the political order of this new world , ” he writes , “ than a group of chimpanzees in the forest can comprehend what goes on among humans in a nearby village . ”

The government says more people are studying maths and sciences
The Royal Society of Chemistry said that as maths was a difficult subject , schools feared examination failures which would threaten their standings .
Chief executive Richard Pike also said universities were increasingly having to run remedial classes in maths .
The Department for Education and Skills said more pupils were studying maths .
Universities are having to mount remedial sessions for incoming science undergraduates
Dr Richard Pike
Dr Pike said : " Schools and students are reluctant to consider A - level mathematics to age 18 , because the subject is regarded as difficult , and with league tables and university entrance governed by A - level points , easier subjects are taken . "
In a paper entitled Why League Tables Have to Go , he said it was not unusual for students taking chemistry and biology to take another non-mathematical " quite unconnected " subject .
He went on : " Increasingly , universities are having to mount remedial sessions for incoming science undergraduates because their maths skills are so limited , with many having stopped formal lessons in mathematics two years earlier at the GCSE level . "
This contrasted strongly with countries like China where maths was taught to all up to the age of 18 , he said .
The society has set people a challenge of completing a Chinese pre-entry maths test , and published a first year English equivalent for comparison .
Dr Pike said : " Mathematics tests set in England by many universities for undergraduate chemistry students in their first term to diagnose remedial requirements are disconcertingly simple .
" They encapsulate the challenge facing this country . "
' Cheap ' criticism
He called for a national investigation into how to tackle the issue .
But the society has been accused by a maths professor of a " cheap and uninformed " attack on UK teaching .
William Shaw , professor of financial mathematics at King 's College , London , said he had taught students from many countries and their training differed .
Within the Uk the emphasis had shifted over the years .
Where once there was " a huge amount of geometry and algebra " , students these days spent more time on statistics , probability and data interpretation .
" I recall admitting and then teaching some very bright and well - taught Chinese students while a tutor in Oxford , " he said .
" At school these students had done lots of geometry , algebra and all kinds of puzzle - solving .
" But I found myself having to teach introductory calculus to some of them .
Some had just not done it . "
Similarly , in the United States , many good students might not learn calculus until they got to college .
" So I could set a test for university entrants in China ( or the US ) which many British sixth form maths students could do , based on some calculus , which could make a similarly unbalanced media story in the Chinese papers , " he said .
Curriculum changes
A Department for Education and Skills spokesman said the numbers of pupils studying science , maths and further maths was increasing .
" This trend is repeated at university level where 120,000 more young people are studying for science - related degrees than in 1997 - 98 , " he said .
" We are changing the curriculum , creating a new entitlement to give more pupils the chance to study separate physics , chemistry and biology GCSEs and piloting 250 science clubs for 11 to 14 - year - olds . "
Some £ 30 m was being spent over the next two years on recruiting 3,000 extra science teachers and encouraging more students to study sciences , he added .
Confusion over the way the WEEE directive ( Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ) is implemented in different European states has prompted Amazon to cease shipping qualifying products to the Repubic of Ireland ( IE ) .
A spokesman told The Register : " Amazon.co.uk does not deliver certain items to the Republic of Ireland because of the implementation of rules relating to the EU WEEE directive .
" The issue relates to the IE treatment of non IE based distance sellers such as ourselves .
We are deemed " producers " as far as the IE are concerned which makes us responsible as EU Importers - in fact we are not EU importers at all but source all products from within the EU . "
This means Amazon is hit by the Irish WEEE waste tariff when it sells into the Irish Republic , even though equivalent tariffs have already been paid by the producers of the kit in question .
The company says while it is committed to recycling it feels a double tariff is unfair .
The European Union will be reviewing the implementation of the directive in all member states next year .
Amazon says it hopes the EU will agree with its view .
It hopes to be able to start selling to Ireland again once the position is " clarified " . ®
Fantazy Land
Alexandia , Egypt
... or " The Worst Theme Park in the World ? "
Photos and trip report by " DubaiDave "
OK , I have just got back from a trip to Alexandria in Egypt .
Apart from arriving the day that the riots started and the place being dirty as hell we had
a nice few days away .
I had heard that there was a kiddie credit at a place called Fantazy Land but could not find anyone who had been there .
Anyway
We finally found the park and it was the worst run park I have ever been to .
On the net I had found that the entry fee was 7 Egyptian Pounds ,
around $ 1.50 .
However when I got there they said it was 13 Pounds .
I went back to the car as or whole group was going to go in , but when we got
back to the pay window it was now 30 Pounds each , Anyway , I decided to go in on my own to get some photos .
One thing to note was that when I
paid my 30 Pounds I was actually given 3 tickets with 10 Pounds written on them , something tells me I was ripped off .
lol
Anyway onto the photos ....
From the state of the sign I got a rough idea of what to expect .
The entrance was quite nicely themed .
I was told no rides were closed today , that was a lie !
This is just inside the entrance Plaza .
Not the best Main Street I have seen .
The Go Kart Track was closed .
As was the suspended monorail .
The flying House ....
Was Working !!!
Construction ??
these are the nicest photos I have of the park , will start on the bad ones soon .
this was the main cafe
Woo Hoo , a coaster credit .
It was closed .
Park Overview
This was a strange concrete box in the middle of the park .
The Dodgems had seen better days .
Several rides were set around a lagoon .
moving onto the island .
The lake had seen better days .
This area was themed on a derelict shack theme .
They had a couple of big flat rides .
Closed of course
One final shot of the enterance plaza .
AND ....
.. the little kids that wanted to know how much my camera was worth ..

Well , I ’m leaving ( on a jetplane ) again .
For Los Angeles , again .
And once again , I ’m reminded how much I hate the experience of modern air travel .
I might not have any way to combat the tedious ( and possibly ineffective ) safety regulations , but I have come up with a system to save as much money as possible .
Tip # 1 : Do n’t pay for it .
Ok , this really is n’t “ advice , ” since not everyone has big , doe -y gray eyes like I do .
But if you happen to be good at it , get someone else to pay for your flight .
I ’m not advocating begging , pleading or blackmailing ( unless you ’re really good at those ) – instead , I just wait around until someone else buys me a plane ticket .
It happens more often than you might think .
Tip # 2 : Do n’t pay much for it .
Although someone else usually pay for my ticket , I ’m always charged with the task of tracking down the cheapest ticket .
Because I ’m exceptionally good at snaking my way around the internet and finding a deal ?
Probably not .
It ’s probably more along the lines of “ I have a lot of time on my hands to scour websites . ”
The best thing to do is use some of the “ fare aggregator ” websites , which search of the other plane fare websites for you .
I have a confession to make : last time I went price checking , I brushed off the best website of all – did n’t even visit it , let alone fill out the search box and look up fares .
Funny story , actually .
Because the site is named Kayak* , and I can’t swim and thus am deadly afraid of kayaks ( the idea of getting flipped over in one and being trapped under water gives me the heebee - jeebees ) , I did n’t even visit the site .
I completely avoided it .
Not so this time , however .
I bounded over to Kayak and fell in love at first search .
Not only did it find me the lowest fare , but the advanced search options allowed me to both be flexible about dates and airports ( I can fly out of Rochester or Buffalo , and land at LAX or Burbank … does n’t matter to me ) in order to find the bestest best fare for me .
Win !
I ’ve got this cute Kayak site widget , if you want to try it out right now :
The other site I use is SideStep , which did n’t find me the same low fare as Kayak this time , but it ’s worth checking both sites every time .
Tip # 3 : Do n’t buy anything at the airport .
Seriously , there ’s nothing there you ca n’t buy elsewhere , and probably at a quarter of the price .
Be a little prepared , and you wo n’t need to buy anything in there .
I just went to the supermarket and loaded up on Pringles and those little cheddar cracker sandwiches with peanut butter inside them .
Bring your own books and magazines – airport bookstores are about the only place you ’ll ever see books selling at their list price .
The only thing you really have to buy in the airport , maybe , is a drink , since they wo n’t let you bring one in .
But you could always bring in an empty water bottle and fill it at a drinking fountain once you ’re through security .
Tip # 4 : Definitely do n’t buy anything on the plane .
$ 5 for the world ’s shoddiest pair of headphones ?
And do n’t even get me started on those SkyMall catalogs .
You ’re being catapulted across the country in a metal tube – now is not the time to be buying lawn ornaments or massage chairs .
And if the in - flight movies are n’t free , forget about them .
They ’re usually not that good anyway , and even if they are , they ’re usually edited for content .
Tip # 5 : Park the car for free .
This might be hard to pull off .
Since I ’m flying out of Buffalo again , it ’s particularly hard to find someplace to leave my car for a week , without getting charged $ 50 .
Thankfully , I have a friend who goes to college in Buffalo , who does n’t mind me leaving my car at his place , and giving me a ride from his campus to the airport – in exchange for a plate of brownies .

Another dramatic production , titled Lovelace ( 2013 ) , portrayed the dual perspectives that adult star and sexual freedom icon Linda Lovelace ( played by 27 year old Amanda Seyfried ) ( later known as Linda Marchiano ) brought to the film .
Depending on the time period of her life , she either embraced the porn film - or rallied against it and became an activist leader in the anti-pornography movement .
Years after the film was screened , Lovelace denounced the film , claiming that she was drugged , coerced and raped during filming and that " there was a gun to my head the entire time " .
In the mid-70s , actor Reems was prosecuted by the federal government ( under the Nixon administration ) on obscenity charges - a first - although later overturned , and the film was championed by Hollywood and other intellectuals for its liberated defense of First Amendment rights .
This hour - long , revolutionary X - rated film ( shot in about a week 's time , with graphic enactments of oral , vaginal and anal sex , group sex , and masturbation in a dozen and a half sex scenes ) told a simplistic plot ( with some comic elements ) about a sexually frustrated woman ( Linda Lovelace , born Linda Susan Boreman ) who wanted to " hear bells " during sex .
Her doctor , Dr. Young ( Harry Reems , born Herbert Streicher ) discovered that her clitoris was located in her throat , and that she would have to experiment with various clients before experiencing orgasm -- this ultimately led to her sexual fulfillment accompanied by fireworks , rockets blasting and ringing bells .
It was an ' event ' film - a hard - core stag film that was OK to see on a date or in mixed company , yet it was banned in many localities as obscene .
It inaugurated a period known as " Porno Chic " - it was the first cross -over adults - only film that became a hit .
After its initial period of release ( at a time of sexual revolution ) , it became a cultural phenomenon and it was fashionable to talk about the film ( and its educationally feminist theme of female sexual gratification ) or make references to it ( such as Watergate 's ' Deep Throat ' ) .
It brought adult movies into the popular culture .
Unintended for mainstream audiences , this notorious X - rated porn flick from writer / director Gerard Damiano became one of the decade 's top - grossing films , and the most influential and successful ( and profitable ) of all films of its kind .
Deep Throat was filmed in 6 days for $ 25,000 ( some sources reported $ 50,000 ) and was subsequently banned in 23 US states .
Meanwhile outdoors , the mother cleverly enticed gang member " Weasel " to have sex ( she had also convinced him to have his hands tied behind his back ) - he told her : " Now you just unzip me , and that 's all l'll need you for . "
At first , his penis ( " little thing ... poor little fellow " ) became caught in his zipper and he was unresponsive , but as she touched him more and more , he warned : " lf you do n't watch it , l'm gonna come . "
She urged : " Please come then , sweetie . "
He asked : " Do n't you want me to do you good and proper ? " - she replied : " You can do both , ca n't you ? " - he boasted : " Hell , yeah !
I can come five or six times if you want me to . "
She sank down to crotch - height , and as he was climaxing , she viciously bit off and dismembered his penis .
After returning home , she fought off Sadie with a knife , and then was able to slash her throat with the weapon in the pool .
In grotesque sequences of ultra-violent revenge , the father semi-electrocuted Krug , chipped out his teeth out with a chisel ( in a dream sequence ) and pursued him with a chainsaw and killed him ( off - screen , evidenced by blood splatter ) .
This ugly scene was intercut with views of ' surprise party ' preparations for Mari by her parents John and Estelle Collingwood ( Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr ) .
Ironically , in a later scene , the escaped convicts took refuge in the home of the upscale small - town parents , the hospitable Collingwoods - where there was animalistic payback revenge / slaughter of the gang .
Phyllis made a run for it , but was cornered , stabbed in the back by deviant Fred " Weasel " Podowski ( Fred Lincoln ) and then dis-emboweled ( after repeated stabbings ) and butchered , after which Sadie reached in and pulled out her gooey intestines to examine them .
Phyllis ' left hand and half of her forearm were amputated ( off - screen ) .
Meanwhile , red- wearing Mari had Krug 's name carved into her upper chest and was then brutally raped ( as he drooled onto her face ) .
She vomited and then walked dazedly into a nearby pond to half - submerge and cleanse herself .
Krug shot and killed her there , and she floated on the water 's surface .
Both females were searching for pot on their way to a Blood Lust rock concert when kidnapped by a group of escaped and degenerate convicts led by Krug Stillo ( David Hess ) .
In one disturbing and humiliating scene after they were taken to a woodsy area , blue - wearing Phyllis was forced to urinate with her clothes on ( " Piss ( in ) your pants ... Do it ! " ) .
The camera panned down , showing her wettened blue - jeans .
Then , they was stripped naked and forced to have oral sex with each other ( " Make them make it with each other ! " ) .
The girls went ahead , rationalizing : " lt 's just you and me here .
Nobody else .
Just you and me , okay ? "
Psychopathic , sadistic gang member Sadie ( Jeramie Rain ) also performed oral sex on Mari .
It told about the long and upsetting ordeal of two teenaged girls who were raped and tortured in backwoods - including chest - carving with a knife , forced lesbian sex and disembowelment ( with bloody intestines pulled out ) :
The film faced censorship difficulties everywhere , but especially in the UK , where an uncut version of the DVD is still unavailable .
The grainy , hand - held 16 mm footage accentuated the realism and horror without glamorization - and led to intense criticism for its graphic depiction of violence and disquieting , exploitative nature ( the film tried to defuse the horror by claiming : " It 's only a movie " ) .
Craven insisted that the film 's painful and protracted violence was " a reaction on my part to the violence around us , specifically to the Vietnam War . "
This low - budget , crude , taboo - breaking and often revolting ' snuff ' - type horror film was Wes Craven 's debut feature film and a loose remake of Ingmar Bergman 's Oscar - winning The Virgin Spring ( 1960 , Swe . ) .
A toned - down version of the film as remade in 2009 by director Dennis Iliadis , with Craven as producer .
Last Tango in Paris ( 1972 , Fr. / It. ) ( aka Ultimo Tango a Parigi )
D. Bernardo Bertolucci
Art or pornography :
That was the question raised by Bernardo Bertolucci 's juxtaposition of lust and despair , starring Hollywood icon Marlon Brando .
Bertolucci's film was a landmark , controversial erotic film with raw ( yet simulated ) sexual scenes and primitive force - critics and audiences alike asked - was it erotic art or pornography ?
It was noteworthy as the first " mainstream " film to carry the dreaded " X " rating , due mostly to the fact that the film featured a major star who had sex throughout the entire movie .
Brando and director Bertolucci were both nominated for Oscars in the highly - acclaimed and debated cinematic work - a classic piece of art - house cinema .
In 1974 , it became the first film to be prosecuted under Britain 's Obscene Publications Act - and the sodomy scene was ordered deleted .
The film was available in a censored R-rated version in 1981 ( with modifications mostly to the anal - sex butter scene ) , and as an uncut X - rated ( or NC - 17 ) version .
[ When re-released in 1997 , the MPAA re-rated the film as NC - 17 . ]
In the director 's own country , the film was seized and banned , and charged for its " obscene content offensive to public decency . "
In the mid-70s , it was permanently banned in Italy ( with all prints seized ) , its stars and director were condemned , and Bertolucci was given a 4 - month suspended prison sentence .
In the film 's story , a distraught , confused , grieving widower and middle - aged ( 45 years old ) , overweight American exile Paul ( Marlon Brando ) - after his wife 's recent suicide - plunged into a sado - masochistic , physical ( yet impersonal and basically anonymous ) relationship with young , full - breasted 20 year - old Parisienne ingenue Jeanne ( Maria Schneider ) .
She was a proper bourgeois , yet free - spirited female who was engaged to be married , but nonetheless accepted his prurient sexual demands .
Paul 's gutter - language and set of ' no questions asked ' rules was notable for the time : " We are going to forget everything we knew - everything " - and their relationship became increasingly more vile , slavish , empty , humiliating , and unromantic ( i.e. , " You know in 15 years , you 're going to be playing soccer with your tits .
What do you think of that ? " )
The film outraged some viewers for Paul 's scatological monologues , a full - body panning shot up Jeanne 's body in an elevator , including a full - frontal closeup shot of Jeanne 's pubic hair .
Also , it was notorious for its bathtub washing scene and the disturbing and explicit anal sodomy scene on the floor using butter as a lubricant during intercourse ( with his command : " Go get the butter " ) .
She passively acquiesced to rape and forced sodomy in the empty , rented apartment , as he forced her to repeat phrases such as : " the will is broken by repression . "
His emphasis was on pure sex , basically anal - a reversal of conventional romantic love .
Later , Paul reciprocated by letting Jeanne penetrate him anally with her fingers - part of his objective to " look death right in the face ... go right up into the ass of death ... till you find the womb of fear . "
But then she abandoned the apartment and they broke up .
Their previous secretive and mostly sexual affair was over , but Paul insisted that a new one was beginning , although she wished to break off their relationship and did n't want to see him again .
He wanted to resume everything , since he had fallen in love with her : " There 's nothing to understand .
We left the apartment , and now we begin and love all the rest of it . "
He told her some details of his brutalized life , things that he had withheld from her in the past : " Yeah , listen .
I 'm 45 .
I 'm a widower .
I own a little hotel .
It 's kind of a dump , but not completely a flop house .
Then I used to live on my luck and I got married , and my wife killed herself . "
Their original relationship had lost its anonymity , which she thought had been preferable : " It 's better not knowing anything . "
He chased her back to her mother 's Parisian apartment .
He playfully donned her late father 's Army cap ( he was a colonel in French North Africa ) .
When he removed it and confessed his love for her while approaching ( " And now I 've found you .
And I love you .
I wanna know your name " ) , she was horrified and fearful .
Suddenly a shot rang out - she spoke her name " Jeanne " at the same moment he was shot point - blank in the stomach .
Paul staggered to the balcony where he collapsed and died in a fetal position .
The camera tracked backwards to reveal the skyline , and Jeanne standing there with a revolver in her hand ( her father 's Army pistol from his military days ) .
Dazed , Jeanne muttered the last lines of the film to herself ( in French , translated below ) , rehearsing her lines that she would have to deliver to the police to explain his death ( rationalizing and reassuring herself that it was self - defense when the stranger attempted to rape her ) : " I do n't know who he is .
He followed me in the street .
He tried to rape me .
He 's a lunatic .
I do n't know what he 's called .
I do n't know his name .
I do n't know who he is .
He tried to rape me .
I do n't know .
I do n't know him .
I do n't know who he is .
He 's a lunatic .
I do n't know his name . "

Try cleansing your musical palette with some Fischerspooner or Kelli Ali .
Those are some of the suggestions made by the new Internet radio site Pandora.com .
It ca n't say for sure that you 'll like those other artists , but it gives you hundreds of suggestions for songs that might appeal to your personal taste .
For the past six years , Pandora founder Tim Westergren , 40 , has been overseeing the ominous - sounding Music Genome Project , which has compiled a checklist of musical signposts ( a.k.a. " genes " ) that help Pandora create a unique radio station .
Pianist and former film composer Westergren and his team of 35 Oakland , California , music geeks break down each song in their 400,000 - tune database according to their genes , which currently number more than 400 .
" Each song is analyzed using this gene pool , " Westergren said .
" Like , there are 30 vocal genes , one of them is how nasal is the voice , how much vibrato , how much falsetto they use . "
If , for instance , you pick Stefani as the signature artist on one of your stations ( you can make up to 100 different ones ) , it will tell you , with some redundancy , that her music " features electronica influences , a subtle use of paired vocal harmony , mild rhythmic syncopation , repetitive melodic phrasing and paired vocal harmony . "
The site will then start playing songs by either Stefani or artists who have similar genes , like Garbage , the French Kicks or , um , Britney Spears .
OK , so it 's not a perfect system , but Westergren said that 's part of the beauty of Pandora .
" Yes , it kind of takes the art out of it to some extent , " he said .
" But we 're quantifying it in an artistic way because we 're trying to describe musical characteristics .
We 're trying to be scientific , but there are things about music appreciation that we do n't capture and I 'm glad of that .
The kinds of things we do n't capture are the things that are hard to capture about songs , which is why we do n't predict hits or always get it right . "
So far the company has mapped the genes for 15,000 artists in four
genres / genomes : rock / pop / country , electronic / hip - hop , jazz and world music .
Inspired by his less - than - headline - worthy career as a struggling musician , Westergren has encouraged the site 's " music guru , " Michael Zapruder , to search far and wide for overlooked artists to fill out the more popular suggestions the site makes .
The result is a mix so eclectic you 're unlikely to hear it on even the most out - there Internet radio station .
Each song that 's listed is accompanied by a box that allows you to say whether you 'd like to hear similar songs or never hear them again , as well as a button that offers an explanation as to why that particular track is being played .
There 's also a link to either Amazon or iTunes to buy the music , though Westergren said being able to purchase the song is not a prerequisite for it to appear on the site .
Unlike other Internet radio services , Pandora creates your station on demand , instead of choosing from a list of top sellers or radio hits .
Pandora can be accessed for free with ads or for $ 36 a year without them ; both services allow you to e-mail your stations to friends .
Pandora keeps things mixed up by creating bundles of brief playlists that have a common thread before moving on to the next bundle of songs .
Those songs are linked through the genes assigned to them by the 30 - plus analysts on staff , who spend 20 to 30 minutes per song to suss out their unique attributes .
Dustin Hodge , 21 , a senior at the University of Washington in Seattle , got turned on to Pandora a week ago through his roommate .
" I decided to try it and I love it , " he said .
" I 'm a computer science major , so the fact that they 've gone through this music and analyzed it and can make suggestions based on what you like ... it 's the only station I know of that tailors content to what you like . "
Hodge said he created a pair of stations based around bands like Dredg , Disturbed and Mudvayne and has already been turned on to " tons " of bands he 's never heard of but now loves , such as Minus the Bear , Seemless and Plain White T's .
" Even on iTunes you 're not guaranteed that they 'll play something you like and if they do n't , you have no say , " he said .
" But Pandora really learns what you like based on the input , and I 've found tons of music already that I would have never found otherwise . "
Because of digital - rights management rules , there are some things Pandora can't do , like go backward or let you hear a particular song on demand .
Also , you can't hear more than four songs by the same artist or three songs off the same record in three hours , and you can only skip forward a limited number of times per hour .
Westergren declined to say how many users the site has , but said more than 6 million stations have been created since Pandora launched in late October .
He said fans are constantly telling him what they want via hundreds of e-mails a day .
Many of those e-mails end up with Zapruder , who buys hundreds of records for use on the site .
So far he 's charged up more than 15,000 albums , abiding by two main rules : Pandora has to own hard copies of everything it plays , and " the music ca n't suck . "
Zapruder buys 300 or more CDs a week , trying to split his purchases evenly among different genres and old and new material .
" My one mandate is to make our library awesome , " he said .
Zapruder added that he gets dozens of packages a week from unsigned indie bands and some of them make it onto the site .
" It 's good for the indie musician and it 's good for us as long as the music is good .
And if I do my job properly , your stations should always be changing . "

Back then , there was no field of computer science , no courses or schools .
The first written reference to “ software ” as a computer term , as something distinct from hardware , did not come until 1958 .
In 1953 , frustrated by his experience of “ hand - to - hand combat with the machine , ” Mr. Backus was eager to somehow simplify programming .
He wrote a brief note to his superior , asking to be allowed to head a research project with that goal .
“ I figured there had to be a better way , ” he said .
Mr. Backus got approval and began hiring , one by one , until the team reached 10 .
It was an eclectic bunch that included a crystallographer , a cryptographer , a chess wizard , an employee on loan from United Aircraft , a researcher from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a young woman who joined the project straight out of Vassar College .
“ They took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem - solving skills — bridge players , chess players , even women , ” Lois Haibt , the Vassar graduate , recalled in an interview in 2000 .
Mr. Backus , colleagues said , managed the research team with a light hand .
The hours were long but informal .
Snowball fights relieved lengthy days of work in winter .
I.B.M. had a system of rigid yearly performance reviews , which Mr. Backus deemed ill - suited for his programmers , so he ignored it .
“ We were the hackers of those days , ” Richard Goldberg , a member of the Fortran team , recalled in an interview in 2000 .
After Fortran , Mr. Backus developed , with Peter Naur , a Danish computer scientist , a notation for describing the structure of programming languages , much like grammar for natural languages .
It became known as Backus - Naur form .
Later , Mr. Backus worked for years with a group at I.B.M. in an area called functional programming .
The notion , Mr. Backus said , was to develop a system of programming that would focus more on describing the problem a person wanted the computer to solve and less on giving the computer step - by - step instructions .

from a 19 - year - old New Yorker who wanted his video on their front page .
Brandon Fletcher says he tried emailing YouTube , but when that failed , he bought an airplane ticket to Silicon Valley .
" If you believe in something — do whatever it takes to make your dream come to reality , " Brandon announced grandiosely on his MySpace page .
But he 's also keeping a video blog of the journey — which of course puts additional pressure on YouTube .
Is this the latest craze — storming a corporation 's headquarters and demanding that they listen to you ?
Brandon says he was inspired by Aaron Stanton , a 25 - year - old developer who pushed and shoved his way into a meeting with YouTube 's owners last month .
Aaron chronicled his surprise visit in a video blog called Can Google Hear Me? , and ultimately the company invited him in to hear his big idea .
It was only a matter of time before someonetried the same trick .
One of Aaron 's newly - recruited programmers even emailed Brandon to offer him encouragement .
But not everyone condones the tactic .
After wishing him luck , Rocketboom 's Joanne Colan added cynically ( but ever - so - sweetly ) " Try not to freak them out or anything . "
And one reporter even asked Brandon , " Why should you get special treatment ? "
( Brandon responded that his video has " a substantial amount " of subscribers , " so I 'm basically getting to the bottom of it to see why it has n't been featured yet . " )
Brandon have " a substantial amount " of subscribers ?
He refused to identify his special video for ZDNet , acknowledging only that it's a reality show .
But searching on the name of Brandon 's enterprise pulls up a casting call for an online dating show , an ad for that dating show on CraigsList , and a page for the dating show on YouTube .
( Which someone named Brandon has submitted to Digg . )
And more importantly : that show has just 71 subscribers .
Nevertheless , Brandon appears undeterred .
After touching down at the San Francisco airport , Brandon 's first order of business was hiring a videographer to make sure his march on YouTube was documented .
" I 'm staying with a friend from high school , " he told us at the time , and he spent over a week in the Bay Area before he was finally ready to make his move .
" I woke up to a barrage of negative e-mails and comments full of criticism , " Brandon wrote on his blog , " which only fueled my desire to succeed even more . "
Last Thursday the glorious moment came , and he posted the results in his video blog . " ' Security ' does n't let us off the elevator .
" Brandon writes that " people from the YouTube office recognized me , and let me know thatknew about the site and were waiting on my arrival ... "
He talked to two employees who gave him some t- shirts , some advice , and some free bottled water .
But they both refused to be filmed .
Brandon says he showed them his idea , and they loved it .
But he still has n't made YouTube 's front page .
Which means he 'll have to decide his next move for promoting the show : either creating another campaign — or pestering YouTube some more .
It 's surprising that there 's been such tolerance of what is now a de facto open - door policy for anyone who wants to use guerrilla tactics to tap into the rock star - making power of GooTube .
Sure , Brandon was met by security and there 's no indication that his gambit is gonna get his video on the home page of YouTube , but nonetheless , to anyone who hears or sees his story , it can only be encouraging that he got as far as he did without being man-handled by surly armed guards .
In his video blog he announces that " the mission is n't complete yet .
I guess the journey never ends .
" Good luck , Brandon .
But try not to freak them out , or anything .
GEN .
DAVID PETRAEUS , commander of U.S. forces in Iraq , has promised to return to Washington in September to report on the outcome of his surge strategy .
I hope he will say that sectarian killings , bombings and U.S. casualties are all down .
But even if he does , I doubt he can offer a clear , plausible date by which the Iraqi army and police will be able to stand on their own without massive U.S. support .
So regardless of what he concludes , we seem destined to enter the presidential election season with no credible date for a U.S. exit from Iraq .
In more than four years of war , there have been countless turning points at which we were led to expect decisive political progress in Iraq : the capture of Saddam Hussein ( December 2003 ) ; the turnover of sovereignty ( June 2004 ) ; elections for the constituent assembly ( January 2005 ) ; elections to ratify the constitution ( August 2005 ) ; and elections for the Iraqi parliament ( December 2005 ) .
The surge was the last military card we had to play , and now our bluff will soon be called .
In my view , there is only one condition under which we can withdraw from Iraq with our core interests fully protected and with a reasonable claim that our mission was accomplished , and that is when strong Iraqi military and police forces emerge that can operate independently of U.S. forces and prevent a takeover of the country by either Al Qaeda in Iraq , resurgent Baathists or Muqtada Sadr ’s Shiite militia .
Let ’s not kid ourselves .
The situation today is in some ways much worse than the one faced by President Nixon in Vietnam 35 years ago .
At that time , South Vietnam had an army with a paper strength of 1 million men that , despite its problems , was able hold on for three years after the U.S. withdrew its ground forces .
The South Vietnamese army provided Henry Kissinger with his “ decent interval ” between the U.S. withdrawal and South Vietnam ’s collapse .
( Indeed , Kissinger argues with some plausibility that the South Vietnamese military could have hung on indefinitely if Congress had n’t cut off funds for U.S. air support . )
Nothing like that exists or will exist in Iraq for the politically meaningful future .
As of November , the Pentagon claimed it had trained 322,000 Iraqi military and police , but it admitted that the actual number on hand was much lower because of desertions and attrition .
Iraqi forces continue to suffer huge shortfalls in armor , weaponry , logistics and communications , and it is unclear how they would fare without American hand - holding .
Serious training of Iraqi forces started late and never received adequate funding or top - level attention , despite the fact that Petraeus was at the helm of the training effort in recent years .
The South Vietnamese army may have been nothing to write home about in 1972 , but we are extremely unlikely to have an Iraqi equivalent by the end of 2007 .
What all this means is that even if the surge , by September , is reducing violence in Iraq to some degree , it will not guarantee a “ safe ” exit strategy for U.S. forces .
But here ’s the problem :
Do we have any other choice than to withdraw ?
We could stick it out , and I suspect that we could avoid losing in Iraq for another five , 10 or 15 years , as long as we ’re willing to maintain high troop levels , continue to spend large amounts of money and suffer more casualties .
But even the most conservative Republican candidates are unlikely to campaign on a platform of staying in Iraq indefinitely when the primary season starts next winter and the war enters its sixth year .
This means that we will have to engage in a very different debate from the one we have been having up to now , a debate not about surging and not about withdrawing with our goals accomplished but about how to draw down our forces in a way that minimizes the costs that will inevitably accompany our loss of control .
This is a difficult situation , but it is necessary .
The questions we need to address include :
How do we reconfigure our forces to provide advice , training and support , rather than engaging in combat ?
How we can withdraw safely without a serious Iraqi army to cover our retreat ?
How will we dismantle enormous bases like Camp Liberty or Camp Victory and protect the diminishing numbers of U.S. troops in the country ?
Do we trust the Iraqi military and police sufficiently to turn over our equipment to them ?
How do we protect the lives of those who collaborated with us ?
The images of South Vietnamese allies hanging to the skid pads of U.S. helicopters departing Saigon should be burned into our memories .
And what if the weak Iraqi government we leave behind falls or other political crises occur when we have fewer U.S. troops to respond ?
Can we work with proxies , resources or arms supplies to shape outcomes ?
As we draw down , the civil war is likely to intensify , and the focus of our efforts will have to shift to containing it within Iraq ’s borders .
Preventing intervention by outside forces will become an even more urgent priority .
On the other hand , it is not necessarily the case that the situation will spiral out of control .
Although the situation is graver in some ways than Vietnam , in others it is better .
Although we have no equivalent to a South Vietnamese army , the enemy has no equivalent of the North Vietnamese army .
It is hard to see any of the small factions struggling for power in different parts of the country emerging as a dominant force throughout Iraq .
The presence of U.S. forces has itself been a spur to terrorist recruitment , but as it becomes clear that we are on our way out , it will be easier for Iraqi nationalists to turn against the foreign jihadists ( as they have already begun to do in Al Anbar province ) .
An intensifying civil war will be a tragedy for Iraq , but it is not the worst outcome from a U.S. standpoint to have a number of bitterly anti-American groups duking it out among themselves .
Civil wars eventually come to an end when one side wins ( unlikely , in this case ) or when the parties exhaust themselves and drop their maximalist aims .
The war is not lost , despite the assertions to that effect by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev . ) .
But victory is not around the corner either .
We need to start figuring out how to leave this zombie - like zone now .
This is the eighth edition of Code Reads , a series of discussions of some of the central essays , documents and texts in the history of software .
You can go straight to the comments and post something if you like .
Here ’s the full Code Reads archive .
The Cathedral and the Bazaar , Eric Raymond ’s classic essay on open - source software development , is now 10 years old .
I first read it soon after its publication .
At that time the term “ open source ” was newly minted , and the movement was in the news chiefly because ( a ) it seemed to offer a threat to Microsoft , and ( b ) Netscape , at a late stage of its war with Microsoft , had decided to release its browser code under open - source license .
I was editing Salon ’s technology section in those days , and one of our central projects was Andrew Leonard ’s thorough coverage of the open - source phenomenon .
( He interviewed Raymond in early 1998 . )
I think it ’s fair to say that today CatB ( as Raymond and others now call the essay ) has proved its importance independent of its place in the long - concluded browser - war saga .
I ’ve reread it several times over the years since , and each time find something new and valuable .
In CatB Raymond identifies two different styles of open - source development :
I believed that the most important software ( operating systems and really large tools like the Emacs programming editor ) needed to be built like cathedrals , carefully crafted by individual wizards or small bands of mages working in splendid isolation , with no beta to be released before its time .
Linus Torvalds ’s style of development — release early and often , delegate everything you can , be open to the point of promiscuity — came as a surprise .
No quiet , reverent cathedral - building here — rather , the Linux community seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches ( aptly symbolized by the Linux archive sites , who ’d take submissions from anyone ) out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles .
The fact that this bazaar style seemed to work , and work well , came as a distinct shock .
One of the most common misconceptions about the essay is to equate the “ cathedral ” approach with closed source .
The line from cathedral to bazaar is actually orthogonal to the line from open source to proprietary software .
There are plenty of examples of open - source “ cathedrals . ”
And though it ’s hard to imagine instances of true closed - source “ bazaars , ” there are enough examples of extensible proprietary software products with thriving communities of users building new functionality on top of the proprietary code to see the “ bazaar ” principle at work in some limited form , even in the closed - source world .
Raymond argued that the bazaar style exemplified by the Linux project represented a new methodological advance for software development .
With a horde of volunteer developers collaborating across the Net , Brooks ’
Law could be transcended , and large quantities of programmer brainpower could be harnessed without getting stuck in the tar pit .
“ Given enough eyeballs , all bugs are shallow . ”
It ’s important to note that Raymond explicitly excluded the initial work of a project from this principle :
It ’s fairly clear that one cannot code from the ground up in bazaar style [ IN ] .
One can test , debug and improve in bazaar style , but it would be very hard to originate a project in bazaar mode .
Linus did n’t try it .
I did n’t either .
Your nascent developer community needs to have something runnable and testable to play with .
When you start community - building , what you need to be able to present is a plausible promise .
Your program does n’t have to work particularly well .
It can be crude , buggy , incomplete , and poorly documented .
What it must not fail to do is ( a ) run , and ( b ) convince potential co-developers that it can be evolved into something really neat in the foreseeable future .
Today the concepts in CatB — like ” Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer ’s personal itch , ” “ Good programmers know what to write .
Great ones know what to rewrite ( and reuse ) , ” and “ Release early , release often ” — have become commonplaces in the field .
And a significant number of large open source projects have built on them .
Today ’s rapid evolution of Web - based applications seems often to be built on open - source infrastructure foundations ( the “ LAMP ” stack , with variations like Ruby on Rails ) .
But it ’s not clear to me that “ Web 2.0 ” has produced many bazaars itself .
Or maybe they just have n’t attained sufficient scale or prominence to have landed on my radar .
In a recent blog posting , Ted Leung ( a developer and manager on the Chandler project that served as the central story of Dreaming in Code ) discussed the many looming difficulties of developing what he calls “ Rich Internet Applications ” ( RIAs ) .
Leung , a longtime participant in the Apache project and a confirmed believer in open source methods , considers the available toolsets for RIA developers : AJAX is popular but , he says , a “ nightmare ” for cross - platform development .
Adobe ’s Flash / Flex is far less nightmarish .
Trouble is , it ’s proprietary .
To me , this suggests that , whatever other benefits the open source bazaar approach may have conferred on the world of Web development today , it has not provided solutions to the next wave of problems today ’s developers confront .
Not yet , anyway !

Every Tuesday is Finance & Family Day at Zen Habits .
As you might already know , I ’ve got a big family — the wife and I plus six rugrats .
Plus a cat and a dog .
We can go through an awful lot of food .
Groceries ( along with the rent and car and gas ) are one of our biggest expenses .
I allocate as much in our budget as I can to groceries , simply because I want to make sure we ’re never short on food .
Also , cooking our own food is just so much less expensive than eating out .
And as I figure that most of my readers , whether they have big families or not , go grocery shopping now and then , I thought I ’d pass along some of my favorite tips .
These are not all my original tips —
I ’ve picked up dozens over the years from magazines , books and websites .
But these are the best of them , plus some I ’ve figured out on my own .
So pick and choose from among these tips , which I hope will be of use to you and your family :
Always go with a list .
If you go without a list , you may as well just throw your money away .
Better yet , donate it to me — I probably need it more than you . :)
Seriously , though , you need to prepare a list of everything you need , pulling from your weekly menu ( next tip ) and checking to make sure you do n’t have it in your pantry , fridge or freezer .
Make sure you ’re not forgetting anything .
Now stick to that list .
Plan out a weekly menu .
This is the best way to ensure that your list is complete , and that you have enough to serve your family dinner for the week .
I often plan a weekly menu and then duplicate it for the next week — this way I can shop for two weeks at once .
Be sure to plan a leftovers night .
Do n’t go when you ’re hungry .
This is a common tip , but it ’s true : when you ’re hungry , you want to buy all kinds of junk .
You ’ll end up spending a lot more .
Eat a good meal first , and you ’ll be more likely to stick to your list .
Have a budget .
When I go to the store , I know exactly how much I can spend .
Then I try my best to stick within that limit .
If you do n’t know how much you can spend , you ’ll certainly spend too much .
Do a rough running tally .
Related to the above tip , if you want to stay within your budget , it ’s best to know where you ’re at .
Then , when you can see you ’re going to go above it , you can decide whether you really need that 10 - lb. box of bon bons .
I keep a running tally on my grocery list , just rounding off so I can do some quick math .
An item costs $ 1.85 ?
I say $ 2 .
Then I do n’t need a calculator or all those complicated math skills .
Keep a list on your fridge , and write things down immediately .
When you run out of something , do n’t leave it to your memory .
Jot it down immediately , and you ’ll never have to run back to the store because you do n’t have eggs .
Make a pantry checklist .
Make a checklist of everything you normally stock in your pantry .
Keep it posted on the pantry .
Put a slash next to each item for the number of items you have ( if you have two cans of stewed tomatoes , put two slashes ) .
Then , when you use something , turn the slash into an x .
This makes it much easier when it comes time to make your list .
Keep things stocked for quick - n- easy meals .
Easy meals for us might be spaghetti or mac - n - cheese or a quick stir -fry .
We ’ve always got the ingredients on hand , so we can whip something up fast when we ’re feeling lazy .
Buy in bulk when it makes sense .
If you can save money , over the course of a month or two , by buying in bulk , plan to do so .
But be sure that you ’re going to use all of it before it gets bad — it is n’t cheaper to buy in bulk if you do n’t use it .
Keep your receipts , then enter into a spreadsheet .
This will be your price list .
Use it so you know when bulk or sale items are a good deal .
It ’s also a great way to comparison shop between stores — buy your baking goods in Store A but your fresh fruits in Store B .
The spreadsheet can also serve as a checklist to use when you ’re compiling your shopping list .
Buy frozen veggies .
While fresh veggies are a little better , frozen veggies are almost as good , and much better than nothing .
And since you can keep them in the freezer , they rarely go bad .
When you ’re running low , write it down .
Do n’t wait until you run out .
when you see there ’s only three toilet paper rolls left , put it on your list .
Because when you run out , it will be too late . :)
Cut back on meat .
Meat is expensive .
We have vegetarian meals several times a week ( think pasta or chili ) and for other meals , you could just use a little meat as a kind of seasoning instead of the main ingredient — think Asian , Indian and other such cultural food .
Actually , I eat vegetarian all the time , but the wife and kids do a little of each .
Pack your own lunch snacks .
Buying pre-made snacks is convenient , but a big waste of money .
Buy little baggies and buy the snacks in bulk , then it will take just a few minutes to pack some snacks for lunch each day .
Make leftovers for lunch .
Plan to cook a bit extra for each dinner , so that you ’ll have leftovers for your lunch and for the kids ’ lunches .
Pack it right away , after dinner , so you do n’t have to worry about it in the morning .
Cook a lot , then freeze .
Alternatively , you can cook a whole mess of spaghetti ( for example ) and freeze it for multiple dinners .
A great idea is to use one Sunday and cook a week ’s ( or even a month ’s ) worth of dinners .
Plan 5 - 6 freezable dinners and cook them all at once .
Always have batteries , toilet tissue and light bulbs .
And other necessities that you always seem to run out of — buy a whole bunch when they ’re on sale , or buy in bulk .
Be sure to check to see if you have these items before you go to the store .
Try crock pot dinners .
We discovered these in the last year , and they are easy and cheap and tasty .
Cut up a bunch of ingredients , throw them in the pot in the morning , and have dinner ready for you when you get home .
Can anything be more perfect than that ?
I submit that it cannot .
Clip coupons .
I know , sometimes they seem like too much trouble .
But it ’s not really that hard to clip a few coupons and toss them in a coupon envelop to take on your grocery shopping trip .
And you can save 10 - 20 % of your bottom line with coupons .
Check store entrances , newspaper and flyers for coupons .
Only use coupons for items you were already planning to buy .
Do n’t let them trick you into buying something that ’s not on your list , just to “ save ” money .
Look for specials .
Every store has specials .
Be sure to look for them in the newspaper , or when you get to the store ( they often have unadvertised specials — look on the higher and lower shelves for deals ) .
Do n’t buy them unless they ’re things you always use .
Try the store brands .
Brand names are often no better than generic , and you ’re paying for all the advertising they do to have a brand name .
Give the store brand a try , and often you wo n’t notice a difference .
Especially if it ’s an ingredient in a dish where you ca n’t taste the quality of that individual ingredient .
Cut back on your “ one - item ” trips .
They waste gas , and almost inevitably , you buy more than that one item .
If you plan ahead , make a weekly menu , and shop with a list , this should drastically reduce the number of trips you make for a small number of items .
But if you still find yourself running out for a few items , analyze the reason — are you not making a good list , are you forgetting some items from your list ?
Stock up on the things you frequently go out for .
Sugar cereals are a bad buy .
Lots of money for no nutrition .
Look for whole grain cereals with low sugar .
Add fruit for better flavor .
Be watchful at the register .
Keep an eye on the scanner — you ’ll keep the cashier on his toes , and catch any mis-priced items .
When there ’s a sale , stock up .
Sale items can be a great deal .
If it ’s an item you normally use , buy a bunch of them .
Comparison shop .
Look at the different brands for a certain type of product , including store brands .
Sometimes there will be a significant difference .
Be sure you ’re comparing apples to apples — you need to divide the price by the amount ( ounces , pounds , etc. ) in order to get the comparable unit price .
Go during slow times .
One of my favorite times to shop is late at night .
But during working hours or other non-peak times is good too .
Avoid right after 5 p.m. , on paydays and near major holidays .
Know when the store stocks its fresh fruits and veggies .
In my area , that makes a big difference .
Fruits and veggies can go bad quickly , because they have to be shipped .
So I know that the store re-stocks on Thursdays , and so I usually go on Thursdays or Fridays , otherwise I ’ll be getting old items .
Plan one big trip a month for bulk staples .
You can get fresh items at another store on other weeks , but doing a big bulk trip will cut back on the expense and amount you have to carry for the other three weeks .
Avoid buying on impulse at the bulk store too — just because they sell a lot of it does n’t mean you ’re saving , if you were n’t planning on buying it in the first place .
Avoid trips to the corner store .
Or the gas station !
These are some of the most expensive stores .
( Ranking right up there with airport stores . )
Try co-ops .
You can often save a lot of money at these types of places for staples .
Consider shopping at two stores .
There ’s no store with a monopoly on savings .
Each has savings on different items on different weeks .
You might switch between two stores on alternate weeks .
Think deep freeze .
If you really want to save , you ’ll need a big freezer .
Ask around — someone you know might have a relatively new model they do n’t need anymore .
You can use freezers to stock up on meat , frozen veggies , and similar staples , and to freeze big batches of pasta , casseroles , and other dinners you prepare ahead of time .
Use everything possible .
Got a bunch of leftover ingredients ( half an onion , a bit of tomato , some pasta , a few other veggies ? ) … combine them for a quick meal , so that these do n’t go to waste before your next grocery trip .
The more you can stretch the food , and the less you waste , the less you ’ll spend in the long run .
Do n’t waste leftovers .
Have a list on your fridge of what leftovers are in there , so you do n’t forget about them .
Plan a leftover night or two , so you ’re sure to eat them all .
Pack them immediately for lunch , so they ’re ready to take the next morning .
Do n’t buy junk food ( or buy as little as possible ) .
Junk food not only costs a lot of money for about zero nutrition , but it makes you and your family fat and kills you .
Talk about a bad deal !
Opt for fruits and veggies instead .
Rain check .
If an item is on sale but the store has run out of stock , ask for a rain check .
Go when the kids are in school .
When you bring kids , they will pester you and pester you until you buy some kind of junk food .
Even if you ’re able to stick to your guns , it ’s not pleasant saying no 10 million times .
In most cases , you ’ll save money shopping without the kids .
Go for whole foods .
The processed kind is lacking in nutrition and will make you fat .
Look for things in their least processed form — whole grain instead of white or wheat bread , fresh fruit instead of canned or juice , whole grain cereal or oatmeal instead of all other kinds of cereal .
You get the idea .
Read labels .
Look for trans fat , hydrogenated oils , high amounts of sugar , saturated fat , lots of sodium , cholesterol .
Then avoid them like the plague .
Look instead for fiber , good fats , protein , vitamins , calcium .
Clean out your fridge .
You ’ve got stuff growing in there and turning from solids to liquids .
The leftovers have begun to organize their own political party .
Toss em out and make room for the new .
Stick to your list .
Avoid impulse buys .
They are almost always bad , and even if it ’s just a couple dollars , they will add up to $ 50 - 100 for a trip .
Over the course of a year , that can mean thousands .
Tell yourself you will not buy anything that ’s not on your list unless it ’s an absolute necessity ( why is n’t toilet paper on my darn list ? ) .
Use store savings cards .
These can add up to big savings over the long run .
Cut back on your restaurant eating .
It ’s never cheaper or more nutritious than eating at home .
Plan your dinners ( see above tip ) and bring your lunches to work and save a ton of money .
Avoid frozen dinners or prepared entrees .
Again , these cost way more and are usually much less nutritious .
Drink water .
If you regularly drink iced tea , Tang , sodas or other types of drinks , cut those out completely and just drink water .
It ’s much better for you , and much cheaper .
Prepare your grocery list by aisle .
If you regularly shop at the same stores , organize your list so that you can easily find and check off items as you walk down the aisle .
We always shop from right to left , so we ’re not constantly running back and forth in the store .
Get cloth grocery bags .
You ’ll save tons of plastic over time , and help the environment tremendously .
Pack healthy snacks for the kids .
Whole wheat crackers , popcorn , cut - up fruit , raisins , and other kid-friendly snacks are much better than the junk you often see in kids ’ lunches .
And cheaper .

You know how it is : you 've just spent five years lovingly crafting an HO - scale layout of Clapham Junction but can't help feeling there 's a certain something missing which would lend your model railway an authentic urban edge .
Well , fret not , because down at the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg , the Busch company recently unveiled its " latest contribution to the model train scenery business " - a set of figurines depicting a group of cops dragging naked strumpets onto the street and entitled " Police Raid on a Brothel " .
We kid you not .
Spiegel Online has photographic evidence here ( NSFW ) , and also features a nice snap of the Viessmann company 's " Sexy Lovers in Motion " - accurately described by the paper as " a man and a woman having sex on a red blanket , in the missionary position " .
Yes indeed , the world of model railways really has moved on since I was a lad .
Shown here is one of the tamer offerings by Busch - " Admiring the Scenery " - which comes complete with " air mattress , fence with ' knothole ' , bicycle and tree " .
If you fancy something a bit more hard core , try Fleischmann , whose toy fair display included a river beside which " a heavily built and highly aroused man is ... getting a blowjob " .
Spiegel Online elaborates : " His arms are outstretched .
He 's frozen in an eternal orgasm .
The woman providing him with his public bliss is sitting on an inflatable mattress and wearing a straw hat . "
Remarkable .
Suffice it to say , the Vulture Central train layout now features a naked prostitute trying to avoid arrest by orally pleasuring a police officer while a bloke on a bike cops an eyeful through a hole in the fence . ®

Editor 's note : Craig Newmark is the founder and customer service representative of craigslist.org , an online community that helps people find jobs , places to live or other services unique to their city .
In 2005 , Time magazine named him one of America 's most influential people .
Mike McCurry presents an opposing viewpoint in an accompanying commentary .
( CNN ) -- Most Americans believe that if you play fair and work hard , you 'll get ahead .
But this notion is threatened by legislation passed Thursday night by the U.S. House of Representatives that would allow Internet service providers to play favorites among different Web sites .
Here 's a real world example that shows how this would work .
Let 's say you call Joe 's Pizza and the first thing you hear is a message saying you 'll be connected in a minute or two , but if you want , you can be connected to Pizza Hut right away .
That 's not fair , right ?
You called Joe 's and want some Joe 's pizza .
Well , that 's how some telecommunications executives want the Internet to operate , with some Web sites easier to access than others .
For them , this would be a money - making regime .
Next stop is the Senate .
If this becomes law , your Yahoo Inc. e-mail account could operate more slowly , unless Yahoo ponies up big bucks to the major telecommunication companies that bring the Internet into your home .
By the same token , your craigslist classifieds ( I'm the Craig from craigslist ) could grind to a halt , unless my company pays up .
This is not fair .
Telecommunication companies already control the pipes that carry the Internet into your home .
Now they want control which sites you visit and how you experience them .
They would provide privileged access for themselves and their preferred partners while charging other businesses for varying levels of service .
But why change a good thing ?
Right now , the Internet is a level playing field for everyone .
The wonky term for this is " Net neutrality . "
When the Internet is neutral , everyone can use it , just like everyone can use public roads or airwaves .
All businesses on the Internet get an equal shot at success .
Here 's how Susan Crawford , a professor of cyberlaw and intellectual property at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York City , puts it :
" Think of the pipes and wires that you use to go online as a sidewalk .
The question is whether the sidewalk should get a cut of the value of the conversations that you have as you walk along ?
The traditional telephone model has been that the telephone company does n't get paid more if you have a particularly meaningful call -- they 're just providing a neutral pipe . "
That 's the gist of the issue .
The telecom executives tell us that they can be trusted to play fair to let all companies , and not just their paying partners , be equally accessible from homes everywhere .
But some of these executives have admitted that they intend to cheat .
William L. Smith , the chief technology officer for Atlanta - based BellSouth Corp. , recently told the Washington Post that BellSouth should , for example , be able to charge Yahoo Inc. for the opportunity to have its search site load faster than that of Google Inc. or vice versa .
" If I go to the airport , I can buy a coach standby ticket or a first - class ticket , " Smith said .
" In the shipping business , I can get two - day air or six - day ground . "
In my view , executives like Smith forget that they get the use of public resources , like the airwaves and public rights of way , on which they have built their businesses and made a lot of money .
As such , they should n't be able to squeeze out some Web sites in favor of others .
This would be a betrayal of the public trust .
You , the consumer , should be able to choose which sites you want to visit without the telecommunications companies interfering .
What it really comes down to is this :
The telecommunications executives say we should trust them to provide a level playing field of service , but can they be trusted to play fair ?
You already know the answer .
If not , ask your repair guy why he did n't show up when promised or consider why the telecom companies block some high - tech services from reaching your cell phone as their own services flourish , as reported recently by Walter Mossberg in the Wall Street Journal .
Or how about the fake grass - roots Web sites , such as Hands off the Internet , the telecom industry has set up to support its cause ?
Is that the height of honesty ?
It seems to me that many telecom execs have a deep investment in " truthiness , " where they make claims about this or that thing without bothering to support those claims with facts .
Perhaps the clearest example of this behavior is when they say that keeping the Net neutral , as it is now , involves more government intervention and regulation , when really the opposite is true .
So let 's keep the Net as it is now : Neutral , fair and free .

" If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it , " an old adage goes .
This applies to the Internet .
Allowing some companies to dictate who gets high - speed service and who does n't is a restriction on our freedom to choose .
Subscribers should be the ones dictating what sites they want to visit , not some " Big Brother " corporation .
Internet users are already paying monthly subscription fees , some of which goes to the telecom companies for their services .

I 've always said that the internet was too good to be true .
It was only a matter of time before the big conglomerates started rubbing their dirty paws together , stirring their brew and figuring out a way to get even richer at the expense of internet CONSUMERS .
It 's really sad .
But corporate America will win this fight , too , and yes , the rich will get richer while the rest of us working stiffs get the shaft ... again .
Gotta love this country .

I have been following this issue for some time and there are pros and cons for both sides .
The World Wide Web needs to maintain what its name says it is -- world wide .
Recently I have noticed attempts to make the web regionalized .
China 's censorship is an example of this and France 's funding of private sector web engine development is another .
The world , as a whole , needs to take part in funding this overhaul .
How ?
There is probably no end of suggestions .
Since the web benefits all , perhaps a tax specific for this .
TJ , Sackville , New Jersey
The Internet is much the same today as interstate highways were in the early 1960's ;
We cruise the web much the same way we cruise the highways only using a different vehicle .
Allowing the telecoms to commercialize and allocate the user 's priority is no different then forcing a motorist to exit at a restaurant that chooses to pay higher road taxes .
Thank goodness our road taxes and laws were never structured that way .
Nor should the Internet .
John Denman , McKinney , Texas
A two - tiered Internet is not in the best interest of the average internet user .
It 's analogous to letting a third party write a disclaimer on material that does not belong to them but favors them .
A stamp on a web page about cattle that says something like , this material has not been evaluated by the pork industry for errors , although no one solicited the opinion of the pork people .
Intellectual rights and freedoms should be protected and retained , not abused by giant corporations in their zeal to dole out the bandwidth necessary for the " fast side " of the Internet .
Mike , Staunton , Virginia
While I do n't believe that the U.S. government or any other government for that matter should regulate Internet access and how it is managed , Net Neutrality is necessary .
It essentially mandates a hands - off position that those on the business end of the telecommunications lobby do n't like .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a 200 - year prison term for an Arizona man convicted of possessing 20 child pornography images , turning down his appeal arguing the sentence was excessive or cruel and unusual punishment .

Without any comment , the high court declined to hear the constitutional challenge to the sentence given to Morton Berger , who at the time of his arrest in 2002 was a married , 52 - year - old high school teacher with no prior criminal record .
Berger ’s lawyers said his lengthy punishment was grossly disproportionate to his crime and exceeded the sentences regularly imposed in Arizona for violent crimes that result in serious injury to the victim .
They said the Arizona law , with its mandatory minimum sentence , is the toughest in the nation .
Under federal law , Berger would have received a sentence of about five years in prison .
In Arizona , conviction for sexual exploitation of a minor , including possession of images of children under the age of 15 engaged in sexual conduct , carries a sentence of 10 to 24 years in prison , without any possibility of probation , early release or parole .
Possession of each image of child pornography is a separate offense and the law requires that consecutive sentences be imposed .
Evidence at trial established that Berger possessed numerous videos and photo images of different children , some younger than 10 years old , being subjected to sexual acts with adults and other children .
The jury heard testimony that Berger had downloaded child pornography on his computer from 1996 to 2002 .
He was convicted on 20 separate counts .
The trial judge gave him the required minimum sentence of 200 years in prison -- 10 years for each count -- and rejected the prosecutor ’s request for a 340 - year sentence .
After his sentence was upheld by the Arizona Supreme Court , Berger ’s lawyer appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court .
“ If this court reviews Berger ’s entire punishment , instead of examining the sentence for a single count , it would find Berger ’s punishment excessive , cruel , unusual and unconstitutional , ” lawyer Laurie Herman wrote .
Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard opposed the appeal .
He said Berger ’s challenge “ is essentially a thinly disguised claim that he is constitutionally entitled to concurrent sentences for multiple crimes . ”

U.S. Supreme Court Overturns Ninth Circuit Decision to Bar Voter ID Requirements
Posted on by truth49
Today the U.S. Supreme Court voted unanimously to overturn a recent Ninth Circuit decision barring the enforcement of an Arizona voter ID law .
Enacted in 2004 by citizen initiative , the law required proof of citizenship for new voter registrations and photo identification at the polls .
Both the Evergreen Freedom Foundation ( EFF ) and Secretary of State Sam Reed have recommended this law as a model for Washington to follow , and today 's decision underscores the legality of such requirements .
The Court chided the Ninth Circuit for acting without having all the proper facts , and for interfering right before a major election .
Regarding the merits of voter ID laws , the Court did not make a specific ruling but noted that : " Confidence in the integrity of our electoral processes is essential to the functioning of our participatory democracy .
Voter fraud drives honest citizens out of the democratic process and breeds distrust of our government . "
Jonathan Bechtle , director of EFF's Voter Integrity Project , agreed with the Court 's ruling , saying , " Today 's unanimous decision is good news .
It helps pave the way legally for needed reforms in Washington , like proof of citizenship for voter registration .
It also sends a message to courts that the legitimate desire of voters for better election security cannot be dismissed ! "

So , thank God , Jade has been evicted .
Imagine if she had n't , that Shilpa had walked the plank ?
It would have represented a popular endorsement of flagrant racism .
The extraordinary fact , of course , is that no one , or virtually no one , ever owns up to racism .
Ron Atkinson described Marcel Desailly as a " fucking lazy , thick nigger " on air and then had the temerity to claim that he was not a racist .
Jade Goody called Shilpa Shetty " Shilpa Fuckawallah " and " Shilpa Poppadom " , and then similarly claimed that she is not a racist .
Andy Duncan , Channel 4's chief executive , in a performance which should see him sacked forthwith , claimed on Thursday that " we cannot with certainty say that the comments directed at Shilpa have been racially motivated " .
Ron Atkinson , Jade Goody and Andy Duncan are in denial - like , it must be said , millions of other whites .
No one likes to admit they are racist or bear prejudices .
Nor do they even like to be open and honest when they witness racist behaviour .
Look at the Big Brother housemates : apart from Shilpa , not one has been prepared to call it by its name ( though Jermaine Jackson , black of course , patently knows and understands ) .
The fact that hardly anyone is ever prepared to admit to racist behaviour is perhaps a sort of strength : it speaks to the fact that racism is socially inadmissible .
But it is also testimony to profound weakness , a measure of how little distance we have travelled as a society when it comes to understanding racism .
For if the truth be told , we are a society that is dripping in racism .
This is not in the least surprising .
For the best part of two centuries , we British ruled the waves , controlled two - fifths of the planet , and believed it was our responsibility to bring civilisation to those who allegedly lacked it .
There is now a belief that all that is long gone , dead and buried , history forgotten in a tsunami of amnesia about our past .
But these attitudes live on in new forms , constantly reproduced in each and every white citizen of this country .
We are not alone in our racism , of course .
Every race exhibits racism towards those whom they believe to be inferior : India is no exception , nor is China , nor is Africa .
What makes Britain - and whites - special in this regard is that we have been top of the global pile for so long , inflicted our brand of racism on so many , and have no idea what it is like to be discriminated against for our colour .
When it comes to our own racism , we shuffle our feet , fall silent , become incoherent and pretend it is not true : we do n't get it .
There seems to be some idea in the mind of Andy Duncan and the rest of the denial brigade that racism comes in a pure and quintessential form : the use of the word " nigger " , perhaps , or a blatant derogatory reference to someone 's colour .
But that is never the main form .
Racism always exists cheek by jowl with , inside and alongside culture and class .
As a rule it is inseparable from them .
That is why , for example , food , language and names assume such importance in racial prejudice .
And that has certainly been the case in Big Brother .
Food is a signifier of difference : so are names , so is language .
So Jade and her sidekicks homed in on Shilpa 's cooking and choice of food , made fun of her name and refused to learn it .
And with food came the suggestion that Shilpa 's hygiene left something to be desired , that she was unclean ( she had touched the food , it was claimed , and " you do n't know where her hands have been " ) .
In other words , not only was she different , but she came from an inferior civilisation .
Her colour too - the most obvious manifestation of racial difference - was tangentially drawn into the equation through the comment about make - up and the Indian desire to be white .
Of course , class is central .
Race always comes with class .
Jade 's reaction to Shilpa has been shaped by her own class background , her racism articulated within that context .
The fact that Jade is hardly blessed with great intellectual gifts , that her conversation is littered with profanities , that her behaviour rarely rises above the crude , lacking any kind of subtlety , and that her status as a former winner of Big Brother is her only claim to be where she is , makes it easy for the middle class to dismiss her racism as that of a crude , ill - educated , white working - class young woman , and that the middle classes would , it goes without saying , never behave in that way .
Of course , they would , and do : but they practise it in a genteel middle - class kind of way .
Just as Jade 's racism has a class intonation , so does theirs - the asides , the put - downs , and the rest .
Indeed , in some ways they are more ignorant - while masquerading as so worldly - because in general they have far less contact with ethnic minorities , unless they employ them as subordinates and / or domestics .
They live in different areas , work in different places , and send their children to overwhelmingly white schools .
Almost from the outset , Big Brother 's racism has had a new and novel dimension .
Because Gordon Brown was in India at the time , and was asked about it during his trip , the issue immediately acquired an international dimension .
In an earlier era , of course , this would have been dismissed as of no consequence : the natives could safely be ignored .
But no longer .
We saw this just a year ago in relation to the Danish cartoons and their ridicule of Islam .
Europe used to ignore what the former colonial world felt .
There was no feedback loop .
But such was the reaction in the Islamic world that it could not be ignored .
That , though , was in the context of the Muslim world which , in global terms , remains weak and marginalised .
Racial abuse of Indians is a very different matter .
India is a rising giant ; we can no longer afford to ignore , as we once did with impunity , the views and feelings of a country that represents one - fifth of humanity .
We live in what increasingly looks like a global goldfish bowl where what we do at home will be seen by the rest of the world - and duly reacted to , in a way that can not be ignored .
The test of our behaviour , of how racist we are , is no longer what the white British think .
That started to change with the self - awareness and growing confidence of our own ethnic minorities .
But the matter does not end there .
The test now , in this instance , is what Indians in India think , how they perceive us .
As Goody raged and railed against Shetty on Wednesday night 's TV broadcast , she was like a cornered animal , lashing out in every direction against something she clearly detested but also feared and felt threatened by .
She was confronted not only with the Other , but a hugely self - confident Other .
What could be worse ?
It was a metaphor for the world that is now rapidly taking shape before our very eyes .

IronPython - Do You Need It ?
There has been some lively debate in the Python blogosphere recently , about Python 3000 and also IronPython .
On the subject of IronPython , Calvin Spealman worries about the possibility of fragmentation of the Python community .
He goes so far as to say " IronPython 's users are increasingly pushing IronPython - only recipes , libraries , and tutorials . "
Firstly that ignores a massive amount of effort by the Microsoft team and the IronPython community ( Seo Sanghyeon in particular ) to ensure that IronPython maintains as much compatibility with CPython and the standard library as possible .
When reading his entry it seemed to me that Calvin did n't understand that although IronPython does n't ship with the Python standard library you can still use ( most of ) it .
Simply set the environment variable IRONPYTHONPATH to include the location of your Python library directory .
For copyright reasons Microsoft wo n't ship the standard library , but they 've put specific fixes into IronPython to address issues with it .
More importantly though , Calvin 's entry kind of misses the point of IronPython .
IronPython is more important for bringing .NET programmers to Python than it is for bringing Python programmers to .
NET .
If you do n't need .NET then you probably do n't need IronPython .
And if you 've got IronPython , you sure as hell want to know how to access .NET from inside it .
If the IronPython community does n't demonstrate how to do this then it will miss the audience it is most relevant to , and miss a huge opportunity .
That said , there are some good reasons for Python programmers to use IronPython .
These include :
Better support for multi- threading with multiple processors ( CPython can't do this )
Built - in security model with AppDomains ( CPython can't do this out of the box , although Brett Cannon is working on a model and Zope does something interesting )
Native Windows GUI ( with a relatively sane API ) via Windows Forms : better than any I 've seen for CPython
Access to third - party .NET components , especially sophisticated GUI components
IronPython is much easier to extend with C# than CPython is with C
IronPython ( on .NET ) may be an easier corporate sell
Despite that seeming like an impressive list , my guess is that it will leave most Python programmers unmoved .
IronPython is still good for Python , it raises the profile of Python .
That does n't mean you all need to use it ...
I got into IronPython because a company who had already chosen .NET needed a scripting language and were so impressed with IronPython they decided to write their whole application with it .
The more companies that do that the better .
I 've no intention of dropping CPython though , and when / if I come to write another desktop application it would probably be with CPython ( but it will be a hard decision - we have a mighty fine test framework I could use and the GUI stuff is really very nice ) .
IronPython aside , there are two new and important issues facing the Python community .
The first of these is the ' problem ' of Python 3 .
The Twisted developers have already declared that they have no current plans to port to Python 3 and my guess is that currently there are other major frameworks / projects in the same position ( Zope ? ) .
The Python developers are aiming to make as much of Python 3 as possible available in Python 2.6 .
That means that it will at least be possible to write code that runs with minimal changes on Python 2.6 and Python 3 .
There will also be the 2to3 translator that should take care of a lot of other problems .
The intention is that code that has been through the translator should n't need hand tweaking to run on Python 3 .
That way developers do n't have to maintain two branches .
Some of the changes proposed are pretty heavy though , especially the changes to strings and to the I/O layer .
I 'm personally unconvinced that ' arbitrary ' code will be able to make it through the 2to3 converter but it will be a great help .
It does n't address at all the issue of C extensions .
In the long run though I do n't think this will matter .
Even after Python 3 is stable , it 's going to take a long time before the production userbase is anything like as large as the Python 2.X userbase .
I suspect that over time this will sort itself out .
A few projects may never make the jump , but that does n't mean we should ditch this opportunity to improve Python .
History will vindicate us .
The second issue is that of alternative implementations of Python .
CPython is no longer alone .
There at least five major implementations of Python now :
CPython
IronPython
Jython
PyPy
Stackless
There is also CLPython which may or may not survive as a serious implementation .
Python is still unspecified as a language and CPython remains the ' reference implementation ' .
IronPython turned up various problems with the specification and at points there is no dividing line between implementation details and standard behaviour .
I 'm not saying that Python needs an ISO specification .
For starters that would n't solve the problem .
The problem is n't so much Python the language , it 's all the millions of lines of Python code there are out there and that includes the standard library .
IronPython uncovered various places in the standard library that rely on unspecified behaviour or implementation details .
For example , did you know that inspect.
getargspec examines Python bytecode to retrieve the varargs and varkeywargs arguments to a function .
That means that inspect.getargspec is n't available to IronPython and so help does n't work .
There has been a lot of debate in the Python community as to what extent the standard library is a core part of Python the language .
I guess to most developers they are inextricably intertwined , and that is probably right .
The PyPy project has already put some work , a lot of it through the Google summer of code , into providing pure - Python versions of C extensions .
This is good news for IronPython and hopefully the other implementations .
I also hope that the experience of IronPython feeds back into CPython .
In some cases this has already happened .
The Python 2.4 documentation said that from __future__ import ... statements were only valid as the first statement in a module .
This was n't actually the case , and the IronPython team asked whether they should follow the spec or the actual behaviour of Python .
This was fixed in Python 2.5 .
Hopefully the Python community will respond to other issues raised by IronPython , PyPy and Jython and Python will continue to flourish in new and strange lands .

When the new chocolate - coloured sofa set was delivered to her Brampton home , Doris Moore was stunned to see packing labels describing the shade as " Nigger - brown . "
She and husband Douglas purchased a sofa , loveseat and chair in dark brown leather last week from Vanaik Furniture and Mattress store on Dundas St. E .
Moore , 30 , who describes herself as an African - American born and raised in New York , said it was her 7 - year - old daughter who pointed out the label just after delivery men from the Mississauga furniture store left .
" She 's very curious and she started reading the labels , " Moore explained .
" She said , `Mommy , what is nig ... ger brown ? '
I went over and just could n't believe my eyes . "
She said yesterday each piece had a similar label affixed to the woven protective covering wrapped around the furniture .
" In this day and age , that 's totally unacceptable , " Moore said .
Douglas explained the origins of the word to daughter Olivia , telling how it was a bad name that blacks were called during the days of slavery in the United States .
" It was tough , because she really did n't understand , " Moore said .
" She 'd never heard that word before and did n't really understand the concept of it . "
Moore , who has a younger son and daughter , said she 's heard the word used many times , although it has never been directed in anger at her .
" But it 's a very , very bad word that makes you feel degraded , like you 're a nobody , " she said .
Moore said she called the furniture store the following day and three other times since , and feels discouraged that no one has returned her calls .
When interviewed yesterday by the Star , Romesh Kumar , Vanaik 's assistant manager , passed the buck to his supplier , Cosmos Furniture in Scarborough .
" Why should I take the blame ? " he said .
" I 'm a trader , I do n't manufacture .
I sell from 20 companies , maybe 50 companies .
How can I take care of all of them ? "
He said that he would check similar stock and make sure other labels were removed .
" That 's terrible , that 's a racial ... something ? " Kumar said .
" This is entirely wrong , but it 's not my fault .
It 's my job to sell good product to people . "
He said the best he could do is to give Moore the telephone number of his supplier , so she could take it up with him .
The owner of Cosmos Furniture , Paul Kumar , no relation to Romesh , said he was upset to learn packing labels on products he sold carried a racial epithet .
" I import my products from overseas , " he said .
" I 've never noticed anything like that .
This is something new to me . "
He passed the blame to a Chinese company , but apologized for the labels .
He said he would contact the furniture maker in Guangzhou and demand they remove all similar labels .
Moore said she 's not sure she wants the sofa set in her home .
" Every time I sit on it , I 'll think of that , " she said .

Humans should be careful when criticizing other humans about the industrial slaughter of animal species .
It is hard to find moral ground .
There was one small , bright spot of global consensus : whales .
It took a very long time , but most of the world agreed that these wonderful , sociable mammals , at least , should be granted a stay of extinction .
Most of the world , but not all .
A few outlying countries continue commercial or dubiously scientific whale hunts , notably Japan , which clings to its whaling ways long past the expiration of any defensible reasons for doing so .
Japanese officials defend the slaughter as a matter of tradition and science .
But as Norimitsu Onishi explained recently in The Times , the everyday consumption of whale meat became a national habit in Japan only in the lean years after World War II , when officials of the American occupation promoted it as cheap protein .
Japan ’s appetite for whale plummeted after the 1960s and never returned , Mr. Onishi reported .
As for the research that Japan insists can be performed only on dead whales , which are then butchered and sold for meat , biologists around the globe dismiss that as a sham .

The booklets would be handed out to hotels and shopping malls , on public transport and at tourist attractions .
Chinglish has become a running joke among many foreigners in China , and several websites have been set up listing humorous examples of mistranslation .
A road sign on Beijing 's Avenue of Eternal Peace warns of a dangerous pavement with the words : " To Take Notice of Safe ; The Slippery are Very Crafty " .
Menus frequently list items such as " Corrugated iron beef " , " Government abuse chicken " and " Chop the strange fish " .
The mistranslations arise because many Chinese words express concepts obliquely and can be interpreted in multiple ways , making translation a minefield for non-English speakers .
The municipal government in Beijing first tried to stamp out the problem just a month after being awarded the 2008 Olympics back in 2001 .
A year later the Beijing Tourism Bureau set up a hotline for visitors and residents to tip off examples of bad English , and said results would be reviewed by a panel of English professors and expatriates .
What are the more memorable examples of Chinglish that you have seen ?
Your comments :
A lot of common errors were transposing errors , for example : First Aid Centre was Fivst Aicl Centrt .
Another sign read :
Help potect the cultural relecs , help protect the railings .

I have two favourites from spending many years working in China .
At the Terracotta Warriors Museum in Xi'an a sign said " Cherishing Flowers and Trees " which meant " keep off the grass " .
The other on a cruise on the Yangtse River , " Do n't Bother " instead of " Do not Disturb " on the cabin doors .
There were many others but these always made me smile .

Whilst living in Beijing about a year ago , I came across a park in a residential area in the Shunyi district which ( although intended for use as a ' dog park ' ) was translated to ' Dog - Bark Park ' .
Not to mention an apartment building which , for some bizarre reason beyond my knowledge was named " An Australian Lady and Her Lifestyle " .

At the Simatai section of the Great Wall of China there is a sign that reads : People and flowers , plants help each other in breath , if you pick the flowers they will die , and you will reduce your life too .
A lovely message somehow gone somewhat wrong .

At one of the bigger train stations ( and I 'm kicking myself right now because I can't remember which one ! ) there is a huge , and I mean huge , sign which states simply " Question Authority " .
Remember , this is an incredibly heavily controlled officially Communist state .
The sign is merely pointing to the help desk .

The taps in my hotel room in Beijing had a fancy engraved sign " No Drinking Without Dealing " - I suspect they meant " boiling " .
There are so many examples but my favourite may have been at the Ming Tombs " Environmental Sanitation of the Scenic Spot Needs Your Conserve " - indeed it does .

I have stayed in Shanghai many times for work .
The new subway at Jing An Temple was proudly opened early for tourist trips .
All the east exits said " East Exit " .
All the west exits said " Wast Exit " .
The next trip back the offending words were covered with duct tape .

While working in Taiyuan , north of Beijing we had the pleasure of visiting a local tourist attraction , one of the signs that had us chuckling was , " do not overtransgress " which is a good guideline , but I do n't think you would find a similar sign in an English speaking nation .

" Cheney is of such an unsavory character , that he makes his protégé , felon Scooter Libby , who was recently convicted of perjury and obstructing justice , seem as pure as a nun , " he said Tuesday .
" If BYU seeks to bring a model of abuse of power , greed and political extremism , which seeks to decimate citizens ' rights guaranteed by our laws , then Cheney is a perfect choice .
But if , on the other hand , the university hopes to offer a model to graduates of love and service to humanity , then better candidates are available . "
In the ATOM publication , we examine how the only way to address the range of seemingly unrelated economic challenges in a holistic manner is to monetize technological deflation .
For reasons described therein , the countries best suited to do this are small countries with high technological density .
Furthermore , we examine the importance of the first - mover advantage , where when a country can monetize the technological deflation in the rest of the world for the benefit of their domestic economy , the first $ 1 Trillion is practically free money .
In Chapter 10 , I outline a systematic program for how the US could theoretically transition to this modernization of the economy .
But I then identify the four countries that are much more suitable than the US .
These are two Western democracies ( Canada and Switzerland ) and two Pacific - Rim city states ( Singapore and Hong Kong ) .
But it is possible to create custom solutions for more countries as well .
To determine how to do that , let us go back to a seminal event in the emergence of these ideas .
What Japan Discovered for the Benefit of Humanity :
Few people have any awareness of what an important event happened in April of 2013 .
Up to that time , the US was the only country that had embarked on a program to engineer negative interest rates through monetary creation ( rather than the punitive and reductive practice of deducting from bank accounts ) .
Japan decided that after two decades of stagnation and extremely low interest rates , something more drastic and decisive had to be done .
The early success of the US Quantitative Easing ( QE ) program indicated that a more powerful version of this could be effective against the even worse stagnation that Japan 's economy was mired in .
In April of 2013 , the Bank of Japan ( BoJ ) decided to go big .
They embarked on a program of monetary easing in the amount of 30 % of their annual GDP .
This was a huge upgrade over the US QE programs for two reasons .
Firstly , it was much larger as a proportion to the host nation 's GDP , and secondly , it had no end date , enabling long - term decisions .
Since the formal economics profession in the West is burdened by a wide range of outdated assumptions about money printing , inflation , and technology , the Western Economists yet again predicted high inflation .
And yet again , they were wrong .
There was no inflation then at the start of the program .
Japan had correctly called the bluff of the inflation specter .
The third - largest economy in the world could print 30 % of its GDP per year for five years , and still experience no inflation .
When I observed this , I drew the connection between technological deflation ( worldwide ) and the vanishing QE ( also worldwide ) .
Most of Japan's QE was flowing outside of Japan ( and indeed into the US , which had long since stopped QE , and has forestalled a major market correction only by drawing from overseas QE , mainly from Japan ) .
Hence , the combined QE of the world was merely offsetting the technological deflation worldwide .
Japan 's big gambit proved this , and in doing so , they showed us how much QE can be done before world inflation even hits 3 % ( i.e. much more than formal economists thought ) .
What is a Small , Prosperous Country to do ?
While it is always better to be a prosperous country than an impoverished one , almost every small country ( the size of Canada or smaller ) is faced with a major vulnerability in the modern economy .
Their economy invariably depends on one or two major industries , and is hence vulnerable to a technological disruption that arises from somewhere else in the world .
The need to diversify against such external risks is obvious , but most countries are not on the best path to achieve this goal .
These days , everyone I meet from the government of some foreign country seems to have the same goal for their country - to create an ecosystem of local technology startups .
This goal is not just extremely difficult to attain , but it is very misguided .
Technology is becoming increasingly governed by winner - take - all dynamics and capital concentration , which means even in the US , rival cities are unable to compete with Silicon Valley ( which itself has concentrated into a smaller portion of the San Francisco Bay Area than was the case in the late 1990s ) .
Small countries with technology sectors , such as Israel and Singapore , started decades ago and have a number of unique factors in their favor , including a major Silicon Valley diaspora .
Hence , a country that thinks it is productive to create a tech startup cluster in their countries will almost certainly create a situation where young people receive training at local expense , only to leave for Silicon Valley .
So these initiatives only end up feeding Silicon Valley at the expense of the original country .
Even if a few tech startups can be forcibly created in the country , it is extremely unlikely that they will achieve any great size within even 15 years .
Take , for example , a country like New Zealand .
It has many favorable characteristics , but certain disadvantages as well in an increasingly globalized economy .
It relies on agricultural and dairy exports , as well as the film industry and tourism .
It is too remote to easily plug into the well - traveled routes of tech executives ( less than 30 M people live within 3000 miles of New Zealand ) or major supply chains .
It is too small to be a significant domestic market for tech ( particularly when a functional tech ecosystem has to comprise of startups in multiple areas of tech in order to achieve rudimentary diversification ) .
New Zealand 's success in getting Hollywood films shot in New Zealand cannot similarly translate into getting some Silicon Valley business , as an individual film project has a short duration and distinct ending , with key personnel on site for just a brief period .
Technology , by contrast , is inherently endless , and requires interdependency between many firms that have to have co-location .
Furthermore , no society is capable of placing more than 1 - 2 % of its population into high - tech professions and still have them be competitive at the international level ( most tech innovation is done by people in the top 1 % of cognitive ability ) .
For this reason , a tech startup ecosystem does not create broad prosperity ( it is no secret that even within Silicon Valley , only a fraction of people are earning almost all the new wealth .
Silicon Valley has among the most extreme inequality found anywhere ) .
Now , from the research contained in the ATOM publication , we know that there is a far easier solution that can deliver benefits in a much shorter time .
New Zealand 's fiscal budget reveals that as of 2018 , it collects about $ 80 Billion in taxes and spends the same $ 80B per year .
The world was recently generating $ 200B / month in QE and is still doing an insufficient $ 120B / month .
The entire annual budget of New Zealand is well below one month of the world 's QE - the QE that is needed just to halt technological deflation .
It would be very easy for New Zealand to waive all income taxes , and merely print the same $ 80 B / year from their central bank .
A brief transition period can be inserted just to soften the temporary downgrades that international rating agencies deliver .
But the waiver of income tax will boost New Zealand 's economy with immediate effect .
It can even enter and dominate the lucrative tax - haven industry until other countries adopt the same strategy .
As we know , it is difficult for government officials , legislators , and statesmen to take such a drastic step , particularly when the entire Economics profession is still mired in outdated thinking about how QE will someday , somehow cause inflation ( despite being wrong about this for 9 years and over the course of $ 20 Trillion in cumulative world QE ) .
For this reason , a second , less drastic option is also available for New Zealand .
That involves create what I describe as a Sovereign Venture Fund , where the New Zealand Central Bank creates a segregated account that is completely partitioned off from the domestic economy , and prints money to place into that account ( say , $ 100 Billion ) .
It is crucial that this money not circulate domestically at first , as it would cause inflation .
The purpose of this $ 100B Sovereign Venture Fund is to invest in startups worldwide that might be disrupting New Zealand 's domestic industries .
This model is extremely effective and flexible , as :
i ) The money was not taken from New Zealand taxpayers , but rather generated for free by the New Zealand Central Bank .
Hence , it can invest in speculative startups across the world with far more boldness .
ii )
The diversification achieved is immediate , and can always be adjusted with equal immediacy as needed .
iii )
The Fund is leveraging the rest of the world 's technological deflation for New Zealand 's domestic benefit .
iv )
Tech startups worldwide become extremely vocal advocates for the fund , and even the country itself .
It boosts New Zealand 's branding ( generating even more tourism ) .
v ) Fund gains can be used to offset government spending by replacement of income tax , or to fund training to enable citizens to modernize their skills .
It can also provide a greater social safety net to cushion industries buffeted by disruption , but without taxing those who are still working .
This is how to repatriate the money without inflation .
vi )
Even a larger fund of $ 800B can earn $ 80B / year from a 10 % return , which exceeds the total taxes collected by the country .
The Sovereign Venture Fund is an extremely effective , speedy , and versatile method of economic diversification .
It can be customized for any prosperous country ( for example , an oil exporter should simply invest in electric vehicle , battery , and photovoltaic technologies to hedge their economic profile ) .
As a huge amount of worldwide QE has to be done just to offset technological deflation , there is no contribution to inflation even worldwide , let alone domestically .
As the winds of technological change shift , the Fund can respond almost immediately ( unlike a multi - decade process of creating a tech startup ecosystem only to worry if the sectors represented are about to be disrupted ) .
Since there is a very high and exponentially rising ceiling of how much world QE can be done before world inflation reaches even 3 % ( about $ 400B / month in 2018 , as per my calculations ) , there is an immense first - mover advantage that is possible here .
The first $ 1 Trillion is effectively ' free money ' for the country that decides to be Spartacus .
New Zealand , in particular , has even more factors that make it a great candidate .
The NZ $ is currently too strong , which is crimping New Zealand 's exports .
This sort of program may create a bit of currency weakening just from the initial reaction .
For this additional reason , it is a low - risk , high - return strategy for generating a robust and indeed indestructible safety net for New Zealand 's citizens , hedging them from the winds of global technological disruption .

Raising the Level ?
There are times I have to wonder if it is all worth it .
Is the time I spend here just wasted effort ?
This is one of those times .
Now I know that Daily Kos is not designed and built to fulfill my needs .
And I know that there are people for whom this is nothing more than someplace they can bitch and moan , merely " a board " or an " opinion forum " .
It is more than that to me .
I view Daily Kos as a community .
But what kind of community do I see ?
Increasingly I am afraid that what I see is a community built on disrespect for the views of others .
At first , the thing that attracted us to this place was disrespect for the views of the " other side , " of the administration and their minions and supporters , of their self - serving ( lack of ? ) principles and convoluted logic .
But I guess that has n't been enough for some of us .
We have turned the disrespect upon ourselves , attacking each other in the name of raising the purity level here .
At the rate which this is progressing and the rate at which the invecting is soaring , I fear that the Daily Kos is in decline , rapidly deteriorating towards irrelevancy .
The personal invective hurled by one person towards another because the first disagrees with the second , or as is more commonly the case , because the second does n't agree with the first , is staggering .
The disrespect for people 's belief systems is causing , at least in me , cognitive dissonance that I 'm not sure I wish to battle at this stage of my life .
Aside : Q : What stage is that , Robyn ?
A : At the Tuesday meeting of the Bloomfield College Gay / Nongay Alliance , my partner Debbie and I volunteered to have our civil union ceremony be a public event , in keeping with our consistent striving for the educational , as part of the college 's Out and Proud Week .
It should be a time of joy .
Hanging around Daily Kos is not currently assisting in the formation of that emotion .
We see person A scream about the " single issue " member B , when what A is really screaming about is the fact that B's single issue is not A's single issue , or that B has a different take on the issue than does A .
We cannot all be right at the same time and too many members are demanding that those with whom they disagree stop participating .
Pardon me if I think that is not right .
In speaking up in defense of those who are being threatened , I and others have been attacked ourselves .
We must be right - wing freakazoids of some sort .
If we try to assure people of our standing on the left , we have been abused and demeaned .
The other day I enumerated the reasons and evidence that I was indeed from the far far left ... and was told I was being an elitist for mentioning it ... by someone whose proof that he was a leftist is that he has supported some unnamed candidate or other .
The level is indeed low .
There is a drought of respect and trust .
There is a lack of critical thinking , even here .
Asking people to think about what they are writing is seen as an attack .
Pointing out an error in logic , hoping to raise the bar the tiniest bit , is called ad hominem .
Insisting that words not be distorted solely as means of attack is seen as classist .
The educated amongst us are often told we should behave as if we are not educated .
Anti-intellectualism is rampant .
Hunter is leaving ?
Everyone is blaming Jerome , of course , but they are missing Hunter 's point : I am tired of months of fights in which every diarist tries to out - top the purity of the last , and where every fight is dominated by clownish , overpainted rhetoric that cannot distinguish between the most vile of neocons and some guy three diaries up or down that might have a procedural objection , strategic disagreement or , terror of terrors , different phrasing of the points of an issue .
To blame Jerome or pacifists is to misread Hunter 's message .
The attack on pacifists here has pushed me to my limits .
I would be sad , but perhaps it is time for me to go as well .
I will be examining that over the next couple of weeks , if only because I would like to say goodbye to Bill in Portland Maine before I go .
I 'd also like to find someone who would keep Teacher 's Lounge going , if at all possible .
We all like to see our children have a chance to grow and prosper .
No one wants to see their " child " die .
But I would really like someone to give me a meaningful reason to stay .
I expect instead that I will be provided with many more reasons to go .

Microsoft promises to wow people who are upgrading from Windows XP to its new operating system , but with the joys of Windows Vista comes plenty of pain .
Computers look complicated , but are easy to upgrade
Vista video roundup I know , I know , I 'm a sucker for technology .
The shiny new Vista disk was sitting on my desk , and I just could n't resist giving it a try .
Even though I fell for Vista 's promise - more security and certainly much more fun than tired old Windows XP - I tried not to be stupid .
I knew my four - year - old PC might have trouble coping with Vista , not least because of its wheezing graphics card .
When I bought it , my Dell Dimension 8200 was fairly state - of - the - art ( a few stats for the experts : Pentium 4 processor running at 2GHz , 384MB of RAM , a 64MB graphics card , and a Creative SB Live audio card ) .
Since then I had added memory ( to 768 MB ) , a second hard disk , extra USB ports and a Wifi card .
A blunt message
But this was probably not enough , so I downloaded Microsoft 's Vista Upgrade Advisor .
Out with the old , in with the new computer memory Microsoft 's message was blunt but useful :
Yes , my computer could happily run Vista , but it would need a few crutches and new body parts .
Step - by - step instructions told me how to avoid problems :
Get a new graphics card with at least 128 MB memory ;
download new software for the Linksys Wifi network card , to sync my PDA with Outlook and to make good use of my multimedia keyboard ;
download the latest version of my Kaspersky Antivirus software .
With a few minor exceptions , the rest of my set - up was given a clean bill of health , including my webcam and printer .
It turned out to be tricky to find the right graphics card .
Most shopping websites were useless in providing information on Vista compatibility .
At least a dozen times , I discovered in the small print on manufacturers ' websites that there were no Vista drivers for that particular piece of hardware .
I finally settled on a Nvidia GeForce 6200 with 256MB memory .
Now here is the dirty little secret of all the expensive PC helpers out there .
Upgrading hardware is really easy .
As long as you make sure the new hardware fits into the slots that come with your computer and does not overburden its power supply , it 's usually just a case of carefully lifting out the old and slotting in the new piece of kit .
Do check the manual , though , to see whether you need to install the driver software for your new equipment before or after putting it in .
If you are still worried , go online .
You can find plenty of videos and manuals providing step - by - step guides on how to do it .
Then I followed the task list drawn up by Microsoft .
The Upgrade Advisor even provided direct links for downloading new drivers and other software .
Taking one more precaution , I made a full back - up of all my documents to an external hard drive .
A good start Finally I was ready to go .
I had read somewhere that a Vista installation would take 20 minutes .
Not if you upgrade from XP .
HAVE YOUR SAY Vista looks snazzy , but functionally , there is n't enough to warrant the price of upgrade yet

After three - and - a - half hours of churning , at long last the Vista logo filled my screen .
It was the beginning of a day of anguish .
At first sight , everything had worked fine :
All user accounts , complete with documents and software , were present and accounted for .
Vista looked slick .
Its user interface was clear and set - up seemingly easy .
The XP gobbledegook had disappeared from dialogue boxes .
Installing the new wifi driver and anti-virus software was a cinch .
Software worked straight away - whether it was Microsoft Office , Firefox or my very old copy of Photoshop Elements .
Feel the pain
But soon the problems began to mount :
Where was the internet ?
I could see my router , but nothing beyond - even after a full day of tinkering with various network wizards .
My BBC laptop proved that this was not a problem with my router or ISP .
Why did my Philips webcam refuse to work ?
The Upgrade Advisor had explicitly said it would .
What hardware was responsible for the three driver errors flagged up by Vista ?
One seemed to be the sound card - oh yes , why did I have no sound ?
But which mysterious " PCI input device " was lacking a driver ?
And what was the " unknown device " flagged up by Vista ?
Why did I get a " disk is full " error message every time I tried to install my keyboard 's new Intellitype software ?
Why did Vista refuse to uninstall the XP - version of Intellitype ?
I knew that Apple had failed to make iTunes Vista - ready , so I did n't even try .
But why did Microsoft 's successor of Activesync , called Windows Mobile Device Center , refuse to hook up Outlook to my trusty old Pocket PC ?
Fiddling around with Vista 's settings , I soon found myself deep below its slick interface .
And the deeper I got , the more the look and jargon of dialogue boxes took me back into the world of XP .
The Vista interface is slick and easy to use
It took me one day to get online .
The detail is tedious and highly technical : reinstalling drivers and router firmware did n't work , but after many trial and error tweaks to Vista 's TCP / IP settings , I had internet access .
Once online , Creative 's website told me that my sound card was a write - off .
No Vista support would be forthcoming .
Grudgingly I ordered a new one .
After installing it , the hardware error messages disappeared ; the three different errors flagged up by Vista were all triggered by my old sound card .
I also realised that my computer really needed more memory .
Annoyingly , my Dell uses an unusual flavour of memory , called RDRAM , which is rare nowadays .
Two lost and one successful eBay auctions later , I installed one extra gigabyte of memory .
So far the upgrade to Vista had cost me about £ 130 .
Not cheap , but probably fair value , as it will have extended the life - cycle of my PC by about two years .
Bearing a grudge against Philips , Dell and Microsoft
But a few problems refuse to go away and are both expensive and aggravating .
VISTA PC SPECIFICATIONS VISTA CAPABLE 800MHz processor 512 Mb memory DirectX9 capable graphics processor PREMIUM READY 1GHz processor 1 Gb memory 128 Mb graphics memory 40 Gb hard drive DVD - ROM Internet access My Philips ToUCam still does n't work , and plenty of angry forum debates are testament to the distinct lack of Vista support provided by Philips .
Even worse , Vista still refuses to talk to my Dell Axim X5 Pocket PC , which is a mere three - and - a - half years old .
I like my PDA .
It saved my bacon when my laptop died on a reporting trip .
Over five days , I filed 14 stories using the Axim and its foldable keyboard .
I do n't want to buy a new one - at least , not until I find an affordable smart phone that is both slim and has a slide - out keyboard ( what 's on the market right now is too bulky for my taste ) .
But my Axim uses the Pocket PC 2002 operating system , and Microsoft has decided that Vista will work only with Pocket PC 2003 and higher .
A top Microsoft executive , who does not want to be quoted by name , tells me that " the refresh rate on [ mobile ] devices is typically 18 months , from our research - hence the view that most Pocket PC 2002 devices would no longer be in use .
" Our view ( which may be incorrect ) is that those people using the latest Desktop [ operating system ] would potentially also be using later devices as well . "
Well , I have a surprise for Microsoft :
They are wrong , not least judging from the discussions on various forums I 've been to while hunting for a solution .
While Microsoft leaves me out in the cold , Dell is no help either .
Delving into a Dell support forum , I realise the company practises tough love .
Very briefly , a couple of years ago , Dell offered X5 customers an upgrade to Pocket PC 2003 .
Not anymore .
So I can either throw away my Axim and invest another £ 200 or £ 300 ( for a PDA and webcam ) , or roll back to XP and wave Vista goodbye .
To Vista or not to Vista I find myself caught in the Vista trap .
Quite apart from the pain of having to reinstall XP , I do like Vista .
It 's slick , it 's fast , it is very user - friendly .
I like its applications - for example , Windows Picture Gallery , which could become a serious competitor to my favourite image browser , Faststone .
However , there are still plenty of wrinkles .
The Windows " sidebar " may look nicer than Google desktop , but it crashes regularly and infuriates me because its " gadgets " can not be customised .
I 've had two Vista crashes so far - not a blue but a black screen - and that really should n't happen .
I can't even remember my last XP crash .
And everywhere I look , there are blogs and forums full of people who have problems with software drivers and suffer the poor customer support of the hundreds of hardware and software vendors that make up the Windows ecosystem .
So would I do it again ?
The answer is no .
Do what I originally had planned to do .
Wait for half a year until the driver issues are settled and then buy a new PC .
Once that 's in place , you can upgrade and tinker with your old machine , to give to your parents or children .
You will probably enjoy Vista , but there 's little reason to do it the hard way .
Update 20 March 2007 : After four different attempts to solve the problem with my keyboard 's Intellitype software , a Microsoft engineer sorted the issue by crawling for 75 minutes through my Registry Editor .
Last night I finally found a driver in an arcane corner of the Philips support website that I could force to work under Vista ; the driver installation did not work out of the box , though , and I had to jump through several hoops to force its installation ;
Philips now say they hope to release a set of Vista drivers in April
I 've given up on the crash - prone , resource - hogging Windows sidebar , and I 'm back with the Google desktop sidebar .
Vista still refuses to speak to my handheld computer , and Microsoft says that this wo n't change ; I now use the Windows XP computer at work to maintain and sync my calendar and address book , which is a huge inconvenience .
Many thanks to all the readers who wrote in with tips and shared their Vista stories - much appreciated .

Clarke vs. Rice : Excerpts from testimony
( CNN ) -- Fifteen days after former White House counterterrorism chief Richard Clarke testified before the 9/11 commission , national security adviser Condoleezza Rice made her case before the panel .
Here are excerpts from their testimony on several key issues before the commission .
What did Bush know and what did he do ?
CLARKE : President Bush was regularly told by the director of Central Intelligence that there was an urgent threat .
...
On one of those occasions , he asked for a strategy to deal with the threat .
...
[ Rice 's ] looking into it and the president asking for it did not change the pace at which it was considered .
And as far as I know , the president never asked again .
[ The threat level in summer 2001 ] exceeded anything that [ CIA director ] George Tenet or I had ever seen .
RICE : From January 20 [ 2001 ] through September 10 [ 2001 ] , the president received at [ daily intelligence briefings ] more than 40 briefing items on al Qaeda , and 13 of those were in response to questions he or his top advisers posed .
The threat - reporting that we received in the spring and summer of 2001 was not specific as to time , nor place , nor manner of attack .
Almost all of the reports focused on al Qaeda activities outside the United States , especially in the Middle East and North Africa .
In fact , the information that was specific enough to be actionable referred to terrorist operations overseas .
Most often , though , the threat reporting was frustratingly vague .
How high a priority was terrorism ?
CLARKE : George Tenet and I tried very hard to create a sense of urgency by seeing to it that intelligence reports on the al Qaeda threat were frequently given to the president and other high - level officials .
And there was a process under way to address al Qaeda .
But although I continued to say it was an urgent problem , I do n't think it was ever treated that way .
My view was that this administration , while it listened to me , did n't either believe me that there was an urgent problem or was unprepared to act as though there were an urgent problem .
RICE : President Bush understood the threat , and he understood its importance .
He made clear to us that he did not want to respond to al Qaeda one attack at a time .
He told me he was tired of swatting flies .
...
One does n't have the luxury of dealing only with one issue if you are the United States of America .
There are many urgent and important issues .
But we all had a strong sense that this was a very crucial issue .
How did the Clinton and Bush administrations ' approaches differ ?
CLARKE : My impression was that fighting terrorism , in general , and fighting al Qaeda , in particular , were an extraordinarily high priority in the Clinton administration -- certainly no higher priority .
There were priorities probably of equal importance such as the Middle East peace process , but I certainly do n't know of one that was any higher in the priority of that administration .
I believe the Bush administration in the first eight months considered terrorism an important issue , but not an urgent issue .
RICE :
The decision that we made was to , first of all , have no drop - off in what the Clinton administration was doing , because clearly they had done a lot of work to deal with this very important priority .
...
On an operational level , therefore , we decided immediately to continue to pursue the Clinton administration 's covert action authority and other efforts to fight the network .
...
We also moved to develop a new and comprehensive strategy to try and eliminate the al Qaeda network .
How does the war in Iraq fit into the war on terror ?
CLARKE : The war in Iraq was not necessary .
Iraq was not an imminent threat to the United States .
And by going to war with Iraq , we have greatly reduced our possibility to prosecute the war on terrorism .
RICE : I believe we will change the nature of the Middle East , particularly if there are examples that this can work in the Middle East .
And this is why Iraq is so important .
The Iraqi people are struggling to find a way to create a multiethnic democracy that works .
...
When they succeed , I think we will have made a big change -- they will have made a big change in the middle of the Arab world , and we will be on our way to addressing the source [ of terrorism ] .
Could more have been done to prevent 9/11 ?
CLARKE : Let me compare 9/11 and the period immediately before it to the millennium rollover and the period immediately before that .
...
Every day they went back from the White House to the FBI , to the Justice Department , to the CIA and they shook the trees to find out if there was any information .
Contrast that with what happened in the summer of 2001 , when we even had more clear indications that there was going to be an attack .
Did the president ask for daily meetings of his team to try to stop the attack ?
Did Condi
Rice hold meetings of her counterparts to try to stop the attack ?
No .
RICE :
There was no silver bullet that could have prevented the 9/11 attacks .
In hindsight , if anything might have helped stop 9/11 , it would have been better information about threats inside the United States -- something made very difficult by structural and legal impediments that prevented the collection and sharing of information by our law enforcement and intelligence agencies .
Why did n't Bush respond to the USS Cole bombing ?
CLARKE : I suggested , beginning in January of 2001 , that ... there was an open issue which should be decided about whether or not the Bush administration should retaliate for the Cole attack [ which occurred in October 2000 ] .
Unfortunately , there was no interest , no acceptance of that proposition .
And I was told on a couple of occasions , " Well , you know , that happened on the Clinton administration 's watch . "
I did n't think it made any difference .
I thought the Bush administration , now that it had the CIA saying it was al Qaeda , should have responded .
RICE : I do not believe to this day that it would have been a good thing to respond to the Cole , given the kinds of options that we were going to have .
...
We really thought that the Cole incident was passed , that you did n't want to respond tit - for - tat .
...
Just responding to another attack in an insufficient way we thought would actually probably embolden the terrorists -- they had been emboldened by everything else that had been done to them -- and that the best course was to look ahead to a more aggressive strategy against them .
Did the decision - making process delay action against terrorism ?
CLARKE : In the Bush administration I ... and my committee , the counterterrorism security group , report to the deputies committee , which is a sub - cabinet level committee .
...
It slowed [ the process ] down enormously , by months .
RICE : I just do n't believe that bringing the principals over to the White House every day and having their counterterrorism people have to come with them and be pulled away from what they were doing to disrupt was a good way to go about this .
It was n't an efficient way to go about it .
The rank of the worst highway in the world belongs now to the Russian federal (! ) road " Lena " .
The Russian line " Lena " connecting Moscow and Yakutsk , proudly takes in a rating of the most dangerous roads in the world the first place .
The " Lena " is not just in serious failure .
This road appears practically washed away after each strong rain .
On the second place in this black list there is a line between the cities of La Pazs and Kopoyko (? ) to Bolivia which local residents name not differently as " Road of death " .
This narrow track lasts in mountains .
There constantly there are landslips , cars quite often fall in breakage , and a condition of asphalt there simply disgusting .
The third place in the list of the most terrible lines is taken with the Military - Georgian road which connects Russia and Georgia .
It differs not only the dangerous turns , but also that in the winter it almost always block because of avalanches .
As Computer technology keeps advancing and hardware becomes smaller and lighter , innovations have been made that allow more mobility when it comes to accessing our data .
A great example is with the portability of USB flash drives .
No longer does the typical home user need to be tied to one computer to view digital photos , videos or documents .
With the same freedom these devices give us , software advancements has also been made with making applications portable .
One that comes to mind , is a suite of applications including Mozilla FireFox and Thunderbird from PortableApps.com
PortableApps have been around for a while , but they recently released a suite that includes Mozilla FireFox web browser , Mozilla Thunderird email client , OpenOffice suite , Mozzila Sunbird calendar / scheduler , Gaim instant messaging client , GaimWin antivirus , Sudoku game , backup utility and integrated menu , all preconfigured to work portably .
Applications are Open source or freeware .
All capable of fitting on a 512 mb USB thumb drive .
Installation is easy and once installed on your USB drive , a small system - tray icon appears .
Clicking on the icon will bring up the launcher menu :
From here you can run any application such as Firefox , as if it was installed on your hard drive .
One of the first task I did after installing PortableApps suite was to copy my Firefox bookmarks from my Laptop to the installed location of Firefox on the USB drive .
Now I can easily keep the bookmarks in sync and always have them with me .
Having the mobility like this has many advantages .
With Thunderbird you can easily backup your email either from GMail or an ISP account directly to the USB drive .
No need to create backup copies and always have your address book , settings and customizations available .
Since the installation resides entirely on a removable drive , you can plug into any Computer and immediately begin to surf the Internet or work on documents or spreadsheets , save your data , unplug and have everything available where ever you go .
For the Tech geeks , there is also a version of Mac OS Classic 7.0.1 available .
PortableApps suite runs on Windows 98/Me/2000 /XP / Vista and Wine if your running Linux .
Check them out at PortableApps.com .
I 've talked about Bilinear vs. Bicubic filtering before in the context of 2D images , but bilinear filtering is a key ingredient in 3D graphics , too .
When a texture is applied to a polygon , the texture may be scaled up or down to fit , depending on your screen resolution .
This is done via bilinear filtering .
A full discussion of 3D graphics is way outside the scope of this post -- plus I do n't want to bore you to death with concepts like trilinear filtering and mip-mapping .
But I do want to highlight one particular peculiarity of bitmap scaling in 3D graphics .
As you rotate a texture - mapped polygon away from the viewer , simple bilinear filtering and mip- mapping cause the texture to lose detail as the angle increases :
Now , some detail loss with distance is intentional .
That 's essentially what mip - mapping is .
if we did n't mip -map into the distance , the image would look extremely noisy :
No mip- mapping Mip- mapping
The problem with simple mip-mapping and bilinear filtering is that they 're too simple .
Much more detail should be retained into the distance .
And that 's what anisotropic filtering does :
Because you 're typically viewing most of the polygons in the world at an angle at any given time , anisotropic filtering has a profound impact on image quality .
Here are some screenshots I took from the PC game FlatOut which illustrate the dramatic difference between standard filtering and anisotropic filtering :
Standard filtering 16 x Anisotropic filtering
These are detail elements cropped from the full - size 1024x768 screenshots : standard , anisotropic .
Proper anisotropic filtering is computationally expensive , even on dedicated 3D hardware .
And the performance penalty increases with resolution .
ATI was the first 3d hardware vendor to introduce some anisotropic filtering optimizations -- some would say shortcuts -- in their cards which allowed much higher performance .
There is one small caveat , however : at some angles , textures do n't get fully filtered .
ATI effectively optimized for common angles you 'd see in 3D level geometry ( floor , walls , ceiling ) at the cost of the others .
For better or worse , these optimizations are now relatively standard now even on nVidia cards .
I think it 's a reasonable tradeoff for the increased image quality and performance .
In my opinion , anisotropic filtering is the most important single image quality setting available on today 's 3D hardware .
It 's like Freedom Rock : make sure you 've turned it up , man !
About 50 people clambered on to the roof of the house to protest
Mohammedweil Baroud said he was warned by Israeli forces to leave his home .
He instead ran to a mosque and summoned neighbours to help defend the house .
Mr Baroud is a commander in the Popular Resistance Committees militant group .
The Israeli army often orders people out of homes ahead of attacks , saying it aims to avoid casualties .
A Hamas commander at the scene said people had gathered to show that the demolition strategy of the Israelis could be defeated .
An Israeli military spokesman confirmed to Reuters news agency that the raid had been called off because of the Palestinian action .
' Human shields '
" The attack plan was cancelled because of the people there , " he said .
" We differentiate between innocent people and terrorists . "
He said Israel would continue its policy of targeted air strikes and accused militants of using the civilians in the camp as human shields .
Meanwhile one person was wounded in a rocket attack on the Israeli town of Sderot .
Hamas said in a statement it had carried out the attack , the Associated Press news agency reported .
Israel often targets the homes of Gaza militants in response to such attacks .
One woman was killed and several injured in an attack on Sderot last week .
Chanting slogans
The BBC's Alan Johnston in Gaza says it appears that an unprecedented act of defiance by the Palestinians to a particular Israeli tactic has worked .
We call upon all the fighters to reject evacuating their houses and we urge our people to rush into the threatened houses and make human shields
Spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees
Very often the air force telephones a warning 10 minutes before the strike to give the occupants time to escape and keep down casualties , our correspondent says .
But on this occasion , the presence of so many people has made it impossible for the Israelis to carry though their planned air strike .
Hundreds of relatives and neighbours gathered at the house , where about 50 people reportedly climbed onto the roof .
Others stood in the street chanting anti-Israeli and anti-American slogans .
Repeat urged
The Israeli military may have to factor in more such Palestinian protests in future when it targets the homes of suspected militants from the air , our correspondent adds .
Following the protest , militant leaders urged Gazans to repeat the tactic in the face of future warnings by the Israeli air force .
" We call upon all the fighters to reject evacuating their houses and we urge our people to rush into the threatened houses and make human shields , " said a spokesman for the Popular Resistance Committees , quoted by Reuters .
Mosque stand - off
Two weeks ago , Palestinian women went to a mosque in the nearby town of Beit Hanoun in response to a request from Hamas commanders .
Israeli forces struck a building in Beit Lahiya on Friday
Up to 15 Palestinian militants were hiding inside the mosque and a tense stand - off had developed between them and the Israeli forces surrounding the building .
The Israeli army said the crowd of women acted as " human shields " .
The men were able to mingle with them and escape , despite two of the women being killed when Israeli troops opened fire on the group .
Earlier on Saturday , two Palestinians were killed in clashes as the Israeli army seized two houses near Beit Lahiya , Palestinian residents and medics said .
Palestinian militants went to confront them and at one point Hamas fighters struck with an anti-tank weapon wounding three soldiers .
So you ’ve decided that starting your own company is the way forward .
Great !
Now what ?
The first thing you need to decide is this :
What is your unique selling point ?
What are you going to offer to the world that does n’t already exists ?
The problem is that a lot of people I ’ve met believe that simply starting their company is enough .
Clients will come to them , because , we ’ll … they just will .
Right ?
Wrong .
You ’ve got to fill a gap that is n’t currently being filled .
With Carson Workshops , we noticed that there was n’t any high - end training for web professionals .
There were a million training courses out there , but they were n’t taught by the best of the best .
With DropSend , we noticed that it was really hard to send large files to people .
Stupid problem , but there were n’t many easy - to - use solutions out there .
I think the best way to discover your USP , is to think about what you would really like .
If you find an area in your professional or private life that is being overlooked by the business world , you might be able to meet that need .
Quite a few of you will be from the web industry .
As we all know , there are thousands of web shops out there .
What will make you different ?
How to prepare
Now that you ’ve nailed down your unique selling point , how to do you get started ?
The first thing to do is start saving .
I ’d recommend at least 2 months of salary , in the bank .
So if you earn $ 2,000 per month ( take home ) , then you should have $ 4,000 in the bank .
Some people say 3 months , but in my experience , this just takes too long and is unrealistic .
The crappy thing about this is that it takes time .
The way I managed to save the necessary cash was to do freelance web development during nights and weekends .
It sucked , but it was what had to be done .
The reason why this is so important is because you wo n’t have paying customers the second you leave your job .
It might take you up to 2 months to get money through the door .
( This leads on to the subject of cash flow , which I ’ll discuss in another article . )
The 5 most important words you ’ll ever learn
My dad drilled this into me , and it is the # 1 reason why we ’re profitable today :
What ’s in it for them ?
Whenever you do anything in business , put yourself in your customers shoes and ask this question .
It will save you from wasting time on ideas that do n’t have any financial viability .
For instance , if you ’re launching a new site , ask yourself " Why will people come here , instead of my competitor ’s site ? " .
If you ’re launching a new web app , ask yourself " Why will people want to use this , instead of the tools they already have ? " .
The key is to be brutally honest - because your potential customers will .
Next time …
In the next installment of Small Biz 101 , I ’m going to cover the subject of cash flow .
It ’ll make you , or it ’ll break you - so it ’s worth covering in detail .
I ’ll show you how to set up a handy Excel spreadsheet that will allow you to see problems coming , and plan accordingly .
If you ’ve learned anything valuable , or disagree with my opinions , please comment below .
See you next time .
* I ’m not advocating being a workaholic .
In fact , since Gill ( my wife ) and I started Carson Systems , we ’ve made a conscious effort to work less .
We start at 9:00 every morning , and finish at 6:00 .
We also take a 1/2 day on Friday and Wednesday .
You ’ll find that the freedom to dictate your schedule is one of the best things about starting your own company .
The flip side of this amazing freedom is that every once in awhile , you have to work seven days a week , 18 hours a day .
A Cost Analysis of Windows Vista Content Protection Peter Gutmann , pgut001@cs.auckland.ac.nz

Last updated 12 June 2007 ( but see the note below )

In early August of this year I gave a talk at a security conference with a significantly more up - to - date and cleaned - up version of this material ( the writeup here was originally written for comment on a private security mailing list and had to be somewhat hastily retrofitted for non-security - geeks ) .
In addition this text was mostly written nearly a year ago and predates a number of events such as the appearance of hardware with PVP - UAB support , about 100 - odd MB of Vista updates , and entire stories like the GigE slowdown issue ( although that has nothing to do with content protection ) .
This means that this writeup exhibits the inevitable bit - rot of broken links , stories that have changed , updated or changed technical information , and so on .
Finally , numerous images and diagrams do n't integrate too well into this text - only writeup ( the talk material is in PDF form , which makes it easier to include graphical content ) .
So the slides for the talk are the recommended form if you want to read about this , with an optional version annotated for the humour - impaired .
I 've also put up a brief comment about statements by the George and Ed tag team at ZDNet for people who were wondering about that .
Executive Summary
Windows Vista includes an extensive reworking of core OS elements in order to provide content protection for so - called “ premium content ” , typically HD data from Blu - Ray and HD - DVD sources .
Providing this protection incurs considerable costs in terms of system performance , system stability , technical support overhead , and hardware and software cost .
These issues affect not only users of Vista but the entire PC industry , since the effects of the protection measures extend to cover all hardware and software that will ever come into contact with Vista , even if it 's not used directly with Vista ( for example hardware in a Macintosh computer or on a Linux server ) .
This document analyses the cost involved in Vista 's content protection , and the collateral damage that this incurs throughout the computer industry .
Executive Executive Summary
The Vista Content Protection specification could very well constitute the longest suicide note in history [ Note A ] .
( In case you missed the note at the top , this writeup has n't been current for some time now , and many links and information are outdated .
It 's only kept online because of the large number of sites linking to it .
If you want the current version , see the note at the top ) .
Table of Contents
This document looks purely at the cost of the technical portions of Vista 's content protection [ Note B ] .
The political issues ( under the heading of DRM ) have been examined in exhaustive detail elsewhere and wo n't be commented on further unless it 's relevant to the cost analysis .
However , one important point to keep in mind when reading this document is that in order to work , Vista 's content protection must be able to violate the laws of physics , something that 's unlikely to happen no matter how much the content industry wishes that it were possible [ Note C ] .
This conundrum is displayed over and over again in the Windows content - protection requirements , with manufacturers being given no hard - and - fast guidelines but instead being instructed that they need to display as much dedication as possible to the party line .
The documentation is peppered with sentences like :
“ It is recommended that a graphics manufacturer go beyond the strict letter of the specification and provide additional content - protection features , because this demonstrates their strong intent to protect premium content ” .
This is an exceedingly strange way to write technical specifications , but is dictated by the fact that what the spec is trying to achieve is fundamentally impossible .
Readers should keep this requirement to display appropriate levels of dedication in mind when reading the following analysis [ Note D ] .
A second point to note is that the term “ premium content ” , or in more recent statements by Microsoft , “ commercial content ” ( I 've used “ premium content ” throughout this writeup for consistency ) goes well beyond the HD - DVD and Blu - Ray examples that I 've used above and encompasses not just the obvious definition of “ HD content in any form ” but even non -HD content , or as Microsoft put it “ commercial content generally , independent of resolution ” .
While premium content is currently still somewhat scarce , in five years ' time it 'll be hard to find a movie or similar content that is n't HD or similar premium content .
So although Microsoft have tried to downplay the perceived impact of Vista 's content - protection by stating that it 'll only apply when premium / commercial content is present , this conveniently sidesteps the fact that Microsoft hopes that this situation will become universal in the near future .
The whole future of Vista 's content protection is predicated on this fact , because without near - universal premium content there 's no point in having content - protection features in the first place .
Vista 's content protection mechanism only allows protected content to be sent over interfaces that also have content - protection facilities built in .
Currently the most common high - end audio output interface is S / PDIF ( Sony / Philips Digital Interface Format ) .
Most newer audio cards , for example , feature TOSlink digital optical output for high - quality sound reproduction , and even the latest crop of motherboards with integrated audio provide at least coax ( and often optical ) digital output .
Since S/ PDIF does n't provide any content protection , Vista requires that it be disabled when playing protected content [ Note E ] .
In other words if you 've sunk a pile of money into a high - end audio setup fed from an S / PDIF digital output , you wo n't be able to use it with protected content .
Instead of hearing premium high - definition audio , you get treated to premium high - definition silence .
Say you 've just bought Pink Floyd 's “ The Dark Side of the Moon ” , released as a Super Audio CD ( SACD ) in its 30th anniversary edition in 2003 , and you want to play it under Vista ( I 'm just using SACD as a representative example of protected audio content because it's a well - known technology , in practice Sony has refused to license it for playback on PCs ) .
Since the S / PDIF link to your amplifier / speakers is regarded as insecure for playing the SA content , Vista would disable it , and you 'd end up hearing a performance by Marcel Marceau instead of Pink Floyd .
Similarly , component ( YPbPr ) video will be disabled by Vista 's content protection , so the same applies to a high - end video setup fed from component video .
In fact even the most basic composite video out ( a.k.a. “ TV - out ” on video cards ) is disabled , at least by nVidia 's drivers :
“ This feature is no longer supported due to the new Protected Video Path Output Content Protection ( PVP - OPM ) in Windows Vista . ” .
A quick Google search leads to numerous online forums containing howls of outrage at this Windows “ feature ” , and an iTWire review recommends against nVidia - based media center PCs altogether because of it .
But what if you 're lucky enough to have bought a video card that supports HDMI digital video with HDCP content - protection ?
There 's a good chance that you 'll have to go out and buy another video card that really does support HDCP , because until quite recently no video card on the market actually supported it even if the vendor 's advertising claimed that it did .
As the site that first broke the story in their article The Great HDCP Fiasco puts it :
“ None of the AGP or PCI - E graphics cards that you can buy today support HDCP [ … ]
If you 've just spent $ 1000 on a pair of Radeon X1900 XT graphics cards expecting to be able to playback HD - DVD or Blu - Ray movies at 1920 ×1080 resolution in the future , you 've just wasted your money [… ]
If you just spent $ 1500 on a pair of 7800 GTX 512MB GPUs expecting to be able to play 1920 × 1080 HD - DVD or Blu - Ray movies in the future , you 've just wasted your money ” .
( The two devices mentioned above are the premium supposedly - HDCP - enabled cards made by the two major graphics chipset manufacturers ATI and n Vidia ) .
ATI was later subject to a class - action lawsuit by its customers over this deception .
As late as August of 2006 , when Sony announced its Blu - Ray drive for PCs , it had to face the embarrassing fact that its Blu - Ray drive could n't actually play Blu - Ray disks in HD format :
“ Since there are currently no PCs for sale offering graphics chips that support HDCP , this is n't yet possible ” .
Only in mid-2007 have the first properly HDMI / HDCP - capable video cards finally started to appear , but even then no - one has been able to identify any Windows system that will actually play HD content in HD quality , in all cases any attempt to do this produced either no output or a message that it was blocked by content protection .
Even nVidia 's latest and greatest GPU , the G80 , can't output 1080 p HD video , because once you enable HDCP ( which is required by Vista for HD - DVD or BluRay playback ) , you 're limited to 720 p resolution .
n Vidia 's older G7 x line also has this problem , as does ATI 's R5 xx .
In fact the only GPU that appears to support full - resolution HD playback , requiring dual - link HDMI , is ATI 's only - sort - of - released R600 .
While it 's not possible to prove a negative in this manner , it 's certainly an indication that potential buyers could be in for a shock when they try and play full HD - quality premium content on their shiny new Vista PC .
The same issue that affects graphics cards also goes for high - resolution LCD monitors .
One of the big news items at the 2007 Consumer Electronics Show ( CES 2007 ) , the world 's premier event for consumer high - tech , was Samsung 's 1920 × 1200 HD - capable 27 ″ LCD monitor , the Syncmaster 275T , released at a time when everyone else was still shipping 24 ″ or 25 ″ monitors as their high - end product [ Note F ] .
The only problem with this amazing HD monitor is that Vista wo n't display HD content on it because it does n't consider any of its many input connectors ( DVI -D , 15 - pin D - Sub , S - Video , and component video , but no HDMI with HDCP ) secure enough .
So you can do almost anything with this HD monitor except view HD content on it .
If you have even more money to burn , you can go for the largest ( conventional ) computer monitor made , the Samsung 's stupidly large ( for a computer monitor ) 46 ″ SyncMaster 460 PN .
Again though , Vista wo n't display HD content on it , turning your $ 4,000 purchase into a still - image picture frame .
Oddly enough , this monitor has been advertised as “ HDTV ready ” by retailers even though there 's no HDMI / HDCP input , although in practice the term “ HD - ready ” has been diluted close to meaninglessness — 10 - year - old 14 ″ CRT monitors have a higher resolution than many “ HDTV - ready ” TVs being sold today .
Someone who works for a large US retail chain has told me that they 'll advertise anything that 'll run at a higher resolution than standard NTSC / PAL / SECAM as “ HD - capable ” .
Here 's an example of an HD - capable PDA , and even a genuine HD - capable cellphone ( the mockup using a Nokia phone is particularly amusing ) to illustrate where this sort of creative marketing leads .
HD - ready cellphones must be from the same marketing people who brough us Internet - ready modems .
In order to appropriately protect content , Vista will probably have to disable any special device features that it can't directly control .
For example many sound cards built on C - Media chipsets ( which in practice is the vast majority of them ) support Steinberg 's ASIO ( Audio Stream I/O ) , a digital audio interface that completely bypasses the Windows audio mixer and other audio - related driver software to provide more flexibility and much lower latency than the Windows ones .
ASIO support is standard for newer C - Media hardware like the CMI 8788 .
Since ASIO bypasses Windows ' audio handling , it would probably have to be disabled , which is problematic because audiophiles and professional musicians require ASIO support specifically because of its much higher quality than the standard Windows channels .
You can get more information on Vista 's audio architecture and the changes from XP in this post from Creative Labs , and a discussion of the problems that the DRM - reengineered Vista audio system causes for sound card vendors in this article on the future of Vista audio .
As well as overt disabling of functionality , there 's also covert disabling of functionality .
For example PC voice communications rely on automatic echo cancellation ( AEC ) in order to work .
Echo cancellation is used to prevent sound from a loudspeaker or headphones interfering with a microphone in the vicinity .
This is rather tricky because the sound will be modified by the speaker and the surroundings that it 's operating in , so it requires fairly sophisticated signal processing to remove , as well as a high - quality copy of the signal ( if you get a degraded copy the signal , it becomes much harder to use it to cancel out the echo with it ) .
Although it 's not visible , echo cancellation is very widely used in applications like hands - free car phones , standard phones used in hands - free mode , and conference calling systems .
AEC in a PC requires feeding back a sample of the audio mix into the echo cancellation subsystem , but with Vista 's content protection this is n't permitted any more because this might allow access to premium content .
What is permitted is a highly - degraded form of feedback that might possibly still sort - of be enough for some sort of minimal echo cancellation purposes .
The requirement to disable audio and video output plays havoc with standard system operations , because the security policy used is a so - called “ system high ” policy :
The overall sensitivity level is that of the most sensitive data present in the system .
So the instant that any audio derived from premium content appears on your system , signal degradation and disabling of outputs will occur .
What makes this particularly entertaining is the fact that the downgrading / disabling is dynamic , so if the premium - content signal is intermittent or varies ( for example music that fades out ) , various outputs and output quality will fade in and out , or turn on and off , in sync .
Normally this behaviour would be a trigger for reinstalling device drivers or even a warranty return of the affected hardware , but in this case it 's just a signal that everything is functioning as intended .
Alongside the all - or - nothing approach of disabling output , Vista requires that any interface that provides high - quality output degrade the signal quality that passes through it if premium content is present .
This is done through a “ constrictor ” that downgrades the signal to a much lower - quality one , then up - scales it again back to the original spec , but with a significant loss in quality .
So if you 're using an expensive new LCD display fed from a high - quality DVI signal on your video card and there 's protected content present , the picture you 're going to see will be , as the spec puts it , “ slightly fuzzy ” , a bit like a 10 - year - old CRT monitor that you picked up for $ 2 at a yard sale ( see the Quotes for real - world examples of this ) .
In fact the specification specifically still allows for old VGA analog outputs , but even that 's only because disallowing them would upset too many existing owners of analog monitors .
In the future even analog VGA output will probably have to be disabled .
The only thing that seems to be explicitly allowed is the extremely low - quality TV - out , provided that Macrovision is applied to it ( see the Decreased System Reliability section for further discussion of Macrovision problems with Windows ) .
The same deliberate degrading of playback quality applies to audio , with the audio being downgraded to sound ( from the spec ) “ fuzzy with less detail ” [ Note G ] .
Amusingly , the Vista content protection docs say that it 'll be left to graphics chip manufacturers to differentiate their product based on ( deliberately degraded ) video quality .
This seems a bit like breaking the legs of Olympic athletes and then rating them based on how fast they can hobble on crutches .
The Microsoft specs say that only display devices with more than 520 K pixels will have their images degraded ( there 's even a special status code for this , STATUS_GRAPHICS_OPM_RESOLUTION_TOO_HIGH ) , but conveniently omit to mention that this resolution , roughly 800×600 , covers pretty much every output device that will ever be used with Vista .
The abolute minimum requirement for Vista Basic are listed as 800×600 resolution ( and an 800 MHz Pentium III CPU with 512MB of RAM , which seems , well , “ wildly optimistic ” is one term that springs to mind ) .
However that wo n't get you the Vista Aero interface , which makes a move to Vista from XP more or less pointless .
The minimum requirements for running Aero on a Vista Premium PC are “ a DX9 GPU , 128 MB of VRAM , Pixel Shader 2.0 , and minimum resolution 1024 × 768×32 ” , and for Aero Glass it 's even higher than that .
In addition the minimum resolution supported by a standard LCD panel is 1024 ×768 for a 15 ″ LCD , and to get 800×600 you 'd have to go back to a 10 - year - old 14 ″ CRT monitor or something similar .
So in practice the 520 K pixel requirement means that everything will fall into the degraded - image category .
( A lot of this OPM stuff seems to come straight from the twilight zone .
It 's normal to have error codes indicating that there was a disk error or that a network packet got garbled , but I 'm sure Windows Vista must be the first OS in history to have error codes for things like “ display quality too high ” ) .
Beyond the obvious playback - quality implications of deliberately degraded output , this measure can have serious repercussions in applications where high - quality reproduction of content is vital .
Vista 's content - protection means that video images of premium content can be subtly altered , and there 's no safe way around this —
Vista will silently modify displayed content under certain ( almost impossible - to - predict in advance ) situations discernable only to Vista 's built - in content - protection subsystem ( Philip Dorrell has created a neat cartoon that illustrates this problem ) .
Microsoft claim that this hidden image manipulation will only affect the portions of the display that contain the protected content , but since no known devices currently implement this “ feature ” it 's hard to say how it'll work out in practice ( what happens currently is that Vista just refuses to play premium content rather than downgrading it ) .
An interesting potential security threat , suggested by Karl Siegemund , occurs when Vista is being used to run a security monitoring system such as a video surveillance system .
If it 's possible to convince Vista that what it 's communicating is premium content , the video ( and / or audio ) surveillance content will become unavailable , since it 's unlikely that a surveillance center will be using DRM - enabled recording devices or monitors .
I can just see this as a plot element in Ocean 's Fifteen or Mission Impossible Six , “ It 's OK , their surveillance system is running Vista , we can shut it down with spoofed premium content ” .
The silly thing about the industry 's obsession with image quality is that repeated studies have shown that what really matters to viewers ( rather than what they think matters ) is image size and not quality .
Sure , if you take the average consumer into a store and put them in front of the latest plasma panel they 'll be impressed by the fact that they can count each individual hair in Gandalf 's beard , but once he 's leaping about wrestling with the balrog this detail becomes lost and the only differentiator is image size .
You can find a good discussion of this in The Media Equation by Stanford professors Byron Reeves and Clifford Nass .
In one experiment on visual fidelity they showed a film using the best equipment they could get their hands on , and again using a fifth - generation copy on bad tape and poor equipment .
There were no differences in users ' responses to the two types of images ( see the book for more details on this ) .
You can see an example of this effect yourself if you can set up a machine with a CRT and an LCD monitor .
Use the CRT monitor for awhile , then switch to the LCD monitor for a minute or two .
When you go back to the CRT monitor , does it seem faulty ?
Did you notice this before you looked over at the LCD monitor ?
Photographers have known about this issue for some time because of the pointless megapixel race that camera manufacturers are engaged in ( the reason why the race continues is that the masses are under some impression that more pixels = better , so manufacturers are cramming more and more sites onto their sensors with no real effect except for larger file sizes and more image noise due to fewer photons impacting each sensor site ) .
The New York Times ran a great experiment to demonstrate this when they blew up 5 megapixel , 8 megapixel , and 13 megapixel images to poster size and spent 45 minutes asking passers - by to guess which was which .
Only one single person , a photography professor ( who may have just got lucky ) , could tell the difference .
On the HD media front , the UK's PC Format magazine did a direct pictorial comparison and again could n't really tell the difference .
Conversely , image size , rather than pixel count , is a huge differentiator :
The bigger the better .
So in practice a degraded image on a huge VGA monitor ( or by extension anything with a lower - quality analog input ) will rate better than a non-degraded image on a much smaller LCD monitor , assuming you can find an example of the latter that Vista will actually output an HD image to .
Of course convincing consumers of this is another matter .
The image perception problem works in the other direction as well .
Even if you do have a true 1080 p display ( rather than a “ 1080 p compatible ” display or some similar weasel - words indicating that what you 're actually seeing is a much lower - resolution image ) , unless the conditions are set up just right ( an appropriate viewing distance and display size ) , you wo n't be able to tell the difference between a true 1080 p image and a much lower - resolution one .
Since the real limiting factor is the acuity of human vision and not the resolution of the display , even on a huge 50 inch plasma panel someone with normal eyesight at a standard viewing distance can't distinguish any finer detail than 720p .
In order to prevent the creation of hardware emulators of protected output devices , Vista requires a Hardware Functionality Scan ( HFS ) that can be used to uniquely fingerprint a hardware device to ensure that it's ( probably ) genuine .
In order to do this , the driver on the host PC performs an operation in the hardware ( for example rendering 3D content in a graphics card ) that produces a result that 's unique to that device type .
In order for this to work , the spec requires that the operational details of the device be kept confidential .
Obviously anyone who knows enough about the workings of a device to operate it and to write a third - party driver for it ( for example one for an open - source OS , or in general just any non-Windows OS ) will also know enough to fake the HFS process .
The only way to protect the HFS process therefore is to not release any technical details on the device beyond a minimum required for web site reviews and comparison with other products .
This potential “ closing ” of the PC 's historically open platform is an extremely worrying trend .
A quarter of a century ago , IBM made the momentous decision to make their PC an open platform by publishing complete hardware details and allowing anyone to compete on the open market .
Many small companies , the traditional garage startup , got their start through this .
This openness is what created the PC industry , and the reason why most homes ( rather than just a few offices , as had been the case until then ) have one or more PCs sitting in a corner somewhere .
This seems to be a return to the bad old days of 25 years ago when only privileged insiders were able to participate .
The HFS process has another cost involved with it .
Most hardware vendors have ( thankfully ) moved to unified driver models instead of the plethora of individual drivers that abounded some years ago ( in the bad old days it used to be necessary to identify individual device types and download specific drivers for them , something that was more or less impossible for non-geek users ) .
Since HFS requires unique identification and handling of not just each device type ( for example each graphics chip ) but each variant of each device type ( for example each stepping of each graphics chip ) to handle the situation where a problem is found with one variation of a device , it 's no longer possible to create one - size - fits - all drivers for an entire range of devices like the current Catalyst / Detonator / ForceWare drivers .
Every little variation of every device type out there must now be individually accommodated in custom code in order for the HFS process to be fully effective , resulting in a re-balkanisation of drivers that have only just become available in a clean , unified form in the last few years .
This is more a concern for device vendors and driver developers than users , since they do n't see any of this artifically - created extra complexity .
As far as the user is aware it 's still a “ unified ” driver since the internal re-balkanisation is n't visible in the driver bundle ( although the “ unified ” driver suddenly becomes a lot larger ) .
The indirect cost to the user ( longer driver development cycles and higher cost ) is mostly hidden from them .
If a graphics chip is integrated directly into the motherboard and there 's no easy access to the device bus then the need for bus encryption ( see Unnecessary CPU Resource Consumption below ) is removed .
Because the encryption requirement is so onerous , it 's quite possible that this means of providing graphics capabilities will suddenly become more popular after the release of Vista .
However , this leads to a problem :
It 's no longer possible to tell if a graphics chip is situated on a plug - in card or attached to the motherboard , since as far as the system is concerned they 're both just devices sitting on the AGP / PCIe bus .
The solution to this problem is to make the two deliberately incompatible , so that HFS can detect a chip on a plug - in card vs. one on the motherboard .
Again , this does nothing more than increase costs and driver complexity .
An even more complex situation occurs with DVI paddle boards , in which the graphics device is on the motherboard but the DVI output is provided through a card that goes into the AGP slot .
This means that the graphics device meets the requirements for a non user - accessible bus device ( see the section Increased Hardware Costs ) but the DVI output portion does n't .
Does this mean that your graphics output gets disabled or not ?
Either option is unpalatable , because Vista 's content - protection design never anticipated such situations .
Further problems occur with audio drivers .
To the system , HDMI audio looks like S / PDIF , a deliberate design decision to make handling of drivers easier .
In order to provide the ability to disable output , it 's necessary to make HDMI codecs deliberately incompatible with S / PDIF codecs , despite the fact that they were specifically designed to appear identical in order to ease driver support and reduce development costs .
In fact the Windows Vista logo requirements explicitly state that “ HDMI output cannot be shared with an S / PDIF output under any circumstances .
All digital outputs must be independent ” ( reading this part of the logo requirements is another trip into the content - protection twilight zone :
In the “ Bus Controllers and Ports ” section , right under the text telling us that “ The requirements defined for controllers and ports emphasize [ … ] industry standards and specifications ” , we find the primary Vista requirement for bus controllers , “ BUSPORT - 0001 ” , which mandates support for “ requirements not specified in the Intel HD Audio specification ” .
But wait , there 's more !
In order to provide the audio channel for HDMI , some manufacturers redirect the not -OK S / PDIF into the OK HDMI .
So even if you go out of your way to get premium content - capable hardware , Vista can still disable it even though it 's supposed to be approved for premium - content playback .
As other parts of this writeup point out , adding all of this unnecessary overhead and complexity to device drivers costs time and money .
The result is that many Vista drivers , particularly for the 64 - bit version , are nowhere near ready even after Vista has already been released .
There 's even a special site set up where people can report which Vista drivers currently work for them , one list for 32 - bit Vista drivers and another for 64 - bit Vista drivers ( note how short the list is for the 64 - bit drivers , with major vendors like nVidia being completely absent ) .
Numerous indications I 've seen , ranging from public analyses through to private comments from driver developers are that it 's going to be about the middle of the year before the drivers for video cards are fully reliable .
As of this writing , major vendors like nVidia ( graphics ) and Creative Labs ( sound ) still do n't have their Vista drivers ready , and other vendors like ATI have resorted to fudging their Vista certification , selling Radeon X1950 graphics cards with no certified drivers but with a “ Certified for Windows Vista ” label on the box , although nVidia then followed suit , selling their GeForce 8600 GTS without a certified driver but with the same “ Certified for Windows Vista ” label .
In fact nVidia only has beta ( pre-release ) drivers available from its web site ( and a pending class - action lawsuit to match , with an accompanying class - action suit against Microsoft for good measure ) , and when ATI finally released a Vista - certified driver for the X1950 , it crashed Vista and would only work reliably in basic VGA mode , circa 1987 .
Even large companies like Dell and Gateway are admitting that Vista 's graphics drivers just are n't ready yet , resulting in them holding back shipping Vista upgrades to people who have already ordered ( and paid for ) them .
For example you can't buy Dell 's top - of - the - line XPS 710 PC with Vista installed because there are no graphics drivers for it .
An additional reason for the driver backlog is that 64 - bit versions of Vista ( which will be displacing the 32 - bit versions within the next few years as everyone moves to 64 - bit platforms ) will only load drivers signed by Microsoft ( there 's a special debug mode invoked by hitting F8 on boot or using the / TESTSIGN flag that allows you to load unsigned drivers on a one - off basis for debugging purposes , but this gets disabled again at the next reboot , and , if you have n't already guessed it , premium content playback is disabled completely in this mode ) .
This means that no drivers that potentially threaten premium content can be loaded .
A downside of this is that an enormous mass of third - party drivers that have n't passed through Microsoft 's approval process can't be used under 64 - bit Vista , and because of the time and money involved in the approval process may never end up running under Vista .
In any case a mere month or so after Vista was released , Indian security researchers at NV Labs released details of their Vbootkit , a pre-loader that allows unsigned ( and therefore completely untrusted ) drivers to be loaded into the Vista kernel .
At about the same time NT kernel developer Alex Ionescu created a simple command - line tool to de-protect Windows Vista's “ protected ” processes , complete with a screenshot of Vista 's audio content - protection process being unprotected .
So the whole driver - signing process - protection effort survived for just over a month in the real world , and now remains as a serious impediment to legitimate driver vendors but little more than a speedbump to attackers .
Why is this a problem ?
Because the vast majority of drivers running on PCs today are n't signed , not so much because the developers could n't be bothered but because the WHQL process that produces the signed drivers is so slow that they 're obsolete by the time they 've been approved by Microsoft ( and even some of the WHQL - certified ones are still pretty flaky ) .
As a result , vendors supply current but unsigned drivers , a practice so widespread that instructions on bypassing the warning dialog that pops up are a standard part of most device install instructions ( you can use Google to find endless examples of the use of unsigned drivers .
One quick example of a large , well - known vendor doing this is AGFA ) .
Almost the entire PC industry relies on users clicking Continue in response to the unsigned - driver warning so that the driver can load anyway .
This situation is so common that you 'll see it written up in computer books and covered in Windows install guides .
At the moment the problem with unsigned drivers is n't too visible as people seem to be avoiding 64 - bit Vista because of the driver issues , but the inability to load drivers that have n't been through Microsoft 's approval process is likely to become a serious headache when its use becomes more widespread .
At some point something will have to give in order for Vista to have viable 64 - bit driver support .
It remains to be seen whether content protection or device support will prove the bigger hammer in this tug - of - war .
Having said that , Vista is n't the only OS that 's being hurt by short - sighted decisions about driver handling .
The Linux community has a strong lobby in favour of refusing to load non-GPL 'd drivers into the kernel , a process that one commentator calls " DRM for code " .
Once a weakness is found in a particular driver or device , that driver will have its signature revoked by Microsoft , which means that it will no longer be fed anything considered to be premium content .
What this means is that a report of a compromise of a particular driver or device will cause all premium content - handling ability for that device worldwide to be turned off until a fix can be found .
To quote the content - protection specs , “ Vista will [ … ] revoke any driver that is found to be leaking premium content [… ] if the same driver is used for all the manufacturer 's chip designs , then a revocation would cause all that company 's products to need a new driver ” .
If it 's an older device for which the vendor is n't interested in rewriting their drivers ( and in the fast - moving hardware market most devices enter “ legacy ” status within a year or two of their replacement models becoming available ) , all devices of that type worldwide become permanently unable to handle premium content .
An example of this might be nVidia TNT2 video cards , which are still very widely deployed in business environments where they 're all that you need to run Word or Outlook or Excel ( or , for that matter , pretty much any non-gaming application ) .
The drivers for these cards have n't been updated for quite some time for exactly that reason :
You do n't need the latest drivers for them because they 're not useful with current games any more ( if you go to the nVidia site and try and install any recent drivers , the installer will tell you to go back and download much older drivers instead as soon as it detects that you 're using a TNT2 ) .
If a such a device were found to be leaking content , it seems unlikely that nVidia would be interested in reviving discontinued drivers that it has n't touched for several years , creating instant orphanware of the installed user base .
The threat of driver revocation is the ultimate nuclear option , the crack of the commissars ' pistols reminding the faithful of their duty .
The exact details of the hammer that vendors will be hit with is buried in confidential licensing agreements , but I 've heard mention of multi-million dollar fines and embargoes on further shipment of devices alongside the driver revocation mentioned above .
This revocation can have unforeseen carry - on costs .
Windows ' anti-piracy component , WGA ( or in Vista 's case its successor Software Protection Platform , SPP ) , is tied to system hardware components .
Windows allows you to make a small number of system hardware changes after which you need to renew your Windows license ( the exact details of what you can and can't get away with changing has been the subject of much debate ) .
If a particular piece of hardware is affected by a driver revocation ( even just temporarily while waiting for an updated driver to work around a content leak ) and you swap in a different video card or sound card to avoid the problem , you risk triggering Windows ' anti-piracy measures , landing you in even more hot water .
If you 're forced to swap out a major system component like a motherboard , you 've instantly failed WGA validation .
Revocation of any kind of motherboard - integrated device ( practically every motherboard has some form of onboard audio , and all of the cheaper ones have integrated video ) would appear to have a serious negative interaction with Windows ' anti-piracy measures .
Another unforeseen consequence of the potential for a downgrade disguised as an upgrade ( that is , a driver being revoked by Windows Update ) is that the whole process of updating your machine is supposed to provide benefits to the user in the form of enhanced functionality or , more pragmatically , bugfixes and security patches .
Since malware attacks are invisible but a loss of playback capability is n't , if the only visible effect of an update is to reduce system functionality it incentivises users to disable updates in order to avoid this issue .
The unfortunate hidden side - effect of this is that in the interests of protecting themselves from having their content - playback capabilities turned off , they 're now vulnerable to all manner of malware , viruses , spyware , and so on .
The details of what will happen if a motherboard contains unused onboard audio capabilities and an additional sound card alongside it , and the motherboard drivers are revoked , is unknown .
Windows can't tell that there 's nothing connected to the cheap onboard audio because the user prefers to use their M - Audio Revolution 7.1 Surround Sound card instead , so it'll probably have to revoke the motherboard drivers even though they 're not used for anything .
Since virtually all motherboards contain onboard audio in some form , this could prove quite problematic .
An entirely different DoS problem that applies more to HDMI - enabled devices in general has already surfaced in the form of , uhh , “ DVI amplifiers ” , which take as input an HDMI signal and output a DVI signal , amplifying it in the process .
Oh , and as a side - effect they forget to re-apply the HDCP protection to the output .
Amusingly enough , precisely this approach has been recommended by a Westinghouse ( large US TV manufacturer ) VP of Marketing to resolve problems with Sony 's interpretation of HDCP in the Playstation 3 and Westinghouse 's interpretation in their 1080 p televisions , who told consumers to “ purchase an HDMI to DVI adapter to bypass HDCP ” .
The hardware vendors seem to have come to the same conclusion about content protection as the computer in Wargames did about global thermonuclear war : “ A strange game .
The only winning move is not to play ” .
HDCP strippers are relatively simple to design and build using off - the - shelf HDMI chips .
Beyond the commercially - available models , individual hardware hackers have built their own protection - strippers using chip samples obtained from chip vendors .
If you have the right credentials you can even get hardware evaluation boards designed for testing and development that do this sort of thing .
Even more accessible than that are HD players with non-HDMI digital outputs , for example ones that contain an HD - SDI ( SMPTE 292M ) interface .
HD - SDI is an unencrypted digital link typically used in TV studios but also available from various non-US sources as after - market sidegrades for standard HD players , providing better - than - HDMI image quality without the hassle of HDCP .
Now assume that the “ DVI amplifier ” manufacturer buys a truckload of HDMI chips ( they 'll want to get as many as they can in one go because they probably wo n't be able to go back and buy more when the chip vendor discovers what they 're being used for ) .
Since this is a rogue device , it can be revoked … along with hundreds of thousands or even millions of other consumer devices that use the same chip .
If they 're feeling particularly nasty , they can recycle the HDMI chips from junked TVs to ensure that the maximum possible damage to the consumer base occurs .
This cannibalisation process is actually fairly common among TV servicemen .
When a major component like the picture tube or yoke ( which is often only sold as an integral part of the picture tube ) fails , it 's often not worth repairing the TV any more , at which point it gains a second life as a source of spare parts for other TVs .
In particular components like the jungle IC ( which integrates a large amount of discrete circuitry into a single device ) can cost as much as $ 50 - 100 to replace , so it makes sense to recycle some of the parts rather than buy new ones , particularly when it's not obvious whether this is the problem component in a set brought in for repair .
Lifting an HDMI chip from such a TV set is n't nearly as exotic as it sounds .
Engadget have a good overview of the ensuing doomsday scenario .
Exactly what will happen when a key is leaked depends on how the attackers handle it .
The way HD - DVD / Blu- Ray keying works is that a per- device key is used to decrypt the title key on the disk , and the title key is then in turn used to decrypt the content .
So the chain of custody is Device key ⇒ Title key ⇒ Content .
This level of indirection allows an individual device to be disabled by revoking the device key without making the disk unplayable on all devices , since other device keys can still decrypt the title key and thus the content ( I 've simplified this a bit to cut down the length of the explanation , see the AACS specification for more details ) .
The device key is tied to a particular device / player / vendor , but the title key is only tied to the content on disk .
You can probably see where this is going … by publishing the device key , the attacker can cause general mayhem by forcing device revocation .
On the other hand by publishing the title key the attacker can release the content in an untraceable manner , since it 's not known which device key was used to leak the title key .
In addition since there 's no way to un-publish the title key ( encrypted content + title key = unencrypted content ) , at that point it 's game over for the content .
( Finding the manifold holes in these content - protection mechanisms has proven an interesting intellectual exercise , first for security researchers and more recently for hardware and software hackers of all kinds .
Some of the public attacks are described elsewhere in this writeup , and in particular the various AACS key recovery attacks have made most other types of attack unnecessary since once you have the keys to the kingdom everything else becomes pretty much irrelevant .
The high level of key management flexibility built into AACS may make for a nice dog- and - pony show when describing its capabilities , but adding too many levels of indirection means that once an attacker gets into certain levels of the chain , their access can never be revoked any more .
This presents a rather interesting object lesson in crypto design .
Although the mass of keying options and multiple levels of indirection provide a great deal of flexibility and functionality for the designers of the crypto mechanisms , they provide just as much flexibility for the attacker .
Specifically , there 's a nice pick - and - mix capability where an attacker can choose to publish the player key , which unlocks all movies but can be traced and disabled , or they can choose to publish the title key for one particular movie , which unlocks only that movie but can't be traced back to a revocable player .
This highly flexible keying system probably serves the attacker better than it does the defender !
Since the following is no longer of much interest to an attacker because universal attacks already exist , I may as well mention my reaction to reading about the details of the AACS revocation process , which was that the threat modelling was done pretty poorly , leaving it vulnerable to attack .
The way the revocation processing works is that the player implements a high - water mark mechanism to avoid someone feeding in an old revocation list that does n't contain the key ( s ) to be revoked .
This is implemented via a monotonically increasing counter in the key block ( referred to as a “ version number ” in the AACS spec ) .
Players will ignore any list with a counter value smaller than one they 've already seen , this preventing key rollback attacks .
So to immunise a player against ever processing another revocation list , you need to feed it a list with a counter value of INT_MAX , the largest possible integer value .
Since nothing can exceed this , no future revocation lists will be processed by the player , and no matter how hacked it is , your player will never be revoked .
Here 's how you do this .
The lists are digitally signed , so you need a way to get around the signature on the data .
To do this you hook the system 's file read function using any one of a vast number of standard rootkit techniques , an example being a filesystem filter driver that intercepts file access IRPs .
When the system reads the media key block file , you use VirtualProtect ( ) to make the second 4 K of data ( corresponding to an x86 page ) a guard page .
Then you sit back and wait .
At some point the AACS verification code will check the digital signature on the data .
Once the hashing gets to the second x86 page , the guard page exception will trigger and you 'll be handed over control .
Your exception handler then goes back 4 K - 8 bytes from the exception location , sets the value there to INT_MAX , and returns from the exception .
You now have a verified digital signature on a media key record with a counter value of INT_MAX , and your player ( which carefully records the information in secure non-volatile storage ) is immunised against any future revocations , since they 'll all have a value less than INT_MAX .
QED .
A simpler approach that 's already being used is just to patch the drive firmware to bypass the check ) .
“ Drivers must be extra-robust .
Requires additional driver development to isolate and protect sensitive code paths ” — ATI .
Vista 's content protection requires that devices ( hardware and software drivers ) set so - called “ tilt bits ” if they detect anything unusual .
For example if there are unusual voltage fluctuations , maybe some jitter on bus signals , a slightly funny return code from a function call , a device register that does n't contain quite the value that was expected , or anything similar , a tilt bit gets set .
Such occurrences are n't too uncommon in a typical computer .
For example starting up or plugging in a bus -powered device may cause a small glitch in power supply voltages , or drivers may not quite manage device state as precisely as they think .
Previously this was no problem — the system was designed with a bit of resilience , and things will function as normal .
In other words small variances in performance are a normal part of system functioning .
Furthermore , the degree of variance can differ widely across systems , with some handling large changes in system parameters and others only small ones .
One very obvious way to observe this is what happens when a bunch of PCs get hit by a momentary power outage .
Effects will vary from powering down , to various types of crash , to nothing at all , all triggered by exactly the same external event .
With the introduction of tilt bits , all of this designed - in resilience is gone .
Every little ( normally unnoticeable ) glitch is suddenly surfaced because it could be a sign of a hack attack , with the required reaction being that ( from the spec ) “ Windows Vista will initiate a full reset of the graphics subsystem , so everything will restart ” .
According to Microsoft this will only take a few seconds and will only affect the graphics subsystem ( so it 's not a complete restart of Vista ) , but the true impact of this mechanism remains to be seen .
In addition even if it 's relatively quick , systems with high availability requirements probably wo n't appreciate the overhead of periodic soft - reboots of the graphics subsystem .
So the effect that these tilt bits will have on system reliability should require no further explanation .
Content - protection “ features ” like tilt bits also have worrying denial - of - service ( DoS ) implications .
It 's probably a good thing that modern malware is created by programmers with the commercial interests of the phishing and spam industries in mind rather than just creating as much havoc as possible .
With the number of easily - accessible grenade pins that Vista 's content protection provides , any piece of malware that decides to pull a few of them will cause considerable damage .
The homeland security implications of this seem quite serious , since a tiny , easily - hidden piece of malware would be enough to render a machine unusably unstable , while the very nature of Vista 's content protection would make it almost impossible to determine why the denial - of - service is occurring .
Furthermore , the malware authors , who are taking advantage of “ content - protection ” features , could claim protection under the DMCA against any attempts to reverse - engineer or disable the content - protection “ features ” that they 're abusing .
Going beyond deliberate denial - of - service attacks , it 's possible to imagine all sorts of scenarios in which the tilt bits end up biting users .
Consider a warship operating in a combat zone and equipped with Vista PCs for management of the vessel 's critical functions that does nothing more wrong that to suffer a severe jolt from a near miss , scrambling the bus just enough to activate the tilt bits ( without causing any other real damage ) .
In one infamous incident in September 1997 , Windows NT managed to disable the Aegis missile cruiser USS Yorktown ( “ NT Leaves Navy ' Smart Ship ' dead in the water ” , Government Computer News , 13 July 1998 ) .
Now Windows Vista can do the same thing via a by - design feature of the OS [ Note H ] .
This issue , unless it can be clearly resolved , would make the use of Vista PCs unacceptable for any applications that have any hint of unusual environmental conditions such as high altitude , environmental variations , shock , and so on .
Some contributors have commented that they can't see the revocation system ever being used because the consumer backlash would be too enormous , but then the legal backlash from not going ahead could be equally extreme .
The only real indication that we have for how committed Microsoft really are to this is the amazing speed with which Microsoft released a patch for the WMDRM ( Windows Media DRM ) vulnerability , which they rushed out at a speed that even the most virulent worm never produced .
This would seem to indicate that they 're pretty serious about this , since they prioritised it above any conventional non-DRM - related security problem .
Can these protection mechanisms be inadvertently triggered ?
There 's plenty of real - world evidence to show that this happens all the time .
One example that I recently encountered in my friends - and - neighbours computer support work involved a retired filmmaker who has a 50 - year collection of educational films made for teaching in schools .
Recently he 's been transferring his entire collection to DVD to make them more accessible to newer audiences .
Unfortunately some component of Windows ' content - protection has decided that some protection requirement is n't being met somewhere , and as a result 50 years of educational film - making have been reduced to an error message indicating that Macrovision can't be enabled and therefore the content can't be played .
Since it plays just fine on a variety of non-Windows platforms including a range of standard DVD players , it 's not a problem with the DVDs but is due to the malfunctioning of a Windows content - protection mechanism around a technology called Macrovision .
Macrovision is a basic analog signal - protection technique that 's applied to TV - out ports on computer video cards .
Strangely , his computer does n't actually have any TV - out capability .
What it does have is a video chipset that , in theory , can provide TV - out ( most video chipsets have this capability , but it 's only used on some types of video cards , see the section Increased Hardware Costs for details on their use in different variations of video cards ) .
However , since no actual TV - out capability exists , it 's not possible to enable Macrovision for it .
This leads to a farcical situation where Windows is prohibiting playback due to the absence of copy protection on a nonexistent output ( here 's one of many examples of other users running into the same problem ) .
As a result , in the name of content protection , the film - maker is prevented from playing back his own content !
This is n't just an isolated incident .
A quick Google search of the error message that comes up reveals thousands upon thousands of users that have encountered this very problem , and this in turn is merely the tip of the iceberg , since few of those affected — home users wanting to play back movies — will have enough know - how to seek out the far - flung technical forums where this is being discussed ( to get a better estimate of the number of affected users you need to make multiple searches using variations of the error message since it 's reported in a variety of different ways , the single search link above is just one example ) .
In any event even if they do get this far , it 's a pointless effort because there 's no known solution to the problem ( although random poking around like wiping the computer clean and reinstalling Windows has reportedly helped in some cases ) .
This in turn is just one single way in which Windows ' content - protection can malfunction .
A Google search for various other playback - prevention error messages ( here 's one example of such a message ) reveals further unfortunate communities of users united by the fact that they 've been prevented from viewing legitimate content by malfunctioning Windows content protection .
“ Cannot go to market until it works to specification … potentially more respins of hardware ” — ATI .
“ This increases motherboard design costs , increases lead times , and reduces OEM configuration flexibility .
This cost is passed on to purchasers of multimedia PCs and may delay availability of high - performance platforms ” — ATI .
Vista includes various requirements for “ robustness ” in which the content industry , through “ hardware robustness rules ” , dictates design requirements to hardware manufacturers .
The level of control that the content producers have over technical design details is nothing short of amazing .
As security researcher Ed Felten quoted from Microsoft documents on his freedom - to - tinker web site about a year ago :
“ The evidence [ of security ] must be presented to Hollywood and other content owners , and they must agree that it provides the required level of security .
Written proof from at least three of the major Hollywood studios is required ” .
So if you design a new security system , you can't get it supported in Windows Vista until well - known computer security experts like MGM , 20th Century - Fox , and Disney give you the go - ahead ( this gives a whole new meaning to the term “ Mickey - Mouse security ” ) .
It 's absolutely astonishing to find paragraphs like this in what are supposed to be Windows technical documents , since it gives Hollywood studios veto rights over Windows security mechanisms .
As an example of these “ robustness rules ” , only certain layouts of a board are allowed in order to make it harder for outsiders to access parts of the board .
Possibly for the first time ever , computer design is being dictated not by electronic design rules , physical layout requirements , and thermal issues , but by the wishes of the content industry .
Apart from the massive headache that this poses to device manufacturers , it also imposes additional increased costs beyond the ones incurred simply by having to lay out board designs in a suboptimal manner .
Video card manufacturers typically produce a one - size - fits - all design ( often a minimally - altered copy of the chipset vendor 's reference design , as illustrated by one product review that shows five virtually identical cards from different vendors with the only noticeable difference being the logo on the heatsink ) , and then populate different classes and price levels of cards in different ways .
For example a low - end card will have low - cost , minimal or absent TV - out encoders , DVI circuitry , RAMDACs , and various other add - ons used to differentiate budget from premium video cards .
You can see this on the cheaper cards by observing the unpopulated bond pads on circuit boards , and gamers and the like will be familiar with cut - a - trace / resolder - a- resistor sidegrades of video cards .
An example of omitting components from a high - end card to create a mid-range card clearly shows the large red rectangular area to the far left of the card , which is where the manufacturer has omitted a component to produce a lower - cost model .
The same thing is visible in another card .
Conversely , an ( at the time it was released ) top - of - the - line card with optional components fitted shows an additional chip to the left of the large square heatsink + fan that handles video encoding and can be added or removed ( along with other optional components ) to create different levels of cards at different price points .
The automotive industry does the same thing , you have one basic model of each car type and 10,000 extras and options to suit everyone 's needs and pockets .
In some cases the addition of extra circuitry is n't merely a convenient price - differentiation mechanism but is required for the device to function .
Most newer video cards have dual video outputs , and the higher - end ones tend to have dual - DVI out .
However , many devices only provide a single TMDS ( Transition Minimized Differential Signaling , a high - speed serial data format ) output for DVI signalling .
The second output is provided by a DVO ( Digital Video Out , not to be confused with Intel 's similarly - named SVDO ) port in combination with an external TMDS transmitter .
In addition some high - resolution displays require multiple DVI / TMDS links because single - channel DVI does n't have enough bandwidth to support very high resolutions , requiring external TMDS transmitters .
You can see this in the first image on a review of Macintosh video cards , which shows the dual - link DVI output used to drive Apple 's 30 ″ Cinema Display ( this actually requires two dual - link TMDS transmitters to support a second display , but I 'll spare you the technical details of that one ) .
The important point in all of this is the phrase “ external TMDS transmitter ” , none of which meet the robustness requirements since they have direct access to the high - quality digital signal .
Perversely enough , it 's mostly the high - resolution displays advertised as suitable for HD content that require the external TMDS circuitry that makes them unable to meet the robustness requirements .
This problem is a nasty catch - 22 from which there 's no escape .
In theory it would be possible to add a DVI - to - HDMI ( with HDCP ) encoder to bypass this ( a typical example would be the Silicon Image Sil139 x or Sil193 x devices , which were specifically designed for this application .
Silicon Image TMDS transmitters are widely used on graphics cards ) , but HDMI does n't have the bandwidth to carry the high - definition images that the Cinema Display provides .
Even without explicit image degradation via constriction , the requirement to use the lower - quality HDMI link to carry what should be a DVI signal means that image quality is lost , and to make it even more painful the resulting graphics cards will be more expensive because it costs extra to add the quality - downgrading HDMI transmitter .
In other words consumers will be paying extra in order to get a lower - quality image .
Even with lower - resolution monitors , the fact that the data signal is present in unprotected form when it enters the external encoder means that it probably wo n't meet the robustness requirements .
( Exactly how this is meant to work is unspecified in any documentation that I 've been able to get my hands on .
It appears to be close to impossible to output a content - provider approved protected signal from a PC while also meeting the robustness requirements ) .
Vista 's content - protection requirements eliminate the ability to accomodate different feature sets in a one - size - fits - all design , banning the use of separate TV - out encoders , DVI circuitry , RAMDACs , and other discretionary add - ons because feeding unprotected video to these optional external components would make it too easy to lift the signal off the bus leading to the external component .
So everything has to be custom - designed and laid out so that there are no unnecessary accessible signal links on the board .
This means that a low - cost card is n't just a high - cost card with components omitted , and conversely a high - cost card is n't just a low - cost card with additional discretionary components added , each one has to be a completely custom design created to ensure that no signal on the board is accessible .
This extends beyond simple board design all the way down to chip design .
Instead of adding an external DVI / TMDS chip , it now has to be integrated into the graphics chip , along with any other functionality normally supplied by an external device .
So instead of varying video card cost based on optional components , the chipset vendor now has to integrate everything into a one - size - fits - all premium - featured graphics chip , even if all the user wants is a budget card for their kid's PC ( although given the popularity of graphics - intensive computer games , it 's more likely that they'd be getting the budget card for their own PC ) .
A further example of external meddling in hardware vendors ' product development and distribution can be found in the document that specifies what happens when a product is compromised in some way even though it 's previously been found to be fully compliant with the robustness requirements :
“ Company shall promptly redesign the affected product [… ] if such redesign is not possible or practical , cease manufacturing and selling such product ” .
This indicates that no matter how much dedication you show to the party line , it still wo n't help you when the chips are down .
Some years ago a friend of mine was working for a company that was building a custom IT solution for a government department .
When the day came time to sign off on it , everyone in the entire department who had signing authority called in sick rather than end up being the one who put their name to it .
I can just imagine the corporate sick day that must have taken place at ATI , nVidia , Intel , VIA , and SiS when it came time to put someone 's name to this gem , which gives Hollywood veto rights over your production lines and sales and distribution channels .
“ We 've taken on more legal costs in copyright protection in the last six to eight months than we have in any previous engagement .
Each legal contract sets a new precedent , and each new one builds on the previous one ” — ATI .
Protecting all of this precious premium content requires a lot of additional technology .
Unfortunately much of this is owned by third parties and requires additional licensing .
For example HDCP for HDMI is owned by Intel , so in order to send a signal over HDMI you have to pay royalties to Intel even though you could do exactly the same thing for free over DVI ( actually you could do it better , since DVI provides a higher - quality link than HDMI ) .
Similarly , since even AES - 128 on a modern CPU is n't fast enough to encrypt high - bandwidth content , companies are required to license the Intel - owned Cascaded Cipher , an AES - 128 - based transform that 's designed to offer a generally similar level of security but with less processing overhead .
The need to obtain unnecessary technology licenses extends beyond basic hardware IP .
In order to demonstrate their commitment to the cause , Microsoft have recommended as part of their “ robustness rules ” that vendors license third - party code obfuscation tools to provide virus - like stealth capabilities for their device drivers in order to make it difficult to interfere with their operation or to reverse - engineer them ( for example the spec requires “ use of techniques of obfuscation to disguise and hamper attempts to discover the approaches used ” ) .
Vendors like Cloakware and Arxan have actually added “ robustness solutions ” web pages to their sites in anticipation of this lucrative market .
This must be a nightmare for device vendors , for whom it 's already enough of a task getting fully functional drivers deployed without having to deal with adding stealth - virus - like technology on top of the basic driver functionality .
In fact the sorry state of some of Vista 's still - not - finished - yet graphics drivers have already prompted a class - action lawsuit against nVidia for deceptive advertising because many devices using nVidia hardware and advertised as “ Vista Ready ” do n't actually work because the drivers are n't ready ( the situation with 64 - bit drivers , ostensibly a major reason for switching to Vista in the first place , is particularly dire ) .
The robustness rules further complicate driver support by disallowing features such as driver debugging facilities in shipping drivers .
Most Windows XP users will at one time or another have encountered a Windows crash message indicating that some application that they were using has terminated unexpectedly and would they like to send debugging information to Microsoft to help fix the problem .
Some device vendors even implement their own custom versions of this debugging support in their drivers , an example being ATI 's VPU Recover , which captures graphics diagnostic and debugging information to send to ATI when a graphics device problem occurs .
Since this debugging functionality could leak content or content - related security information , it can no longer be used with audio or video components , considerably complicating vendors ' driver support and software enhancement processes ( the ATI product manager referenced in the Sources section lists these additional testing and support costs as “ potentially the highest cost of all ” ) .
“ Since [ encryption ] uses CPU cycles , an OEM may have to bump the speed grade on the CPU to maintain equivalent multimedia performance .
This cost is passed on to purchasers of multimedia PCs ” — ATI .
In order to prevent tampering with in - system communications , all communication flows have to be encrypted and / or authenticated .
For example content sent to video devices has to be encrypted with AES - 128 .
This requirement for cryptography extends beyond basic content encryption to encompass not just data flowing over various buses but also command and control data flowing between software components .
For example communications between user - mode and kernel - mode components are authenticated with OMAC message authentication - code tags , at considerable cost to both ends of the connection .
The initial crypto handshake is :
driver -> application : cert + nonce application -> driver : RSA - OAEP - SHA512 ( nonce || key || seqNo1 || seqNo2 )
In this step the driver supplies its certificate to the calling application via DxgkDdiOPMGetCertificate ( ) and a 128 - bit nonce via DxgkDdiOPMGetRandomNumber ( ) .
This is either a COPP or an OPM certificate , with COPP being the older Windows XP content protection and OPM being the newer Windows Vista one .
There 's also a third type of fleur - de - lis certificate that the driver uses if it has a UAB ( User - Accessible Bus ) .
The certificates contain a 2048 - bit RSA key which is used to encrypt a 40 - byte payload containing the nonce provided by the driver , a 128 - bit session key , and two 32 - bit initial sequence numbers ( they start at random values ) , the first number is for status messages via DxgkDdiOPMGetInformation ( ) and the second for command messages via DxgkDdiOPMConfigureProtectedOutput ( ) .
Once the keys are set up , each function call is :
in = OMAC ( nonce || seqNo || data ) out = OMAC ( nonce || seqNo || data )
( I 've used conventional bits - on - the - wire notation for this , the values are actually fields in a structure so for example the sequence number is provided in the ulSequenceNumber member ) .
This is very similar to the protocol used in SSL or SSH ( in practice some steps like cipher suite negotiation are omitted , since there 's a hardcoded set of ciphers used ) .
Finding SSL being run inside a PC from one software module to another is just weird .
Needless to say , this extremely CPU - intensive mechanism is a very painful way to provide protection for content , and this fact has been known for many years .
Twenty years ago , in their work on the ABYSS security module , IBM researchers concluded that the use of encrypted buses as a protection mechanism was impractical .
In order to prevent active attacks , device drivers are required to poll the underlying hardware every 30ms for digital outputs and every 150 ms for analog ones to ensure that everything appears kosher .
This means that even with nothing else happening in the system , a mass of assorted drivers has to wake up thirty times a second just to ensure that … nothing continues to happen ( commenting on this mechanism , Leo Laporte in his Security Now podcast with Steve Gibson calls Vista “ an operating system that is insanely paranoid ” ) .
In addition to this polling , further device - specific polling is also done , for example Vista polls video devices on each video frame displayed in order to check that all of the grenade pins ( tilt bits ) are still as they should be .
We already have multiple reports from Vista reviewers of playback problems with video and audio content , with video frames dropped and audio stuttering even on high - end systems [ Note I ] .
Time will tell whether this problem is due to immature drivers or has been caused by the overhead imposed by Vista 's content protection mechanisms interfering with playback .
An indication of the level of complexity added to the software can be seen by looking at a block diagram of Vista 's Media Interoperability Gateway ( MIG ) .
Of the eleven components that make up the MIG , only two ( the audio and video decoders ) are actually used to render content .
The remaining nine are used to apply content - protection measures .
Even more radical approaches to content protection can be found in Microsoft research papers , which indicate areas that Microsoft are looking at for future work .
For example the ASPLOS X paper Enabling Trusted Software Integrity proposes a system whereby content - playback mechanisms are protected by adding encrypted constraints into each basic instruction block that prevent the code from acting in anything other than an extremely constrained way .
This goes beyond simple code signing in that each basic code block contains a cryptographic hash that special hardware ( around 20 K gates on a simple RISC CPU , but far more for a more complex x86 one ) added to the processor 's instruction unit recalculates on the fly for each basic block of code before it 's executed to ensure that nothing other than the originally authorised instruction flow is executed .
The content - playback software is node - locked to a CPU on install , a special process that involves the processor running in single - user mode with virtual memory , context switches , and all interrupts disabled ( this special operation mode is only required for the initial install step , not during normal playback ) .
With various optimisations applied , typical content - processing operations like MPEG and JPEG encode or decode take a 10 - 20 % performance hit .
On - board graphics create an additional problem because blocks of precious content will end up stored in system memory , from where they could be paged out to disk .
In order to avoid this , Vista tags such pages with a special protection bit indicating that they need to be encrypted before being paged out and decrypted again after being paged in .
Vista does n't provide any other pagefile encryption , and will quite happily page banking PINs , credit card details , private , personal data , and other sensitive information , in plaintext .
The content - protection requirements make it fairly clear that in Microsoft 's eyes a frame of premium content is worth more than ( say ) a user 's medical records or their banking PIN [ Note J ] .
In fact , Microsoft is imposing a higher standard of security for premium content than what 's been required in the past for any known secure computing initiative proposed for protecting data classified at TOP SECRET or TS / SCI levels ( the closest that anything came to what 's required in Vista was the LOCK kernel with SIDEARM and BED coprocessors ( PDF link ) , which did n't go as far as the Vista requirements and after 17 years of development effort was a commercial failure to boot ) .
Just to make this point clear , the level of security that Vista is trying to achieve to protect video and audio is more extreme than anything the US government has ever considered necessary for protecting its most sensitive classified data .
In addition to the CPU costs , the desire to render data inaccessible at any level means that video decompression can't be done in the CPU any more , since there is n't sufficient CPU power available to both decompress the video and encrypt the resulting uncompressed data stream to the video card .
As a result , much of the decompression has to be integrated into the graphics chip .
At a minimum this includes IDCT , MPEG motion compensation , and the Windows Media VC - 1 codec ( which is also DCT - based , so support via an IDCT core is fairly easy ) .
As a corollary to the Increased Hardware Costs problem above , this means that you can't ship a low - end graphics chip without video codec support any more .
The inability to perform decoding in software also means that any premium - content compression scheme not supported by the graphics hardware can't be implemented .
If things like the Ogg video codec ever eventuate and get used for premium content , they had better be done using something like Windows Media VC - 1 or they 'll be a non-starter under Vista or Vista - approved hardware .
This is particularly troubling for the high - quality digital cinema ( D - Cinema ) specification , which uses Motion JPEG2000 ( MJ2 K ) because standard MPEG and equivalents do n't provide sufficient image quality .
Since JPEG2000 uses wavelet - based compression rather than MPEG 's DCT - based compression , and wavelet - based compression is n't on the hardware codec list , it 's not possible to play back D - Cinema premium content ( the moribund Ogg Tarkin codec also used wavelet - based compression ) .
Because all D - Cinema content will ( presumably ) be premium content , the result is no playback at all until the hardware support appears in PCs at some indeterminate point in the future .
Compare this to the situation with MPEG video , where early software codecs like the XingMPEG en / decoder practically created the market for PC video .
Today , thanks to Vista 's content protection , the opening up of new markets in this manner would be impossible .
This extra overhead carries a heavy cost for the typical user .
It 's not uncommon to find PCs so infested with malware ( spyware , viruses , trojans , bots , and so on ) that they can barely perform their normal tasks , let alone handle the overhead of content protection ( depending on whose surveys you believe , the typical Internet - connected PC averages 20 - 30 pieces of malware ) .
Despite the fact that , on paper , they may have plenty of system resources to throw around for content protection , in practice the overhead of hosting an entire zoo of malware means that any added overhead due to content protection renders them more or less unusable for content playback ( while users do n't seem to mind waiting around for their botnet - hosting PC to open a Word document , they 'll be less happy when it drops frames or produces stuttering audio output ) .
Looking at this from the point of view of the high - end rather than the average user , the problem is rather different .
The high - end graphics and audio market are dominated entirely by gamers , who will do anything to gain the tiniest bit of extra performance , like buying Bigfoot Networks ' $ 250 “ Killer NIC ” ethernet card in the hope that it 'll help reduce their network latency by a few milliseconds .
These are people buying $ 500 - $ 1000 graphics and sound cards for which one single sale brings the device vendors more than the few cents they get from the video / audio portion of an entire roomful of integrated - graphics - and - sound PCs .
I wonder how this market segment will react to knowing that their top - of - the - line hardware is being hamstrung by all of the content - protection “ features ” that Vista hogties it with ?
“ Compliance rules require [ content ] to be encrypted .
This requires additional encryption / decryption logic thus adding to VPU costs .
This cost is passed on to all consumers ” — ATI .
As part of the bus-protection scheme , devices are required to implement AES - 128 encryption in order to receive content from Vista .
This has to be done via a hardware decryption engine on the graphics chip , which would typically be implemented by throwing away a GPU rendering pipeline or two to make room for the AES engine ( nVidia did this in their low - end G84 variant of the G80 GPU , while saving the G80's silicon for as many rendering pipelines ( well , technically speaking they 're stream processors now ) as they can fit .
Discarding GPU features to make way for content - protection hardware seems a sub-optimal business model for graphics device vendors .
Establishing the AES key with the device hardware requires further cryptographic overhead , in this case a 2048 - bit Diffie - Hellman key exchange whose 2 K - bit output is converted to a 128 - bit AES key via a Davies - Meyer hash with AES as its block transformation component .
In programmable devices this can be done ( with considerable effort ) in the device ( for example in programmable shader hardware ) , or more simply by throwing out a few more rendering pipelines and implementing a public - key - cryptography engine in the freed - up space .
Needless to say , the need to develop , test , and integrate encryption engines into audio / video devices will only add to their cost , as covered in Increased Hardware Costs above , and the fact that they 're losing precious performance in order to accommodate Vista 's content protection will make gamers less than happy .
The burden that the content - protection overhead places on resources is even more severe for portable , battery - powered devices .
As a CNET review of portable devices found , “ DRM not only slows down an MP3 player but also sucks the very life out of them ” , with the extra overhead of processing DRM'd content shortening the battery life by about 25 % across a whole range of products .
This burden extends beyond DRM 'd music into games as well .
For example the content - protected version of the game Flatout 2 runs 15 % slower than the same game without content protection .
In the introduction , I predicted that Vista 's content protection , the entire mass of complex and troublesome technology covered in this writeup , would last less than a week once the hackers got hold of it .
Sure enough , shortly after Vista 's release , it was broken by an individual who was annoyed by the fact that he could n't play back his legitimately - purchased HD - DVDs on his legitimately - purchased HD - DVD player ( technically what he broke was the AACS content protection rather than mounting a direct attack on Vista , but the end result is that premium content under Vista is now unlocked ) .
In a sort of re-run of the DeCSS / Xing player story from a few years , someone going by the name of muslix64 appears to have figured out how to extract HD - DVD and Blu - Ray keys from the PowerDVD player software , allowing all ( ? )
HD disk content to be decrypted and played back on any HD display , without content - protection measures getting in the way .
The manufacturers of PowerDVD claim that they 've done nothing wrong and wo n't be updating the player , and muslix64 says that “ they [ players ] are all vulnerable [ to a ] different extent ” .
This was indirectly confirmed in April 2007 when the WinDVD player apparently had its keys revoked , requiring that users download and install , an , uh , “ security update ” to re-enable the DRM .
As a result , both HD - DVD and Blu - Ray content can now be decrypted and played without image downgrading or blocking by the OS , and unprotected content is already appearing in the usual locations like BitTorrent streams .
The fact that the legally - purchased content would n't play on a legally - purchased player because the content protection got in the way was the motivating factor for the crack .
The time taken was about a week .
As a result , all of the content - protection technology ( at least for HD - DVDs and Blu - Ray discs ) is rendered useless .
All that remains is the burden to the consumer .
It lasted all of one week .
If you want to read more about the AACS crack and its potential repercussions , Ed Felten has a long and detailed analysis in his Freedom to Tinker blog .
TLS security person Eric Rescorla has looked at this a bit further and concluded that this problem is more or less unfixable as long as software players exist .
A side - effect is that if the content owners decide to address this by revoking the players , it affects a huge number of innocent users , and because the problem as a whole is unfixable , the attackers can force the content owners to do this whenever they please and as often as they please , a fact that 's unlikely to endear the content providers to consumers .
From a chess - playing perspective it appears that the content owners ' threat modelling never went any further than “ Hey , I can move my rook over there ! ” .
There does n't seem to have been any consideration of what could happen during any subsequent moves , or maybe no - one wanted to think about it .
So even though the mechanisms to address this are in place , in practice it looks like AACS is CSS all over again ( see [ Note C ] for the reasons why ) .
The AACS Licensing Authority in turn says that AACS has not been seriously compromised , which no doubt comes as a considerable surprise to people busy decrypting HD - DVD and Blu - Ray content .
Given the legal implications for the various participants in AACS this finger - pointing contest is to be expected ( you could just blame Canada , for example ) , but it 's unlikely that anyone but the lawyers will care .
In the meantime there 's an ongoing arms race ( or an amusing game if you 're not the AACS LA ) in which the AACS LA releases fixes and the opposition break them , often within a day of the fix being released .
Overall it 's probably safe to say that the future function of AACS will be mostly to act as a teaching example of how not to do security engineering .
( The “ blame Canada ” comment is a reference to a carefully - planted story in the Canadian Globe and Mail newspaper designed to influence Canadian lawmakers in their vote on Bill C - 60 .
Another Canadian paper calls the story “ mostly fiction [… ] much ado about nothing , featuring unsubstantiated and inconsistent claims about camcording , exaggerations about its economic harm and misleading critiques of Canadian law ” , with further analysis showing that “ the industry 's own data reveals that the claims are based primarily on fiction rather than fact ” ) .
“ No amount of coordination will be successful unless it 's designed with the needs of the customer in mind .

“ The PC industry is committed to providing content protection on the PC , but nothing comes for free .
These costs are passed on to the consumer ” — ATI .
“ How do I put all these companies in a position where , regardless of what they see is in their best interest , they have to adopt your technology ? [… ]

“ I 'm not sure how the company lost sight of what matters to our customers , both business and home , the most , but in my view we lost our way .

The product still has a few wrinkles
The topic of DRM is far too complex to cover here , and in any case has been extensively analysed elsewhere .
In you want a good summary of the situation then I 'd recommend reading There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch by book author Eric Flint .
This provides an interesting view of DRM from one of the artists / content creators that DRM is supposed to be protecting .
It 's an extremely insightful analysis of the topic that examines the underlying business model and indeed philosophy of DRM rather than focusing exclusively on technical and legislative measures or its counterpart , “ information wants to be free ” jingoism .
This should be required reading for anyone who works with DRM or who 's interested in the background for the whole DRM debate .
So setting aside the DRM debate , the question remains :
Why is Microsoft going to this much trouble ?
Ask most people what they picture when you use the term “ premium - content media player ” and they 'll respond with “ A PVR ” or “ A DVD player ” and not “ A Windows PC ” .
So why go to this much effort to try and turn the PC into something that it 's not ?
You can get an idea of just how important content protection is to Microsoft by looking at the Windows Vista logo requirements .
The primary requirement for graphics devices in the Windows Vista Logo Program is n't , as would be expected , the ability to handle a high - resolution display or display a rich palette of colours .
It is n't the presence of a good quantity of memory and powerful graphics rendering .
It is n't even the ability to handle Vista 's much - touted Aero interface , arguably the primary reason for running Vista .
Instead , the number one requirement for Windows Vista graphics device certification , “ GRAPHICS - 0001 ” in the specification , is “ Display adapter supports output connectors with content protection features and provides control via PVP and COPP DDIs ” .
It 's only the follow - on “ GRAPHICS - 0002 ” that requires that “ Display subsystem meets GPU , memory , resolution , and bandwidth requirements for a premium Windows experience ” .
This is a pretty amazing admission , because it means that Microsoft is placing content protection above all other requirements for Vista , even the ability to handle Vista 's primary feature , the Aero interface .
For audio it 's less critical , dropping to 14th place as “ AUDIO - 0014 ” , “ Audio device implements DRM support as defined in the Windows Driver Kit ” .
This is probably because Microsoft have n't quite got the audio DRM sorted out yet so it 's a bit hard to nail down requirements at this stage .
So why is content protection apparently Microsoft 's number one priority for Vista ?
In July 2006 , Cory Doctorow published an analysis of the anti-competitive nature of Apple 's iTunes copy - restriction system that looked at the benefits of restrictive DRM for the company that controls it .
The only reason I can imagine why Microsoft would put its programmers , device vendors , third - party developers , and ultimately its customers , through this much pain is because once this copy protection is entrenched , Microsoft will completely own the distribution channel .
In the same way that Apple has managed to acquire a monopolistic lock - in on their music distribution channel ( an example being the Motorola ROKR fiasco , which was so crippled by restrictions that a Fortune magazine senior editor reviewed it as the STNKER ) , so Microsoft will totally control the premium - content distribution channel .
In fact examples of this Windows content lock - in are already becoming apparent as people move to Vista and find that their legally - purchased content wo n't play any more under Vista ( the example given in the link is particularly scary because the content actually includes a self - destruct after which it wo n't play any more , so not only do you need to re-purchase your content when you switch from XP to Vista , but you also need to re-purchase it periodically when it expires .
In addition since the media rights can't be backed up , if you experience a disk crash you get another opportunity to re-purchase the content all over again .
This is by design : as Jack Valenti , former head of the MPAA , put it , “ If you buy a DVD you have a copy .
If you want a backup copy you buy another one ” ) .
It 's obvious why this type of business model makes the pain of pushing content protection onto consumers so worthwhile for Microsoft since it practically constitutes a license to print money .
Microsoft have been saying for some years now that they 'd really like the PC to go away , to turn into a kind of media platform and content - distribution center for consumers .
This was a major theme of Bill Gates ' world promotional tour for Vista in early 2007 , and in particular something he went into in some detail at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
Windows MCE has been the tail and of a long line of ( unsuccessful ) attempts to achieve this ( the only reason why MCE seems to sell at all is because it's the cheapest version of Windows that vendors can pre-install on a PC ) .
If “ premium content ” ever takes off , Microsoft wants to be the central controller of all content distribution and playback — only Windows can secure the content , therefore only Windows can distribute it .
Even the term “ premium content ” is misleading : in a few years ' time , most audio and video will be produced in some form of HD format , at which point “ premium content ” becomes normal , and so everything is subject to content protection .
Paul Stimpson submitted an excellent analysis of this situation in which he points out that “ Microsoft are being clever by releasing these protection ' features ' now ;
The average user who goes to a computer store will get Vista but wo n't have either premium content or get ' premium ready ' PC hardware ;
The ordinary person in the street can't afford a top - of - the - line machine and display .
They will have a ' Vista capable ' machine ; Vista will look nice and not cause too much trouble or suffer from the protection overhead too much ;
They wo n't have any choice or know any different and it will be accepted .
These people will dismiss any complaints they hear about these problems as a geek thing .
They got their computer at the right price and it does everything they ask of it .
They will only find out the truth in a few years when they buy their next computer and all machines are ' premium ready ' ( and fast enough to implement the protection ) and every display has an HDMI connector .
By that time XP will be well into its decline so there will be no going back .
It 's impossible to keep off the upgrade treadmill if you have Windows ; Eventually you will either have to buy new hardware ( with a new copy of Windows ) or your out - of - support version of Windows will become such a target for malware that it will no longer be useable ” .
“ In today 's environment these content protection features are indeed a nonsense .
I do n't think , however that Microsoft are thinking about today 's environment beyond keeping these features low - key for most users in order to avoid rejection .
In their heads Microsoft see the ' connected home ' where everyone has a network and displays around the house that integrate everything from TV to email , Internet , telephone , lighting and heating .
In order to do these things on your TV you need a computer attached to it and Microsoft want that computer to run Windows ” .
So not only will Microsoft be able to lock out any competitors , but because they will then represent the only available distribution channel they 'll be able to dictate terms back to the content providers whose needs they are nominally serving in the same way that Apple has already dictated terms back to the music industry : Play by Apple 's rules , or we wo n't carry your content .
And as the example above shows , they 'll also be able to dictate terms to consumers in order to ensure a continual revenue flow .
The result will be a technologically enforced monopoly that makes their current de-facto Windows monopoly seem like a velvet glove in comparison [ Note K ] .
The onerous nature of Vista 's content protection also provides a perverse incentive to remove the protection measures from the content , since for many consumers that 'll be the only way that they can enjoy their legally - acquired content without Vista 's DRM getting in the way .
This is already illustrated in the Quotes and Footnotes sections , where the people bypassing HD - DVD protection measures are n't hardcore video pirates but ordinary consumers who can't even play their own legitimately - acquired content .
The sheer obnoxiousness of Vista 's content protection may end up being the biggest incentive to piracy yet created .
Even without overt “ piracy ” ( meaning bypassing restrictions in order to play legally - purchased media ) , it makes very sound business sense for companies to produce media - player hardware that bypasses the problem , just as they have already with region - free play - anything DVD players .
Perhaps Hollywood should heed the advice given in one of their most famous productions : “ The more you tighten your grip , the more systems will slip through your fingers ” .
A historical feature of organisations like Beria 's NKVD ( and by extension any kind of state enforcers in a totalitarian society ) is that the lack of any fixed goals and limits on their behaviour , the kind that would be set by the laws of a democratic country , combined with the intense paranoia of the leadership , leads to a continual extension of the security apparatus and an ongoing escalation of repressiveness by the enforcers .
The result is a driftnet approach to enforcement that ends up netting more innocent bystanders than anything else .
The many examples given in the rest of this writeup are an indication that Windows is already well down this path .
Overall , Vista 's content - protection functionality seems like an astonishingly short - sighted piece of engineering , concentrating entirely on content protection with no consideration given to the enormous repercussions of the measures employed .
It 's something like the PC equivalent of the ( hastily dropped ) proposal mooted in Europe to put RFID tags into high - value banknotes as an anti-counterfeiting measure , which completely ignores the fact that the major users of this technology would be criminals who would use it to remotely identify the most lucrative robbery targets ( in my Godzilla security tutorial I nominate this ( hastily - dropped ) idea as “ possibly the most stupid use of RFID ever proposed ” ) .
To add insult to injury , consider what this enormous but ultimately wasted effort could have been put towards .
Microsoft is saying that Vista will be the most secure version of Windows yet , but they 've been saying that for every new Windows release since OS security became a selling point .
I do n't think anyone 's under any illusions that Vista PCs wo n't be crawling with malware shortly after the bad guys get their hands on them ( there were already Vista exploits up for sale before the OS even hit the shelves ) .
But what if the Vista content - protection technology had instead been applied towards malware protection ?
Instead of a separate protection domain for video playback , we might have a separate protection domain for banking and credit card details .
Instead of specialised anti-debugging technigues to stop users getting at even one frame of protected content , we could have those same techniques combatting malware hooking itself into the OS .
The list goes on and on , with all of the effort being misapplied to DRM when it could have been used to combat malware instead .
What a waste .
What a waste .
Where could all this stuff be heading in the future ?
For some years now Microsoft have been trying to introduce software - as - a - service ( SaaS ) , where you do n't pay one lump sum for an application any more but instead rent it in an ongoing series of payments .
The reason for this is that they 've pretty much run out of ideas for new revenue - generation features for their two flagship produces Windows and Office .
If you take a typical user and dump them in front of a ten - year - old copy of Microsoft Word ( Office ' 97 ) and then ask them to compare it with the latest edition ( at least before Office 2007 , when they radically changed the user interface ) then the only obvious change is that the paperclip is gone .
Sure , there 's a pile of obscure little changes that 99.99 % of the user base would never notice , but for the vast majority of users the functionality of Office that they actually make day - to - day use of has n't changed in ten years .
This is n't due to any inability of Microsoft to innovate , but because there 's only so many things that you can do with ( say ) a word processor , and at some point you 've made the last meaningful change and the only thing left to do is repeatedly tweak the eye candy and bump the version number every few years .
Windows has the same problem .
If you take an eight - year - old PC running Windows 98 , put it next to a current PC running Windows XP ( with the Fisher - Price colour scheme turned off ) , the typical user wo n't be able to tell you what 's changed without a point - by - point comparison of system features from one machine to the other .
This problem is by no means exclusive to Microsoft .
Here 's a quick exercise : Apart from the monstrous bloat in size , what changed between Adobe Acrobat Reader 4 , Acrobat Reader 5 , Acrobat Reader 6 , and Acrobat Reader 7 ?
For anyone but a hardcore geek or DTP professional , the response is “ nothing ” , because there really was n't much more left to add after version 4 .
You can actually see this in a program called Adobe Reader Speedup , which unplugs all of the bloat from newer versions of Acrobat so that it loads and runs almost instantly , with no noticeable loss in functionality .
The same applies to any number of other software packages :
After they 've reached a certain level of maturity , you just run out of things to add .
This is a severe problem for large software ( and hardware ) vendors , whose revenue streams are dependent on users upgrading to the latest version every few years .
If users have a perfectly usable old PC running a perfectly usable old version of Windows and a perfectly usable old version of Office , there 's no incentive to upgrade , and so by extension no incentive to provide a new revenue stream to the vendor .
Enter the subscription model for software .
Instead of paying for something once and then falling off the radar as a revenue source for several years , subscription - based content and subscription - based software guarantee a continuous revenue stream for the vendor .
If Microsoft controls the distribution channel for content ( which is what Vista 's content protection is trying to achieve ) then every time you view or listen to some content ( no matter whose con
At least one member of the Fourth Estate has finally caught on to the sheer wrongness that is the White House Correspondents Dinner , that annual farce whereby journalists gush at the chance to hobnob with the very subjects they are tasked with objectively investigating .
From Frank Rich 's subscription - only New York Times column , via Editor & Publisher :
NEW YORK Tucked inside Frank Rich's Sunday column in the New York Times is indication that the newspaper will no longer attend the annual White House Correspondents Association dinners in Washington , which he calls " a crystallization of the press 's failures in the post - 9/11 era . "
He writes that the event " illustrates how easily a propaganda - driven White House can enlist the Washington news media in its shows . "
" After last weekend 's correspondents ' dinner , The Times decided to end its participation in such events , " wrote Rich .
" But even were the dinner to vanish altogether , it remains but a yearly televised snapshot of the overall syndrome .
The current White House , weakened as it is , can still establish story lines as fake as ' Mission Accomplished ' and get a free pass . "
Rich mixed this criticism of the press in with regret over the death of David Halberstam this week , who Rich said it would be hard to imagine " yukking it up with Alberto Gonzales , Paul Wolfowitz and two discarded ' American Idol ' contestants " at the dinner .
" It 's our country 's bitter fortune that while David Halberstam is gone , too many Joe Alsops still hold sway , " writes Rich , comparing the Pulitzer - winner to the now - forgotten Vietnam War cheerleading columnist .

Forget so - called “ energy drinks . ”
A new analysis by University of Georgia researchers finds overwhelming evidence that regular exercise plays a significant role in increasing energy levels and reducing fatigue .
“ A lot of times when people are fatigued the last thing they want to do is exercise , ” said professor Patrick O’Connor , co-director of the UGA exercise psychology laboratory .
“ But if you ’re physically inactive and fatigued , being just a bit more active will help . ”
Health professionals encourage regular exercise to prevent or improve symptoms of conditions such as diabetes , heart disease and obesity , but the scientific evidence on whether exercise increases or reduces fatigue had never been reviewed quantitatively .
O’Connor , kinesiology professor Rod Dishman and lead author Tim Puetz , who recently completed his doctoral work at UGA , analyzed 70 randomized , controlled trials that enrolled a total of 6,807 subjects .
They found strong support for the role of exercise in reducing fatigue .
“ More than 90 percent of the studies showed the same thing : Sedentary people who completed a regular exercise program reported improved fatigue compared to groups that did not exercise ” O’Connor said .
“ It ’s a very consistent effect . ”
The study , published in the November issue of the journal Psychological Bulletin , quantified the magnitude of the effect of exercise and found that it was stronger than the treatment of fatigued people with drugs such as the narcolepsy drug modafinil .
Specifically , the researchers found that exercise increased energy and reduced fatigue by 0.37 standard deviations when compared to control groups , whereas participants in a previous study taking modafinil had an improvement of 0.23 standard deviations .
Puetz notes that their analysis found that nearly every group studied – from healthy adults to cancer patients to those with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease – benefited from exercise .
He acknowledges that it may seem counterintuitive that expending energy through exercise would increase feelings of energy and reduce fatigue , but he points out that previous studies have shown marked increases in the levels of energy - promoting and mood - enhancing neurotransmitters such as dopamine , norepinephrine and serotonin in the brains of animals that are placed in regular exercise conditions .
“ We live in a society where people are always looking for the next sports drink , energy bar or cup of coffee that will give them the extra edge to get through the day , ” Puetz said .
“ But it may be that lacing up your tennis shoes and getting out and doing some physical activity every morning can provide that spark of energy that people are looking for . ”
Supplies of blood are always stretched
The technique potentially enables blood from groups A , B and AB to be converted into group O negative , which can be safely transplanted into any patient .
The method , which makes use of newly discovered enzymes , may help relieve shortages of blood for transfusions .
The work , led by the University of Copenhagen , is reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology .
Using incompatible blood during a transfusion can put a patient 's life in danger .
The blood cells of people with group A and B blood contain one of two different sugar molecules , which act as " antigens " , triggering an immune system response .
People with AB blood have both types of molecule , while those with group O blood have neither .
People produce antibodies against the antigens they lack .
This means groups A , B and AB can only be given to patients with compatible blood , while O - as long as it is rhesus negative - can be given to anyone .
The new technique works by using bacterial enzymes to cut sugar molecules from the surface of red blood cells .
After a search of 2,500 fungi and bacteria the researchers discovered two bacteria - Elizabethkingia meningosepticum and Bacterioides fragilis - which contained potentially useful enzymes .
They found that enzymes from both bacteria were able to remove both A and B antigens from red blood cells .
Trials needed
However , they say that patient trials will be needed before the conversion method can be used in hospitals .
Writing in the same journal , blood experts Geoff Daniels , of the Bristol Institute for Transfusion Sciences , and Stephen Withers , of the University of British Columbia , Canada , welcome the research .
They said the use of enzymes to convert blood group has long been proposed , but has proved to be impractical due to the inefficiency and incompatibility of available enzymes .
However , they say the enzymes discovered in the latest study may finally overcome these problems .
They write : " Their method may enable manufacture of universal red cells , which would substantially reduce pressure on the blood supply . "
The new process cannot do anything about another antigen that can trigger an immune response .
Blood which carries this antigen is known as rhesus positive .
This means that only rhesus negative blood can be used to create the new type of group O supplies .

Of all the ancient cultures in South America , perhaps the most mysterious are those found in and around the rugged mountains of Peru .
The area is such a harsh environment , with steep inclines , temperature extremes and a scarcity of water to sustain crops or man , that it is a puzzle why ancient cultures settled here .
But settle they did , often building large living centers from stone at very high altitudes where low atmospheric pressure makes even walking a breathless task .
While the world is generally familiar with Machu Picchu and the Nazca Lines , another mystery has come to light through the modern science of satellite photography .
This phenomenon is one that was previously known but the extent of its size and effort required to make it is just being fully realized .
A series of holes , usually about 24 inches across and in neat rows of from nine to twelve , stretch for almost a mile in Peru .
It starts at the base of a mountain and then climbs up the side and meanders up and down , over some of the roughest terrain .
The remains of an ancient settlement can be seen near the Southern part of the path , distinguished by two large craters , measuring about 24 feet across .
Elsewhere in the mountains , other ancient structures and foundations can be seen from satellite imagry [ right ] , but have not yet been excvated .
In his book , Zecharia Sitchin describes how the annunaki set up a colony in Peru to look for gold , following their disappointment with sea mining .
It has been suggested that these holes appear similar to excavations conducted by mining operations , perhaps searching for a vein of precious metal .
Similar holes have been encountered from attempts to locate water , although the liklihood of finding water in these stone mountains seems very remote .
What made the ancient people of this era toil in such inhospitable conditions to create these holes ?
How long did it take them ?
What sustained them while they labored so hard ?
These mysteries remain to be answered .

I know they are not the same but I have noticed some 60 foot holes in California near I - 5 and the Oregon border .
No one knows who made them and they too are in a sort of neat row formation .

My theory is that when ever a local young man wanted to prove that he was ready to join the adult society he had to dig one of these holes using implements that he had fashioned himself , perhaps even within a given time frame ..
Since it was such a rugged environment , manual skills and endurance were the necessary elements of success as an adult .
These holes were the testing grounds .
The size , shape , relationship to the other holes were all important considerations .
The best hole diggers might even have landed the most desirable maidens .
The weaker contestants who could not dig a suitable hole were not allowed to have any maidens at all .
This automatically weeded out the weakling born into the group .
The custom fell out of favor when the people realized that the best diggers were not always the smartest .

from first glance , i'd say it was a security feature .
like a wall .
it has the same impact as a wall , it stops a large force from crossing .
individuals might not have a problem stepping around the holes , but an army of people would .
I 'd imagine it would scare people from entering the area if they thought they would fall in .

perhaps the holes were support for timber or some bio dergadable that served as upright barrier
Dr. Paul Recher
I would seggest that perhaps there was a settlement near the bottom of this hill and that these holes were designed to hold water and prevent a landslide ... or perhaps to hold water for use in irrigation or for drinking .

Hey ,
If you look at some of the surrounding land from satellite photos on goole - earth you see more of these in neat rows next to what looks like farms .
I note that Peru is a big coffee and nut grower and so these farms , with rows of trees , are likely growing some kind of food .
The only problem with this theory is that you have to wonder why anyone would try to grow trees in a long narrow row and on the steep side of a mountain ?
Weird .

Could this be some ancient archaeological excavation that was done , perhaps looking for some buried artifacts ?

Vonage Holdings CEO
Michael Snyder resigned , the company said Thursday , at the same time announcing moves to cut costs .
Snyder resigned , and also quit the company ’s board of directors , Wednesday .
Chairman and Chief Strategist Jeffrey A. Citron will fill in as CEO until a replacement is found .
The company announced plans to cut its costs by $ 140 million , including $ 110 million in unnecessary marketing expenses , in order to become more competitive .
Vonage may soon be able to cut back on customer recruitment costs : on Friday it won a temporary reprieve from a court order prohibiting it from signing up new customers as a result of a patent dispute with Verizon Communications Inc. , but that order may be reinstated at a hearing on April 24 .
Vonage spends $ 275 on marketing for each new customer signed up , it said .
The VOIP ( voice over Internet Protocol ) operator also plans to freeze staff recruitment , and to lay off 10 percent of its workforce during the second quarter , cutting costs by a further $ 20 million .
The company expects to report revenue for the first quarter of $ 195 million and 322,000 new customers signed up during the quarter .
Allowing for departing customers , it expects to report a net gain of 166,000 subscribers .
The company has around 2.4 million subscriber lines , bringing it an average monthly revenue per line of $ 28.17 , it said .
Editor ’s note :
Due to a reporting error it was incorrectly noted that Vonage was prohibited from signing up new customers ; that has been corrected .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
We 're in an unprecedented situation .
It 's not just that Hillary Clinton would be the first woman president if elected , she would also be the first president married to a former president .
Which leads to the question :
What will Bill Clinton do if Sen.
Hillary Clinton becomes commander in chief ?
" People ask me all the time , well , if you 're elected , can you make him secretary of state ? " the New York senator said .
" And I tell them , since President Kennedy and Robert Kennedy , I think that 's illegal . "
Voters expect a president to be his or her own person .
That 's one reason vice presidents like Hubert Humphrey , Walter Mondale , Dan Quayle and Al Gore often have trouble winning the presidency on their own .
The Clintons seem to be aware of the problem .
" She 'll be the president , " Bill Clinton said on " Larry King Live " last week .
" She 'll make the decisions .
But if I can help , I will . "
Do voters want the former president to help ?
Apparently , they do .
By two to one , voters think Bill Clinton would be an asset , not a liability , if his wife becomes president , according to a CNN / Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted April 10 - 12 .
But the question is , what would he do ?
" I sure can make him ambassador to the world , because we have a lot of work to do to get our country back in the standing it should be , " she said .
On Saturday , Sen. Clinton said , " I ca n't think of a better cheerleader for America than Bill Clinton . "
Why do we need a cheerleader ?
Because friendship with other countries is as crucial in the war on terror as it used to be in the Cold War .
The Clintons want to have it both ways .
The former president will be there as an adviser .
" I 've had a lot of experience and I can help her , " he said .
But he wo n't be there to run things .
" I 'd like to continue my foundation work around the world , " he said .
The rest of the world may miss Bill Clinton , but do Americans ?
Increasingly , they do .
As President Bush 's numbers have gone down , Bill Clinton 's have gone up -- to the point where a majority of Americans now say they miss him .

CORVALLIS - A 200 - year study of rotting logs in the Oregon Cascade Range is only 10 percent complete , but findings from this research have already helped save hundreds of millions of dollars , improved forest health and shattered conventional wisdom about the decay of woody debris .
It also has attracted the interest of forest managers from around the world .
This work was begun 20 years ago by scientists from the College of Forestry at Oregon State University with 530 logs at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest near Blue River , Ore .
The research was seen as a way to more rigorously document the process of wood decay and the value it provides in nutrient release , soil enhancement and other issues .
Even though the study is far from complete , it has already achieved many of these goals and raised other important questions that will continue to affect modern silviculture and the understanding of forest ecology , said Mark E. Harmon , the Richardson Chair and Professor of Forest Science at OSU .
The work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the U.S.D.A. Forest Service .
" Much of what we 've found has run contrary to the conventional wisdom and is not what we expected , " Harmon said .
" And this long - term , intensive study of the decay of forest debris and logs has raised considerable awareness of this issue among forest managers . "
Two decades ago , forest harvest operations usually " cleaned up " a site after logging , removing most of the debris at considerable cost and effort .
As this and other studies showed the compelling ecological value of that material , the debris is now largely left where it is , making the forest healthier in the long run and saving hundreds of millions of dollars in unnecessary work .

" When this study began , we still assumed that most debris and logs decayed in more or less the same way , only releasing their stored - up nutrients after decades or centuries of decay , " Harmon said .
" It 's now understood that there are large differences between the decay rate caused by different decomposers of different tree species , and that some nutrients from dead wood begin to enrich the forest almost immediately .
" That 's a huge change in our thinking , and there are still a lot more changes to come , " he said .
Among the other findings of the first 20 years of this work :
# As much as one - third of the nitrogen in Pacific Northwest forests , one of the key nutrients that limit vegetation growth , appears to come from nitrogen fixation processes within rotting logs , in addition to that being slowly released from the wood itself .
# Nutrient release begins far more quickly than ever anticipated , from both decaying fungi and the leaching effects of persistent rains .
advertisement
# The " brown rot " fungi that cannot break down lignin in trees leaves structural material behind to help form the next generations of forest floor and ultimately soil .
White rot fungi , by contrast , degrade all parts of the wood , leaving almost nothing behind and decaying far more rapidly but only on some tree species .
# Although some wood ( such as Douglas - fir ) resists decay , mechanisms such as mushroom growth on downed logs work to drain nitrogen from these logs , much more than had been understood .
# There is a 10 - fold difference in wood decay rates among dead trees .
True firs such as silver fir will decay far more rapidly than other species , as much as 5 - 6 percent a year and may be gone in 60 years or less .
Other species such as western red cedar or Douglas - fir may persist for hundreds of years .
# Some parts of a log will decay and release nutrients much more quickly than other parts , leading to complex patterns that cannot be predicted by considering just the " average " condition of the wood .
# Decay processes are dynamic and constantly changing , and they affect everything from nutrient release to soil changes , stream sedimentation , and plant , animal and fish habitat .
" In the past we just did n't pay much attention to what was decaying , and how , and what the ecological implications of that were , " Harmon said .
" We now know there are huge differences between tree species , that some fungi decay some species and not others , and that all of these factors will play a role in sustainable forestry and overall forest health . "
In the future , Harmon said , trees increasingly will be planted that are never meant to be harvested - by design , they will be left to decay and play certain roles in forest ecology , for the health of plants , trees , microbes and wildlife .
With large trees that have commercial value , it 's still not certain exactly how many must be left for the complete range of forest benefits , he said , and findings on that issue will continue to emerge from studies such as this .
Oddly enough , some of today 's evolving forest management systems may seem more similar to those in the early days of the Pacific Northwest forest products industry - when large amounts of less - valuable wood was left behind in practices that were later deemed " wasteful " and changed dramatically after the 1940s , in order to harvest more of the wood and leave a clean site behind .
The findings of these studies and their temporal scope have been so compelling , Harmon said , that they have attracted not only forest scientists but artists .
" We originally began this work assuming it would be of interest only to forest researchers and ecologists , " Harmon said .
" Now people from all over the world are watching these studies , and many experts think of nutrient release as one of the last frontiers in understanding the role of dead trees in forest ecology .
" Writers have done features on the work in national publications .
Even artists and sculptors have worked with us to portray the fascinating , natural processes of forest growth and long - term changes . "
David Cameron is an idiot .
A simpering , say - anything , dough - faced , preposterous waddling idiot with a feeble , insincere voice and an irritating tendency to squat near the top of opinion polls .
I do n't like him .
And I 've got a terrible feeling he 'll be prime minister one day .
Brrr .
These are unthinking snap judgments , based on little more than his media profile - but since he appears to consist of little more than a media profile designed to appeal to unthinking snap judgments , that seems fair enough .
On that basis , let 's stick to gut instincts , shall we ?
There is nothing to him .
He is like a hollow Easter egg with no bag of sweets inside .
Cameron will say absolutely anything if he thinks it might get him elected .
If a shock poll was published saying 99 % of the British public were enthusiastic paedophiles , he would drive through the streets in an open - top bus surrounded by the Mini Pops .
He 's nothing .
He 's no one .
It 's notoriously tricky to find out much about his past , in the same way that Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt found it tricky to find out much about the serial killer John Doe in the movie Se7en .
He 'd managed to erase his entire existence , even slicing the skin off his fingers to avoid leaving prints .
Ever seen a close - up of Cameron 's fingertips ?
Of course not .
Think about it .
The apparently self - penned bio on Cameron 's website begins , " I was born in October 1966 , " and then leaps straight forward to 2001 , missing out the decades he spent as a guffawing , top - hatted toff in between .
The infamous photo of Dave posing alongside his posho chums from the Bullingdon Club in an expensive royal blue tailcoat is one of the few clues we have .
It looks like precisely the sort of photo a detective might end up studying in a murder mystery , one where a group of friends accidentally killed a prostitute during a drunken , stormy night , and collaborated on a cover - up .
I 'm not saying the Bullingdon boys kill prostitutes .
I 'm just saying I would n't be surprised .
And that 's his fault , not mine .
He 's gone out of his way not to mention his blue - blooded carousing , because he knows it would make the average citizen puke themselves into a coma , and one side - effect of this is that he seems shifty and suspicious .
Every time I look at Cameron , I 'm reminded of video - game characters : not the loveable , spiky ones like Sonic or Mario , but the bland , generic dead - eyed avatars you can " create " for use in a tennis game or a tedious Tolkienesque adventure .
You start with a bald clone , then add features drawn from a limited palette - eye colour , one of three noses , an optional goatee beard and so on - and invariably end up with an eerily characterless zombie straight out of the boardgame Guess Who ?.
Simulated choice , as opposed to genuine variety .
It is easy to build a Cameron lookalike .
Just simulate the smuggest estate agent you can think of .
Or some interchangeable braying twit in a rugby shirt , ruining a local pub just by being there .
Easy .
Naturally , I 'm biased .
I 've instinctively hated the Tories since birth .
If there was an election tomorrow , and the only two choices were the Nazis or the Tories , I 'd vote Tory with an extremely heavy heart .
In descending order of vehemence , my objections to the Tory species stem from a ) everything they do , b ) everything they say , c ) everything they stand for , d ) how they look , e ) their stupid names and f ) the noises I imagine they make in bed .
I once overheard two posh people - almost certainly Tories - having sex in a hotel room .
It was grim .
The woman kept saying , " Fuck me , Gerald , " in a cut - glass accent , which was funny , but Gerald himself soon wiped the grin off my face with his grunting , which was n't really grunting at all , but instead consisted of the words " oh " and " ah " crisply orated aloud , like Sir Laurence Olivier reading dialogue off a card at an early rehearsal .
I did n't stick around long enough to hear the climax , but I imagine the words " gosh " , " crumbs " , and " crikey " probably put in an appearance .
And here is why that 's relevant : Cameron almost certainly says " crikey " at the vital moment .
Go on , picture it .
Right now , in your mind 's eye .
You know it 's true .
If nothing else in this puerile one - sided hatchet job has convinced you , that 's reason enough not to elect him , right there .
In summary , then : he is a idiot .
But you knew that anyway .
In fact the only reason I have written this is because it is going to be printed in a newspaper , which means his advisers will have to photocopy it and include it in some official internal press file , where it will sit alongside all the unnecessarily positive coverage he has generated for himself .
It gives me a pathetic , childish , self - indulgent thrill , and in today 's world of cookie - cutter choicelessness , that 's as good as it gets .
So nyahh nyahh , Dave , you fair - weather , upper - crust guff - cloud .
Nyahh nyahh .

The Conservative party
The Conservative party is an eternally irritating force for wrong that appeals exclusively to bigots , toffs , money - minded machine men , faded entertainers and selfish , grasping simpletons who were born with some essential part of their soul missing .
None of history 's truly historical figures has been a Tory , apart from the ones that were , and they only did it by mistake .
To reach a more advanced stage of intellectual evolution , humankind must first eradicate the " Tory instinct " from the brain - which is why mother nature is gradually making them less sexy with each passing generation .
The final Tory is doomed to spend his or her life masturbating alone on a hillside , which , let 's face it , is the way things were supposed to be all along .

JACK CAFFERTY , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Nice to see you , Suzanne .
Happy Friday .
This may come as a surprise to those of you watching , or maybe it wo n't , the FBI properly and sometimes illegally used the Patriot Act to get personal information about people in the United States .
This is the kind of stuff that happens when the war on terror is used as an excuse to circumvent our civil liberties , which has become the hallmark of the Bush administration .
The Justice Department 's inspector general was looking at the FBI 's use of something called national security letters .
Agents use these to get personal and business information about people from third parties without court orders .
The audit found that for three years , the FBI under reported to Congress how often it used these national security letters , under reported by about 22 percent .
It said in many cases , the FBI was trying to get information it " could have obtained properly " by following other presumably legal guidelines .
The report blames agent error and shoddy reporting for the problems .
The FBI 's director , Robert Mueller , calls the audit report excellent and said he's to blame for not fixing the problems earlier .
Members of Congress want hearings now and some say they want to consider reigning in parts of the Patriot Act , something that is an absolutely wonderful idea that is way , way overdue .
So here 's the question this hour -- does it surprise you that the FBI misused the Patriot Act in order to get personal information about Americans ?
E-mail your thoughts to caffertyfile@cnn.com or go to cnn.com / caffertyfile .
I wonder what they know about you -- Suzanne .
MALVEAUX : Oh , well , let 's keep that to ourselves , Jack .
Who do you think is responsible for all of this ?
Because everybody seems to be saying well , I take part blame .
Who do you blame ?
CAFFERTY : Well , there 's a climate in Washington , beginning with the passage of the Patriot Act and the NSA spying and the trolling through bank records and the trolling through opening people 's mail and all of the other things that have gone on under the guise of the war on terror and keeping us safe that have created , I think , a climate where this kind of thing is -- is sort of , you know , it 's a wink and a nod and you do it the most expedient way possible , whether it 's legal or not , because there 's been no oversight of any of this stuff for the last six years .
And so people have learned that there 's no accountability .
They do n't have to worry about it .
And , you know , they to pretty much whatever they want to do .
It 's -- it 's -- it 's horrible .
But I think there 's , you know , there 's a climate that exists in Washington -- or at least has -- that 's allowed this kind of stuff to take root and grow .
MALVEAUX : Well , hopefully our records are still private , Jack .
CAFFERTY : Well , let 's hope .
Especially the stuff about you and me .
MALVEAUX : Oh my goodness , do n't start any rumors .
No rumors .
No rumors .
CAFFERTY : All right .
At least 32 American troops have been killed in Iraq this month .
Approximately 300 have been wounded .
The “ battle for Baghdad ” is going nowhere .
A Marine friend just back from Ramadi said to me , “ It did n’t get any better while I was there , and it ’s not going to get better . ”
Virtually everyone in Washington , except the people in the White House , knows that is true for all of Iraq .
Actually , I think the White House knows it too .
Why then does it insist on “ staying the course ” at a casualty rate of more than one thousand Americans per month ?
The answer is breathtaking in its cynicism : so the retreat from Iraq happens on the next president ’s watch .
That is why we still fight .
Yep , it ’s now all about George .
Anyone who thinks that is too low , too mean , too despicable even for this bunch does not understand the meaning of the adjective “ Rovian . ”
Would they let thousands more young Americans get killed or wounded just so George W. does not have to face the consequences of his own folly ?
In a heartbeat .
Not that it ’s going to help .
When history finally lifts it leg on the Bush administration , it will wash all such tricks away , leaving only the hubris and the incompetence .
Jeffrey Hart , who with Russell Kirk gone is probably the top intellectual in the conservative movement , has already written that George W. Bush is the worst president America ever had .
I think the honor still belongs to the sainted Woodrow , but if Bush attacks Iran , he may yet earn the prize .
That third and final act in the Bush tragicomedy is waiting in the wings .
A post-election Democratic House , Senate , or both might in theory say no to another war .
But if the Bush administration ’s cynicism is boundless , the Democrats ’ intellectual vacuity and moral cowardice are equally so .
You ca n’t beat something with nothing , but Democrats have put forward nothing in the way of an alternative to Bush ’s defense and foreign policies .
On Iran , the question is whether they will be more scared of the Republicans or of the Israeli lobby .
Either way , they will hide under the bed , just as they have hidden under the bed on the war in Iraq .
It appears at the moment that a congressional demand for withdrawal from Iraq is more likely if the Republicans keep the Senate and Sen. John Warner of Virginia remains chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee than if the Democrats take over .
There is a great deal of material available to the Democrats to offer an alternative , much of it the product of the military reform movement of the 1970s and ’ 80s .
Gary
Hart can tell them all about it .
There is even a somewhat graceful way out of Iraq , if the Dems will ask themselves my favorite foreign policy question , WWBD  What Would Bismarck Do ?
He would transfer sufficient Swiss francs to interested parties so that the current government of Iraq asks us to leave .
They , not we , would then hold the world ’s ugliest baby , even though it was America ’s indiscretion that gave the bastard birth .
But donkeys will think when pigs fly .
A Democratic Congress will be as stupid , cowardly , and corrupt as its Republican predecessor ; in reality , both parties are one party , the party of successful career politicians .
The White House will continue a lost war in Iraq , solely to dump the mess in the next president ’s lap .
America or Israel will attack Iran , pulling what ’s left of the temple down on our heads .
Congress will do nothing to stop either war .
By 2008 , I may not be the only monarchist in America .
In today ’s Firefox 3 ( code name Gran Paradiso ) meeting , developers released a preliminary list of requirements for Firefox 3 .
The new target release date is sometime in the third quarter this year .
Among the list of mandatory requirements , read , what is the most likely to be included in Firefox 3 we have :
Improved interaction with Add-ons : clearer , more coherent language ; less steps to install ; more visible way to configure add - ons , probably to be moved back to the general Options window , which I hope deeply ; more noticeable alerts when updates are available ; a permanent restart Firefox button .
Support for remote bookmarks , bookmarks and history annotation .
Files could be handled by web services .
If I am reading this correctly , this could mean you would be able to click on an attached document and open it with something like Writely or Google Documents .
And perhaps , as I asked Santa , the ability to redirect mailto : links to web email services .
A much needed print support to prevent cut paragraphs and true WYSIWYG .
The much requested MSI installer which will be a much welcomed improvement for IT administrators as it will ease deployment and updating of Firefox across a company .
In the security front : support for Microsoft CardSpace and OpenID ( check tomorrow ’s article for more coverage on this ) .
Smarter credentials handling .
Airbag , the Google backed open source crash reporting tool will replace currently licensed TalkBack .
Among the highly desirable requirements :
A private web browsing mode .
I guess this would mean no cache , history , password or entered form information storage .
Save web pages as PDF files , integrated with history .
That would be just awesome .
Support pause / resume downloads across sessions .
Make Firefox help accessible only while online .
Not sure how good and idea this is .
Microformats support .
Nice to have :
Unified bookmarks / history .
Does this mean no Places ?
Support for Windows Vista parental controls .
I really hope this one goes up in the priority list .
This would be the first concrete downer for Firefox when confronted with Internet Explorer 7 .
Tab grouping and expose .
This sounds like Internet Explorer 7 Quick Tabs or the foxPose extension .
Windows Group Policy .
Another blessing for IT administrators .
Allow add - ons to be installed without rebooting Firefox .
Simplified interface to manage downloads .
Can it be simpler ?
Maybe exposing commands currently placed in the context menu .
You can read the complete Firefox 3 requirements at Mozilla Wiki .
A small biotechnology company has emerged to claim that it invented a seminal technique crucial to biotechnology research .
And the government says it will consider , nearly a quarter - century after the invention was made , whether it awarded the patent to the wrong party .
The United States Patent and Trademark Office has started a proceeding to determine the rightful inventor of the technique , automated DNA sequencing : scientists at the California Institute of Technology , who hold the patent , or those at Enzo Biochem , the small company .
If Enzo were to win the patent rights it could mean significant revenue for the company and could hurt Applied Biosystems , which licenses the patent in question from Caltech and dominates the DNA sequencing business .
Applied Biosystems machines were the main ones used in the Human Genome Project to determine man ’s genetic blueprint .
Applied Biosystems , a unit of Applera , recorded $ 540 million in sales of DNA sequencing machines and chemicals in the fiscal year ended June 30 , accounting for 29 percent of its revenue .
Caltech is estimated to have earned tens of millions of dollars from that and related patents .
I ’m snuggled under the covers with Jon Stewart and the remote .
The “ Evolution / Schmevolution ” skit is funny , but it ’s been a long day , and I ’m fading fast .
The promise of technology is that I ’m one click away from slumberland .
I hit the power button .
The picture disappears , but the TV is still glowing a creepy blue that will haunt my dreams if I do n’t make it go away .
I try the tv button .
Nothing .
The cable button .
Nothing .
What the %$ *&??
I kick off the blankets and trudge over to turn off the miserable box at the source .
I ca n’t help but wonder , as I lie there , now wide awake , how it is that all the things that were supposed to make our lives so easy instead made them more complex .
Why is so much technology still so hard ?

It is innovation ’s biggest paradox :
We demand more and more from the stuff in our lives –more features , more function , more power–and yet we also increasingly demand that it be easy to use .
And , in an Escher - like twist , the technology that ’s simplest to use is also , often , the most difficult to create .
Marissa Mayer lives with that conundrum every day .
As Google ’s director of consumer Web products , she ’s responsible for the search site ’s look and feel .
Mayer is a tall , blond 30 - year - old with two Stanford degrees in computer science and an infectious laugh .
She ’s also Google ’s high priestess of simplicity , defending the home page against all who would clutter it up .
“ I ’m the gatekeeper , ” she says cheerfully .
“ I have to say no to a lot of people . ”
The technology that powers Google ’s search engine is , of course , anything but simple .
In a fraction of a second , the software solves an equation of more than 500 million variables to rank 8 billion Web pages by importance .
But the actual experience of those fancy algorithms is something that would satisfy a Shaker : a clean , white home page , typically featuring no more than 30 lean words ; a cheery , six - character , primary - colored logo ; and a capacious search box .
It could n’t be friendlier or easier to use .
Here is how Mayer thinks about the tension between complexity of function and simplicity of design : “ Google has the functionality of a really complicated Swiss Army knife , but the home page is our way of approaching it closed .
It ’s simple , it ’s elegant , you can slip it in your pocket , but it ’s got the great doodad when you need it .
A lot of our competitors are like a Swiss Army knife open–and that can be intimidating and occasionally harmful . ”
It would be lovely if Google ’s corporate mythology included an enchanting tale to account for the birth of this pristine marvel .
But the original home - page design was dumb luck .
In 1998 , founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were consumed with writing code for their engine .
Brin just wanted to hack together something to send queries to the back end , where the cool technology resided .
Google did n’t have a Web master , and Brin did n’t do HTML .
So he designed as little as he could get away with .
advertisement
The accident became an icon , of course , and a key reason the company enjoys a commanding lead .
Google ’s design has been mimicked on the search pages of MSN and Yahoo , whose portals are messy throwbacks to the “ everything but the kitchen sink ” school of Web design .
But they ’re poor imitations ; according to Hitwise , Google controls 59.2 % of the search market , up from 45 % a year ago ; MSN ’s share is down to 5.5 % and Yahoo ’s is 28.8 % .
No surprise that a site easy enough for a technophobe to use has caught the public imagination .
Like desperate Gullivers , we ’re pinned down by too much information and too much stuff .
By one estimate , the world produced five exabytes ( one quintillion bytes ) of content in 2002 – the same amount churned out between 25,000 b.c. and a.d. 2000 .
Little wonder that Real Simple has been the most successful magazine launch in a decade , and the blogosphere is abuzz over the season ’s hottest tech innovation –the Hipster PDA : 15 index cards held together by a binder clip .
With Google ’s extraordinary trajectory and the stratospheric success of Apple ’s iPod–itself a marvel of simplicity and , with 20 million units sold , a staggering hit–we seem to be nearing a seminal moment .
Whereas endless Sunday Styles stories may have failed to get its attention , the tech industry ’s interest is invariably galvanized by cash .
If the equation T ( technology ) + E ( ease of use ) = $ can be proven , the time may be right for the voice of the technologically challenged who ca n’t operate their remotes to be heard .
In a 2002 poll , the Consumer Electronics Association discovered that 87 % of people said ease of use is the most important thing when it comes to new technologies .
“ Engineers say , ‘ Do you know how much complexity we ’ve managed to build in here ? ’
But consumers say , ‘ I do n’t care .
It ’s just supposed to work ! ’ ” says Daryl Plummer , group vice president at Gartner Group .
It ’s often that tension –between the desire to cram in cool new features and the desire to make a product easy to use –that makes delivering on the simplicity promise so hard , particularly in companies where engineers hold sway .
At Google , it ’s an ongoing battle .
As developers come up with ever sexier services–maps !
news alerts !
scholarly papers !
–the pressure to lard on links is fierce .
Mayer holds them at bay with a smile and strict standards .
To make it to the home page , a new service needs to be so compelling that it will garner millions of page views per day .
Contenders audition on the advanced - search page ; if they prove their mettle–as image search did , growing from 700,000 page views daily to 2 million in two weeks –they may earn a permanent link .
Few make the cut , and that ’s fine .
Google ’s research shows that users remember just 7 to 10 services on rival sites .
So Google offers a miserly six services on its home page .
By contrast , MSN promotes more than 50 , and Yahoo , over 60 .
And both sell advertising off their home pages ; Google ’s is a commercial - free zone .
advertisement
So why do n’t those sites simply hit the delete button and make their home pages more Googlesque ?
Hewing to the simplicity principle , it turns out , is tougher than connecting with tech support , particularly if you try it retrospectively .
“ Once you have a home page like our competitors ’ , ” Mayer says , “ paring it back to look like Google ’s is impossible .
You have too many stakeholders who feel they should be promoted on the home page . ”
( MSN says more than half its customers are happy with its home page–but it ’s experimenting with a sleeker version called “ start.com . ” )
Google understands that simplicity is both sacred and central to its competitive advantage .
Mayer is a specialist in artificial intelligence , not design , but she hits on the secret to her home page ’s success :
“ It gives you what you want , when you want it , rather than everything you could ever want , even when you do n’t . ”
That , says Joe Duffy , founder of the award - winning Minneapolis design firm Duffy & Partners and author of Brand Apart , is a pretty good definition of good design .
He quotes a famous line from the eminent designer Milton Glaser : “ Less is n’t more ; just enough is more . ”
Just enough , says Duffy , contains an aesthetic component that differentiates one experience from another .
It ’s just that holding the line on what constitutes “ just enough ” is harder than it looks .
It ’s early September , and the streets of Cambridge , Massachusetts , are teeming with young technorati in flip - flops and shorts .
But there is calm at the MIT Media Lab , just upstairs from the List Visual Arts Center , the university ’s preeminent gallery .
It ’s a fitting juxtaposition , a place where art and technology seek common ground .
“ I want to figure out how you could combine simplicity , which is basic human life , with this thing–technology – that ’s out of control . ”
John Maeda runs the Media Lab ’s Simplicity Consortium .
His goal is to find ways to break free from the intimidating complexity of today ’s technology and the frustration of information overload .
He is a gentle , soft - spoken man , dressed elegantly in a crisp , white collarless shirt and black pants .
And he is an unusual amalgam : having the mathematical wizardry of a computer geek with the soul of an artist .
Indeed , in 1990 , he left MIT for four years to study art .
“ My whole life changed , ” he says .
“ I thought , This is a great way to live . ”
But rather than throwing over his digital life entirely , he conceived a mission .
“ I came back to MIT to figure out how you could combine simplicity , which is basic human life , with this thing–technology – that ’s out of control . ”

Maeda ’s ability to toggle back and forth between right brain and left affords him unusual insight into how we got stuck in this technological quagmire .
On one level , he says , the problem is simply one of scale .
Before computer technology , small things were simple ; big things were more likely complex .
But the microchip changed that .
Now small things can be complex , too .
But small objects have less room for instruction–so we get cell phones with tip calculators buried deep in submenus and user manuals the size of the Oxford English Dictionary to help us figure it all out .
Blame the closed feedback loop among engineers and industrial designers , who simply can’t conceive of someone so lame that she can’t figure out how to download a ringtone ; blame a competitive landscape in which piling on new features is the easiest way to differentiate products , even if it makes them harder to use ; blame marketers who have n’t figured out a way to make “ ease of use ” sound hip .
“ It ’s easier , ” says Charles Golvin , principal analyst with Forrester Research , “ to market technology than ease of use . ”
Across the river from MIT , in the Boston suburb of West Newton , Aaron Oppenheimer runs the product behavior group of Design Continuum , one of the country ’s preeminent design firms .
He is the sympathetic counselor who gently points out that for each feature clients want to include –
“ Hey , if we ’ve got a microprocessor in there , let ’s add an alarm clock ! ” – they ’re trading off a degree of ease of use .
It ’s a never - ending battle .
“ I spend a lot of time talking clients out of adding features , ” he says with a sigh .
“ Every new feature makes things more complicated , even if you never use them . ”
In the past , he says , adding features usually meant adding costs .
Put a sound system or power windows into a car , and you ’ve upped the price , so you better make sure consumers really want what you ’re peddling .
But in the digital world , that cost - benefit calculus has gone awry .
“ The incremental cost to add 10 features instead of one feature is just nothing , ” says Oppenheimer .
“ Technology is this huge blessing because we can do anything with it , and this huge curse because we can do anything with it . ”
“ The market for simplicity is complex .
If I offer you a VCR with only one button , it ’s not all that exciting , even if when you use it , it ’s likely to be easier . ”
But the issue is also our conflicted relationship with technology .
We want the veneer of simplicity but with all the bells and whistles modern technology can provide .
“ The market for simplicity is complex , ” says Dan Ariely , a business - school professor who is spending a year off from MIT figuring out how to quantify the value of simplicity at Princeton ’s Institute for Advanced Study .
“ If I offer you a VCR with only one button , it ’s not all that exciting , even if when you use it , it ’s likely to be easier . ”
We also want our devices to talk to each other–cell phone to the Web , digital camera to printer .
That requires a level of interoperability that would be difficult to attain in a perfect world , but is well nigh impossible in one where incompatibility is a competitive strategy .
“ In business , it ’s all about war , ” says Maeda .
“ I hate to sound like a hippie , but if there were just some sense of peace and love , products would be much better . ”
advertisement
In his quiet way , Maeda hopes to right the balance between man and machine .
He and his students are working on software , code - named OPENSTUDIO , that would create an “ ecosystem of design ” –connecting designers with customers on a broad scale .
That could lead to bespoke products–a cell phone , for example , with 30 features for Junior , 3 for Gran .
“ You ca n’t make the world simpler unless you can get in touch with design , ” he says , “ and the only way you can do that is to get in touch with designers . ”
How do you make your company ’s products simpler ?
You can start by simplifying your company .
In the late 1990s , Royal Philips Electronics was a slow - footed behemoth whose products , from medical diagnostic imaging systems to electric shavers , were losing traction in the marketplace .
By 2002 , a new CEO , Gerard Kleisterlee , determined that the company urgently needed to address the dynamic global marketplace and become more responsive to consumers ’ changing needs .
Philips deployed researchers in seven countries , asking nearly 2,000 consumers to identify the biggest societal issue that the company should address .
The response was loud and urgent .
“ Almost immediately , we hit on the notion of complexity and its relationship to human beings , ” says Andrea Ragnetti , Philips ’s chief marketing officer .
Consumers told the researchers that they felt overwhelmed by the complexity of technology .
Some 30 % of home - networking products were returned because people could n’t get them to work .
Nearly 48 % of people had put off buying a digital camera because they thought it would be too complicated .
Strategists recognized a huge opportunity : to be the company that delivered on the promise of sophisticated technology without the hassles .
Philips , they said , should position itself as a simple company .
Ragnetti was dumbstruck .
“ I said , ‘ You must be joking .
This is an organization built on complexity , sophistication , brainpower . ’ ” But he and Kleisterlee responded with an even more audacious plan .
Rather than merely retooling products , Philips would also transform itself into a simpler , more market - driven organization .
That initiative has been felt from the highest rungs of the organization to the lowest .
Instead of 500 different businesses , Philips is now in 70 ; instead of 30 divisions , there are 5 .
Even things as prosaic as business meetings have been nudged in the direction of simplicity :
The company now forbids more than 10 slides in any PowerPoint presentation .
Just enough , they decided , was more .
advertisement
The campaign , christened “ Sense and Simplicity , ” required that everything Philips did going forward be technologically advanced–but it also had to be designed with the end user in mind and be easy to experience .
That ideal has influenced product development from conception–each new product , like the ShoqBox , an MP3 mini - boom box , must be based on a user need that ’s tested and validated –to packaging .
Philips invited 15 customers to its Consumer Experience Research Centre in Bruges , Belgium , to see how they unpacked and set up a Flat TV .
After watching people struggle to lift the heavy set from an upright box , designers altered the packaging so the TV could be removed from a carton lying flat on the ground .
While many of the new products have yet to hit the market , early results of the business reorganization , particularly in North America , have been dramatic .
Sales growth for the first half of 2005 was up 35 % , and the company was named Supplier of the Year by Best Buy and Sam ’s Club .
Philips ’s Ambilight Flat TV and GoGear Digital Camcorder won European iF awards for integrating advanced technologies into a consumer - friendly design , and the Consumer Electronics Association handed the company 12 Innovation Awards for products ranging from a remote control to a wearable sport audio player .
Maeda , who , as a member of Philips ’s Simplicity Advisory Board has had a front - row seat for this transformation , is impressed .
“ The best indication of their sincerity is that they ’re embracing the concept at a management level , ” says Maeda .
“ It is n’t just marketing to them .
That ’s quite a radical thing . ”
Designing products that are easy to use is nothing new for Intuit , the big tax - and business - software company .
Indeed , it ’s been the mantra since founder Scott Cook developed Intuit ’s first product , Quicken , back in 1983 after listening to his wife complain about writing checks and managing bills .
But even by Intuit ’s standards , Simple Start , a basic accounting package that debuted in September 2004 , was a leap .
For one thing , the target market was tiny businesses that used no software at all .
“ These were people who said , ‘ I have a simple business , and I do n’t want the complexity of having to learn this .
I do n’t want to use the jargon , I do n’t want the learning curve , and besides , I ’m afraid of it , ’ ” says project manager Terry Hicks .
But the potential was huge : some 9 million microbusiness owners that Intuit was n’t reaching with its current line .
So Hicks ’s team first tried a knockoff of Intuit ’s QuickBooks Basic , with a bunch of features turned off .
Then they confidently took the product out for a test - drive with 100 potential customers .

And it bombed .
It was still too hard to use , still riddled with accounting jargon , still too expensive .
They realized they had to start from scratch .
“ We had to free ourselves and say , ‘ Okay , from an engineering point of view , we ’re going to use this code base , but we need to design it from a customer ’s point of view , ’ ” says Lisa Holzhauser , who was in charge of the product ’s user interface .
The designers followed more customers home .
They heard more complaints about complexity , but also anxiety that things in their business might be falling through the cracks .
So the team distilled two themes that would guide their development :
The product had to be simple , and it had to inspire confidence .
Terms such as “ aging reports ” and “ invoicing ” were edited out , and the designers drew on the experience of the SnapTax division , which had hired an editor from People magazine to help translate accountant - speak into real - world language .
Accounts receivable became “ Money In , ” accounts payable , “ Money Out . ”
They pared back 125 setup screens to three , and 20 major tasks to six essentials .
They spent days worrying about the packaging , knowing that to this audience , something labeled “ Simple Accounting ” was an oxymoron .
Above all , they subjected their work to the demanding standards of Intuit ’s usability lab , run by Kaaren Hanson .
To get a product by her , users must be able , 90 % of the time , to accomplish the tasks deemed most critical .
It ’s a draconian standard .
But “ if our goal was to make it ‘ as easy as we can , ’ ” Hanson says , “ we would n’t be as successful as if we had set a concrete number . ”
The Simple Start team thought they had nailed the user - interface problem after their third iteration of the product got rave reviews for its look and feel .
But task completion results from the lab were dismal .
The launch was delayed for months while the team reengineered the tools until they measured up .
The additional time was worth it .
Simple Start–a product with 15 years of sophisticated QuickBooks code lurking behind an interface even a Luddite could love–sold 100,000 units in its first year on the market .
Even better , reviews from target customers indicate that Intuit hit the mark .
Ken Maples , owner of a tiny flight - instruction school in Cupertino , California , summed it up : “ It ’s easy to use .
It ’s got everything I need and nothing more . ”

Ah . . . just enough .
Good .
Somewhere , Milton Glaser is smiling .
“ TWO YEARS OF SLOW BLEED ” …. I did n’t think anyone overused clauses set off by dashes — like this one — as much as I did , but in his latest column Joe Klein manages to use four in five consecutive sentences .
That ’s impressive .
It ’s going to be hard — though not impossible — for me to top that .
And the column itself ?
Here it is : “ I ’ve tried to be respectful of the man and the office , but the three defining sins of the Bush Administration — arrogance , incompetence , cynicism — are congenital : they ’re part of his personality .
They ’re not likely to change .
And it is increasingly difficult to imagine yet another two years of slow bleed with a leader so clearly unfit to lead . ”
Yeah , we hear you .
Except for a few things .
It ’s not really arrogance , is it ?
More like barroom obstinance .
And not quite cynicism , either .
Closer to partisanship and paranoia gone psychopathic .
And I ’d change “ not likely ” to something a little stronger .
Let ’s say , “ Pigs will orbit Mars before this changes . ”
And finally , that “ difficult to imagine ” part is n’t quite right either .
Unfortunately , it ’s all too easy to imagine .
Other than that , it ’s perfect !
Bush 's top aides say he did not break the law
The New York Times says the National Security Agency was allowed to spy on hundreds of people without warrants .
The NSA is normally barred from eavesdropping within the US .
Republican Senator John McCain called for an explanation , while Senator Arlen Specter , Senate Judiciary Committee chairman , said he would investigate .
" There is no doubt that this is inappropriate , " said Mr Specter , also a Republican , adding that Senate hearings would be held early next year as " a very , very high priority " .
The allegations coincided with a setback for the Bush administration , as the Senate rejected extensions to spying provisions in the Patriot Act .
' Attacks foiled '
The New York Times said Mr Bush signed a secret presidential order following the attacks on 11 September 2001 , allowing the NSA , based at Fort Meade , Maryland , to track the international telephone calls and e-mails of hundreds of people without referral to the courts .
Decisions made are made understanding we have an obligation to protect the civil liberties of the American people
President Bush
Q&A : US spying row
Previously , surveillance on American soil was generally limited to foreign embassies .
Critics have questioned whether wider surveillance in the US crosses constitutional limits on legal searches .
American law usually requires a secret court , known as a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , to give permission before intelligence officers can conduct surveillance on US soil .
' Sea change '
Administration officials refused to confirm or deny details of the New York Times report , but issued a robust defence of anti-terrorist operations , saying they had prevented several attacks - including one on targets in Britain .
In an interview with US TV , Mr Bush said the administration did not discuss ongoing intelligence operations to protect the country .
NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY
Formed in 1952 Biggest US security agency , with 38,000 employees Nicknamed " No Such Agency " Has a dozen listening posts around the world , tracking phone calls , diplomatic traffic , emails , faxes May record up to 500 million hours of traffic every day On US soil , can only listen to " agents of a foreign power "
America 's most powerful spy agency
But he added : " I will make this point .
That whatever I do to protect the American people , and I have an obligation to do so , that we will uphold the law , and decisions made are made understanding we have an obligation to protect the civil liberties of the American people .
" I think the point that Americans really want to know is twofold .
One , are we doing everything we can to protect the people ?
And two , are we protecting civil liberties as we do so ?
And my answer to both is : yes , we are . "
The New York Times said nearly a dozen current and former administration officials had discussed the bugging programme , but that the paper delayed publishing its revelations for a year in response to White House concerns it could jeopardise investigations .
A former senior official who specialises in national security law told the paper that Mr Bush 's move represented a " sea change " .
" It 's almost a mainstay of this country that the NSA only does foreign searches , " said the anonymous source .
" This is Big Brother run amok , " was the reaction of Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy , while his colleague Russell Feingold called it a " shocking revelation " that " ought to send a chill down the spine of every senator and every American " .
Intense concern
The American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) said eavesdropping in the US without a court order and without complying with the procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was " both illegal and unconstitutional " .
" The administration is claiming extraordinary presidential powers at the expense of civil liberties and is putting the president above the law , " director Caroline Fredrickson said .
Senators from both sides have expressed disquiet
To opponents of the Bush administration , the alleged bugging programme is reminiscent of the widespread abuse of power by the security services during the Vietnam War when anti-war activists were monitored illegally , says BBC Washington correspondent Justin Webb .
That activity prompted tougher regulation of bugging .
In a separate development on Friday , the Senate refused to reauthorise provisions of the Patriot Act , extending government surveillance rights .
It is a sign of intense concern about infringements of civil liberties in the name of security , our correspondent says .
The White House is having a tough time convincing even its Republican supporters that the things it does in the name of the war on terrorism are always justified , he adds .

Life coaching may be similar to therapy or counseling , but there is a profound distinction between these two .
Here are some of the relevant differences :
- People who goes to a therapist or a counselor , have problems that they want solved .
A person who goes to a life coach has goals or dreams that he / she wants to achieve .
- Therapy is more about resolving the past .
Life coaching is more about dealing with the present and the future .
- A therapist helps people with mental illness or dysfunctions while a life coach will help able people become even more successful .
There may be distinctions but there are also a few exceptions .
There are some similarities , too , like the solution focused therapy .
This method intends to provide the client with a big picture on how to deal with the present and the future , just like with life coaching .
When Do You Need A Life Coach ?
If you ever had big dreams but do not know how to get to them , then a life coach is just what you need .
A life coach is helpful even for simple personal goals such as sticking to your fitness routine or to your vegetarian diet .
Here are other things that a life coach can help you :
1. Shifting to a career that is geared more to your passion and strengths ,
2. Finding a life partner ,
3 . Looking for a better job ,
4 . Achieving balance between work and life ,
5 . Making transitions in life
6. Improving relationships ,
7. Organizing life ,
8. Overcoming fear ,
9 . Gaining confidence , or
10 . Enjoying life and worrying less .
We may be the experts of our lives .
We know more about who we are , what we want and where we are headed .
But sometimes , even we , the expert , do not recognize what it is that is best for us .
We should be able to acknowledge the need for a professional life coach .
They are the better experts .
They will help you discover that you can be the best that you have always dreamed of .
But life coaching will only have powerful and successful results if these three ( 3 ) factors are present :
– An intent desire to be able to develop your potential to the fullest ;
– A big gap between your current status , where you are , and your intended future , where you want to be ; and
– You are willing to cooperate and take action and ready to take responsibility with the results that you are going to achieve .
So do n’t just dream , because you can truly have a more fulfilling , better and richer life if you seek the help of a life coach !

Creationists , Hitler and Evolution By Lenny Flank ( c ) 1999 Posted April 23 , 2006 A common charge made by creationists is that evolutionary theory is " evil " and is the source of racism in general , and of dictatorial killers in particular .
The most often - heard assertion is that Hitler and his racist genocide were the product of " evolutionary philosophy " .
Henry Morris , for instance , flatly declares , " However one may react morally against Hitler , he was certainly a consistent evolutionst . "
( Morris , " Evolution and Modern racism " , ICR Impact , October 1973 ) Morris adds : " The philosophies of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche -- the forerunners of Stalin and Hitler -- have been particularly baleful in their effect : both were dedicated evolutionists . "
( Morris , Troubled Waters of Evolution , 1974 p. 33 )
How accurate is this creationist finger - pointing ?
Not very .
The creationists are apparently unaware of the fact that Stalinist Russia rejected Darwinian evolution as " bourgeois " and instead embraced the non-Darwinian " proletarian biology " of Lysenko and Michurin ( a disaster from which Russian genetics and biological sciences has still not completely recovered ) .
As for Hitler , even a cursory reading of his book Mein Kampf reveals that the true source of Hitler 's inspiration and exhortations came from a source that creationists , understandably , would rather not talk about .
Hitler 's goal was the " purification " of the " Aryan race " through the elimination of " subhumans " , which included Jews , gypsies , Asians , black Africans , and everyone else who was not a white Aryan .
Despite the creationists claims that this was based on Darwinain evolutionary theory , Hitler 's own writings give quite a different story .
The ICR claims that " Hitler used the German word for evolution ( Entwicklung ) over and over again in his book . "
( ICR Impact , " The Ascent of Racism " , Paul Humber Feb 1987 )
Like so many of ICR 's claims , this one is simply not true -- a quick scan of several online English translations of Mein Kampf shows only ONE use of the word " evolution " , in a context which does not refer at all to biological evolution , but instead to the development of political ideas in Germany : " This evolution has not yet taken the shape of a conscious intention and movement to restore the political power and independence of our nation . "
Had ICR made even a cursory reading of Mein Kampf , they would have seen a quite different source for Hitler 's racist inspiration than the one they would have us believe .
White Aryans , Hitler writes , are the special creations of God , the " highest image of the Lord " , put here specifically to rule over the " subhuman " races : " Human culture and civilization on this continent are inseparably bound up with the presence of the Aryan .
If he dies out or declines , the dark veils of an age without culture will again descend on this globe .
The undermining of the existence of human culture by the destruction of its bearer seems in the eyes of a folkish philosophy the most execrable crime .
Anyone who dares to lay hands on the highest image of the Lord commits sacrilege against the benevolent Creator of this miracle and contributes to the expulsion from paradise . "
( all quotes from Hitler , Mein Kampf , online version ) Actions which aid the " subhumans " at the expense of the Aryan master race , Hitler declared , were an offense against God : " It is a sin against the will of the Eternal Creator if His most gifted beings by the hundreds and hundreds of thousands are allowed to degenerate in the present proletarian morass , while Hottentots and Zulu Kaffirs are trained for intellectual professions . "
Rather than basing his racism on any evolutionary theory , Hitler based it squarely on his view of white Aryans as the favored people of God .
In fact , Hitler solemnly declares that his program of removing Jews and other " subhumans " from the earth is a divine task forced upon him by the Lord Almighty : " What we must fight for is to safeguard the existence and reproductionof our race and our people , the sustenance of our children and the purityof our blood , the freedom and independence of the fatherland , so that our people may mature for the fulfillment of the mission allotted it by the Creator of the universe . "
Hitler concludes : " Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator : by defending myself against the Jew , I am fighting for the work of the Lord , " adding " Compared to the absurd catchword about safeguarding law and order , thus laying a peaceable groundwork for mutual swindles , the task of preserving and advancing the highest humanity , given to this earth by the benevolence of the Almighty , seems a truly high mission . "
For Hitler , removing the subhumans from earth was not a matter of biology or evolution -- it was a divine mandate from God Himself , the " work of the Lord " , a " truly high mission " .
Even in discussing racial purity and " race - mixing " , Hitler chooses not the words of evolutionary biology or eugenics , but points instead to his divinely holy mission : " Historical experience offers countless proofs of this .
It shows with terrifying clarity that in every mingling of Aryan blood with that of lower peoples the result was the end of the cultured people .
North America , whose population consists in by far the largest part of Germanic elements who mixed but little with the lower colored peoples , shows a different humanity and culture from Central and South America , where the predominantly Latin immigrants often mixed with the aborigines on a large scale .
By this one example , we can clearly and distinctly recognize the effect of racial mixture .
The Germanic inhabitant of the American continent , who has remained racially pure and unmixed , rose to be master of the continent ; he will remain the master as long as he does not fall a victim to defilement of the blood .
The result of all racial crossing is therefore in brief always the following :
To bring about such a development is , then , nothing else but to sin against the will of the Eternal Creator . "
The goal of the " folkish government " , then , Hitler declares is to " finally to put an end to the constant and continuous original sin of racial poisoning , and to give the Almighty Creator beings such as He Himself created . "
" The folkish - minded man , in particular , " Hitler concludes , " has the sacred duty , each in his own denomination , of making people stop just talking superficially of God 's will , and actually fulfill God 's will , and not let God 's word be desecrated .
For God 's will gave men their form , their essence and their abilities .
Anyone who destroys
His work is declaring war on the Lord 's creation , the divine will . "
In Mein Kampf , Hitler makes an emotional appeal to God to aid him and his Nazis in their divine task : " Then , from the child 's story - book to the last newspaper in the country , and every theatre and cinema , every pillar where placards are posted and every free space on the hoardings should be utilized in the service of this one great mission , until the faint - hearted cry , " Lord , deliver us , " which our patriotic associations send up to Heaven to - day would be transformed into an ardent prayer : ' Almighty God , bless our arms when the hour comes . ' " Later , when Nazi troops swarmed over Europe , each of them wore an army - issue belt buckle inscribed with the words " God is With Us " .
The invocation of God and the Bible in support of racism continues with modern hate groups in the US .
Aryan Nations , which also calls itself the Church of Jesus Christ Christian , begins its web site by proclaiming " Praise Yahweh " and its intention to " serve the Lord of Glory and His Holy Race " .
The American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan note that only those of " Christian faith " can be members , and asks every new recruit " Do you believe in Jesus Christ ? "
The White Camelia Knights of the Ku Klux Klan declare that " at some point God 's people must take action in the defense of our Christian , racial and political beliefs " .
The Camelia KKK website also explicitly states " We base our beliefs on our Biblical interpretations , not ignorance , superstition or blind hatred . "
How does the Camelia KKK justify its opposition to " race - mixing " ?
" White Christian Israelites are under God 's law and covenant .
The other peoples of the earth are under nature 's law , which God also created .
. .
Nature 's law , which is a creation of YAHWEH , dictates that kind reproduce after kind .
The different people of the world were never supposed to mix . "
The Imperial Klans of America declares , " We are a gathering of White Christian men and women . "
The National Knights of the Ku Klux Klan website declares that they " reverently acknowledge the majesty and supremacy of Almighty God and recognize his goodness and providence through his Son Jesus Christ .
We avow the distinction between the races of mankind as decreed by the Lord our God , and we shall ever be true to the maintenance of His Supremacy . "
None of these racist websites mentions " Darwin " or " evolution " as a justification for any of their beliefs .
All of them talk about " God " and " The Creator " instead .

Montana pardons 1918 sedition law victims
2006-05-03 04:00:00 PDT
Helena , Mont. --
When Steve Milch found out recently that his great - grandfather , an immigrant from Bavaria , had been convicted of sedition in Montana during World War I , he was amazed .
It was something no one in the family had ever talked about .
For the past 88 years , a lot of secrets have been kept in Montana families , especially those of German descent , about a flurry of wartime sedition prosecutions in 1918 , when public sentiment against Germany was at a feverish pitch .
Seventy - nine Montanans were convicted under the state law , considered among the harshest in the country , for speaking out in ways deemed critical of the United States .
In one instance , a traveling wine and brandy salesman was sentenced to seven to 20 years in prison for calling wartime food regulations a " big joke . "
But the silence -- and for some families , the shame -- has ended .
The convictions will be undone today when Gov. Brian Schweitzer , a descendant of ethnic Germans who migrated to Montana from Russia in 1909 , posthumously pardons 75 men and three women .
One man was pardoned shortly after the war .
Forty - one of those convicted , including one woman , went to prison on sentences from one to 20 years and paid fines from $ 200 to $ 20,000 .
" I 'm going to say what Gov. Sam Stewart should have said , " Schweitzer said , referring to the man who signed the sedition legislation into law in 1918 .
" I 'm sorry , forgive me , and God bless America , because we can criticize our government . "
Dozens of relatives of the convicted seditionists will be at the State Capitol to witness the signing of the pardons , with some traveling from as far as Florida .
Milch said the official acknowledgment , even after so many years , offers comfort and closure to the families .
" The whole Milch clan is appreciative of making things right , " he said .
The pardon ceremony is the result of a book by Clemens Work , director of graduate studies at the University of Montana School of Journalism , called " Darkest Before Dawn : Sedition and Free Speech in the American West " ( University of New Mexico Press , 2005 ) .
The book chronicled a contentious period in Montana history when people were convicted and jailed for voicing their opinion about the war .
" It was an ugly time , " Work said .
The sedition law , which made it a crime to say or publish anything " disloyal , profane , violent , scurrilous , contemptuous or abusive " about the government , soldiers or the American flag , was unanimously passed by the Legislature in February 1918 .
It expired when the war ended , Work said .
During that time , though Germans were the largest ethnic group in Montana , it was also illegal to speak German , and books written in it were banned .
Local groups called third - degree committees were formed to ferret out people not supportive of the war .
Officials encouraged neighbor to inform on neighbor , and one person 's accusation was often enough for an arrest .
Twenty - seven states had sedition laws during World War I. Montana 's became the template for a federal law , enacted by Congress later in 1918 .
Work and other historians believe that the harshness of the Montana law was influenced by the Anaconda Copper Mining Co. , which dominated the state economically and viewed the law as a way to deal with labor unrest .
But blame should also be laid at the feet of Stewart , Work said .
" In the last 100 days of his term , he commuted 50 sentences , including 13 murders and seven rapists , " he said , " but not a single seditionist . "
Exoplanets
Planets
Everyone knows what a planet is .
Or at least so we thought until last year .
For the last 76 years we have had nine planets in our solar system ; every schoolchild has learnt this as an absolute fact .
But the truth is that there has never been a precise definition of exactly what a planet is .
Times change though , and in a very well publicised meeting of the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , in August 2006 , a formal definition of a planet was created .
To qualify as a planet the celestial body must :
be in orbit around a star .
be of sufficient mass that the body 's self - gravity has overcome the rigid body forces of the body 's matter and formed a hydrostatic equilibrium ( that is , the body is nearly spherical ) .
have cleared its orbital neighbourhood of other celestial bodies ( or captured them as moons ) .
The new category created by the IAU is Dwarf Planet .
Like Planets , these must also meet the first two criteria above but not the third .
Pluto falls into this new category , as do Ceres ( in the asteroid belt ) and Eris ( the Trans - Neptunian body initially known as 2003 UB313 , and informally as " Xena " ) .
So now everyone knows we have just eight planets .
But this is not exactly true , or at least not if you are willing to look outside the Earth 's own Solar System , and consider Exoplanets ( or Extrasolar Planets ) .
In fact just over a month before the IAU removed Pluto 's planetary status , the count of planets orbiting other stars had reached 200 with an announcement in The Astrophysical Journal ( July 20 , 2006 ) of five new Extrasolar Planets .
The History of Exoplanet Detection
Astronomers have been looking for planets orbiting other stars since the mid-nineteenth century , but all claims of planets orbiting stars including 70 Ophiuchi and Barnard 's Star , all having been later shown to be due to observational errors .
All this changed in the late 1980s , or the early 1990s depending upon your point of view .
1988 saw a group of Canadian Astronomers ( Campbell , Walker and Yang ) make a rather cautious announcement of an Extrasolar Planet orbiting around Gamma Cephei ( Alrai ) .
Their announcement met with a sceptical response from the astronomical world , mainly due to the fact that the observations had been made at the very limit of the equipment being used .
In fact , it was n't until 2003 when improved technology and techniques confirmed the team 's original results .
So although the planet orbiting Gamma Cephei was the first to be announced , the long delay until its confirmation effectively handed the honour of the first detection over to two other astronomers - Canadian Dale Frail and Pole Aleksander Wolszczan .
In 1992 they discovered two planets around a pulsar , PSR B1257+12 .
This was confirmed in short order , and so mankind had conclusively discovered a planet orbiting another star .
This discovery was not entirely expected .
PSR 1257+12 is a pulsar - a type of star previously not considered a candidate for having planets .
Pulsars are rotating neutron stars , the remnants of supernovas .
It had previously been believed that such stellar explosions would destroy any planets in orbit around the star .
Three years after this , in October 1995 , the first discovery of a planet around a main sequence star was made .
Two astronomers ( Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz ) of the University of Geneva detected a planet around 51 Pegasi , a very Sun - like star fifty light years from Earth .
This planet , 51 Pegasi b ( these planets are designated in order of detection , not distance from the parent star - with the letter " a " reserved for the parent star ) is not a likely candidate for life , however .
Like the other early Extrasolar Planets detected it is a large world ( in our solar system it would be a close second to Jupiter in terms of size ) and it orbits very close to its star causing it to have a high surface temperature around 1200 degrees Centigrade .
It has been given the informal nickname " Bellerophon " .
Methods of Detection
Campbell , Walker and Yang 's 1988 detection was made using a technique known as Radial Velocity ( or the Doppler Effect ) .
By analysing the Doppler Shifts in the spectral lines emitted by the star , slight variations in the speed ( relative to Earth ) can be detected .
Variations like this can only be explained due to the gravitational effects of other celestial bodies and the technique has , so far , proven the most productive of all the Extrasolar Planet detection methods .
Mayor and Queloz used a technique known as Pulsar Timing Variations to discover their planets .
Pulsars emit extremely regular radio waves as they rotate .
Variations in the frequency of these emissions can be proven to be the effect of orbiting planets .
Over the years , as technology has improved , new techniques have been developed and there are now many methods of detecting Extrasolar Planets .
When one star is directly in front of a more distant star from the perspective of an observer on Earth , the gravitational field of the front star can act like a lens , causing the far star to be magnified .
Any planets orbiting the nearer star can be detected due to their effect on this magnification .
Astrometry is the technique of measuring the exact position and path of movement of a star , and examining the movement for perturbations caused by gravity fields from nearby planets .
Periodic variations in the brightness of stars can be proven to be due to planets passing in front of the star ( from our point of view ) , obscuring some of the light and causing the star to appear dimmer .
If this dimming happens regularly , the only cause is an orbiting body .
A further technique involves analysing disks of dust surrounding stars .
These disks absorb some of the star 's light , and then re-emit this energy as infrared radiation .
Features in these disks can suggest the presence of planetary sized bodies .
The Chances of Life
The majority of Exoplanets detected thus far have been orbiting Sun - like stars .
A main reason for this is that one goal of the work is to discover an Earth - like world , so programmes have been concentrating on similar stars .
However , there is also good reason to concentrate on these stars .
Large stars ( tens of times larger than our Sun ) emit so much radiation that they inhibit planetary formation .
Smaller dwarf stars are believed less likely to have planets , and it is generally believed that these planets will be smaller than current detection methods can discover .
Given that planets have now been detected around multiple star binary systems ( another environment thought not to be likely homes to planets ) this narrowness of search may well need to be expanded .
Although the majority of the search is concentrated on Sun - like stars , our currently available technology and detection methods are not capable of finding other Earths out there .
Up to February 2007 the vast majority of the 200 + discovered Exoplanets are Gas Giants , often greater in size and mass than Jupiter .
This is to be expected , for these will produce much greater anomalies than rocky planets could .
The smallest Exoplanet discovered orbiting a main sequence star is OGLE - 2005 - BLG - 390Lb .
At a mere 5.5 times the mass of the Earth , it orbits its parent star at 2.6 times the Earth - Sun distance .
As the majority of Extrasolar Planets orbit very close to their star , this makes this body the most Earth - like world we know about .
So what do these discoveries mean for the chances of life out there ?
They do prove that planetary formation is not uncommon .
There are a number of other criteria that are believed to be necessary for life to develop .
But given the fact that planets are being detected that are comparable to the size of Earth , orbiting similar stars to our own Sun at Earth - like distances , the chances are looking good .

DICK CHENEY has never been a great fan of open government .
His staff refuse to reveal how many people work in his office , let alone what they do there .
He went to court to keep the membership of his energy commission secret .
You can find the White House and the Pentagon on Google Earth .
But the vice - president 's official residence is pixellated out .
Which makes the trial of Mr Cheney 's former chief of staff , Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , all the more notable .
The defence finally decided against calling Mr Cheney to testify .
But nevertheless the trial , which is now reaching its final stages , has cast a rare shaft of light on the vice - president 's dark world .
His handwritten notes have been projected on giant screens .
His bureaucratic fingerprints have been examined in the smallest detail .
It has always been clear that Mr Cheney is an exceptionally powerful vice - president .
He has the largest vice - presidential staff in history ( an estimated 14 national security advisers compared with Al Gore 's four , for example ) , and vassals in most branches of government .
But the trial has given a sense of how that power operates on a day - to - day basis .
The two characteristics that have emerged most clearly are ruthlessness and obsessive attention to detail .
Mr Cheney was clearly determined to punish Joseph Wilson for casting doubt on some of the administration 's claims about WMD .
( Mr Wilson wrote an article in the New York Times claiming that , during an official visit to Niger in 2002 , he had found no evidence that Saddam Hussein had tried to purchase nuclear material from the country . )
And from the moment he cut Mr Wilson 's article out of the New York Times and scrawled notes all over it , Mr Cheney devoted a striking amount of energy to the administration 's offensive against him .
According to Mr Libby and a former PR aide , he dictated talking points for press officers to use .
He discussed the case several times a day with Mr Libby , told him to deal directly with selected reporters , and instructed him to leak a sensitive document .
Mr Libby 's leaks are what landed him in trouble : he disclosed that Mr Wilson 's wife , Valerie Plame , was a CIA agent , which is potentially a crime , though he is being tried not for that but for giving misleading evidence when questioned .
Why was Mr Cheney so obsessed with Mr Wilson ?
Mr Wilson was a retired ambassador who had been peddling the story of his trip to Niger around town for months .
Mr Cheney 's office had difficulty in getting chosen reporters to tune into its arguments ; indeed , but for Mr Cheney worrying at it like a dog at a bone , Mr Wilson 's article would have been long forgotten .
One possible explanation is that Mr Cheney knew that the administration 's claims about WMD were false .
But it seems unlikely .
Mr Cheney continued to argue that Saddam possessed WMD long after Mr Bush had backed down .
His problem was not that he was lying , but that he was so convinced that Saddam possessed WMD that he could not see evidence to the contrary .
The other , more probable , explanation is that Mr Cheney was engaged in a personal vendetta , and that this was vicious inside - the - Beltway politics , not grand trickery .
Indeed , one of the most striking things about the trial is that it demonstrates just how much of a creature of Washington Mr Cheney really is .
He may present himself as a plain - spoken son of Wyoming who eventually went on to become the no-nonsense CEO of a global company .
But in reality he is the quintessential Washingtonian .
He started his career as a failed academic , dropping out of Yale after a few terms and never completing his PhD at the University of Wisconsin .
But he flourished when he came to Washington : attracting the attention of Donald Rumsfeld , rapidly climbing the greasy pole , and becoming Gerald Ford 's chief of staff at the age of 34 .
He had found his perfect milieu .
Conspiring and manoeuvring
During his years as an insider he has acquired the typical habits of mind of veteran Washingtonians : an obsession with spin and gossip , including an over - inflated sense of the importance of newspaper articles ; a hyper - sensitive nose for threats ; and , it would appear , a determination to destroy his enemies by whatever means necessary .
He began his career in the White House by conspiring with Donald Rumsfeld to sideline the vice - president , Nelson Rockefeller , and to rein in Henry Kissinger ( who then combined the jobs of secretary of state and head of the National Security Council ) .
If Mr Libby 's evidence is anything to go by , he has been conspiring and manoeuvring ever since .
It was also during the Ford administration that Mr Cheney seems to have acquired a profound distrust of the CIA .
He became convinced that the CIA was underestimating the Soviet military build - up .
He lent his support to something called “ Team B ” , a group of foreign - policy experts who made it their business to second - guess the CIA over the Soviet threat .
Mr Cheney 's distrust of the CIA grew even stronger in the 1990s , when he concluded that the agency had misjudged Saddam 's military capabilities in the run-up to the first Gulf war .
He relied on his own intelligence sources — the latter - day equivalent of Team B — and made repeated visits to the CIA headquarters in Langley to interrogate officers there on their intelligence .
Mr Wilson was thus a ready - made target for Mr Cheney : an Iraq war sceptic who had been sent to Niger by a notoriously soft agency and who tried to ventilate his views in the newspapers .
All this still leaves the biggest question unanswered .
Where did Mr Cheney get his fervour from ?
The average Washington insider is a consummate trimmer .
Mr Cheney comes across as a man firmly in the grip of an ideology .
It will take more than the Scooter Libby trial to explain him fully .
But at least Americans have learned a little bit more about the power behind King George 's throne .
In one sense it is perhaps just as well that it was British , rather than American , sailors and marines who were taken prisoner .
If they had been Americans , the rump of neoconservatives in the Bush administration , in particular Dick Cheney and Elliott Abrams , would have been saying : " We told you so . "
They have long argued that Iran is not susceptible to diplomatic pressure , that the European approach is doomed to failure and the only way to stop Iran acquiring a nuclear - weapons capability is a military strike on its nuclear facilities .
Even though the prisoners are British rather than Americans , neocons have been desperate to head for television studios .
The only reason they have not done so yet is a request by the British government to the Bush administration to stay out of it .
Word has also reached members of Congress .
The British fear is that even a mild rebuke from President George Bush , or a neoconservative such as John Bolton , will be counterproductive , escalating the crisis and making it harder to get the 15 back .
Tony Blair is well aware of the battle lines in Washington and , hopefully , will keep this at the top of his mind during the crisis .
He is in a hard place this weekend .
He is , understandably , under pressure from the public and parliament to do something amid a sense of outrage that Iran not only captured the group , but denied them consular access and paraded them on television .
To address these concerns Mr Blair has made the necessary strident noises .
But he has to resist more hysterial voices .
Throughout his premiership the British government has consistently opted for negotiation with Iran to try to resolve the nuclear issue , not military action .
And now , after years in which the US refused to participate , the British government has serious allies in Washington .
The US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and the defence secretary , Robert Gates , are pursuing engagement and are prepared to talk to Tehran .
The duo are in the ascendancy in Washington while the Cheney - Abrams alliance is temporarily relegated to the sidelines .
Ms Rice and Mr Gates think their approach is working , that there are signs of anxiety in Tehran over sanctions and other economic measures , as well as the diplomatic pressure .
They argue that Iran is not like North Korea , and that it does not want to be isolated .
How Mr Blair handles the present crisis could crucially impact on this internal Washington debate .
Mr Blair has options .
The prime minister , who has a genuine dislike of and concern about the Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , could still ask Washington to set the drums beating .
That would suit Mr Cheney and Mr Abrams .
At this stage such an approach , thankfully , seems unlikely .
Alternatively Mr Blair could have opted for a quieter approach , choosing discreet , bilateral discussions , but was advised that this would not work .
Instead he has opted for a middle route , internationalising the crisis , seeking the help of other countries to put pressure on Tehran .
Countries in Europe and the Middle East have been helpful : the United Nations security council less so .
Servicemen taken by Iran in 2004 were quickly released .
The background is tenser now .
Iran 's Revolutionary Guard , which is holding the 15 , has suffered a series of setbacks in recent months , from the capture of six members of its Quds brigade in Iraq through to the defection of a senior commander to the west .
British pressure applied through its allies may not have much impact on the Revolutionary Guard , but it will influence the foreign ministry and perhaps even Iran 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .
It could take a while for Britain to secure the release of the sailors and marines .
In the meantime Mr Blair has to placate the British public .
But he must also show patience and do nothing that will undermine Ms Rice and Mr Gates .
' In the endgame , " said one of the world 's best - ever chess players , José Raúl Capablanca , " do n't think in terms of moves but in terms of plans . "
The situation in Iraq is now unravelling into the bloodiest endgame imaginable .
Both popular and official support for the war in those countries that ordered the invasion is already at a low and will only get lower .
Whatever mandate the occupiers may have once had from their own electorates - in Britain it was none , in the US it was precarious - has now eroded .
They can no longer conduct this war as they have been doing .
Simultaneously , the Iraqis are no longer able to live under occupation as they have been doing .
According to a UN report released last week , 3,709 Iraqi civilians died in October - the highest number since the invasion began .
And the cycle of religious and ethnic violence has escalated over the past week .
The living flee .
Every day up to 2,000 Iraqis go to Syria and another 1,000 to Jordan , according to the UN's high commissioner for refugees .
Since the bombing of Samarra 's Shia shrine in February more than 1,000 Iraqis a day have been internally displaced , a recent report by the UN - affiliated International Organisation for Migration found last month .
Those in the west who fear that withdrawal will lead to civil war are too late - it is already here .
Those who fear that pulling out will make matters worse have to ask themselves : how much worse can it get ?
Since yesterday American troops have been in Iraq longer than they were in the second world war .
When the people you have " liberated " by force are no longer keen on the " freedom " you have in store for them , it is time to go .
Any individual moves announced from now on - summits , reports , benchmarks , speeches - will be ignored unless they help to provide the basis for the plan towards withdrawal .
Occupation got us here ; it can not get us out .
Neither Tony Blair nor George Bush is in control of events any longer .
Both domestically and internationally , events are controlling them .
So long as they remain in office they can determine the moves ; but they have neither the power nor the credibility to shape what happens next .
So the crucial issue is no longer whether the troops leave in defeat and leave the country in disarray - they will - but the timing of their departure and the political rationale that underpins it .
For those who lied their way into this war are now trying to lie their way out of it .
Franco - German diplomatic obstruction , Arab indifference , media bias , UN weakness , Syrian and Iranian meddling , women in niqabs and old men with placards - all have been or surely will be blamed for the coalition 's defeat .
As one American columnist pointed out last week , we wait for Bush and Blair to conduct an interview with Fox News entitled If We Did It , in which they spell out how they would have bungled this war if , indeed , they had done so .
So , just as Britain allegedly invaded for the good of the Iraqis , the timing of their departure will be conducted with them in mind .
The fact that - according to the foreign secretary , Margaret Beckett - it will coincide with Blair leaving office in spring is entirely fortuitous .
More insidious is the manner in which the Democrats , who are about to take over the US Congress , have framed their arguments for withdrawal .
Last Saturday the newly elected House majority leader , Steny Hoyer , suggested that the Americans would pull out because the Iraqis were too disorganised and self - obsessed .
" In the days ahead , the Iraqis must make the tough decisions and accept responsibility for their future , " he said .
" And the Iraqis must know : our commitment , while great , is not unending . "
It is absurd to suggest that the Iraqis - who have been invaded , whose country is currently occupied , who have had their police and army disbanded and their entire civil service fired - could possibly be in a position to take responsibility for their future and are simply not doing so .
For a start , it implies that the occupation is a potential solution when it is in fact the problem .
This seems to be one of the few things on which Sunni and Shia leaders agree .
" The roots of our problems lie in the mistakes the Americans committed right from the beginning of their occupation , " Sheik Ali Merza , a Shia cleric in Najaf and a leader of the Islamic Dawa party , told the Los Angeles Times last week .
" Since the beginning , the US occupation drove Iraq from bad to worse , " said Harith al - Dhari , the nation 's most prominent Sunni cleric , after he fled to Egypt this month facing charges of supporting terrorism .
Also , it leaves intact the bogus premise that the invasion was an attempt at liberation that has failed because some squabbling ingrates , incapable of working in their own interests , could not grasp the basic tenets of western democracy .
In short , it makes the victims responsible for the crime .
Withdrawal , when it happens , will be welcome .
But its nature and the rationale given for it are not simply issues of political point - scoring .
They will lay the groundwork for what comes next for two main reasons .
First , because , while withdrawal is a prerequisite for any lasting improvement in Iraq , it will not by itself solve the nation 's considerable problems .
Iraq has suffered decades of colonial rule , 30 years of dictatorship and three years of military occupation .
Most recently , it has been trashed by a foreign invader .
The troops must go .
But the west has to leave enough resources behind to pay for what it broke .
For that to happen , the anti-war movement in the west must shift the focus of our arguments to the terms of withdrawal while explaining why this invasion failed and our responsibilities to the Iraqi people that arise as a result of that failure .
If we do n't , we risk seeing Bono striding across airport tarmac 10 years hence with political leaders who demand good governance and democratic norms in the Gulf , as though Iraq got here by its own reckless psychosis .
Eviscerated of history , context and responsibility , it will stand somewhere between basket case and charity case : like Africa , it will be misunderstood as a sign not of our culpability but of our superiority .
Second , because unless we understand what happened in Iraq we are doomed to continue repeating these mistakes elsewhere .
Ten days ago , during a visit to Hanoi , Bush was asked whether Vietnam offered any lessons .
He said : " We tend to want there to be instant success in the world , and the task in Iraq is going to take a while ...
We 'll succeed unless we quit . "
In other words , the problem with Vietnam was not that the US invaded a sovereign country , bombed it to shreds , committed innumerable atrocities , murdered more than 500,000 Vietnamese - more than half of whom were civilians - and lost about 58,000 American servicemen .
The problem with Vietnam was that they lost .
And the reason they lost was not because they could neither sustain domestic support nor muster sufficient local support for their invasion , nor that their military was ill equipped for guerrilla warfare .
They lost because it takes a while to complete such a tricky job , and the American public got bored .
" You learn more from a game you lose than a game you win , " argued the chess great Capablanca .
True , but only if you heed the lessons and then act on them .

ruby - tour A Quick Tour of Ruby
Stevey 's Drunken Blog Rants ™ Ruby used to annoy me simply by existing .
I first heard about Ruby years ago , in maybe 1997 or 1998 , and folks said it was kind of like Perl , but " cleaner " , whatever that meant .
Ruby fans back then seemed like a tiny minority of rebels and fringe separatists .
Ruby irked me primarily because we already had Perl , which was working just fine thank you very much .
And if for some strange reason you did n't like Perl , we had Python .
If Perl fans were dog owners , and Python fans were cat owners , then Ruby fans seemed like ferret owners .
They could go on and on about how much they adored their beady - eyed albino stretch - limo rats , and how cute they were , but we all knew they were just looking for attention .
Nobody really wants a pet rat .
( Ferret owners will correct me and say they 're not rodents ; they 're more closely related to weasels and skunks .
As if that helps . )
Regardless , I did n't want to have anything to do with Ruby .
Last year , though , I was looking at a bunch of different languages in the hopes of finding one to replace Perl for small - to medium - sized tasks .
One day my magic
Perl dust had worn off rather suddenly , and I 'd joined the growing ranks of people who were beginning to notice the emperor was a wee bit underdressed .
But all the alternatives to Perl looked pretty bad themselves , and I started judging languages by how far I 'd get into the reference manual before throwing it across the room .
I eventually picked up a Ruby book -- I think it might have been the O'Reilly " Ruby in a Nutshell " by Ruby 's author , Yukihiro " Matz " Matsumoto .
To my lasting surprise , I made it all the way through , occasionally even pounding the table and saying " Now THAT is the right way to do that !
Finally ! " ( I know .
Loony . )
Within about 3 days , I was more comfortable with Ruby than seven years had made me with Perl .
I was still accidentally sticking " my " in front of variable declarations , typing " sub " instead of " def " , little things like that .
But I was already starting to think in Ruby , and suddenly I had all this extra space in my brain .
You have to learn Perl by memorizing , but you learn Ruby by understanding .
Within a month or two , I 'd totally given up on Perl .
My Ruby programs were shorter , clearer , and more fun to write .
Everything I 'd actually liked about Perl was there in Ruby , and I realized there was a lot of crufty old legacy baggage in Perl that it was never going to lose .
Nowadays I can't look at a Perl program without snickering ; there 's so much suffocating boilerplate junk in there .
And I feel for folks who still have to write in it .
Going from Perl to Ruby is as big a step in expressive power as going from C++ to Java .
I still like dogs and cats , but I 'm starting to think ferrets might not be so bad .
Experimenting With Ruby
There 's no way to cover a language decently in a short article like this one , so I 'll just highlight a few things I particularly like about Ruby .
If it 's not enough to convince you to take a look , no worries .
It 'll still be around next year .
The place to start getting to know Ruby in the " irb " interactive Ruby session .
It comes with the standard Ruby distribution .
I usually run it inside an Emacs buffer with M-x run-ruby .
To do this , you need to download inf - ruby.el and ruby - mode.el from the Ruby website , and put them in your Emacs load path somewhere .
There are some instructions on the site .
If you do n't want to run it in Emacs , start up a Unix shell and type " irb " to get a prompt .
There 's an Eclipse plugin for editing Ruby source code , but you still have to run irb in a shell .
Ruby 's interactive session is an example of a REPL , or " Read Eval Print Loop " .
Most popular languages these days have a repl of some sort : Common Lisp , Scheme , Ruby , Tcl , Haskell and OCaml all ship with very good ones as part of the language distribution .
Python 's is also good but a bit annoying , since you have to indent every line manually when entering multi-line expressions .
Perl has an OK - ish one .
Just type " perl - d " to enter the Perl debugger , followed by Ctrl -d for the program , and then do n't use the " my " modifier on your variables .
And do n't hit Ctrl - C Ctrl - D or it spins into an unrecoverable infinite loop .
( Perl lovers , I 'm sure , will be happy to have this new set of weird things to memorize . )
For JavaScript your best bet is to use Rhino , Mozilla 's implementation of JavaScript in Java .
It comes with an interpreter shell .
For Java , you have lots of options , since most of the languages above have been " ported " to the JVM .
The most popular REPL for Java is probably BeanShell , which provides a language that 's very close to the Java language .
There 's even a REPL for C and C++ called CINT .
Go figure .
REPLs are amazingly useful .
Once you get used to them , you 'll never want to code without one again .
They 're a bit like an interactive debugger - you can evaluate expressions , set variables , call functions , define classes , and generally just tinker with things safely .
If you 're not sure what a particular line of code will do , just enter it into the REPL and see .
Some REPLs are friendlier than others .
Perl 's is definitely the worst , but it 's really more of a debugger than a REPL .
Ruby 's is very friendly .
Just type " irb " to enter it , " quit " to leave it , and enter expressions or statements at the prompt to have them evaluated .
Using IRB
In Ruby , all data types are first - class objects , so you can use irb to ask any object what its methods are .
And that 's pretty useful .
For instance , if you want to see the methods available on arrays , you type : irb( main ) : 009:0 > [ ] . methods and the interpreter responds with : => [ " send " , " rindex " , " reject " , " reject ! " , " [ ] = " , " flatten " , " pop " , " < < " , " & " , ...]
The names of all the methods on an array object come back in an arbitrary order .
I 've truncated the list above , but the list actually had 118 methods in it , which I figured out by typing : irb( main ) : 010:0 > [ ].methods.size
=> 118 The " methods " method ( available on all Ruby objects , since it 's defined in the base class , Object ) returns the method names in an array , so you can easily get a sorted list back instead .
Here we get the first 11 sorted method names from the Array class : irb( main ) : 015:0 > [ ].methods.sort[0..10 ]
= > [ " & " , " * " , " + " , " - " , " < < " , " < = > " , " == " , " === " , " =~ " , " [ ] " , " [ ] = " ]
Ruby lets you omit parens if you 're invoking a method with no arguments , so a no-arg method invocation looks just like a field access , and you can chain them : foo.bar.baw.baz .
Working with Collections
We work with collections all the time .
It 's hard to imagine a useful program that does n't do at least some work with them .
Lists , stacks , queues , hashtables , trees , graphs , sets , bit vectors , tuples , multimaps , result sets -- these are all collection types .
Even Strings are collections of characters , although most languages make it inconvenient to treat them that way , as last month 's String Permutations problem demonstrated .
So one of the most important features of a language is how easy and consistent it makes working with collections .
Regardless of the other merits of the language , this one aspect probably has the biggest impact on your day - to - day programming .
To a large extent , it determines how pleasant it is to work in the language .
To illustrate , let 's pick a random simple problem .
How about if we write a program that will print out all the words in the dictionary starting with the letter ' Q ' ( case - insensitive ) , grouped by increasing length , and sorted alphabetically within each group .
So the output would look something like this : Words of length 3 :
qua
quo
Words of length 4 :
quad
quay
quip
quit
quiz
Words of length 5 :
Qatar
Quinn
Quito
quack
...
Words of length 15 :
quantifications
It 's a pretty straightforward problem , so you 'd hope that the code would also be straightforward .
And in Ruby , it is :
It 's a pretty straightforward problem , so you 'd hope that the code would also be straightforward .
And in Ruby , it is : # !/usr/bin/ruby
words = [ ]
IO .readlines ( " /usr/share /dict / words " ) .each do |word |
words << word.chomp if word.downcase [ 0 ] == ?
q
end
max = - 1
words.sort_by{|a| [ a.length , a ] }.each do |word |
if word.
length > max
max = word.
length
puts " Words of length #{max} :"
end
puts " # {word} "
end
It 's a very short program , but it 's especially short because Ruby lets you specify an array of fields to sort on in your collection .
I 've highlighted that array in magenta above .
It specifies that the " words " array should be sorted first on word length , then on the word itself ( which defaults , as in Java , to alphabetical order . )
A corresponding Java program would be about 4 times longer : import java . io .*;
import java .
util .*;
public class QWords {
public static void main ( String [ ] args ) throws IOException {
List < String > dictionary = new ArrayList < String >( ) ;
BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader ( new FileReader ( " /usr/ share/dict/words " ) ) ;
String line ;
while ( ( line = in.readLine ( ) ) != null ) {
dictionary.add(line.trim ( ) ) ;
}
in.close ( ) ;
// sort strings by their length , then alphabetically
Comparator < String > c = new Comparator < String >( ) {
public int compare ( String s1 , String s2 ) {
int diff = s 1.length ( ) - s2.length ( ) ;
return ( diff != 0 ) ? diff : s1.compareTo(s2 ) ;
}
} ;
Set < String > sorter = new TreeSet < String > ( c ) ;
for ( String word : dictionary ) {
if ( word.toLowerCase().charAt(0 ) == ' q ' ) {
sorter.add ( word ) ;
}
}
int max = - 1 ;
for ( String word : sorter ) {
if ( word.length ( ) > max ) {
max = word.length ( ) ;
System.out.println (
" Words of length " + max + " : " ) ;
}
System.out.println ( " " + word ) ;
}
}
}
Actually a real Java program would be even longer , because you 'd refactor the code clumps above into their own methods .
And both the Java and Ruby versions would be approximately doubled in length after you " servicized " them , creating classes and exception handlers and documentation and so on .
But the Ruby version will always be a lot shorter .
And the longer the program gets , the bigger the difference will be .
Why is the Java code so long ?
All in all , Java is a relatively pleasant language to work with , and it has a lot to recommend it .
I 'm a Java fan , no question .
But as I 'm writing Java code , I keep wondering why it 's taking me so long .
Fred Brooks has established that the time it takes to write a program depends mostly on its length .
Also , the number of bugs in a system is proportional to the size of the code base .
So I 'd obviously prefer shorter programs .
What does Ruby give me that Java does n't ?
Breaking it down , the major differences that came into play in this example are : Java does n't provide a utility method for opening a text file , reading or processing its lines , and closing the file .
This is something you do pretty frequently .
Java 's collections do n't support higher - order functions very conveniently or consistently .
The fact that TreeSet can take a Comparator is the only higher - order function we were able to take advantage of here .
( The Comparator is a sorting function , which the TreeSet takes as a constructor parameter . )
Java does n't have any shortcuts for sorting .
You ca n't say " mylist.sort ( ) " in Java ; it requires more cumbersome infrastructure to specify what you want to do .
And some minor differences contribute as well : Java does n't import two of the most critical packages for you by default : java.util and java.io .
We use these all the time .
Java does n't provide syntax for indexing collections like arrays ( e.g. " mythings [ 2 ] " ) , nor does it provide operators for adding things to the collection .
I.e. , Java collections do n't have first - class language status ; they 're all done via an OOP interface .
One difference that did n't surface in this example is that collection methods in Ruby typically return collections .
E.g. if you call a_list .addAll ( b_list ) , the return value in Ruby will be a new list with all the elements of A and B .
In Java , you get back the number of items added .
This has two important implications : you can't usually chain collection operations in Java ( e.g. " mylist.sort.uniq.grep(/foo/ ) " ) , and it 's inconvenient to program in the functional style , which I 'll cover more below .

Anyway , I mentioned earlier that Ruby 's Array class has 118 methods , at least in the 1.8.1 version I 'm running on my laptop .
That 's a lot of methods !
Ruby 's collection classes have a surprisingly rich set of operations , including a bunch that I really wish they had by default in Java collections .
For instance , Ruby has defined a bunch of useful operators on arrays , including : a + b # returns new array containing elements of a and b
a - b # returns new array with b's elements removed from a
a << b # modifies a , appending elements of b
a[ expr ] # indexes into a with value of expr and several others .
Note that " + " and " < < " are identical operators , except that " < < " modifies a , and " + " returns a copy of a. and several others .
Note that " + " and "<
The fact that there are side - effect and non-side - effect versions of the same operators in Ruby is important , so I 'll talk about it a bit .
Functional Programming
In C++ , Java , Python , and many other languages , collection operations usually work via side - effect , modifying their target .
You might naturally assume that this is the best design , for performance reasons : returning a copy of a collection sounds expensive .
However , the asymptotic complexity is usually the same -- e.g. " a + b " runs in O ( n ) time , where n is the number of elements in a and b. " a << b " is still O ( n ) operations ; it just allocates ( slightly ) fewer objects .
So returning copies is unlikely to produce detectable performance differences , and when it does , your profiler can show you the bottlenecks ( usually very few ) that need to be tuned .
There 's a style of programming called functional programming that tries hard to avoid side - effects , since this eliminates large classes of bugs .
Functions with no side - effects are idempotent , making them a convenient building block that you can use without worrying about their effect on state or concurrency .
This idea pops up in a lot of Java literature .
Josh Bloch 's " Effective Java " hits on it in several places .
Item 13 ( " Favor immutability " ) covers it in some detail .
Josh says ( emphasis his ) :
It is known as the functional approach because methods return the result of applying a function to their operand without modifying it .
Contrast this to the more common procedural approach in which methods apply a procedure to their operand causing its state to change .
Josh then goes on to say the functional approach may seem unnatural at first , but he spends the next six pages (! ) explaining its many advantages .
Josh then goes on to say the functional approach may seem unnatural at first , but he spends the next six pages (! ) explaining its many advantages .
Some other great books on Java also recommend using the functional programming style .
Concurrent Programming in Java , for instance , describes various schemes for isolation , containment and immutability , all to avoid the need for explicit thread synchronization , which is notoriously fragile and error - prone .
And if you want to see the idea of functional Java taken to an almost comical extreme , you might try A Little Java , A Few Patterns by Matthias Felleisen and Daniel P. Friedman , the authors of The Little Schemer and The Little MLer , two famous books on the functional programming style .
I own all these books and can't recommend them enough .
They 'll make you a better programmer no matter what language you use .
Ruby is OO / Functional Object - oriented programming , procedural programming , and functional programming are three very different styles for designing and writing programs .
But they do n't need to be mutually exclusive , and often they 're not .
Some functional languages ( Lisp , OCaml ) provide object - oriented programming features , because OOP is a really useful way of modeling many problem domains .
How do you decide whether a language is " functional " or " object oriented ? "
Is it even a reasonable distinction to make ?
I think it is , because if you want to program in a particular style , you 'll want to use a language that makes that style convenient .
E.g. you would n't really want to do object - oriented programming in ANSI C .
Ruby makes it easy to program in the functional style recommended by Josh Bloch , Doug Lea and other recognized design gurus .
This is one of the reasons I find Ruby such a pleasure to work with compared to its peer languages , Perl and Python .
For instance , if I fire up an interactive Ruby shell , an interactive Python shell , and an interactive Perl " shell " ( via " perl - d " followed by ctrl -d for the Perl program ) , observe what happens when I sort an array ...
Python :
>>> a = [ 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 ]
>>> a.sort ( )
>>> a
[ - 1 , 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 ] So in Python , the sort ( ) function is destructive , modifying the list .
So in Python , the sort ( ) function is destructive , modifying the list .
Perl :
DB < 1 > @a = [ 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 ] ; DB < 2 > p @a ; ARRAY ( 0x104bfc2c ) DB < 3 > $ a = ( 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 ) ; DB < 4 > p $ a ; 7 DB < 5 > eat flaming death Ca n't locate object method " eat " via package " flaming " ( perhaps you forgot to load " flaming " ? ) at ( eval 27 ) [ /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.2/.perl5db.pl:618 ] line 2 . DB < 6 > @a = ( 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 ) ; DB < 7 > p @a ; 31-1407 DB < 8 > p join ( ' , ' , @a ) ; 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 DB < 9 > sort @a ; DB < 10 > p @a ; 31-1407 DB < 11 > p join ( ' , ' , sort @a ) ; - 1 , 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 DB < 12 > p @a ; 31-1407
So in Perl , after a bit of friendly interactive experimentation to remember the right combination of symbols for declaring an array ( as opposed to a reference to an array , or an array evaluated in a scalar context , or a reference to an array evaluated in a list context ) , we see that the built - in sort function is functional - style , and returns a copy without modifying the array .
The same goes for Perl 's other collection functions ( map , grep , reverse , and the like ) .
So Perl is a functional - friendly language .
Perl 's overall friendliness is still a matter of some debate .
Ruby :
irb ( main ) : 001:0 > a = [ 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 ]
=> [ 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 ]
irb ( main ) : 002:0 > a.sort
=> [ - 1 , 0 , 1 , 3 , 4 , 7 ]
irb ( main ) : 003:0 > a
=> [ 3 , 1 , - 1 , 4 , 0 , 7 ]
In Ruby the sort function is non-destructive .
The same goes for all of Ruby 's collection functions , so Ruby is functional - friendly .
In Ruby the sort function is non-destructive .

However , Ruby also provides destructive versions of the functions if you want to modify the array in - place , using the Scheme language convention of appending a " ! " to the method name for the destructive version : irb( main ) : 007:0 > [].methods.sort.grep (/!/)
=> [ " collect ! " , " compact ! " , " flatten ! " , " map ! " , " reject ! " , " reverse ! " , " slice ! " , " sort ! " , " uniq ! " ]
Nice !
( Note : Ruby 's functions borrowed to make life easier for Perl programmers , notably push / pop / shift / unshift , do n't follow the " ! " naming convention , but they do modify the array as in Perl . )

Ruby is also fully Object - Oriented , and unlike in Python and Perl , the OO features are n't just bolted onto the side ; they 're designed into Ruby from the ground up .
It supports inheritance , mixins , composition , public / private / protected visibility , static members , reflection , and all the other things you 'd expect .
Also , Ruby 's support for static methods is n't totally busted like Java's .
In Java , static methods are just global functions stuck in a class 's namespace , and do n't have parity with instance methods in terms of support for overriding , interfaces , polymorphism , etc .
Ruby 's static methods and members work the way you wanted them to in Java .
Ruby also supports a large number of OO features not present in Java , including metaclasses , mutable classes , singletons , operator overloading , delegation and forwarding , message passing , enumerating all instances of a class at runtime , and more .
Ruby 's OO support is more powerful , flexible , and consistent than Java's .
Ruby does provide you with the ability to write " scripts " without defining any classes .
But it 's just a trick to make procedural - style programming easy when you need it : all your top - level statements and functions are being assembled into an anonymous wrapper object that you can reference with " self " : irb( main ) : 008:0 > self .
methods
=> [ " irb_workspaces " , " send " , " kill " , " irb_quit " , " irb_popws " , ...]
Oooohhh , now that is pretty cool .
Oooohhh , now that is pretty cool .
So I think Ruby can genuinely make the claim : " Ruby works the way you do ! "
And unlike in Perl , it 's not just a marketing gimmick .
When would I use Ruby ?
For starters , anywhere I 'd think of using Awk , Bash , Python , or Perl , and I 'm not required to use one of those languages , then Ruby 's a good option .
Ruby 's threads scare me a little , for two reasons :
They 're " green threads " , implemented and managed by the Ruby interpreter , which means they 're more fragile than native threads .
E.g. a single deadlock brings the whole process to a halt ( although for what it 's worth , you can't do much about a deadlock in Java , either , since you can't kill threads safely or reliably . )
A more serious problem is that a thread that blocks on an OS call will block the other threads too .
Any large system is likely to be multi- threaded .
You can get by just fine with multi-processing ( Perl folks do this all the time ; Ruby threads may be scary , but if you use Perl threads you 'll be accounted a suicide ) , and Ruby folks would argue that you should n't build giant systems in the first place , but things are rarely that simple in practice .
I do n't feel the semantics of Ruby 's threads are well - documented , at least compared with pthreads or Java threads .
There are a lot of details in the specification for Java threads , and when I do n't see that kind of detail in Ruby 's thread documentation , I worry that nobody really understands how they interact with all of Ruby 's other language features .
So I 'd be reeeeally leery about building a significant multi- threaded system in Ruby .
I 'd be comfortable implementing concurrency using multiple OS processes , but that 's a bit cumbersome if you 're used to threads .
So I 'd be reeeeally leery about building a significant multi- threaded system in Ruby .
I 'd be comfortable implementing concurrency using multiple OS processes , but that 's a bit cumbersome if you 're used to threads .
I 'd definitely consider using Ruby as an embedded interpreter , e.g. if I needed an expression language .
Ruby 's syntax is pretty much exactly what I 've seen people come up with for their home - grown expression languages ; I figure you might as well save yourself the effort and just embed Ruby in your C/C++/ Java application , since it 's trivial to do .
( You 'd use JRuby for embedding in Java . )
Lastly , I 'm still undecided on strong typing vs. weak typing : in particular , whether I 'd feel comfortable building a large system in a non-statically - typed language .
I 've seen people do it , of course -- IMDB is a good example of a large , working system written in Perl .
But I 'm dubious about it .
Not because I think compiler type - checks are the last word in runtime correctness -- no , you still need unit tests ( which we rarely do , but it 's not like we can exactly say we 're " getting away with it " , either ) .
It 's because type tags are extra documentation , and automatically checkable documentation at that .
It can help with code - analysis tools , API - doc generators , and ( possibly ) human readability .
In large systems , I think having the type tags may be a big win .
But I 've never written a large system in a latently - typed language , so I do n't know for sure !
If you have , I 'd love to hear how your experience went .
In the meantime , we have tons of little automation and embedding tasks that Ruby is perfectly suitable for .
So I hope you get a chance to play with it a bit .
I think you 'll find that Ruby takes a lot of the tedium out of programming , and you 'll have fun with it .

Liquid Sculpture : Water art Martin Waugh 's Liquid Sculpture images are water art photographs of fascinating liquid shapes that were created by dropping and splashing water , or other liquids .
These sculptures are then photographed using high - speed photography , since they last only a few thousandths of a second .
Some of the pictures are amazing , others relaxing .
Creating and capturing these amazing photos requires careful manipulation of the materials and precise control of the lighting and timing .
Liquid Art Water photography , and other liquid pictures captures the sensuous shapes of flowing fluids .
There is something universally appealing about the art of liquids flowing , running , or splashing .
They are beautiful , restful , and evocative .
At times , they seem like old friends you 've never met .
Water Drop
A simple water droplet is beautiful , but when two drops collide , the varieties are endless and fascinating .
The shapes are affected by many things : the physical properties of the liquid , such as surface tension and viscosity , as well as the timing of the drops and when the camera 's shutter is opened and flash fired .
Being experiments in fluid dynamics , they reveal the chaotic nature of fluid flow - it can be quite reproducible sometimes , and other times highly sensitive to initial conditions .
Places to learn more about water drops : Wikipedia discusses some about the surface tension of water and how it helps form drops .
The hydrodynamics of water drops are complex , and ever - fascinating for physicists .
A very clever device created a hundred years ago by Lord Kelvin uses water drops to create static electricity .
Of course , NASA can't resist experimenting with water drops in zero- gravity .
An interesting result recently showed up : if there is n't any atmosphere , water drops do n't splash on a dry surface .
Wendy W. Zhang from the University of Chicago presented an illuminating paper on capturing liquid motion and water drops in Boulder in 2006 .
Milk Drop Droplets of milk make fascinating splashes .
It was one of Harold Edgerton 's lifelong pursuits to capture " the perfect " milk splash .

My oldest live projects are Mongoose and Cesta , both in intermittent development since 2003 .
I 'm doing a bit of hacking on both right now .
In the case of Mongoose , writing my own VM ( or , thus far , four of them ) was fun , but it 's not viable in the long term .
I 'd like to target the language to an existing VM , but earlier attempts with the JVM and CLR bore little fruit .
( Neither VM is well - suited to dynamic languages with serious metaprogramming facilities . )
In the case of Cesta , I need a way to speedily evaluate filter expressions , and a way to " cross - breed " decoders for parallel fuzzy decoding .
Research on both topics kept leading me back to LLVM , which is many things : Initially , I was scared of LLVM .
I did some hacking on the GCC family of compilers a few years ago , and the code is abjectly terrifying — not to mention the deliberately obfuscated intermediate representations .
However , every research lead I followed kept pointing back to LLVM .
Eventually , I got up the gumption to download it and try it out .
In short : I am floored .
LLVM is almost absurdly easy to work with , thanks to the best - designed C++ API I 've ever seen outside of Qt. Within minutes of downloading it , I had built and tested some of my C code using , their drop - in replacement for GCC .
An hour , two source examples , and 120 lines of code later , I had written a program that generates a Fibonacci function in RAM , JITs it to native x86 , and executes it in process , printing the results .
( It might have taken longer if the LLVM guys had n't provided an example that does exactly that , which I was able to learn from . )
This is when I started to notice something : the JIT is impressively fast , considering that I had not activated any of LLVM 's impressive suite of optimizations .
I coded up two version of the Fibonacci sequence ( naïve and hand - optimized ) and ran some benchmarks .
The first is the naïve recursive version : Compiled in a test harness , the times are as follows ( suitably averaged and scrubbed of outliers ) : ( note that units are now milliseconds ) Generating this recursive Fibonacci function at runtime ( which takes some milliseconds at startup , not included in this benchmark ) produces code that runs faster than GCC at - O0 .
Neat .
Next , the iterative transform of the function :
( The code to generate this at runtime is substantially more complex , since I 'm assembling the SSA intermediate representation by hand in C ++. ) This algorithm is vastly faster than the previous version , so note that our units below are now nanoseconds .
On this version , LLVM shows an impressive performance gain over GCC at - O0 , and is within a factor of 2 of GCC 's output at - O3 .
( As noted in the comments , running GCC at - O0 is effectively tying both of its hands behind its back .
I understand this ; I 'm comparing to - O0 here because I 've not aggressively optimized my LLVM code here and I wanted to try a non-JIT compiler with its optimizations turned off .
It 's still faster than the M3VM threaded interpreter . )
To try this for yourself , here 's where to find the sources :

What Occupation Has the Highest Homicide Rate ?
( Or at least had it in 1990 - 92 ; my quick search could n't find more recent data . )
We 're talking here about generally accepted Department of Labor job categories , which are limited to legal occupations , are nationwide , and apparently exclude the military .
The answer is here ; the homicide rate for this occupation was 30 times the average overall occupational homicide rate .
Of course , none of these approach the nearly 2 % yearly homicide rate racked up by this perfectly legal job .
Most of us have been exposed to information cautioning us to be wary of pork , from religious traditions ( particularly in Jewish and Muslim cultures ) that proscribe its consumption to warnings that one can get really sick by ingesting parasites present in ( undercooked ) pork products .
The disease trichinosis ( or trichinellosis ) can be caught through the consumption of raw or undercooked meat of animals infected with the larvae of the Trichinella worm , a parasite common to many wild carnivorous animals and sometimes found in game meat from bears , pigs / boars , large felines , foxes , dogs , wolves , horses , seals , and walruses .
Because Trichinella infection may also occur in domestic pigs , consumers of pork have long been cautioned to cook the meat thoroughly to ensure that any parasites in the meat are killed off prior to their being ingested by humans .
However , as the Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) note , the incidence of trichinosis associated with pork consumption is now much less common due to a number of factors :
Infection used to be more common and was usually caused by ingestion of undercooked pork .
However , infection is now relatively rare .
During 2008 - 2010 , 20 cases were reported per year on average .
The number of cases decreased beginning in the mid-20th century because of legislation prohibiting the feeding of raw - meat garbage to hogs , commercial and home freezing of pork , and the public awareness of the danger of eating raw or undercooked pork products .
Cases are less commonly associated with pork products and more often associated with eating raw or undercooked wild game meats .
Moreover , the potential for trichinosis can be headed off through observing a few simple precautions in the preparation of pork , such as cooking the meat thoroughly ( the CDC recommends a temperature of 170 °F , although most sources state that temperatures in the 140 - 150 °F range are sufficient to kill the Trichinella spiralis roundworm ) , or freezing pork less than 6 inches thick for 20 days at 5 ° F or lower .
Separate legends involving pork and Coca - Cola have been combined into a sort of meta - legend , one which holds that pouring Coke over a piece of uncooked pork will cause worms to come crawling out of the meat :
I live in the south and have heard a rumor for several years now that I have been too busy ( or lazy ) to test myself .
The rumor says that if you take uncooked pork bacon and pour carbonated , sugary soda on it , tiny “ worm - looking ” things will come out of the meat .
This is believed to be a type of tapeworm , according to the supporters of the rumor .
I HEARD THAT IF YOU TAKE A PORK CHOP PUT IT ON A PLATE AND POUR COCA COLA SODA ON IT AND WAIT 5 OR 10 MIN THAT LITTLE TINY WORMS WILL COME OUT
Any comment yet on the idea that if you take a piece of pork , draw a circle around it and then pour coke over it , the pork will literally move on its own outside the outline — apparently this is due to the worms and microbes living inside of it ( pig , of course , being swine that wallow in their own filth ) .
This newer legend plays off misconceptions of pigs as filthy , garbage - eating animals whose meat is ordinarily contaminated by disease - bearing worms and Coca - Cola as a drink chock full of caustic , bad - for - you substances that will dissolve flesh and bone .
Thus , even the hardy , nasty worms supposedly found in pork ca n’t withstand the onslaught of the corrosive chemicals allegedly present in Coke and will come crawling out of their comfy , edible homes to escape it .
The less - than - fantastic reality is that pork products made from domestically - raised animals and sold on the consumer market are pretty reliably free of worms , and pouring Coca - Cola over a slab of raw pork wo n’t get you much other than perhaps a nicely
marinated piece of meat .
At great personal expense , we verified this conclusion by obtaining a pork chop from the local supermarket and marinating it in a can of Coca - Cola Classic , producing no discernable result other than a slightly soggy chop .
( We did n’t try frying it up afterwards to see how the Coke affected its taste ) :
However , when we tried the same experiment with a can of cheap , store - brand cola , the results were somewhat ambiguous :
The image shows a mud mound with a central vent that shows up as sort of a bluish tint , and it is surrounded by large bivalves ( clams ) .
The central vent has a series of mud flow channels that spill away from the vent center .
These were the locations and paths for mud flows that resulted when the mud volcano was more actively venting .
The large clams number around 40 or so individuals and their association with the vent indicate a feeding or foraging strategy tied to what ever is coming out of the vent .
The scale is shown for this image by the laser points which are 20 cm apart .
The collapse of a giant ice shelf in Antarctica has revealed a thriving ecosystem half a mile below the sea .
Despite near freezing and sunless conditions , a community of clams and a thin layer of bacterial mats are flourishing in undersea sediments .
" Seeing these organisms on the ocean bottom -- it 's like lifting the carpet off the floor and finding a layer that you never knew was there , " said Eugene Domack of Hamilton College .
Domack is the lead author on the report of the finding in the July 19 issue of Eos , the weekly newspaper of the American Geophysical Union .
The discovery was accidental .
U.S. Antarctic Program scientists were in the northwestern Weddell Sea investigating the sediment record in a deep glacial trough twice the size of Texas .
The trough was unveiled in the 2002 Larsen B ice shelf collapse .
Toward the end of the expedition the crew recorded a video of the sea floor .
Later analysis of the video showed the clams and bacteria growing around mud volcanoes .
Since light could not penetrate the ice or water , these organisms do not use photosynthesis to make energy .
Instead , these extreme creatures get their energy from methane , Domack said today .
The methane is produced inside the Earth and is distributed to the sea floor by underwater vents .
This type of ecosystem is known as a " cold- seep " or a " cold- vent . "
The first of its kind was discovered in 1984 near Monterey , California .
Since then , similar ecosystems have been discovered in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Sea of Japan .
This recent discovery is the first cold - seep to be described in the Antarctic .
The nearly pristine conditions -- which have been undisturbed for nearly 10,000 years -- will serve as a baseline for researchers probing other parts of the ocean .
They better hurry though -- debris from the iceberg calving has already begun to bury some of the area .
Domack hopes to find new species and that this discovery will open the door to future Antarctic expeditions , specifically into Lake Vostok , a freshwater lake that sits two miles below the surface .
Any knowledge gained from studies into Antarctic life could help researchers search for life in other subterranean water locations on Earth .
And , experts say , this research could better prepare scientists to examine the hypothesized ocean on Jupiter 's moon Europa or on Saturn 's moon Titan .
This morning , a programmer visited #haskell and asked how to implement backtracking .
Not surprisingly , most of the answers involved monads .
After all , monads are ubiquitous in Haskell :
They 're used for IO , for probability , for error reporting , and even for quantum mechanics .
If you program in Haskell , you 'll probably want to understand monads .
So where 's the best place to start ?
A friend of mine claims he did n't truly understand monads until he understood join .
But once he figured that out , everything was suddenly obvious .
That 's the way it worked for me , too .
But relatively few monad tutorials are based on join , so there 's an open niche in a crowded market .
This monad tutorial uses join .
Even better , it attempts to cram everything you need to know about monads into 15 minutes .
( Hey , everybody needs a gimmick , right ? )
Backtracking :
The lazy way to code
We begin with a backtracking constraint solver .
The idea : Given possible values for x and y , we want to pick those values which have a product of 8 :
solveConstraint = do x <- choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] y <- choose [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] guard ( x * y == 8 ) return ( x , y )
Every time choose is called , we save the current program state .
And every time guard fails , we backtrack to a saved state and try again .
Eventually , we 'll hit the right answer :
> take 1 solveConstraint [ ( 2 , 4 ) ]
Let 's build this program step - by - step in Haskell .
When we 're done , we 'll have a monad .
<!--more-->
Implementing choose
How can we implement choose in Haskell ?
The obvious version hits a dead - end quickly :
-- Pick one element from the list , saving -- a backtracking point for later on .
choose :: [ a ] -> a choose xs = ...
We could be slightly sneakier , and return all the possible choices as a list .
We 'll use Choice whenever we talk about these lists , just to keep things clear :
type Choice a = [ a ] choose :: [ a ] ->
Choice a choose xs = xs
Running this program returns all the possible answers :
> choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
Now , since Haskell is a lazy language , we can work with infinite numbers of choices , and only compute those we actually need :
> take 3 ( choose [ 1 .. ] ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
Because Haskell does n't compute answers until we ask for them , we get the actual backtracking for free !
Combining several choices
Now we have the list [ 1,2,3 ] from our example .
But what about the list [ 4,5,6 ] ?
Let 's ignore guard for a minute , and work on getting the final pairs of numbers , unfiltered by any constraint .
For each item in the first list , we need to pair it with every item in the second list .
We can do that using map and the following helper function :
pair456 :: Int ->
Choice ( Int , Int ) pair456 x = choose [ ( x , 4 ) , ( x , 5 ) , ( x , 6 ) ]
Sure enough , this gives us all 9 combinations :
> map pair456 ( choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) [ [ ( 1 , 4 ) , ( 1 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 6 ) ] , [ ( 2 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) , ( 2 , 6 ) ] , [ ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 3 , 5 ) , ( 3 , 6 ) ] ]
But now we have two layers of lists .
We can fix that using join :
join :: Choice ( Choice a ) ->
Choice a join choices = concat choices
This collapses the two layers into one :
> join ( map pair456 ( choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] ) ) [ ( 1 , 4 ) , ( 1 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 6 ) , ( 2 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) , ( 2 , 6 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 3 , 5 ) , ( 3 , 6 ) ]
Now that we have join and map , we have two - thirds of a monad !
( Math trivia :
In category theory , join is usually written μ. )
In Haskell , join and map are usually combined into a single operator :
-- Hide the standard versions so we can -- reimplement them .
import Prelude hiding (( >>= ) , return ) ( >>= ) :: Choice a -> ( a -> Choice b ) ->
Choice b choices >>= f = join ( map f choices )
This allows us to simplify our example even further :
> choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>= pair456 [ ( 1 , 4 ) , ( 1 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 6 ) , ( 2 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) , ( 2 , 6 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 3 , 5 ) , ( 3 , 6 ) ]
Completing our monad : return
We 're getting close !
We only need to define the third monad function ( and then figure out what to do about guard ) .
The missing function is almost too trivial to mention : Given a single value of type a , we need a convenient way to construct a value of type Choice a :
return :: a ->
Choice a return x = choose [ x ]
( More math trivia : return is also known as unit and η .
That 's a lot of names for a very simple idea . )
Let 's start assembling the pieces .
In the code below , ( \x -> ... ) creates a function with a single argument x .
Pay careful attention to the parentheses :
makePairs :: Choice ( Int , Int ) makePairs = choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>= ( \ x -> choose [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] >>= ( \ y -> return ( x , y ) ) )
When run , this gives us a list of all possible combinations of x and y :
> makePairs [ ( 1 , 4 ) , ( 1 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 6 ) , ( 2 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) , ( 2 , 6 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 3 , 5 ) , ( 3 , 6 ) ]
As it turns out , this is a really common idiom , so Haskell provides some nice syntactic sugar for us :
makePairs ' :: Choice ( Int , Int ) makePairs ' = do x <- choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] y <- choose [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] return ( x , y )
This is equivalent to our previous implementation :
> makePairs ' [ ( 1 , 4 ) , ( 1 , 5 ) , ( 1 , 6 ) , ( 2 , 4 ) , ( 2 , 5 ) , ( 2 , 6 ) , ( 3 , 4 ) , ( 3 , 5 ) , ( 3 , 6 ) ]
The final piece : guard
In our backtracking monad , we can represent failure as a choice between zero options .
( And indeed , this is known as the " zero " for our monad .
Not all useful monads have zeros , but you 'll see them occasionally . )
-- Define a " zero " for our monad .
This -- represents failure .
mzero :: Choice a mzero = choose [ ] --
Either fail , or return something -- useless and continue the computation .
guard :: Bool -> Choice ( ) guard True = return ( ) guard False = mzero
And now we 're in business :
solveConstraint = do x <- choose [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] y <- choose [ 4 , 5 , 6 ] guard ( x * y == 8 ) return ( x , y )
Note that since the return value of guard is boring , we do n't actually bind it to any variable .
Haskell treats this as if we had written :
-- " _ " is an anonymous variable .
_ <- guard ( x * y == 8 )
That 's it !
> take 1 solveConstraint [ ( 2 , 4 ) ]
Another monad : Maybe
Every monad has three pieces : return , map and join .
This pattern crops up everywhere .
For example , we can represent a computation which might fail using the Maybe monad :
returnMaybe :: a -> Maybe a returnMaybe x = Just x mapMaybe :: ( a -> b ) ->
Maybe a ->
Maybe b mapMaybe f Nothing = Nothing mapMaybe f ( Just x ) = Just ( f x ) joinMaybe :: Maybe ( Maybe a ) ->
Maybe a joinMaybe Nothing = Nothing joinMaybe ( Just x ) = x
Once again , we can use do to string together individual steps which might fail :
tryToComputeX :: Maybe Int tryToComputeX = ... maybeExample :: Maybe ( Int , Int ) maybeExample = do x <- tryToComputeX y <- tryToComputeY x return ( x , y )
Once you can explain how this works , you understand monads .
And you 'll start to see this pattern everywhere .
There 's something deep about monads and abstract algebra that I do n't understand , but which keeps cropping up over and over again .
Miscellaneous notes
In Haskell , monads are normally defined using the Monad type class .
This requires you to define two functions : return and >>= .
The map function for monads is actually named fmap , and you can find it in the Functor type class .
Also , every monad should obey three fairly reasonable rules if you do n't want bad things to happen :
-- Adding and collapsing an outer layer -- leaves a value unchanged .
join ( return xs ) == xs -- Adding and collapsing an inner layer -- leaves a value unchanged .
join ( fmap return xs ) == xs -- Join order does n't matter .
join ( join xs ) == join ( fmap join xs )
That 's it !

And if you liked the backtracking monad , you 'll also like The Reasoned Schemer .

ELLSWORTH — On Oct. 22 , the Northern Light Blue Hill and Maine Coast Hospital Board will welcome three new trustees .
Joining the board will be ...
Just as you secure your home by locking your doors and windows , you should also take precautions of securing your home wireless network .
For the average home user this can be frustrating and confusing to say the least .
To help make the process simple , the following 10 tips will help you with securing your home wireless network .
Remember no network will be completely secure , but following the recommendations and providing multiple layers of security , will lessen the risk from someone breaking into your network .
Some of the tips include technical terms .
Always consult your wireless router vendor documentation or website support as needed .
Before making any changes , backup the router configuration or write down all configured settings .
All tips are for home use .
If you are connecting to your Company network with your wireless router , contact your Company I.T. department for assistance .
1 ) Change Your Router Default Password – A must in the first line of defense .
Create a strong password with a mix of numeric , alpha and symbolic characters .
Password length should be between 8 and 15 characters , or longer in length , and should not be obvious to you ( such as kids or wife name , birthdays , favorite cars or sports teams , etc ) .
If your wireless router includes a user name , it 's a good idea to change it to another name other than the default name .
2 ) Rename and Disable SSID Broadcast on your Wireless Router – SSID ( Service Set Identifier ) is the network name or identifier for the wireless router .
SSID 's broadcast a beacon signal ( usually about 10 times each second ) which announces to the world that the network is live and ready to go .
With broadcasting off , wireless clients must first know the SSID before they can connect .
If you have multiple PC's on your home network simply type the new name in your wireless client 's setup to connect to your router when SSID is disabled .
Remember to always change the SSID name to something other than the default .
3 ) Enable Infrastructure Mode –
When using the " ad - hoc " mode , which lets clients set up peer - to - peer networks , rogue users will be able to connect to your network through a legitimate wireless client .
This setting configuration can be found on your PC wireless network card .
4 ) Use MAC Addressing Filter On Your Wireless Router – Many routers let you restrict access to known MAC ( Media Access Control ) addresses .
Each network device , such as a computer network card ( NIC ) has a unique MAC address .
By allowing access only to pre-defined MAC addresses you can reduce the risk of rogue clients connecting to your home network .
5 ) Change the Default Router IP Address Setting – Router manufacturers set every router with an IP address .
For example , Linksys routers are configured with an IP address of 192.168.1.1 .
These address settings are well known and published , and can be easily discover by hackers if they know the router manufacturer and type .
Changing the IP address during the setup process , for example to 192.168.80.1 does not secure the router , but will make any attackers guessing for the IP address .
Changing this setting , will automatically change the DHCP IP addresses handed out by your router to PC 's allowed on your network .
6 ) Use WPA or WPA2 PSK ( Wi - Fi Protected Access with Pre Shared Key ) Encryption – When possible use WPA or WPA2 PSK over WEP ( Wired Equivalent Privacy ) .
Both Windows XP and Mac OS X support them , along with any access point manufactured within the past few years .
WPA and WPA2 both have a mode called the PSK mode that will allow you to use a password in lieu of using a full - blown 802.1X setup , which is perfect for the home user .
If your hardware does not support WPA2 use WPA .
Creating a strong shared key ( PSK ) will lessen the chance of attackers successfully breaking in to your network .
If you router only supports WEP , and your concerned about security , considered upgrading to a new router along with your PC NIC cards .
7 ) HTTPS , Firewall and Remote Access Settings On Your Wireless Router – Make sure HTTPS is enable for connecting to the router administration setup over your local network .
Verify the firewall is enabled and all incoming ports are blocked .
Disable remote access over the Internet setting .
If for any reason you need to provide remote access via the Internet , enable it only when needed and change the default management port setting to something other than 8080 .
8 ) Enable And Monitor Your Wireless Access Logs – Check your logs frequently for rogue access points ( AP ) or clients attached to the network .
If you spot unknown clients or AP 's connected to your network , change your WEP or WPA code , and do a little detective work in identifying unknown connections to your network .
Also check the status screen that shows the MAC addresses of all clients currently connected to the network and verify they are known devices .
9 ) Backup Your Router Configuration Settings – Although , not considered a security setting , backing up the router configuration before making changes will allow you to easily restore the settings in the event you make a mistake .
This will prevent your router from being vulnerable if you are unsure about any changes you have made .
10 ) Turn off Your Wireless Router When Not In Use – Why would you want to do this ?
When your router is powered off , your network cannot be compromised .
Consider doing this when you go on vacation or you will not be using you network for extended periods of time .
Just turning off your PC may prevent the PC from being attacked , but it will not prevent someone from breaking into your network via your router if it is powered on .
Bonus Security Tip –
Get in the habit of changing your router password every 30 to 60 days .
Also change your PSK several times a year .
Changing these two settings may just kick that un -detected guest off your network ( take that neighbor ! ) .
Limit the maximum number of DHCP users allowed on your network to just the known number of PC 's in your house .
Limiting this setting can be an indication of someone on your network to you if one of your PC 's cannot obtain an IP address from your router .
Paul Wolfowitz is mired in a scandal regarding payments to his girlfriend
Kevin Kellems said an ongoing scandal surrounding his boss made it difficult for him to remain effective in his role at the Washington - based institution .
Mr Wolfowitz has been mired in a controversy involving his handling of a pay package for his girlfriend .
Mr Kellems , who had also worked with Mr Wolfowitz at the Pentagon , is expected to leave his post next week .
" Given the current environment surrounding the leadership of the World Bank , it is very difficult to be effective in helping to advance the mission of the institution , " Mr Kellems said .
" I have tremendous respect and admiration for the Bank staff and management , " he added .
Conflict of interest
Mr Kellems ' sudden departure comes at a critical point in the investigation into whether Mr Wolfowitz acted properly over the authorisation of his girlfriend 's promotion and pay increase in 2005 .
The lingering controversy over the potential conflict of interest involving Shaha Riza , who is on the payroll of the World Bank , has prompted a growing chorus of voices calling for his resignation .
Critics argue the scandal is damaging the credibility of the global lender , amid a recently launched anti-corruption campaign .
Kevin is known among his colleagues for his emphasis on team - building and mentoring
Marwan Muasher , World Bank
A special World Bank panel of directors has been looking into whether Mr Wolfowitz abused his powers and is expected to report its findings imminently to the wider 24 - member board .
The Bank 's shareholder governments will then decide on the president 's fate .
The committee is also believed to be examining other controversial employment arrangements amid claims Mr Wolfowitz gave senior posts to trusted former colleagues , who did not have much relevant experience .
Mr Kellems was an adviser to the World Bank boss when he was Deputy Defence Secretary in the Bush administration and supported him in the run-up to the Iraq war .
" Kevin is known among his colleagues for his emphasis on team - building and mentoring , and for his work ethic and grace under pressure , " said Marwan Muasher , senior vice president , external affairs at the World Bank .
" My colleagues and I enjoyed working with him and will miss him . "

Trivia Tidbit Of The Day : Part 400 -- Economic Freedom Equals Economic Progress .
Policies Have Consequences -
The 2007 Index of Economic Freedom is out .
Inside , you 'll find a wealth of information , including :
Not only are economically free economies the biggest and best , they are also growing the fastest :
The rich get richer indeed .
Again , some questions , answered many times on this blog :
1 . What is it about economic freedom that makes economies perform well , while repression makes other economies languish ?
Or is the correlation just an accident ?
2 . Who in America espouses economic freedom ; who wants more taxes , more trade barriers , and more regulation ( less economic freedom ) ?
3 . If policy differences between and among states produce different outcomes , and policy differences between and among nations produce different outcomes , and those outcomes show a consistent pattern ...
... should n't we emulate those policies producing the best outcomes ?
Do n't we have a moral obligation to grow the economy ?
Is n't socialism inherently immoral ?
Please , peruse the Index of Economic Freedom 2007 yourself , and , please , do your part to advance freedom , economic or otherwise .

GCC Error Messages …
… and How - to Solve The Problem
This page has been converted from a Wiki formatted article .
If I ’ve missed anything in the conversion process , please tell .
Sometimes GCC emits something that can be described as Haiku poems – and you have no clue as to what it really is complaining about .
This page is a collection of such gems , their meaning in English and how to solve the problem .
If you run into an error that you feel belongs here , feel free to mail me .
I ’m using GMail as e8 johan .
Compilation Errors
This is a list of compilation errors that you might find yourself trying to interpret in no particular order .
Error : … discards qualifiers
Error message : passing ‘ const ClassName ’ as ‘ this ’ argument of ‘ virtual void ClassName : : methodName ( ) ’ discards qualifiers .
You have called a method that is n’t const using a const object ( const ClassName * foo ) .
Either add const to you method , e.g .
class ClassName
{
public :
void methodName ( ) const ;
} ;
Alternatively , you remove the const from your object , declaring it as ClassName * foo instead of const ClassName * foo .
Sometimes it is possible to solve this issue using const_cast ( thanks Witold ) .
Refer to this DevX article for an example of this .
Error : storage size of ‘ foo ’ is n’t known
Error message : storage size of ' foo ' is n't known .
I ran into this problem when using a typedef ed struct as a struct from a function .
typedef struct { ... } Foo ;
void function ( )
{
struct Foo foo ;
…
}
The solution is trivial – but hard to spot if you do n’t know what to look for .
typedef struct { ... } Foo ;
void function ( )
{
struct Foo foo ;
…
}
Error : multiple types in one declaration
Error message : multiple types in one declaration .
You ’ve probably forgot to end a class declaration with a semi-colon – ; .
The faulting class is not the one that GCC complains about but one of the classes included from the file containing the class declaration GCC nags you about .
Locate the faulty class in one of the suspected files , add the semi-colon and try compiling again .
Error : invalid use of undefined type ‘ struct Foo ’
Error message : invalid use of undefined type ‘ struct Foo ’ .
It is likely that you are trying to use the class
Foo that you ’ve forward declared but never included .
Simply include the full class declaration for Foo and everything will work .
Error : no matching function for call to ‘ FooClass : : foo ( ) ’
Error message : no matching function for call to ' FooClass : : foo ( ) ' .
Thanks to Diederik .
If you have implemented and declared the member foo , you are probably trying to use a method from a forward declared class .
You need to include the header file containing the declaration of FooClass .
Another variant of this is when you are missing an inherited method .
As you are using a forward declared type , GCC cannot tell if FooClass inherits the class implementing foo .
A concrete example of this :
chatmaster.cpp:220 : error : no matching function for call to ‘ ChatMaster : : connect ( const ContactList * & , const char [ 35 ] , ChatMaster * const , const char [ 39 ] ) ’
/usr/lib/qt3/include/qobject.h:116 : note : candidates are : static bool QObject ::connect ( const QObject* , const char* , const QObject* , const char * )
/usr/lib/qt3/include/qobject.h:226 : note : bool QObject ::connect( const QObject* , const char* , const char* ) const
Here ContactList is forward declared and GCC cannot tell that it inherits QObject ( containing the connect method ) .
You will not get any message telling you that you have forgot to include the header file .
Error : undefined reference to ‘ FooClass : : foo ( ) ’
Error message : undefined reference to ' FooClass : : foo ( ) ' .
Thanks to Diederik .
You have defined foo in the header file , but not implemented it .
Alternately , you ’ve used a library function without linking to the needed library .
Error : invalid operands of types `const char [ 31 ] ’ and `const char [ 7 ] ’ to binary `operator + ’
Error message : invalid operands of types `const char [ 31 ] ' and `const char [ 7 ] ' to binary `operator +' .
Thanks to Diederik .
You cannot write " foo " + " bar " , instead write " foo " " bar " ( the split could be across a line - break ) .
GCC automatically concatenates strings .
Error : ` QValueList ’ undeclared ( first use this function )
Error message : ` QValueList ' undeclared ( first use this function ) .
Thanks to Diederik .
This happens when you write QValueList foo instead of QValueList < type > foo .
Error : cannot call member function ` Foo* Foo:: instance ( ) const ’ without object
Error message : cannot call member function ` Foo* Foo:: instance ( ) const ' without object .
Thanks to Diederik .
You have called instance as a static method , but is was not declared as such .
Errors : non-pointer type , non-aggregate type , cannot convert
Error message : base operand of `->' has non-pointer type ` Foo ' .
Error message : request for member `bar ' in `foo ' , which is of non-aggregate type ` Foo * ' .
Error message : cannot convert ` Foo ' to ` Foo * ' in initialization .
Thanks to Diederik .
These are all examples of messages that you run into when mixing references , pointers and stack - based variables .
Error : syntax error before `*’ token
Error message : syntax error before `*' token .
Thanks to Diederik .
A class name is unknown .
It has not been forward declared , nor included .
Error : `foo’ is not a type
Error message : `foo ' is not a type .
You wrote foo . width ( ) when you meant foo -> width ( ) .
Error : unable to find a register to spill in class `FOO ’
Error message : unable to find a register to spill in class ` FOO ' .
Thanks to Dexen .
Quoting this thread .
This error message is n’t telling you about an error in your code , it ’s telling you about an internal failure ( almost certainly a bug ) in the compiler .
You might be able to work around the compiler bug by re-working your code , but it ’s not at all obvious how .
You might also try tweaking command - line options , particularly ones related to optimization .
A Google search for the error message might be fruitful .
Simon Farnsworth also points out that the cause of this can be inline assembler code :
This error can also be caused by inline assembly code .
If you have asm ( ) directives in your source ( see http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Extended-Asm.html), check that the input and output operand constraints are correct , and consider relaxing constraints where possible .
However , be aware that your inline assembly may not run as fast as intended if you do this .
Error : invalid operands to binary ‘ operator <<‘
Error message : invalid operands of types ‘’ and ‘ const char [ 15 ] ’ to binary ‘ operator < .
Thanks to Diederik van der Boor .
This message was produced by misspelling cout , for instance :
count << " Hello world ! " << endl ;
Jonathan
Wakely kindly clarified the cause of the error message to me .
Apparently , there is a std :: count function that confuses the compiler to produce this rather cryptic error message .
Qt Peculiarities
Sometimes
Qt ’s build system and GCC steps on one anothers toes , resulting in confusion .
Many issues can be solved through a make clean && make or just a touch myproject .
pro && make .
Using
Qt – invalid use of void expression
Error message : invalid use of void expression , while using Qt .
This message can appear if you have forgotten a SIGNAL ( ) or SLOT ( ) macro when calling QObject :: connect or a similar function .
Thanks to Loïc Corbasson for this error .
Using Qt – … before ‘ protected ’
Error message : refers to protected , but at an odd line number , while using Qt .
The signals keyword is really just a define of protected .
All signals are protected methods .
Hence , the compiler can refer to your signals section when it mentions protected .
Using Qt – …vtable
Error message : complaints about vtable entries .
This can indicate that you are missing a Q_OBJECT macro , or have missed to implement a virtual method .
Check for this .
Another potential cause can be that QMake generates Makefiles that can run into this issue when your add or remove signals and slots to classes .
The first thing to try is to touch your pro-file , e.g. run touch foo .
pro from the command line .
If you cannot find an actual problem , and touch does not work , try running make distclean && qmake && make to do a clean rebuild .
Serious Warnings
The warning messages listed below indicates that you might run into serious trouble .
As we ’re talking about warnings , you will encounter and have to trac down these issues at run-time .
A better option is to do something about the warnings .
If you want warnings to stop your compilation , run GCC with the flag - Werror ( thanks Jason ) .
Also , see the relevant GCC documentation .
Warning : Control reaches the end of a non-void function
Warning message : Control reaches the end of a non-void function .
There is a way to reach the end of a non-void function without returning something .
Add a final return at the end of the function to solve this .
Do not ignore this warning – it is possible to run into really hard to debug problems if you do .
Warning : ‘ foo ’ is used uninitialized in this function
Warning message : ‘ foo ’ is used uninitialized in this function
.
You are using foo , even though you have not initialized it .
This listing will cause the problem :
int main ( )
{
int foo , bar ;
bar = foo ;
foo = 7 ;
return bar ;
}
The solution is to initialize foo before using it .
For example , add foo = 0 ; before bar = foo ; .
Ignoring this warning can give you random values in a variable , causing the potential bug to appear sometimes , but not always .
This can make it very hard to debug .
Warning : cannot pass objects of non-POD type ‘ struct std:: string ’ through ‘…’
Warning message : cannot pass objects of non-POD type ' struct std:: string ' through '...' ; call will abort at runtime .
You are , for instance , trying to print a C++ std:: string directly to printf .
std :: string foo ;
printf ( " Foo : %s
" , foo ) ;
The result in run-time can be something like Illegal instruction ( core dumped ) .
The proper way to handle the std :: string to printf is to use the c_str method :
std :: string foo ;
printf ( " Foo : %s
" , foo.c_str ( ) ) ;
Thanks to Mark for this warning .
From a letter sent out to supporters :
Back in February , I asked if people would send me letters describing their experiences with our health care system .
I received over 19,000 of them .
It was truly overwhelming as we literally took a month and read them all .
To read about the misery people are put through on a daily basis by our profit - based system was both moving and revolting .
That ’s all I will say right now .
We ’ve spent the better part of this year shooting our next movie , “ Sicko . ”
As we ’ve done with our other films , we do n’t discuss them while we are making them .
If people ask , we tell them “ Sicko ” is “ a comedy about 45 million people with no health care in the richest country on earth . ”
But like my other movies , what we start with ( General Motors , guns , 9/11 ) is not always what we end with .
Along the way , we discover new roads to go down , roads that often surprise us and lead us to new ideas — and challenge us to reconsider the ones we began with .
That , I can say with certainty , is happening now as we shoot “ Sicko . ” I do n’t think the country needs a movie that tells you that HMOs and the pharmaceutical companies suck .
Everybody knows that .
I ’d like to show you some things you do n’t know .
So stay tuned for where this movie has led me .
I think you might enjoy it .
At this point , we ’ve shot about 75 % of “ Sicko ” and will soon begin putting it together .
It will be released in theaters sometime in 2007 .
I blame Microsoft and bloggers for my brain function lately .
I just ca n’t keep up with everything going on , and I do n’t really even try to .
At any given time , I have 10 – 15 tabs open in Firefox of webpages that I want to read .
And it stays that way .
This is how my day goes :
Check email with Gmail .
I ’m a stickler for keeping my inbox clean and less than 25 items in it at any given time .
So I go through my email , mark them with labels , star them and archive them .
Right now I have 20 + emails ( that I can remember ) that I really need to address .
Probably more .
Open my rss reader .
Go through all the items and flag the stuff I want to read with purple flags .
I ’ll open several of the items in my browser .
Now by the time I have finished this , I have more email in my inbox again , more unread items show up in my rss reader , a bunch of unread tabs in my browser and work to do .
So naturally I work on what I get paid to do , which right now is a business rules engine and entity translators for services to domain objects .
In order to not really screw up the team velocity and sprint regression trends , I stay on top of my work all day , not to mention there are deadlines to meet .
More email shows up .
More unread rss feeds .
More stuff open in my browser from searching for work related stuff .
And my day ends there .
I flagged a bunch of blog posts , flagged a bunch of emails , did n’t really read any of them because I can’t keep up with the emails and rss feeds that just keep pouring in .
I get a lot of emails from people asking for help on items related to blog posts of mine .
I just ca n’t respond to them all , and it makes me feel bad for not doing so .
Also trying to get a hold of WPF and WCF right now too , and its just hard to find time .
My daughter likes to dance when I play guitar and to play hide and seek too , so those items naturally take precedence .
I spend an hour at the gym every day Monday through Friday .
I also blame Cory , Dan and Jason ( especially Jason ) for keeping me out too late at night lately ( 2 am most times because that is when the bars close down ) .
Even though it might have been my idea to go out drinking , its still their fault for agreeing to it .
So much stuff is going on that I only have time to address the most immediate item at any given time , just like a stack .
What happens in the morning is the last thing to ever get addressed because of priority levels .
I ’ve certainly got to do something to get my life going queue style instead so that I can address items and get them done and feel some sort of sense of accomplishment outside of seeing our sprint burndown chart in a nice downward slope of regression .
But I get paid to code , not read .
My family is my life , so I address that first too .
Work and family .
When I think about the presentations I have to do , code camps to organize , a user group to run ( with the help of other officers , of course ) , conferences to plan , attend , speak at , whatever the case may call for , books to read , emails to reply to , blog posts to read , blog posts to write , books to write ( putting that one off big time ) , wikis to read , code to play with , ideas to play with , calories to track , miles to bike , software to evaluate , productivty tools to play with , home improvements to finish , watching YouTube videos , and just learning in general ( which is my favorite hobby ) , well , I need a time machine .
I ’m aging too fast for all of this .
I think a feel a LiveBetter II post brewing , on living with stress and feelings of “ non-accomplishment ” , because all in all , I ’m still a happy person , so something is going right .
Its just time to scale back and prioritize some things and just let go .
Did I just describe your day too ?
Oh yes , I blame Twitter for occupying too much of my time too .

I promise more technical posts are coming soon , in the spirit of CodeBetter .
I ’m working on a project where we are doing a few interesting things ( a usable EF would be killer right now , because I know what their vision is , and I wish that vision was in place sooner than its going to be ) that I will blog about later , including how we ended up with our fake MVC for the web ( Monorail was not an option that we could use and I just did n’t have the time to look deeper into Igloo to see how well it would work with our architecture ) , and how we ended up doing control behavior mapping to custom controls based on workflow status and user roles .

those who claimed to have past life memories made consistent and systematic errors in a particular psychological task
less likely
1 in 5 Americans believe in reincarnation , the sameas in Europe .
One can ascribe this to the influence of Indian religion , but recall that reincarnation has ancient roots within Europe .
My own suspicion is that reincarnation is an " evoked " belief which many humans find plausible .
Like the existence of gods it does n't have to be " invented " by a genius , cognates naturally emerge in a parallel manner across human societies due to the universal mix of psychology & environment .
I have made no secret of the fact that my own position is that modal human theism likely emerges from conventional and prosaic human cognitive processes ( e.g. , agency detection ) , but what about supernatural ideas like reincarnation ?
A new paper ,
The false fame illusion in people with memories about a previous life ( popular press summary ) , sheds some light on the modal cognitive processes which might account for belief in past lives which seem to be a recurring phenomenon in human culture .
Researchers found that .
In short , it seems that these individuals tended to be more suggestible and prone to allowing mistakes in associational memory creep into their recollections .
It seems possible then that cognitive " misfiring " opens up an avenue whereby these strange mental concepts can easily slip into the domain of plausibility ( innate mind - body duality already seems to convince us about the permanence of the soul ) .
The control group wasto make these mistakes , and were also less likely to believe in reincarnation , but this does not negate the general relationship and the likelihood that similar ( if attenuated ) cognitive processes are at work on a broad scale across human societies .

Foster about his spacious concrete vaults : " A tunnel dug by man through earth and rock is a very special place .
Its shape is a reaction to the forces of nature and the texture of its construction bears the seal of man .
This must be respected , not covered up to make the place look like any other building .
One must be able to feel being underground , and make it a good , special experience " ( quoted from Metro Bilbao 's Touristic Guide Map ) .

McCartney was always uptight that everyone considered Lennon , not to mention Mick Jagger and Keith Richards , a lot hipper than him .
Thus , he was known to brag , particularly on the pages of Rolling Stone , about being first to try this and that .
It was on the pages of Rolling Stone that he first let it be known that he was the first Beatle to try cocaine , and that he came close to cashing it in on unspecified drugs on a few occasions .
" I 've seen my soul get up and walk across the floor a couple of times . "
He also claimed in the mag that he gave Mick Jagger his first taste of marijuana .
Sir Jagger vociferously denied the claim , saying that the Stones smoked weed long before The Beatles did ( nyah nyah ! ) .
Continuing on the Paul - is - hipper - than - you - think theme , McCartney was the Beatle who befriended ultra-hipster hero William S. Burroughs when he settled in London during the late 1960s .
McCartney supplied Burroughs with tape equipment to experiment with his cutup method .
McCartney was also a lifelong friend with Beat / counterculture poet Allen Ginsberg .
He performed , along with Philip Glass , on Allen Ginsberg 's 1996 CD release , " Ballad of the Skeletons . "
Paul and Linda McCartney were financial supporters of the 25th and 30th anniversary celebrations of " The Summer of Love . "
The celebration of psychedelic counterculture was organized by their long - time friend Chet Helms and took place in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco .
, allegedly during a talk with friend and self - proclaimed " king of bitter divorces " Alec Baldwin a few days ago , that he has grown physically sick from the latest charges by his estranged wife in their divorce proceedings .
( Her latest claim is that he stole paintings by Picasso and Renoir from their once - shared lodge . )
But , let us revisit for a moment one of the more interesting charges leveled by Heather against Paul , shall we ?
Let us return to the drugs .
In college in the late 1970s , I had a girlfriend from The Hamptons who had been the baby sitter for Paul and Linda McCartney .
( Paul and Linda and their children lived in that elegant Long Island suburb through most of the 1970s ) .
Lizzie hated babysitting for the McCartneys because they were slobs ( messy house ) and because there were " drugs all over the place , " right out in the open where theoretically one or all of their four young children could get at them .
When I questioned Liz more closely about the drugs , she mentioned white powders , mushrooms and ( no surprise ) marijuana .
Lizzie detested drugs back then , because she was worshiping a poet named Robert Bly , and Robert Bly hated drugs .
But I must admit , for me , this tidbit added substantially to Beatle Paul 's always questionable hipster cred .
In the recent divorce case between Paul and his anti-landmine activist soon - to - be ex-wife Heather Mills McCartney , Heather filed a court statement , according to the British tabloid press , stating that McCartney had attacked her with a broken wine glass , and that he used illegal drugs and drank to excess .
I'm in no position to comment on any propensity Sir Paul may have towards violence , although a biography written by the tabloidesque rock writer Christopher Sandford promises , in a synopsis on Amazon.com , that " McCartney is a tale of self - destruction , violence and epic excess . "
( Imagine that .
Paul McCartney : the Great Beast . )
And McCartney himself has made clear that he drinks heavily when he 's depressed ( after the breakup of the Beatles in 1970 , after the death of his first wife Linda , and while he toured for his hardest rocking solo album , " Run Devil Run " in 1999 ) .
But when it comes to Macca and drugs , there is quite a bit more to talk about .
Join me then on a magical mystery tour : Early 1960s
The Beatles play frequent late night shows in seedy clubs in Hamburg , Germany , popping stimulants — mostly Benzedrine — to stay awake .
August , 1964 Bob Dylan turns
The Beatles on to marijuana .
He is shocked to discover that they 're pot virgins .
April 1965 John Lennon and George Harrison are slipped LSD at a dinner party thrown for them by their dentist .
McCartney is elsewhere .
1966
McCartney becomes the last Beatle to try LSD1967McCartney is turned on to cocaine by Robert Fraser , an art dealer and a central figure in the London counterculture , who was art director for the Sgt.
Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover ( the image itself was done by Peter Blake ) .
He uses cocaine a bit during his work on Sgt. Peppers , although he apparently does n't share it around with his mates .
Cocaine is very obscure in 1967 and does n't become second nature to rock stars ’ til around 1969 .
Spring , 1967 McCartney is the first Beatle and the first major figure in rock to admit that he and the other Beatles had taken LSD .
While this would seem to have been obvious to anybody who had been listening to their recent recordings , the great majority of people were way more clueless than they even are now and so the admission stirs up quite a bit of controversy .
Lennon is miffed that McCartney came out of the closet as an acid head first .
June , 1967
In Life magazine , McCartney describes himself as " deeply committed to the possibilities of LSD as a universal cure - all . " July 24 , 1967 All four Beatles sign a petition published in The Times of London calling for decriminalization of Marijuana .
Sir Francis Crick and Francis Huxley also sign the petition .
The Beatles also pay for the ad.1972 Paul and Linda McCartney are busted for smuggling hashish into Sweden .
He pays a $ 2,000 fine .
1973 McCartney is busted for growing marijuana on his farm in Scotland .
He is fined the equivalent of $ 240 .
McCartney visits John Lennon and Harry Nilsson , who are living together in L.A. while Lennon produces Nilsson 's album , " Pussy Cats . "
A bleary - eyed Nilsson offers McCartney some PCP .
Paul asks , " Is it fun ? " " No , " Nilsson replied .
So McCartney passes on the PCP.1974 According to a book written by May Pang called Loving John : The Untold Story about the time she spent as John Lennon 's girlfriend , John Lennon and Paul McCartney drop acid together one day in New York City in 1974 and decide to go visit David Bowie .
Bowie has just received the final mix of his latest album , Young Americans which includes two songs that John Lennon worked on .
One was a reworking of The Beatles song , " Across the Universe , " and the other was to become Bowie 's first number one hit , " Fame , " co-written with Lennon .
Bowie proudly plays the new album for his two Beatles heroes and they 're impressed .
And so he plays it again .
And again .
And again .
Eventually , McCartney excuses himself and bolts out the door , Lennon following quickly behind .
Bowie 's drug of choice in the mid-1970s might explain his obsessiveness that day : mountains of cocaine .
An interesting side note : In The Beatles version of " Across The Universe " , the line " nothing 's gonna change my world " comes across as a sort of cosmic meditation on the divine perfection of the eternal now .
In Bowie 's version , the same line becomes an expression of terrified desperation .
This might be interpreted as the difference between psychedelics and coke , as well as the difference between the 60s and the 70s.1975 Linda McCartney is busted for possession of marijuana in Los Angeles , but charges are dropped .
Sometime around 1976 - 77I can't find the source so this is from memory , but at some point the McCartneys hosted a party for the original cast of Saturday Night Live .
Mescaline was on the menu , according to one of the many SNL histories .
Late 70 sJohn Lennon , Paul McCartney and wives are sitting around Lennon and Ono's apartment one Saturday night getting stoned on weed and watching SNL , when Lorne Michaels does one of his occasional routines offering The Beatles a ridiculously small amount of cash ( $ 3,200 ) to reunite .
They briefly consider heading down to the show as a lark to claim half of the money , but they 're too stoned to deal with it .
January 16 , 1980 McCartney famously busted in Japan at the start of a planned tour with Wings with approximately half - a- pound of marijuana in his suitcase .
He spends ten days in prison in Japan before being released and deported .
After his release , he promises to quit but also argues that it is less harmful than Valium or alcohol .
He also later comments that he just could n't leave the pot behind because " it was such good stuff .
" 1984 Paul and Linda McCartney busted in Barbados for possession of marijuana .
Several days later , Linda is busted again flying into Heathrow Airport in London with marijuana .
1997
McCartney , now a Knight of the British Empire , tells Musician magazine , " I support decriminalization .
People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminal is wrong .
" September 22 , 1999At an after - party for a celebration / performance for McCartney 's new album , Run Devil Run , held at Hammerstein Ballroom in New York , McCartney is observed smoking vast quantities of weed with Woody Harrelson and Laurence Fishburne .
McCartney 's publicist gives a photo of the red-eyed trio to High Times magazine and encourages them to publish it .
High Times published the photo under the heading , " The Three Stoners . " June 22 , 2000 McCartney delivers a keynote speech in England on " Drug Awareness Day " about " heightening parental awareness to drug misuse , and to outline Government activity in this area . "
Rank hypocrisy ?
In fairness to Sir Paul , the talk repeatedly uses the term " misuse " and singles out heroin and cocaine as " the drugs that cause the greatest harm .
" 2004
In a prime example of the media 's tendency to recycle old news as though it were fresh news , the British press goes wild with headlines like " Sir Paul Admits He Used Drugs ! "
The articles quote from an interview McCartney gives to " Uncut " magazine .
He disclosed that he once smoked heroin , but did n't get high .
He says that " Got to Get You Into My Life , " off of the Revolver album was about pot and that the hit single , " Day Tripper " was about acid .
He also admits the obvious , that " Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds " was about LSD , something the song 's main author , John Lennon , always denied .
While he tells the magazine that he 's grown out of using drugs , he also tells them he " was flattered when he was recently invited by a group of Los Angeles teenagers to share their marijuana . "
McCartney was quoted as saying , " To me , it 's a huge compliment that a bunch of kids think I might be up to smoke a bit of dope with them . "
Mark Shields is a nationally known columnist and commentator .
If we do n't ( blank ) , then the terrorists will have won YOUR E- MAIL ALERTS Opinion George W. Bush Acts of terror Washington or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON -- After the national nightmare of September 11 , 2001 , those urging their fellow Americans to pursue a particular activity or to support a particular public policy -- whether drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge , or outlawing civil unions between gay Americans , or buying a new car -- would often argue that their fellow Americans ' unwillingness or refusal would force the world to conclude : " ... then the terrorists have won ! "
It was Henry Kissinger who observed in 1969 , " The conventional army loses if it does not win ; the guerilla wins if he does not lose . "
In Iraq and Afghanistan , the United States military has more than answered the challenge given it by routing the opposing armies .
But a case can be made -- four - and - a- half years after the terrorists ' assaults on New York and Washington -- that the criminals who organized and executed that attack have succeeded beyond their wildest expectations .
First , the United States is less favorably regarded and much more isolated in the world than it was before 9 - 11 .
According to the Pew Global Attitudes Project , anti-Americanism " surged as a result of the U.S. war in Iraq . "
In 2000 , three out of four citizens of Canada , Britain , France and Germany held a favorable opinion of the United States .
By 2005 , less than a minority of people in those same countries felt favorably .
Japan , France and Germany are all more favorably regarded than the United States by the countries of Europe , and China has a more positive image than the United States among the Europeans polled .
In Jordan , Turkey and Morocco , positive feelings toward the United States have fallen through the floor .
The unity that had been the hallmark of the nation in the last months of 2001 was replaced by polarization and distrust .
George W. Bush , who -- if he had chosen to do so -- could have become another Ike by governing as a center - right leader and bringing three or four Democrats into his Cabinet as part of a national coalition government , decided instead to follow an ardently conservative agenda in a time of war featuring historically aberrational tax cuts .
The social fabric of the nation has been worn and torn .
The number and percentage of this country 's citizens in poverty has gone up each and every year of this decade .
Today , there are 5.4 million more Americans living in poverty , most of them children , than there were when George W. Bush was elected president .
The number without health insurance grew by more than 6 million from 2000 to 2004 , to more than 45 million Americans .
During the same period , employer - sponsored health insurance dropped by 5 full percentage points , from covering 66 percent of the non-elderly to just 61 percent .
Inflation - adjusted hourly and weekly wages are still below where they were in the fall of 2001 , in spite of the fact that worker productivity has risen some 13.5 percent during that same time .
For five years in a row , Americans ' median household income has dropped .
It was actually $ 1,740 lower in 2004 than it had been in 1999 .
Those in the nation forced to work for the minimum wage ( which has not been increased in nearly nine years , during which time the Congress has voted itself seven salary increases ) have paid a painful price .
The real value of the minimum wage has fallen by 82 cents from $ 6.02 to $ 5.15 an hour since 2000 to today .
In a morally just nation , the rich do not get richer while the poor get poorer .
But in the United States , that has been the continuing case .
In the last quarter century , the household income of the highest quintile of the population has increased by 52 percent , while that same figure for the lowest quintile has grown by not quite 5 percent .
The nation 's fiscal health has deteriorated .
When Bush took office , the debt ceiling for all federal borrowing was under $ 6 trillion and had not been raised since 1997 .
Last year , Bush signed into law another $ 800 billion increase in the debt ceiling to $ 8.2 trillion .
In the first 224 years of the nation , 42 U.S. presidents borrowed a total of $ 1.01 trillion from all foreign sources .
In just over one term in office , George W. Bush has out - borrowed all 42 of his predecessors .
Some record .
By standards of national cohesion , economic and social justice , international respect , and fiscal vitality , the United States has lost much ground since 9 - 11 , and we 're not winning this war .

Perl became a popular language for one reason and one reason only : CGI .
Wrong .
The universe did not begin in 1994 .
The Perl community seems to have always had a rather snobbish attitude towards the web .
Nice synecdoche , but it 's a logical fallacy .
Well , despite what Perl snobs may think , people are not going to learn
Perl because it 's cool and " post modern . "

Most of the people writing Perl code today are n't real programmers .
What is your definition of a " real programmer " ?
It 's difficult to argue against this without a definition .
What 's amazing is that the Perl community not only accepts and encourages bad code , it 's outright hostile to those who do n't .
Look , that synecdoche problem again .
I 've seen people raked over the coals ( even on Perl Monks ) for suggesting cleaner alternatives to the Schwartzian Transform or suggesting using named variables instead of $ _. I 've seen people lambasted for believing that U.S. Astronauts actually landed on the moon too .
Instead of shoehorning Perl 6 features into the aging Perl 5 codebase , the Perl Gods chose to do a complete rewrite .
Have you tried to add a feature to Perl 5 ?
I have .
Perhaps you should listen to the people who 've patched Perl 5 when they say " Ouch .
That hurt . "
Well , I 'm here to tell you today that Perl is stagnating .
I wrote the article to which you responded , so I 'm a primary source .
Therefore , my opinion wins .
Perl needs a new , snazzy web application server right now .
Something that has the performance of mod_perl but does n't expose Apache 's internals ; something as easy to install as PHP or RoR , with a great name and a great API .
( A toned - down version of mod_perl coupled with T2T and Mason would suffice . )
I completely agree .
Finally , Perl 6 needs to come out in some form this year .
Not in 2008 or 2010 .
By then , no one will care .
Shelve all nonessential features ; save them for future versions .
Just get something out now that people can play around with so you can say " Perl 6 is here ! "

Just ask !!!
The last time I looked at it , it had almost no usable documentation , a weird development process that made a lot of existing software obsolete very quickly , and some design decisions that frightened me .
That was several months ago ; I have n't had time to look again .
It 's also not a replacement for mod_php , which is what I believe the original poster wanted .

Perl , the first postmodern computer language .
Seeing that that article is some 7 years old does that make Perl a " Post - Post - Modern " language now then ?
Surely the whole " post modern " bubble has gone now , much like the Web 2.0 thing will at some point .
Declaring a paradigm change by fiat is just , well , so post modern ... ;- p /J\
No , the part where Perl snobs think that people will learn
Perl because it's a postmodern programming language , not the speech where Larry said he considers it a postmodern programming language .
Did you notice that article was 7 years ago ?
Wrong .
The universe did not begin in 1994 .
Right .
And how many people used Perl before 1994 ?

How ?

Citation ?
To what , a Zogby poll ?
Ask Perl programmers why they learned Perl .
Most of them will tell you , Because of CGI .
What is your definition of a " real programmer " ?
It 's difficult to argue against this without a definition .
Someone who knows how to write good , solid , maintainable software , and does so either as an occupation or during their free time .
I 've seen people lambasted for believing that U.S. Astronauts actually landed on the moon too .
Yes , people often get attacked for telling the truth .
Have you tried to add a feature to Perl 5 ?
I have .
Perhaps you should listen to the people who 've patched Perl 5 when they say " Ouch .
That hurt . "
Why , Chromatic , just refactor it over and over again !
Is n't that what you XP zealots always tell us ?
Unless you think it would have taken equally long ( 6+ years ) to reshape the Perl 5 codebase into Perl 6 , then I think you 'd have to admit that the rewrite was a big mistake .

I do n't expect you or the rest of Perl 's upper - crust to abort their doomed course just because I , a lowly Perl hacker , says to .
My intent here was to say the things I felt needed to be said about Perl 's future .
As a Perl programmer of many years , one with work up on CPAN , one who 's contributed to other people 's work on CPAN , one who 's helped people here and elswhere , I feel I 'm entitled to be critical of Perl and its community ( of which I 'm a member ) .

I posted something controversial here once , and guess what happened ?
Some asshole downvoted everything I posted in the thread , then went and downvoted -- over the course of several days -- all of my past writeups , some of which fell below the depth most people view at .
These were helpful posts ( answers to SoPW questions , mostly ) , but that did n't matter to this person .

Wrong .
The universe did not begin in 1994 .
Right .
And how many people used Perl before 1994 ?
I know I did .
My earliest published code is a delayed qmail notifier ( no longer supported ) from 1997 , and I know I was using perl long before that time .
In fact , IIRC , I wrote some game theory processing for a checkers game ( studying AB pruning ) in 1993 or 1994 .
I went through the Perl4 / Perl5 conversion .
-- MidLifeXis
all of my past writeups , some of which fell below the depth most people view at .
You must be confusing PerlMonks with some other site ( slashdot or use. perl ? ) because PerlMonks has no " do n't show me nodes with a reputation below X " feature like some sites do .
So the only " damage " was to your XP or to the reputation shown on the node to those who voted on it , neither of which is likely to change how helpful a node is .
A reply falls below the community 's threshold of quality .
You may see it by logging in .
Well , there 's a few things you can do , personally , to save perl .
First thing , stop thinking of mod_perl when you think of a faster CGI .
Instead , think of FCGI .
It 's everything you say you wish mod_perl was .
Also , while you 've got some points with perl6 , I think the community can show at least as much by getting 5.10 out the door , and good work is being done by the perl5 - porters on that front .
Thanks for the post , though .
Esp. the link .
Edit :
The link I meant was How Does a Programming Language Stagnate , by chromatic .
The replies are particularly interesting .

The link that theobtwo identified is well worth looking at , especially the second reply by Peter Scott .
There is definitely a need for a pre-packged collection of those modules with features that are expected to be part of Perl6 , but exluding the filters and such that are not production - level reliable .
As Peter Scott observed in that link , How Does a Programming Language Stagnate , ease of use by those who do n't yet have extensive knowledge is an area where Perl5 could use some catching up reletive to competitors .
Among other things , he says
So you 've got to be clued into which " hip " modules to load just to get Perl behaving the way many people think it should .
The standard documentation does n't have a roadmap leading people in this direction ; they pretty much have to dig around and keep up with the latest Perl news and books .
While the synopses and exegeses are quite well written and quite satisfying for the many in this forum with the necessary interest and background , a summary for those programmers that are less a part of the process could be wise insurance .
It would take time from someone with authoritative knowledge , so it might be stealing resources from the speedy advance of the Perl6 project , but I think it would be worthwhile insurance that the full complement of users is still there when Perl6 is production - ready .
Oh , of course , FastCGI , that project that 's been virtually dead for years , with a homepage that looks exactly like it did back in 2001 .
Certainly this can standup to the enormous hype of Ruby on Rails !
Look , CGI is old and boring .
It does n't matter if you tack on " Fast " to it ; people see " CGI " and walk away .
Perl needs something like Ruby on Rails .
It can even be assembled from existing technology ( FastCGI , if you like ) , but it needs a new , catchy name , and it needs to be marketed .
Look at AJAX .
AJAX is pretty much Dynamic XHTML .
It 's 5 - year - old technology , but slap a new acronym on it and all of the sudden people take notice .

Hype is n't just generated by having a flashy homepage ; it 's also something generated by lots individuals .
If you keep pointing out mod_perl , you perpetuate the myth that mod_perl is the best way to do not -CGI with perl .
Would a better name and a better homepage fix things ?
Possibly , but not if people keep talking about mod_perl instead of fastcgi .
All web based applications are CGI .
Ar n't they ?
Did I miss some change ?
Could be , dunno .
AJAX : Actualy AJAX is new becuase it involves a new process ( retrieving data from the server after the page has finished loading .
Are you realy saying now that it does n't even matter if the code / language is good or bad , it just does n't have enough hype ?
Realy if your only concern is hype then start hyping the language instead of saying its dieing .
Honestly if your the same AM as the OP then I 'm very disappointed because the original rant was actualy quite well written and thought out , while this argument was just lame .

It is n't that we have n't heard this before .
And it is n't that it is n't true in some respects .
However you are kidna confusing me in a few respects .
You mention that perl should focus on web scripting , but then complain that most people using perl ar n't realy programmers and they write messy code .
Being easy to pick up and use is a feature .
A very nice feature in fact .
It causes some messy code , and it allows some non-programmers to actualy hack something together .
These are blessings and curses , but thats how perl is .
You do act as though perl is only a web scripting language and nothing more , and that to be usefull in any way it neesd mod_perl .
Those are pretty much all false .
About half of the perl i right is web based , the rest deals with text processing that is realy hard to do in other languages .
If I need to parse an input , format an export , manage a database then perl is where i reach .
Before I could get any other language to connect or handle most those thing i would be done with 2 or 3 perl projects .
If I was more profecient in other languages then this might not be the case , but the fact is you can do lots of stuff with perl long before you reach a " Proficient " level .
Perl6 is thankfully a seperate beast from perl 5 .
This is good because perl 5 is continuing to be maintained and is not on hold while those building perl 6 do their thing .
Is perl 6 taking too long to come out ?
Probably , but since this is all volunteer work it is hard to push .
Find someone to pay for it and i'm sure you could get it out faster , but thats not realy the perl way .
Their goal is to have something better than our current perl , but still just as easy to pick up and use .
Few other languages can boast both the easy of use and depth of power that perl has and that is its strenght not its weakness .
This strenght results in some bad code and some misconceptions but it also gave us all a great language .
One last bit .
I did n't start with perl because I wanted a scripting language for web pages .
I started with it because I wanted a language that handled memory , dynamic arrays , strings , and hashs without me having to code them .
Actualy i'd just finished writing myself a script language in C++ that did all this and while researching ways to improve it I found perl , junked my own mini-language and never looked back .
I still dable in C++ , VB , ASP , PHP , etc , but when it comes to getting a job done quick I pickup perl , get it done , then go back to playing ;) P.S. five years ago when I started perl , people said it was dieing .
Guess they were wrong ! ;)

I have two representative data points :
About four years back , the programmer we hired straight out of college started us off using PHP .
He was a very competent Perl programmer , but he said access to session info and to the database was a lot easier in PHP when doing something small .
The only thing that stopped further growth of PHP development in our shop was an old BSDI Unix box that did n't handle threads properly .
Without that old box , scripts in PHP ( and maybe Ruby ) would be a significant part of our code .
There 's a strong draw to knowing about and participating in the thing that 's " happening " .
That , coupled with even moderate technical merit , is enough to draw people 's attention to something .
At a 4th of July picnic this year , an Electrical Engineering professor ( whose interest is other than programming ) was suprised to learn from me that Perl was a large and full featured language , and that we were planning to translate our older core software into Perl .
She thought Perl was mostly just for web scripting , and pretty much the " old guard " for doing that .
IMO , Perl is a strong language , for now , with CPAN , discussion of best practices , and Perl6 doing a great deal to strengthen it .
However , it 's still worth paying attention to the issues raised by the OP , and illustrated by the two data points above .
We want to keep our favorite language as strong as it should be .
The number of people using a language decreases when losses outnumber gains ; when the number who wander off and start using something else that looks more intriguing outnumber those who try it , like it , and stay with it .
Perl needs a new , snazzy web application server right now .
Something that has the performance of mod_perl but does n't expose Apache 's internals ; something as easy to install as PHP or RoR , with a great name and a great API .
( A toned - down version of mod_perl coupled with T2T and Mason would suffice . )
This is good advice which addresses a real need .
It 's worthwhile focusing some attention on this aspect of what will make perl stronger in the long term , however long it takes for Perl6 to be usable in production code .
I disagree with the OP on Perl6 , both in content and style .
The rewrite of the language is needed , whatever you think of the role of Parrot .
Also , saying that it 's taking too long just irritates those who are generously contributing their time and creativity ( to whom the rest of us should be very thankful ) , and it does nothing to recruit more hands to the cause .
It 's better to say something like " Perl6 needs to get out there soon to ensure that your favorite language remains strong and healthy .
Help wherever you can .
Here 's how ... "
Eric , I never suggested Perl was only a web scripting language .
My point was that web scripting is what made Perl mainstream .
Before the web it was just a fringe language .
If the Perl community had only realized this and tried to accommodate web developers better , then Perl might still be attracting lots of new programmers .
There needs to be a compelling reason for people to learn Perl , otherwise the language will begin to rot .
It does n't have to be web scripting , but it needs to be something .
Perl just being a great language is n't enough .
Python has almost completely taken over the desktop scripting market that Perl was once making great inroads into .
When people want to write small to medium sized GUI programs , they turn to Python , not Perl.
PHP is now on the command line too .
Ruby has surged in popularity in the past year or two , almost entirely because of its new web development platform Ror .
These other languages are growing .
Perl is shrinking .
" Python has almost completely taken over the desktop scripting market that Perl was once making great inroads into " ..... seriously ?
I mean maybe it has while i've been hiden away in my turtle shell .
I certainly know it is common to come across VB and C++ solutions , maybe even Java , but i've never been searching for something and come across python at all .
That 's hardly proof that it is n't taking over , just that if it is , I 've failed completely to notice .
Is there even any way to prove that type of thing ?
If so what kind of metric would you use and can you compare a couple of language ?

Is Perl " less popuplar " than it used to be ... perhaps .
So what ?
That does not mean that it is dying anymore than the fact that fewer people read books these days means that soon no one will read books .
Instead of obsessing about meaningless " market share " " statistics " , just answer two questions : what other language has as vibrant and active an online community as perlmonks ?
and what other language has as large and diverse a repository of modules and libraries as CPAN ?
Is Perl " less popuplar " than it used to be ... perhaps .
So what ?
Some would argue it's a benefit .
Many people in technology are obsessed with the bleeding edge -- the ones who rush to learn a new language , so they can assert their superiority over everyone else , or just because they like learning .
That 's fine -- there are always going to be people like that , and for the most part , they 're going to quickly complain , and / or jump ship to whatever next new language comes along .
Why ?
Because they 're adopting too early in the hype cycle .
I 'd personally say that Perl is comfortably in the ' Plataeu of Productivity ' .
It 's well established , its shortcomings are known , and we can set realistic expectations on projects written in it .
There 's always going to be the group of language nomads -- they can't settle on a language , because they 're just never happy .
They 're the ones pushing Ruby now ... maybe they were last on Python , or Java , or whatever else .
In some ways , every good programmer should learn experiment with other languages -- see what the alternate tools are that are out there , so they can make an informed decision about their language choices .
I personally like a language where there are a good number of experts to refer questions to , rather than watching a community of newbies struggle along in the dark as they all try to implement the same things with varying degrees of success .
Amen to jZed ... with one small caveat re ' meaningless " market share " " statistics " ' ... which I believe should read ' meaningless " market share statistics assertions , unsupported by data " ' or , perhaps , ' assertions of questionable reliability .
'
And likewise , " amen " ( with only minor kvetches ) to prasadbabu , nimdokk , jdporter , eric256 and others above ...
( Implication of the following is likewise unsupported by data , I concede : )
Someone once observed that rumors of his death were greatly exagerated .

As a counterpoint , if I want to script Poser ( a 3D graphics app I own ) I have to use Python .
If I want to mod Civilization IV then again , Python is required .
And even games that do not advertise the ability to mod are using Python , such as the second Freedom Force game .
So quite frankly , I think Perl 's reputation does matter .
The less popular it becomes then apparently the more likely I am going to feel pressured to learn Python .
And I think it goes without saying that there are ramifications for those of us who use it to help make a living .
If nothing else , if it is considered " old school " then it could become a liability on a resume .
For sysadmins I seriously doubt it has reached that point .
On the other hand , I think it 's a lot coser with PHP vs. Perl .
I mean , I think I 'd rather have PHP on my resume today if I was appplying for a web development position . [
Sheds tear . :( ] -- Argel Update : Fixed typos / grammar
Ah. Anonymous Monk is looking into the future .
Well then , I 'll look a bit into the past ( my past ) to contribute something that might be interesting .
Way back I was programming on a nifty CAD program on the ATARI ST , in GFA Basic , and my extensions to it earned me a job at the university which roughly consisted in documenting their UNIX network and help to solve problems .
I had no clue of programming when I started on that CAD thingy , and I had no clue of UNIX either but sat at a SPARCstation IPC running SunOS 4.1.3 and was supposed to deliver something useful .
Took me about half a year self - teaching me the use of shells , sed , awk , tr , uniq , sort , oodles of other binaries to get a grip on what UNIX is about , I dabbled with yacc , nm , ld and so on .. well , the documentation was never done .
By the time I had the clue there was a budget cut and someone had to go .
' Twas me , since I was not involved in anything vitally important to the institute .
But meanwhile I did some useful things .
My tutor gave me the hint to look at perl whilst I was doing some complicated networking stuff , and when disk quotas became a problem I whipped up a perl shell that behaved exactly like a user 's shell , but allowed only operations which reduced the disk space used .
Im still working with this shell , 13 years old now , of course without the restrictive part ;-)
What first struck me with perl were the three virtues of programming , laid out in the pink camel book : laziness , impatience and hubris .
Note that these virtues are diametral to social virtues : laziness < => diligence impatience < = > patience hubris < => humility [ download ]
These opposites deserve a meditation on it's own .
But tell me , is there any other other computing language which takes you to musing about those things right in the first chapter of the book describing it ?
Next job was replacing a Siemens Quattro system with HPUX / X11 , and I was supposed to write database stuff without a database , because $ customer could not decide on which one to use at that time .
I wrote my own , perl and DB_File , it was a mess but ran lightning fast and did it 's job for four years at least .
I spent my time as system administrator , security consultant , perl hacker , networker , software and hardware reseller ( not in that particular order ) , but not in the realm of architecture which I had originally chosen .
Ah , yes , and web programming .
Back to the present .
I 'm not a programmer , but I do it .
Things that I work out in perl often prove helpful , and many of them are done in no time , some require " banging my forehead with a book for half a year " , but I have never found a task in which I had to " fight my tool " , which is perl .
Sometimes my code is a mess , sometimes I 'm proud of it , but then I get humbled whith what I see e.g. at perlmonks .
I see perl is shipped with major OS distributions , it is used for kernel builds , administration tasks , bioinformatics , text munging , glue stuff , glue , and glue and glue stuff , and many other things I do n't even know .
The future ?
From my experience , I disagree with you , Anonymous Monk , and I agree with you .
" All things must pass " , as George Harrison said , but I guess perl will not die anytime soon .
Perl is a wonderful tool , and a tool will die and be relegated to a museum when the task for which it was invented no longer exists .
Using a better tool is always right , if it helps to " get your job done before your boss fires you . "
But as for now I can not see any other tool more apt for this particular task than perl .
Ah , this is growing long .
Just a few condensed points , to repeat other posters : the lowly unix tools sed awk grep tr sort uniq et al continue to exist , being decades old
et al continue to exist , being decades old perl is part of virtually any UNIX or UNIX - like OS
perl can be considered a standard UNIX tool
fastcgi provides a better separation between webserver and content assembling programs
it 's better to compromise the webserver with mod_perl than compromising your entire server with , say , PHP
CPAN is also a playing field and cauldron from which standards arise
perl is quite alive , and kicking , as are sed awk grep sh etc

Anonymous Monk ,
I am working in e-publishing company where mainly text processing , HTML , XML process are handled .
I am not professional in CGI concepts .
As far as i know there is no language equivalent to Perl in text processing and handling regex .
Could you tell us any other language good in handling text processing and regex ?
" use Perl " Prasad
I 'd have to agree here .
We do not use Perl for any web applications yet 98 % of our jobs are written in Perl because I could write one script and use it on either Windows ( running Activestate Perl ) or on Unix running the installed version of Perl and you would n't need to do anything different becuase of the platform ( granted there was a lot of platform specific operations that are done behind the scenes in a custom module ) .
Being able to create a custom module allows us to have scripts that use functions out of that and if we update something , that update is carried out for all scripts using it ( one change rather than having to change several hundred scripts in a variety of places ) .
I also use it to parse log files and put them into a coherent format for reporting .
Perl also has the advantage of being very fast .
I 've pulled reports out of logs and been able to parse large amounts of data within a few minutes .
Perl 's regex's are great as well , I 'm in the process of convincing our software vendor to enhance the use of regex's in a program they wrote in Perl .
I do n't think it 's dying , perhaps it 's just not growing as quickly as some would like .
Of course if it really stops growing , then it will die ( like any other language in the world - take Latin for instance ) .
However , my opinion is that 's a long way off since there is a lot of work being done , especially with CPAN to extend what you can do with Perl .
Just by 2 pence :-)
Of course if it really stops growing , then it will die ...
Not that I have any particular disagreement with your overall point here , nimdokk ; but I strongly disagree with the meme that " if it ai n't growing , it 's dying " .
There 's a third possibility : sustaining .
And in many scenarios sustaining has significant advantages over growing ( not to mention , over dying ) .
To take just one example from biology : humans stop growing at some time around 20 years of age * but we do n't really start dying until maybe 70 or 80 * .
Sure , adolescence has its perqs ; but , all things considered , I 'm quite happy to be an adult .
* The exact ages do n't matter ; let 's not split hairs .
like any other language in the world - take Latin for instance Um , that 's not why Latin died .
We 're building the house of the future together .
However , my opinion is that 's a long way off since there is a lot of work being done , especially with CPAN to extend what you can do with Perl .
Actually , that 's part of the problem with Perl 's waning comparative popularity : languages like Perl , Python , and Ruby gain a lot of mindshare traction via their suitability for the Web , but CPAN actually acts as a demotivator in that realm .
When people come up with new code in Perl that they want to share with the world , they stuff it in CPAN — but all those people out there looking to use Perl on their shared - server webhosting accounts are often pretty badly disenfranchised by that approach because they can't just go around installing modules willy - nilly when they often do n't even have shell access , let alone root access , on the servers .
That does n't even bring up the problem with dependency hell that CPAN - wrangling can often impose on our otherwise apparently simple solutions to commonplace problems .
CPAN is great , but it suffers some issues , and these issues most affect the most fertile ground for growing Perlists .

Could you tell us any other language good in handling text processing and regex ?
Ruby .
Ruby is good at text manipulation .
So is Python , even if it does look a little different .
The thing is that text manipulation is an innate part of what Perl is .
It 's so tightly ingrained into the language that Perl is often a first choice for such tasks even if other , prettier languages are available .

At least it 's a well written rant .

Perl is my hammer , hence wo n't die in my world because there are oh so many nails :)
All the other languages I know I use by requirement , or because Perl would n't be the best choice .
If I 'm asked to accomplish something the first language I ponder is Perl .
I do n't recall getting acclaim for the thousands of lines of Java or some obscure ' C ' interface that I 've coded , but most of my little duct tape wonders get me that , ' That 's cool ' result that I most enjoy about my work .
I try to picture Perl going the way of Pascal or Basic and just do n't see where Perl wo n't retain its unique advantages in the ' niche ' corners of computing -- with or without Perl 6 .
Rumors of Perl 's demise is greatly exaggerated , and rediculously premature .

I do n't give a damn about CGI .
Out of all the stuff I do in Perl , CGI ( or some other way to put dynamic content on the web ) comprises just a few percent .
Very few .
And I 'm far from being an exception .
Yeah , newbies who want a counter on their web page are not flooding Perl newsgroups and mailing lists with their " how do I sum two numbers " type questions anymore .

What ’s amazing is that the Perl community not only accepts and encourages bad code , it ’s outright hostile to those who do n’t .
Are we in the same community ?
I ’ve seen that sort of behaviour in isolated programmer cliques that have no connection to the Perl community at large and where Perl is used for what are deemed throwaway tasks – such people often develop weird notions about the value of cleverness or even outright golfing .
But the larger community ?
Perlmonks has a sometimes unhealthy obsession with strict and warnings .
I ’ve been evangelizing three - arg open , tightly scoped variables , the use of foreach ( LIST ) over for ( ; ;) etc. wherever it is n’t too wildly off - topic .
There were long threads about inside - out objects on Perlmonks ages before they showed up in Perl Best Practices .
TAP , the Test Anything Protocol that originated from the Test :: Harness family of modules , is being absorbed by other languages .
I could go on endlessly about the ways in which the Perl community really cares about code quality and is at the forefront of innovation and evangelism in that area .
I ’m not saying you ca n’t use those features , but the level of hackishness and amateurism I see regularly in Perl scripts is appalling .
It seems like terseness wins out over clarity every single time .
No doubt , but the level of roundabout pretzel logic and amateurism I see regularly in Java code is appalling too .
It seems verbosity wins out over clarity every single time .
Terseness is not the opposite of clarity .
That ’s verbosity .
Clarity lies somewhere half - way between the extremes , but finding the balance that achieves it is a really hard discipline that few people master .

Perl Programmers are snobby ?!?!?!?!
Say it is n't so !
The problem with that claim is that you should drop Perl and simply say that programmers can be snobby .
I have found snobby C , C++ , Assembler , Python , Perl , Fortran , Pascal , and even Cobol programmers .
Even you my friend are a snob :
Most of the people writing Perl code today are n't real programmers .
They 're systems administrators or hobbyists .
They never learned " proper " software development techniques so their code is almost always a mess .
Ugly , inconsistent and largely unreadable to those that lack a firm understanding of the language ( at least 2 - 3 years experience ) , it 's this ugly code that turns new people off to Perl and gives it its reputation ( though undeserved ) for being a write - only language .
Well - written Perl code is a thing of beauty ( and still shorter than the equivalent in any other language ) , but I would guess that less than 5 % of the Perl code out there fits into this category .
What 's amazing is that the Perl community not only accepts and encourages bad code , it 's outright hostile to those who do n't .
I 've seen people raked over the coals ( even on Perl Monks ) for suggesting cleaner alternatives to the Schwartzian Transform or suggesting using named variables instead of $ _.
More amazing , the hostility is usually from some smug sys - admin that 's never worked on a large software project their entire life .
I 'm not saying you can't use those features , but the level of hackishness and amateurism I see regularly in Perl scripts is appalling .
It seems like terseness wins out over clarity every single time .
If you have even worked in the world of system administration , you would find that management does n't care about the beauty of code .
They want something fast .
Most of the time the scripts are only to answer a small problem , a status check , a report , or a simple monitor .
Writing beautiful perfect code would not offer much to the task at hand .
However , if you were writing a database system , a production management system , etc , then you are correct .
Care must be taking in the design .
Never mind the fact that a full blown
Perl developer is writing those kind of systems .
I could be wrong , I have never taken part in a large software development project .
I am only a system administrator . ;)
Perl Programmers are snobby ?!?!?!?!
Say it is n't so !
The problem with that claim is that you should drop Perl and simply say that programmers can be snobby Alas , I think Perl programmers are snobbier .
How many times in this site have you seen posters go apolpletic because some poor sod wrote " PERL " instead of " Perl " , or a n00 b got blasted with RTFM because they have n't learnt perldoc yet I remember an experienced Perl programmer saying on the Krang list that he would be more gentle on Perlmonks posters after he received a lot of patient answers to his Krang questions .
The fact is that not everyone is a guru programer , and some people will struggle because Perl programming is not their forte , but they still have to get the job done .
Yeah , how dare you people point out that they 're wrong .
How dare you people point out their ignorance and where to remedy it .
We should coddle them and inculcate their incorrect notions and ignorance .
Perish the thought that they should be pointed to the ample documentation where they can help themselves and improve in the process .
Everyone should be spoon fed whatever they need immediately regardless of the effort they 've exhibited .
Otherwise it might mortally wound their fragile self esteem .
Or they might get the idea that programming is an intellectual endeavor with certain inherent rigors .
Perish the thought .
Shame on you all .

IT 'S " perl " OR " Perl " YOU SECOND HAND ELECTRIC DONKEY BOTTOM BITER !
This is what usually happens : " Perl " is the language , " perl " is the implementation ; " PERL " is just wrong .
See the difference ?
As to being told to RTFM , most of the time that 's probably because : the querent asked an extremely trivial question
the querent showed no effort on their part to begin with
it 's an extremely simple question to begin with
TFM answers said question rather succinctly to begin with ( that , you know , kinda being the purpose of having good documentation )
The few times I 've gotten RTFM'd on a couple of the Ruby IRC channels it 's shown me where to find TFM that I was n't aware of ( things like ri or the standard library docs online ) .

I do n't know that Perl is dying , but there is an exodus going on .
I will offer myself up as a data point .
I used to be a serious Perl programmer .
I spent about 5 years coding almost exclusively in Perl and only occasionally sticking my head up to play with other languages .
It was a hell of a lot better than Java , which those around me were using and I could crank out applications with more features and better performance in less time than they could without breaking a sweat .
A couple years back , I got called upon to take over a project that had been started in Python .
I was n't too excited about coding in Python but hey , at least it was n't Java .
It took me about an afternoon to go through Dive Into Python and basically get to where the syntax of the language did n't get in my way too much .
Then there was about a week of frequently looking up the things I was n't quite sure how to do in Python ( mostly library , not syntax related ) .
It also took a little while before I 'd broken myself of always putting curly braces around things , $ 's in front of variable names and semicolon 's at the end of every line .
At first of course , I despised the whole whitespace thing and I felt really unproductive overall .
After a couple weeks though , a funny thing happened and I noticed that I 'd gone from thinking significant whitespace was the worst idea ever to not noticing it at all to actually appreciating how simple it made things ( at least once I 'd gotten emacs configured right ) .
I also noticed that within the domain that I was working ( a GUI app for scientific simulation ) , I was now feeling at least as productive as I 'd ever been in Perl .
A little longer spent in Python - land exploring more libraries ( for web stuff , database stuff , XML manipulation , etc. ) and I started looking for ways to replace our Perl applications with Python .
What really got me was the simple elegance of the language .
After a week or so I 'd basically learned by heart every single aspect of Python syntax without really trying .
Five years of coding Perl , hanging out on Perlmonks , reading perldoc and O'Reilly books and I 'd never quite felt like I knew more than a small subset of the language .
All of Python could fit in my head at once and I could just program without having to think about the language at all .
Everything was simple , consistent , and as clear and explicit as possible without straying into verbose .
I 've never quite bought the " Perl is a write - only language " argument ( I 'm still maintaining five or six year old Perl code at work that we have n't replaced yet because the applications were too big and I never have problems reading the old Perl despite the fact that I barely touch Perl any more ) but that ability of Python to get out of the way of coding in a way that Perl never could for me was a pretty significant reason that I 've moved on from Perl and have no desire to go back .
Perhaps other programmers have more room in their brain for language syntax and can work with Perl the way that I can with Python .
If that 's you , more power to you .
I 'm just not that talented .
Here are the things about Perl that have tempted me to return : CPAN - CPAN still kicks everyone 's ass as a centralized repository of modules for doing everything and more .
It was the first thing I really missed from Perl .
However , in the last three years or so I really have n't run into much in Python that I thought there should be a library for that there was n't already one for that was easily findable with google .
With the Python Cheese Shop
It looks like the Python community 's determined to catch up .
And easy_install even lets me do the same trick with downloading and installing a module by name from the commandline .
Text Processing -
No doubt about it , Python 's regular expression library is more tedious to use than Perl and no one in the Python community seemed to really care .
Eventually though , I realized that Python had a very powerful built in string class and all the common things that I used to do with regexps in Perl I could do directly and more clearly with Python strings .
It took some getting used to , but now I do fairly heavy text processing and barely ever use regexps .
( Which is not to say that I do n't still drool slightly at Perl 6 regexps ( I do n't use regexps much anymore , but they 're still cool as hell ) ) .
mod_perl - mod_python is good and improving all the time , but it 's still rough around the edges compared to mod_perl .
The rough transition that mod_perl had to make between apache1 and apache2 kind of leveled the playing field though .
Nowadays I use TurboGears and Plone though and am much happier for it .
DBI - DBI is more consistent , polished , full - featured and better documented than Python 's equivalent database API .
Once I discovered the SQLObject ORM though and let it hide the crufty bits , it ceased to matter .
Perlmonks -
There 's just no other community like it in any language that I 've found :(
I really have nothing against Perl ; I still think it 's one of the better languages out there and I sure as hell learned a lot in my years working with it .
And I do n't think that it 's dying or stagnating ;
There are just too many people with too much Perl experience and too many lines of production Perl code for that to happen anytime soon .
I 'm just trying to give you one single data point for why a programmer might be inclined to move along to something else .
I 'm also not particularly attached to Python .
It 's treated me well , but I 'm a disloyal bastard at heart and I 'll happily jump to another language when it makes sense for me ( Erlang , I 'm looking at you ... ) anders pearson
From a quick look at your webpage , it looks like you 've been out of school for five years , so your five years of coding Perl have been since getting out of school .
Do you think the ease with which you 're picking up Python could be that you 're now more experienced with computer languages in general ?
Or could it be similar to the urge to rewrite code that people have , but in this case you 're kind of rewriting the whole language that you 're using .
The grass is always greener on the other side .
By the way , if you like simple syntax , why are n't you programming in Lisp ? :)
I was writing a lot of Perl while I was in school .
Yes , part of the reason that I picked up Python quickly was that I was a more experienced programmer .
Still , since I learned Python , I 've had to occasionally go back to Perl for weeks or months at a time to work on old code and it's never gotten as comfortable as Python .
If the ease of learning a language was only ( or even mostly ) dependent on the experience of the programmer ( as you seem to suggest ) , I should have been able to go back to Perl and be even more proficient in it than I was in Python since I then had even more experience .
I love Lisp , but every time I 've attempted to use it for something non-trivial , I hit a wall usually involving libraries and cross- platform issues .
Eg , last time I attempted to write a blogging engine in Lisp , I never managed to get an ORM library , a webserver , and a templating library all installed and running at the same time in the same lisp interpreter .
One or the other seemed to have issues with SBCL , Clisp , or Allegro that I was n't able to debug .
But I keep trying once a year or so and each time I make it a little farther .
So maybe next time .
In the meantime , I do write a lot of emacs lisp and it makes me happy .

Interesting stats .
Perl gets half the share of PHP , twice the share of Python , 10 times the share of Ruby .
I guess there are n't as many PHP hackers as I thought .
Well obviously now is the time to get your foot in the door with these hot new up - and - coming languages like Pascal or Ada .
This statistics page is a lot of fun , like the computer language shootout , but I think of it for entertainment purposes only .
It 's part of a set : telephone psychics , political speeches , and computer language statistics .
You are right :
The ratings are calculated by counting hits of the most popular search engines .
The search query that is used is + " < language > programming "
...
July 's Newsflash
From this month on we also measure the hits of Google Blogs .
The languages that benefit from this are Java , Visual Basic , Ruby , and VB.
NET .
On the other hand , Ada , D , dBase , and Fortran have a lower rating now because they are not popular in blogs .

There was a funny mail from Marcelo Barros de Almeida .
He suggested to search for the query " < language > sucks " ( sorry for this term ) to get a feeling about languages that are unpopular .
The top 5 is 1 . Java , 2 . PHP , 3 . C++ , 4 . C , and 5 . Ruby .
Ok ...
This explain the high mark of Visual Basic over Perl .
Now , I will go to my blog page and fill it with " Perl programming " ... :-)
I have to wonder why you , and many others , are so concerned with what language other people use ?
It almost seems like you 're too scared to make up your own mind , when others around you claim that php / python / ruby / whatever is better .
Either Perl does what you need it to do , or it does n't , and that should be your only criteria and concern .
Stop worrying about what the rest of the fashion sheep are doing and do what works for you , If Perl is dying , this could be the start of the longest bedside vigil in history .

Well Perl could be dying .

So simple - it works for you , or it does n't .
Use it , or do n't ...
How hard is that ?
I have to wonder why you , and many others , are so concerned with what language other people use ?
As I mentioned in a previous post , I have a graphics app ( Poser ) that has a scripting interface that unfortunately uses Python .
And if I want to do some moderate modding in Civilization IV then I need to learn some Python ( the easy stuff is modifying XML files and the really hard stuff would be writing your own AI in C ) .
Anyway , the point is that the decisions of others do affect me and that is why I should be concerned about it .
I mean , I wish I could easily MOD Civ4 using Perl . :-/ -- Argel Update : Fixed a typo
My Perl wishes : that snazzy open - source apps like Muine are written in Perl , rather than C# and Python
that we have a heavily used web framework ( totally agree with chromatic that Catalyst is frightening )
that more new development occurs in Perl rather than in C# , Java , Ruby , Python ...
that Perl 6 will somehow emerge from the ashes like Firefox did from the Mozilla code base !?
To those who will say , " write it yourself ! " with regards to Perlish versions of Muine and Ruby on Rails -- I 'm not a professional programmer , or even a unprofessional one .
I 'm just a scientist and hobbyist who finds Perl occasionally useful .
The point is , I would find Perl far more useful if Perl and CPAN received the sort loving care that would ensue if it were more popularly used for new applications , i.e. if Perl were growing rather than merely " sustaining " .
Catalyst is getting better by the minute .
The installation is painless if you use Matt ’s Shadowcat installer and the docs strengthen every time the core stabilises further .
It started out scary because it went through a phase of hyperrapid development ( core infrastructure was moving around with every minor release for a while ) where it was impossible to document it properly .
Things are settling in , trust me .
As for new apps , I do n’t know why so few people write stuff with Gtk2 - Perl .
It ’s the coolest way to do GUIs I ’ve seen – quick , easy , based on a powerful toolkit , and unlike Tk , neither your app nor its code look disgusting .
I ’ve been meaning to write a GUI feed aggregator in Perl for a while ; Gtk2 - Perl will definitely be my weapon of choice for that .
Makeshifts last the longest .
What 's amazing is that the Perl community not only accepts and encourages bad code , it 's outright hostile to those who do n't .
Odd .
I tend to see the opposite .
A couple of crappy modules showed up on CPAN a few weeks ago , and both attracted a series of scathing reviews .
Check out cwd and Template .
Someone wandering into Perl for the first time would receive sufficient warning about these modules to avoid them .
This leaves the problem of older modules that do n't come up on the radar of the small core of dedicated CPAN reviewers .
I know for my own part that when I bring down a new module from CPAN that solves the problem at hand ( or not ) , I take care to find the time to write up a review .
Peer review is about as good as it gets , and further increases the value of CPAN .
While there is a lot of crap on CPAN , all the good stuff has by now begun to acquire good reviews .
In some point in the future , if a CPAN module does n't have a review , it may well mean that it is n't very good .
And note that it 's taken five years or so to get CPAN to this point .
All the other dynamic languages are that much futher behind on the curve .
I 'll switch to Ruby or Lua when they have as useful a library , and as well peer reviewed , as Perl does .
• another intruder with the mooring in the heart of the Perl
I was talking to a CS lecturer the other day about perl .
He said to me : " perl is too useful not to teach " .
I am not a snob .
I try to encourage people to use Perl .
I do however feel that there are snobs , even within Perlmonks .
But I like using Perl .
I do n't feel that my code is a mess .
Perl has n't become popular because of CGI , but because it is usefull .
Every language has shortcomings , all areas of life have idiots and fascists and snobs .
PHP is catered for web developlment .
So what .
Perl does all that and more .
A web application server ?
There are many areas which I believe can be improved .
And that takes coordination between the community .
People have to work togethor on things .
Im not saying that they are not , but they have to do it more so .
It 's not use Perl and die ;
It 's : use Perl or die ;
There are many reasons to use Perl .
When people learn it in a class , they enjoy it , and find it usefull .
One thing I have quams about is the complete over kill of available modules .
But you do n't have to use them .
Alot of them are quite usefull .
Blah blah blah ... Im off now ..
One thing I have quams about is the complete over kill of available modules .

Well , I 'm glad there are so many modules on CPAN , if only because it demonstrates how easy it is to write modules for Perl and get them published .
But I think you touch on an important point , which is that the sheer volume of modules can be daunting to someone trying to establish proficiency in Perl .
What 's needed is guidance — someone to say " These modules are worth your attention ; ignore the rest ( for now ) . "
I 'm sure there are some module review efforts out there already ... but they need to be better publicized .
PerlMonks might be a good place to host such a beast , too .
But it would need to be collaborative ; so maybe a wiki would be appropriate .
We 're building the house of the future together .

I just want to say amen brother .
We use Perl a great deal .
In some cases the CGI module was useful .
I do n't know where I would be without Perl helping me manage the network .
There might be a " holy war " over which is the best web based language .
Perl is much too useful of a language to suggest its death because of CGI .
Nobody ( I think ) mentioned that Perl is also the number 1 language for biology computing ( BioPerl ) .
Do n't take this personally Anonymous Monk , but I have a question for you :
Why are you here ?
Why ?
I 'm new here , and I 've learned a lot from the all the Monks --- including you .
But you need to learn patience .
Perl is just beginning .
The best is yet to come !
Keep the Faith !
Maybe it 's the fact that it 's 4 am in the morning .
Or maybe it 's the fact that this post , albeit it slightly more evolved and coherent , is the same song and dance we 've seen over , , and over and over .
My history is not up to date , nor do I have the patience / willpower to dig up stats and quotes about how perl faired in the past .
All I know is , I use it now for soon - to - be large web applications ( online communities , schedulers , message boards , etc. ) and it works spectacular .
Granted it 's not as shiny and easy to use right off the bat as PHP or maybe ASP , but it gets the job done , and it gets it done well , with speed and elegance .
I 'm not saying I 'm solely a perl guy , I like to write my GUIs in C++/ Delphi .
I also am planning on porting a lot of my applications to Ruby , and Python , and creating new apps in each respective language .
Why ?
because i want to .
The fact of the matter is , perl stands as my number one web application language of choice .
Regardless of whether i start to use PHP , Python , Ruby , or ASP , Perl will always have a place with what I do , not only because I 've fallen in love with almost every aspect of it , but because it works , and it always has worked .
Go post how about bad we 're dying on a PHP forum , maybe they 'll listen and make you feel good about yourself .
I 'm going to bed . meh .
My experience lately is just the opposite -- for me Perl is thriving .
I 'm not CGI - centric , rather I use Perl for core Windows system administration , log file analysis , data munging , etc. and fail to see why admins would use a scripting tool other than Perl on unix or Windows .
Granted , Windows Admins have VBScript at their disposal by default and it's a decent admin scripting choice but Active State perl is a snap to install and much more powerful ( IMHO ) than VBScript .
One thing that 's critically important to me for my Perl growth and excitement are good books ( and an active community such as perlmonks ) .
I 've learned so much from many wonderful Perl book authors that I think they are one of the keys to Perl use and growth .
Of course , the staple : " Perl Cookbook " was the first to open my eyes to the amazing power of Perl but I also highly value ( and wish for more ) Perl books catering to Windows admins .
Books from Dave Roth and Linchi Shea's are gems for Windows admins and give us so much power to monitor our enterprises .
Note : it 's rewarding to proudly display my Perl library at the entrance to my cube .
I 've had many folks ask about and borrow my Perl books and some of those folks get quickly hooked .
My two " Learning Perl " books are very worn but I feel I owe it to myself and the Perl community to play librarian with my Perl books and try to get others excited about Perl .
Just my two cents worth .
Perl is certainly not dying .
Granted - several other dynamic languages have sprung up in its wake , but I do n't see Perl suffering for it .
A wise man once said " Perl makes easy things easy , and hard things possible . "
Perl is easy to learn , and it is possible ( and often easy ) to do incredibly powerful things with Perl .
Some characteristics that make Perl easy to learn can have the negative consequence of allowing novice programmers to write poor code .
Perl is just a tool .
The Community ( and strict + warnings ) encourages good coding practices .
I think it is mostly myth that the Community encourages bad coding style .
Perhaps the " obfus " are mistaken for this ?
That said , I have to confess my own straying ways .
After 4 years of trying to pull / push / drag the rest of my company over to a LAMP Stack ( P is for Perl ) codebase , I gave up .
We 're now doing .NET and I have to admit it 's pretty nice .
I know that when Perl6 is released I will be applying much of what I have learned from C# ( delegates , static typing , etc ) and the head - start will help me write better Perl6 .
One problem I see with .NET is " There is ONE way to do it " compared with Perl 's " There 's More Than One Way To Do It ! " .
The ONE way appears easier for the rest of the developers here , but perhaps because they come from a VBScript background ( " There 's NO way to do it !! " ) and would n't know a closure , anonymous sub or regex if it bit them on the behind .
I still write plenty of Perl on my own , but for these yahoos .NET is ok .
I get more expressiveness with C# than with VBScript , and they can just point - n - click their way through stuff without learning how to code .
I enjoy coding and getting things done , therefore I use and prefer Perl .
If I were intimidated by code , or was disconnected from consequences of failure or deadlines , I might prefer some other more corporate language ( not naming names ) .
FYI , .
Net 's regexp library has at least one feature that we 'll have to wait til perl6 for : named captures .
I wrote Regexp : : NamedCaptures as an experiment to copy .
Net 's feature into perl5 but it's not something I 'd want to use heavily .
Also , .
Net has the benefit of being parrot - like .
You write code in multiple ( Microsoft only ) languages and they all compile down to the same thing .
This lets you implement different parts of your stuff in the appropriate languages .
I would n't be surprised if there was also support for your other two features : anonymous subs and closures .

Yeah , you can write .NET programs in any language , as long as it ’s C#… :-)
Makeshifts last the longest .
You write code in multiple ( Microsoft only ) languages Except for the Microsoft Only part
downvotes are bound to ensue ...
Gee - ya think ?
Sometimes I wonder why people are even here .
Somehow I find plenty of enterprise work to do with companies who are serious about having it done - and they let me do it in this " dying language " called Perl .
All I can say is wow - learn a little patience .
People are n't writing Perl6 so that the Perl community can be on the top of some chart .
It is being written to make it possible to get even more done with a beautiful language .
Whether or not the media or academia likes it is irrelevant to me ( not that my opinion matters - but I think that it might to somebody ) .
my @a=qw ( random brilliant braindead ) ; print $ a[ rand ( @a ) ] ;
Thank heavens for all those ( ...er , well , " MOST of those ... " ) who write about code .
I frequently benefit from their wisdom .
And that 's certainly true about parts of this thread .
But / me can't help but wonder whether it might not be well to shift some of the energy going into comment here back to coding , per se .
I - for one -- would rather spend time writing code and reading about better ways to do so .
No -- I 'm not implying that I see this thread as an example of the usual " religious wars " claptrap about why X is ( insert laudatory or disparaging verb here ) than Y ... but ( pretty please ? ) can we go back to being a quiet little Monastery on a hill , standing apart from that which even smacks of jihadism / crusading / suchlike ?

Re : a better web platform , one way to get ahead would be to solve the C10 K problem - http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html.
The whole CGI / FCGI thing is a dead end .
In - process solutions like mod_php and mod_perl take you a little further but not far , unless you 're 100 % thread safe , and even then , there 's a limit .
Solution : a Pure Perl web server based on async IO , with a decent API , and relevant modules ( e.g. session handling ) bundled .
And decent API does not mean CGI - like - see http://www.mnot.net/blog/2003/12/08/http_api.
It also does n't mean Catalyst , which inverts the problem to " many verbs via a single controller " .
Check out web.py's API ( http://webpy.org/).
And see STREST - http://duncan-cragg.org/blog/post/strest-service-trampled-rest-will-break-web-20/
Practically perlbal seems to be the best candidate ( http://www.danga.com/perlbal/) - repurpose as an application server and you 've got an edge over the competition , for everyone that wants serious scaling .
Sure it 's not a solution for the low end user but right now there 's effectively nothing that a high end user can take seriously , other than Java .
Perlbal has already got async IO going on plus it 's served enough requests to be regarded as fairly robust .
Someone has already thought about it : http://lists.danga.com/pipermail/perlbal/2006-May/000205.html
Speaking of Perl is dying ..
http://www.slimdevices.com/ has made this product " Squeezebox " which is totally written in Perl .
So , yea , Perl seems dead to me ...
Yes ... but I am trying two months ago to get the Nokia SDK for to start programming Perl at my nokia 6600 and I do n't have support ... :-(
I 've been a Perl developer for 8 years .
I 've seen a steady delcine in sales , and a steady increase in PHP 's popularity .
I have no doubt that Perl is no longer king .
PHP , while it may not be as powerful with RegExps , is where the masses have moved to .
Proof can be found in google .
Results 1 - 10 of about 2,070,000 for perl script .
( 0.23 seconds ) Results 1 - 10 of about 11,400,000 for php script .
( 0.11 seconds ) PHP , accoring to google is 5 time more popular than perl .
2 - 3 years ago they were on par .
2 - 3 years before that Perl was 5 times more popular than PHP .
In repsonse to comments about hacks , I 'm sure there are many millions of PHP hacks also .
The question is why this happened and my answer is that while Perl hackers were so concentrated on scaling - meaning up - scaling - PHP took the world by concentrating on down - scaling .
So , who are all these Monks who are using it ?
Last I checked there were > 37 K
Monks ; of these , a smaller number is active , but there are still lots of people out there using Perl .
You seem to be saying that Perl is little more than a Web language .
While CGI was one reason why people used Perl , it was n't the only one , nor was it the most important .
Yes ,
Perl is being edged out by other Web - oriented languages , but these tend to be fairly limited in their uses .
It 's a niche , and perl is far too big to fit into it .
You say that a person who is new to Perl is confronted by a lot of ASCII .
You run into this a lot - it 's not unique to Perl .
They 're all a mystery when you 're first starting out .
The objection to Perl being used mostly by amateurs is invalid .
Again , this is n't unique to Perl , but applies to most languages I 've ever seen .
Of course , as an amateur , I may not see the * real * languages that the big boys use ...
Still , no language is immune from bad programming or amateurs .
If Perl really dies , it will be because something better has come to take its place .
If that happens , then I 'll reluctantly say goodbye to an old friend , and move on .
But so far , I have n't seen anything come even close to what I value in Perl - ease of use , flexibility , freedom of choice , power , and - perhaps the single most valuable feature - CPAN .
Most of the things I want to accomplish already have a module that does them , or that I can use as a start .
I do n't see this with other languages ( they may exist - but I 've never found anything like CPAN ) .
You made an interesting claim - that Perl needs to come up with something as easy to install as PHP or Ruby in Rails .
I find that interesting , because I have never yet managed to get either of those installed .
They are the * only * languages that I 've had problems installing .
PHP and RoR defeated me .
Of course , I did n't really care about that , because I had Perl , and had little trouble getting it to work .
I did n't bother to track down whatever I was doing wrong with PHP and RoR , and fix it .
Not much incentive .
You referred us to " Code Complete " for advice on how to write better programs .
This book is published by Microsoft Press .
If their software is any indication of what the book will help me to accomplish , I 'll pass .
I 'd be a whole lot more impressed if the publisher 's parent company actually produced decent software , following their own guidelines .
I think Perl may be able to echo Mark Twain 's response to finding his obituary published in the papers : " News of my demise has been greatly exaggerated " .
Rejecting " Code Complete " out of hand because it 's published by Microsoft Press is incredibly close - minded .
You would do well to reconsider .
I consider it to be one of the most significant programming books ever written and I'm a card - carrying Free Software Zealot ( been using GNU / Linux as my only OS since 1999 ) with no particular love for Microsoft .
I know there are plenty of far better programmers than I who would agree .
anders pearson
I do n't reject " Code Complete " out of hand .
I bought and read it .
I reject it because I read it from cover to cover , and found that its advice was either little more than common sense , or ideas that were too awkward to put into practice .
In my opinion , Microsoft software is of poor quality .
I can only conclude that they have so little confidence in their own book that they do n't practice what they preach - in which case , they 're hypocrites ; or , they * do * follow their own precepts , in which case , they do n't work .

I agree , but Perl can be saved , and honestly , it would n't take the stuff that you 're talking about .
All it takes is a few more killer apps like WebGUI and SpamAssassin to bring it back to life .
It requires developers to take off their developer hats , and stop writing perl modules as stand alones and start writing " Products " .
Perl is a giant mess of projects , but has only a couple real products .
And that 's it 's problem .

The rails - like thing that perl programmers need is ... Rails !
As someone who used to use Perl for CGI and mod_perl and embedded perl ( Mason / Embperl ) , Ruby is now my main focus .
For me , one of the brilliant thing about ruby is it took everything I loved from perl .
So there is nothing I miss .
There is no reason to look back .
Imitation might be the best form of flattery , but it also left perl as completely irrelevant for me .
I was hoping someone could compile Ruby to Parrot but now I wonder if that will be finished .
I 've been a big fan of Perl for many years .
I agree with the author of this article .

I am not even going to pretend that I am Perl programmer .
Perl gained popularity because of CGI .
CGI has lost its popularity and Perl has gone back to what it was , a niche language .
Perl could have held on to its popularity had it been an easy language like PHP .
The average person is not smart enough to handle everything Perl has to offer .
PHP is far less complicated .
For the same reason , Visual Basic was / is popular and Java eventually has pushed out C ++.
どうもコメント欄の論争が過熱気味なのでクールダウンをしようとしていたのですが、うまくいきません。どうにもこうにも過熱の一途です。これは当ブログだけで勝手に過熱しているのかと思えばそうでは無いようです。どうも医師ネット世論全体が過熱しているように感じます。極北の議論が続く某掲示板はもとより、比較的穏健なスタイルであったブログ系も意見がどこも過熱しつつあるようです。
過熱化した意識変化はどんなものかと考えると、ほんの半年前までは「焼野原懸念論」が一定の勢力があったのに、現在では「焼野原待望論」が完全に主流になってきていると言うことです。これは問題を突き詰めていくと当然の帰結とも考えられます。去年の福島の事件を契機に多くの医師が医療危機に関心を寄せました。ネットにドッと進出した医師たちは盛んに情報交換、情報収集を行ないます。集まった情報と自分の身の回りに起こっている変化をつなぎ合わせると、自分が苦しいのは自分が勤めている病院の特殊事情ではなく、全国の病院に広く起こっている現象であるとの結論に速やかに到達します。
日本全国どこも苦しいという結論から次に展開するのは、このままでは到底持ちこたえられないです。苦しさは長年積みあがった構造的なものであり、一人の医師が個人的な努力でどうにかなるものでないのはすぐにわかります。その見解の上で医療政策を見れば、やっている事がいかに的外れで絶望的なものであるか理解します。そこから発生する現象が逃散です。
逃散すると言っても日本中の医師が逃散できるものでもなく、当然のように踏みとどまって戦う医師も沢山います。そんな医師たちが持っていた危機意識が「焼野原懸念論」です。そうはなってはならないです。「焼野原懸念論」の立場で多くの情報発信がなされました。今でもこれは続けられています。焼野原懸念論者は政府の政策に噛み付き、マスコミ報道の偏向振りに憤り、医療訴訟のトンデモさを糾弾します。
焼野原懸念論者の分析は詳細を極め、またこれに多くの賛同者が現れ議論は深まっていきます。ところが知識が増え、議論が深まるとやがて大きな壁に突き当たる事になります。どんな方向から議論を進めても最後に当たる壁です。医療は国策であり、国が方針を変えない限り、医療は救いようが無いという壁です。
これもまたすぐに分かるのですが、国の医療への方向性はあまりにも明瞭です。明瞭な上に強固です。強固に定められた方向性は医師だけが声を上げてもなんの影響も無いのです。国の方針を変えられるのは国民だけなのです。国民が医療が焼野原になってもらったら困ると感じ、世論として巻き起こらない限り、国の強固で明瞭な方向は絶対に変わらない事が痛いほどわかります。
ところが医師以外の国民の医療への意識は希薄です。医療への論評はネット医師の執拗な努力によって幾分かは変化しましたが、圧倒的多数派は無関心か、これまで営々とマスコミが作り上げた「高慢な医師像」のステレオタイプの見解からほとんど動きません。この反応の鈍さに焼野原懸念論者たちも絶望の影を深くしています。「これでは百年河清を待つのと同じだ、到底間に合わない」です。
これがどれほどの深みと広がりを持つか計りかねていましたが、今日ついに決定的とも言える証拠を読んでしまいました。医療系ブログの中でも穏健な良識派で知られたある産婦人科のひとりごとのエントリーにそれはあります。謹んで引用させて頂きます。
ここの管理人氏の事はネット医師なら誰でも知っています。ここの管理人氏が福島事件以来、いかに誠実に医療危機問題を論じ、医療が健全になって欲しいと祈りつつ、常に良識的建設的な提言を行ない続けてきた事を誰もが知っています。その管理人氏をしてここまでの意見表明に変化しています。
流れは完全に変わりました。変わったと言うかステージが上がったとした方が相応しいかと感じます。流れは完全に焼野原待望論に傾き、その流れは滔々と拡がるばかりで、最早押し止めるものもいないと考えます。当ブログのコメント欄の論調の変化もそれに連動したものと素直に解釈できます。
今日の 「ある産婦人科のひとりごと」のエントリーは、確実にまた一つの曲がり角を通り過ぎた象徴として記録する価値があると考えます。
The news is filled with alarming statistics , nonstop images of the most extreme examples , and rhetoric that becomes more frantic with each passing day .
How many epidemics are we told are now reaching “ pandemic proportions ” and that we must save the children ?
Hearing the word “ epidemic , ” let alone “ pandemic , ” leads us to instantly think of danger and crisis .
It ’s easy to believe the claims , repeat them or , worse , act on them without knowing if the information is even correct .
It never occurs to most of us to even consider that an epidemic can be created and not be due to anything ominous at all .
What if you learned that most scientists do n’t see an epidemic of obesity or type 2 diabetes , but that the evidence shows very modest increases in actual numbers and that what really is at work is an epidemic of diagnosis , with a hefty dose of marketing spin ?
This morning I tried to visit a site called OLGA ( on - line guitar archive ) , a place where I had often gone in past years to check out chord progressions for pop / rock tunes .
Many guitarists had worked out tunes as best they could , then posted them at this site .
Over the years , the contributions to the site had been inconsistent on OLGA .
Sometimes many of the chords were incorrect , but they served to get you started to figure the rest out .
Some of the others progressions were truly excellent .
OLGA served as a cyber - place for thousands of guitarists to exchange chord arrangements for songs .
I ’ve played guitar for many years , and this is exactly what guitarists do in person .
It is the best way to learn tunes — we exchange scribbled out chord progressions .
But we wo n’t do this any more on OLGA .
You see , the owners of the site received a “ take down letter , ” and that was the end of OLGA .
You can read the letter here .
What are the damages , if one is taken to court ?
Up to $ 30,000 .
According to this letter , these guitarists who were merely exchanging chord arrangements were a threat to the livelihood of professional musicians who created the songs .
Never mind that all of those professionals got to be professionals by trading chord progressions .
Here is the legal basis for the take down letter .
Once again , the little person has been knocked around by big corporations .
I say this because people trying to learn how to strum tunes on their guitars do n’t have the money to pay off politicians in order to have an exception carved for their own benefit .
What if you DO have millions to spend ( i.e. , Disney ) ?
There ’s almost no limit to what money can buy .
If you are a corporation , you likely own lots of the intellectual property .
After all , you ’ve squeezed it out of your employees over the years .
And whenever you publish a tune or a photo or movie , you now have the right to monopolize it for the shorter of 95 years from publication , or 120 years from creation .
That ’s the benefit of the 1998 “ Mickey Mouse Protection Act . ”
You might be wondering how this period got to be so incredibly long .
You would n’t be the first .
After all , 50 years ago , here is what was deemed fair : “ 28 years , plus the work could be renewed for 47 years , now extended by 20 years for a total renewal of 67 years .
What is distressing to me is that there is no rational balance between the “ rights ” of corporate intellectual property owners and the right of society to freely ( eventually ) enjoy the cultural artifacts were made popular by the people , after all .
Now we know that guitar players trading chord progressions are a menace to society !
Do n’t think about it too much , though , or you ’ll realize that all prominent guitarists have traded chord progressions .
But now we know that this important part of educating future guitarists is highly illegal .
The horror . . .
Here ’s a good article on how Disney obtained the best copyright laws money could buy .
Here ’s another .
In the meantime , I ’ll be figuring out the chords to tunes more slowly , on my own .
Wolfgang Priklopil was a 44 - year - old telecoms technician More details have emerged in Austria suggesting that a woman found near Vienna on Wednesday is a schoolgirl who vanished eight years ago .
The passport of Natascha Kampusch was found at the house where she was allegedly imprisoned and the woman had the same distinctive scar as the girl .
DNA test results are due later on Thursday which Austrian police expect will confirm the woman 's identity .
The suspected kidnapper died after throwing himself in front of a train .
The man , named in Austrian media as Wolfgang Priklopil , had been chased by police earlier on Wednesday evening and his red BMW car was later found abandoned .
The schoolgirl 's disappearance at the age of 10 had sparked a huge manhunt eight years ago .
Dungeon
The woman says she is Natascha Kampusch and relatives of the missing girl say they are confident she is telling the truth .
The woman - said to be in good health - says she was abducted and held captive in a sealed garage at the house in Strasshof , in the Gaenserndorf area on Vienna 's northeastern outskirts .
Police were called when she was found staggering in a garden nearby .
It is not clear what the kidnapper 's motives were .
Police say he had no connection to the girl 's family and there had been no ransom demand .
A police investigator told the BBC's PM programme that " he gave her food , he gave her all the supplies she needed " .
" He gave her books , even taught her how to read and how to write , and mathematics and all things like this , according to what she told us . "
Police have searched the garage , and say it looked like a dungeon .
Austrian media report that the room had a cavity measuring four by three metres ( yards ) , with an entrance measuring 50 cm by 50 cm .
They believe it was blocked with a sound - proof safe whenever the kidnapper left the scene .
A bed and bookshelf with children 's books were reportedly also found there .
" She is white - pale , looking as if she had been out of the light of day for a long time , but she articulated well and could read and write , " the Austria Press Agency quoted a police investigator as saying .
' Stockholm Syndrome ' APA also reported that she burst into tears on Wednesday night when she met the man believed to be her father , Ludwig Koch , at the police station .
Ms Kampusch 's disappearance in 1998 shocked Austria and triggered a search that extended into Hungary and included the dredging of riverbeds .
The young woman says she was held captive for eight years According to police , before committing suicide Wolfgang Priklopil had called a friend for help on Wednesday , saying he was being pursued by police for drink - driving .
Psychologists quoted by Austrian media say they believe the woman suffered from " Stockholm Syndrome " - a psychological condition in which captives begin to sympathise with their kidnappers .
Priklopil had been questioned by police in April 1998 , as one of more than 1,000 owners of white vans .
He was later released .
A schoolfriend of Ms Kampusch had told police the girl had been abducted in a white van .
Police are investigating whether the woman had been beaten or sexually abused by the kidnapper .

そういう代理店もあるという話ではなく、そもそもどこも使っていないという話。
などと言うと 「えっ、使ってるじゃん」といわれそうだ。もちろん世の中に血液型性格判断をこれほど流布させるには広告業界がその一翼を担っているのは事実だ。
ところがだ。やや驚くべきことに実は彼らは肝心なところではこれを使うことがないのだ。モノを売るための環境作りのために血液型性格判断が生かされたことがない。
彼らにとって科学的に正しいとか正しくないとか、道義的に若干の問題があるかもしれないなんてことはほとんどどうでもよく、とにかく売るのに役に立てばいいのだ。しかし、上述のように流布させ煽ることをするだけだ（もちろんそれで活字媒体やTVのネタを作れるから全く無意味なことをしているわけではない）。
なぜかというと結構答えは簡単で「 全然役に立たない」から。
この切り口がマーケティング活動に有効ではないかと考えた業界は、実は結構古く数十年前には真面目にこの問題に取り組んだことがある。マーケティングのためのデータを収集する際に血液型データもちゃんと集めていたのだ。
上述のように、理論なんぞはどうでもいいから、とにかく何かあればいいと考える彼らだが、しかしどこをどうこねくり回しても個人の血液型と関連した性格もライフスタイルも購買行動も見つけることができなかった。もうこれに関してはあの業界では一種の黒歴史化しているので誰も触れはしない（忘れられているとも言える）。
そして、今日もどこかのキャバクラで血液型と性格の話は盛り上がっているのに、店は客の誕生日を聞くことはあっても血液型なんて聞きはしないのである。

WASHINGTON , Feb .
16 — Back when Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was first lady , no one better embodied what she once called the “ vast right - wing conspiracy ” than Richard Mellon Scaife .
Mr. Scaife , reclusive heir to the Mellon banking fortune , spent more than $ 2 million investigating and publicizing accusations about the supposed involvement of Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton in corrupt land deals , sexual affairs , drug running and murder .
But now , as Mrs. Clinton is running for the Democratic presidential nomination , Mr. Scaife ’s checkbook is staying in his pocket .
Christopher Ruddy , who once worked full - time for Mr. Scaife investigating the Clintons and now runs a conservative online publication he co-owns with Mr. Scaife , said , “ Both of us have had a rethinking . ”
“ Clinton was n’t such a bad president , ” Mr. Ruddy said .
“ In fact , he was a pretty good president in a lot of ways , and Dick feels that way today . ”

Heh , just posted in the thread for last years version of this ah anyway .
Great work !
Have n't had time to rifle through all this text , anyway have you noted that a large part of the national debt is also because of military spendings .
My opinion on the military then , brace yourselves here comes opinions ; A strong military is needed for a superpower like the US but it has grown vastly out of proportion to need .
The problem with such a monstrous military funding is that what we have here is what dear old Eisenhower called a military industrial complex , which means that you cannot lower military spending because that would mean that people lose jobs , and the economy would suffer because of it as well as making people unhappy so that politicians lose votes .
So we have a nation dependent on their military to support their economy .
Russia has already fallen into that sinkhole and so has the US .
Much of the military spending of the US are spent on mostly useless Hi-tech hardware .
When most of the potential enemies of the US have weaponry that could n't even hope to glance the armour of a US Apache / M1A2 Abrams , etc why do the US need to invest in even more hi tech things ?
China is so economically involved in the US that a war is economically impossible .
North Korea may have a large army but their tech is subpar .
Still the US invests in useless hardware like Hi Tech submarines and jet fighters ( like the F - 22 ) even though current hardware is quite enough to do the job .
I would not be so biased that I would say that this caused the Iraq war , but there is a saying .
'' If the only tool you have is a hammer , you tend to see every problem as a nail . ''
The US has a military addiction , which worries me because when America goes ill it affects all of us .
Well that 's my 5 cent .
The US is definitely better than China , Russia and other totalitarian states but the US aims to be a democracy and a state to look up to unlike other oligarchys .
It 's difficult to improve if you are n't aware of your shortcomings .
I criticise USA because I care for her , not because I hate her .
This was copy pasted from a post in last years version of this .

SCO has " willfully " failed to comply
She lambastes them for beating on the " good faith "
She uses their own interrogatories against them
She hammers their " newly renewed all new motion to recompel " behavior .

" Given the amount of code that SCO has received in discovery the court
finds it inexcusable that SCO is in essence still not placing all the details on
the table . "
The judge has made it clear that she understands the case , and is sick and tired
of SCO 's games - playing .
The dismisal on the grounds of vagueness also has clear
ramifications for the so - called expert reports , and the folks at BSF should be
plenty nervous about the next ruling .
Bliss :)

The judge in this document outlines the " story to date " , and seen in this form you can track how she came up with the decision .
I quite like this bit at the start of Section I : SCO 's Public Statements .
As repeatedly noted by IBM , concurrent with SCO 's court filed allegations has been SCO 's siren song sounding the strength of its case to the public .
Look at the definition of Siren Song .
And this was written by the judge .

We already knew Judges Wells and Kimball were on to SCO and upset about it .
My
concern was whether Magistrate Judge Wells would be able to find legal
justification for the huge step of ditching the only SCO claims with a decent
chance of surviving summary judgment motions .
Well , we have the answer : a
resounding " YES ! "
In fact , the claims left are some of the easiest to
refute , for instance , the negative know - how items .

Here are my favorite bits from the ruling .
Does n't look like she 's pulling any punches on this one : ... the court finds that SCO has failed in the part to meet the level of specificity required by this court 's orders and the order entered by Judge Kimball .
It is also apparent that SCO in some instances failed to meet the level of specificity it required of IBM .
Further , this failure was willful under case law and prejudicial to IBM .
And she goes on at some length about what she means by " willful " too .
Apparently she 's a bit miffed that -- with every scrap of AIX , Dynix , Linux and SCO UNIX available to them -- SCO could n't do a better job of identifying code .
So I guess IBM coughing up a fully configure MVCS machine was worth it .
Nor did it help that SCO was simultaneously demanding source code themselves .
After reviewing the record , the court has not found any evidence that SCO abandoned the level of specificity it required from IBM in its first set of interrogatories , to wit , " identification of the specific lines and portions of code " . . .>
If IBM could come up with all that code , why could n't SCO ?
And it looks like the repeated re-renewed reiterations of the motions to compel bit them too : Given SCO 's track record in this case , the court is certain that if IBM had simply provided line information without version and file information for " methods , " SCO would have filed motions to compel complaining about IBM 's lack of specificity .
She goes on like that for a long time and -- somewhere around page thirty -- reaches the conclusion that SCO really did need to provide source code .
Based on the forgoing , the court finds that methods and concepts can be identified in source code and that under the court 's orders SCO was required to provide the source code behind them .
Remember when Wells got peeved with SCO for expanding her orders by claiming they were n't clear , but not asking for clarification ?
Looks like they did it again .
IBM warned SCO that if the final submissions were of the same level of specificity court intervention would be sought .
Tellingly , SCO did not seek court guidance as to the required level of specificity after IBM disagreed with SCO 's interpretation of the court 's orders .
But my all time favorite is this one .
It 's the kind of stuff I expect to see in Groklaw or the other discussion forums , but it 's way cool to hear a judge say it .
The court finds SCO 's arguments unpersuasive .
SCO 's arguments are akin to SCO telling IBM sorry we are not going to tell you what you did wrong because you already know .
...
Given the amount of code that SCO has received in discovery , the court finds it inexcusable that SCO is in essence still not placing all the details on the table .
Ceritainly if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking out of Neiman Marcus they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole .
That 's my list .
Feel free to make your own ; there 's a lot of fun reading in this one .
The bit that survived included three bits where SCO theorized " negative know how " ( i.e. , they learned from UNIX not to do it this way ) .
The judge called the theory " quite a tenuous position " but , since it explained them not having source code , she left those bits in .
She also left in some parts which really are n't about copying code .
They go to the theory that somebody who worked on AIX is contractually forbidden from contributing to Linux .
But that 's it .
The bulk of what IBM wanted out is gone .
It 's been a good day .

There is no evidence before the court to indicate that SCO lacked the ability to comply with the courts orders .

Typo : page 8 : " SCO 's trademark claims " - I think that it 's pretty
apparent , Wells meant " SCO 's trade secret claims "
Killer underlining : Page 11 : " After reviewing the progress of the case upto
that point , the court lifted the discovery stay in the light of " SCO 's good
faith efforts to comply with the discovery order " " .
--- " upto
that point " being underlined , to emphasize the finding of " SCO 's good
faith efforts " does n't necessarily apply to SCO 's subsequent actions ,
despite SCO 's protestations to the contrary .

177 items down at a stroke !
This is indeed very good .
After tSCOg complained that Randall Davis wandered off into opining about " wilfulness " , Wells sticks a pointed boot in by echoing precisely what Randall Davis quoted on the subject .
She also produces her own octavo version of Kimball 's Lament , that tSCOg had so amazingly failed to back up its large claims , not only claims against IBM but claims to have evidence , with actual production .
Davis claimed that NONE of the items on tSCOg 's list actually complied with the orders for specificity .
The decision to move against only 188 of them at this point was an interesting judgment call .
By the look of things , IBM and its legal team made very judicious decisions on what to move to strike in the motion .
Only getting 11 items out of 188 denied is extremely good going , particularly when the relief being asked was ( as Wells says ) so hard on tSCOg .
We 'll have to see whether IBM is equally successful in moving for PSJs .
A different judge , and different rules .

There 's been a lot of criticism of Wells for not slapping SCO down sooner .
But what 's generally been ignored is that she 's limited ( in a practical sense )
to ruling on motions raised by either party .
I believe , though I may be wrong , that she could legally have decided at any
point to unilaterally slap SCO down for their antics .
But that would be an open
invitation for SCO to come up with some garbage accusation of " bias "
on appeal .
And Wells , Kimball , IBM and World + dog know that they 'll jump on any such chance
to run their scam for another couple of years .

Good Evening
All ,
I think the Judge has made a mistake in the order .
On page 32 is the sentence :
" Based on the foregoing , the court finds that SCO has had
ample opportunity to articulate , identify and substantiate its claims against
SCO . "
I think she meant : Based on the foregoing , the court finds that SCO has had
ample opportunity to articulate , identify and substantiate its claims against
IBM .
1 ) Am I correct that an error exists here ?
2 ) If I am correct , how serious is this ?

Unless there is a total disconnect between the two judges
( and the Magistrate and District Judges work hand in hand ) ,
we can surmise that the other IBM motion will also be
granted .
IBM has asked that no new material other than that disclosed
in December be used .
It does not ask for specific parts of
the expert declarations be tossed , only sets up the stage
for it .
In order to be consistent with Well 's order , it seems obvious that IBM 's motion
would also be granted .
Otherwise
SCO can simply introduce by expert testimony that which
Wells just threw out .
Kimball could n't really rule without Well 's going first ,
so there is the first punch of the one - two .

Some gems ( line breaks added in some places to make it readable )
Page 32
" Based on the foregoing , the court finds that SCO has had ample opportunity
to articulate , identify and substantiate its claims against SCO ( Sic , should be
IBM ) ..
The court further finds that such failure was intentional and therefore
willfull based on SCO 's disregard of the court 's orders and failure to seek
clarification .
In the view of the court it is almost like SCO sought to hide it 's case until
the ninth inning in hopes of gaining an unfair advantage despite being
repeatedly told to put " all evidence ... on the table .
Accordingly , the court finds that SCO willfully failed to comply with the
court 's orders . "
Page 33 - 34
" The court finds SCO 's arguments unpersuasive .
SCO 's arguments are akin to
SCO telling IBM sorry we are not going to tell you what you did wrong because
you already know .
SCO received substantial code from IBM pursuant to the court's
orders as mentioned supr .
Further , SCO was required to disclose in detail what
it feels IBM misappropriated .
Given the amount of code that SCO has received in
discovery the court finds it inexcusable that SCO is in essence still notplacing
all the details on the table .
Certainly if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking
out of Neiman Marcus they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly
stole .
It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that " you know
what you stole I 'm not telling "
Or , to simply hand the accused individual a
catalog of Neiman Marcus ' entire inventory and say " its in there somewhere ,
you figure it out . "
Ladies and gentlemen , a lot of folks have said unknind things about the Judges
in this case .
including myself .
How would we like our crow cooked ?

This is ART !
It severely limits what SCO can actually take to trial .
I
particularly enjoyed how SCO 's initial trumpeting has been brought back against
them , and the judgement that their actions , or lack of , are wilfull .

I think it 's safe to say that this is the watershed we 've all been waiting for .
SCO has gotten chance after chance , and gambled that pulling the same stuff
would work here .
The last hearing , where the judge told them about
reinterpretting her orders and not seeking clarification , should have signaled
SCO that they had hit the PNR .
This can only be the beginning .
They are now limited to certain things , and

I 'm suprised at the style and tone of this document .
I've
been totally exasperated at how slow things have moved , how
patient the judges have been , giving SCO chance after chance ,
after chance .
By reading between the lines , we 've been
able to tell that the Judges were losing their patience a bit ( e.g. Judge
Kimball with his : " is that all you 've got ? " ) .
And then this .
I was expecting this result but not the tone .
Judge Wells
could have been very clinical in the wording .
This reads like she ran out of
patience .
After 3 years it 's about time !!!
Finally !!!!
One thing is clear : they can't play games with this judge anymore .

Well , you know , this is really good .
I was getting worried because it had been
over a month since this garbage happened .
The judges made their decision a long time ago .
They communicated it with
crystal clarity .
At the last minute SCO / BSF told them they were wrong .
Everyone knew it was completely inappropriate .
Everyone knew it was a bogus
claim .
Everyone knew SCOG needs to argue on specifics ( and WE all know they
wo n't be able to ) .
But to be quite honest , I thought the judges would cave once
again in what has been a giant joke of a trial ( that was still being fought over
what it would be about ) .

For years some of us had predicted that the courtroom shenanigans of BSF / SCO were partly designed to so peeve the judges as to get them to over - react and thus give BSF / SCO a redo by claiming that the judges were prejudiced against them .
Judge Wells had many harsh words for SCO in this ruling .
Do any of the legal eagles here know if this is going to give SCO a shot at successfully complaining about the judges ?

What we see here is a magistrate who precisely understands SCO 's nature : Given SCO 's track record in this case , the court is certain that if IBM had simply provided line information without version and file information for methods ,  SCO would have filed motions to compel complaining about IBM 's lack of specificity .

( Seeing as there 's no corrections thread ) PJ writes :
What 's left in the case ?
Only item numbers 23 ( about " negative know how " regarding EES , an " error event subsystem " in Dynix / PTX ) , 43 ( " learning from TCP failures to help networking and storage for Linux " ) , 90 ( " avoiding a logging event that caused problems in PTX ) , 94 and 186-192 ( about Dynix again ) .
That 's it .
That 's all the case is about now .
This may be an exaggeration .
There are also 90 - something items that were n't challenged in the current motion .

- 1 . Yet to read PJ 's article .
This is a personal risk , SCOish even .
0 . Thirty - nine pages .
Did she get leave to file an overlength order ?
" Granting in Part . "
I wonder if SCO got left with a part they really
wanted .
Let 's see .
1 . It is simple , well - written , authoritative , powerful , with devastating
factual arguments .
She repeatedly uses SCO words and actions against them .
She
lines up with Kimball .
It is a decision difficult to assail .
2 . She lists some of SCO 's specific claims and their demands for specificity
from IBM .
This is quite devastating .
She is VERY familiar with the record .
McBride and Sonntag 's words have come back to haunt them .
The millions of lines
and the MIT deep divers are all referenced by her .
She spends over 17 pages on
the discovery history including the Motion to Strike .
She lived it and reviewed
it .
3 . She discusses specificity : what IBM defined and demanded , what SCO defined
and demanded , what Kimball ordered .
She knows the record .
In a most
devastating fashion to SCO she quotes Kimball rebuking SCO for its lack of
specificity , the " ... vast disparity between SCO 's public accusations and
its actual evidence - or complete lack thereof ... " p. 27 .
Then there is her
line " Given SCO 's track record in this case . "
They demanded the same
specificity from IBM .
Then she uses SCO 's own Sandeep Gupta 's words on the
necessity of file , line , and version against them .
And this is for methods and
concepts .
She also notes that lines are needed for copyright registration .
A
strong argument .
p. 29 .
4. Willfulness :
She discusses how noncompliance arises from intentional
failure or inability .
Wrongful intent is not required for willfulness .
Then
she crams some more SCO words down their throat : " given SCOs own public
statements outlined in part supra , it would appear that SCO had more than enough
evidence to comply with the courts orders .
p. 31 .
She notes IBM gave them
another chance .
SCO never asked for clarification .
She also uses a
" ninth - inning " baseball analogy which seals her conclusion of
willfulness .
p. 32 .
5. Prejudice : Look at her argument about code on page 34 .
She really
understands how IBM is prejudiced without specific code .
She finds prejudice
based on the delay and burden to IBM at this late stage .
6 . The Specifics :
She denied striking some " negative know how "
claims .
Even in doing that she made sure to disparage the possible merits of
any claim .
She also reminded SCO that they had to specify their misappropriated
items .
p. 36 .
The rest of the specifics are best left to the coders and
attorneys up to snuff .
7 . The Risk of an appeal to Kimball .
SCO can appeal to Kimball immediately if
they really want something that has been excluded .
Why bother ?
Why risk it ?
Kimball is in no way more sympathetic than Wells .
They probably have to
" go through the motions " lest they be attacked by their client for not
doing so .
IBM will oppose and cross-appeal .
Do they really want to give IBM
another crack at the rest ?
If IBM does n't cross appeal , presume they consider
what remains " sitting - duck " material .
SCO runs the risk of losing the
rest of what IBM moved to strike .
SCO may also gain a little .
This decision
takes on presumptive power .
It is not going to be disturbed without finding a
severe abuse of discretion by the court .
It 's not there to be found .
It will
sound reasonable to Kimball .
Why do all that work when Wells already did .
She
did a good job .
[ 8 . A good exercise would be to go back and see which of her arguments were
made by IBM in Motion and Reply .
The decision would be that much more
impressive if many of her arguments were original .
The Q - Mass team could do
this in a few seconds . ]

After scanning through the PDF text of Judge Wells ' decision , I have a number early comments to make : I read Judge Wells ' decision with great delight .
Seeing that Discovery in this case is nearly at its end ( barring a rising creek ) this likely will be near the end of the series of decisions she 's had to make in SCO v. IBM .
Within the constraints of her position as Magistrate Judge , issues of equity and fairness were foremost in her mind , and it showed .
She seemed to cover every argument thoroughly , and explained her decisions in admirable detail .
Was the good judge reading my earlier commentary here on Groklaw on what the basic arguments and issues were in this motion ?
Or do great minds just think alike ? ;-)
Justice was not only done here , it was seen to be done .
Judge Wells gives us some additional tidbits about some of the remaining claims in the text , even though the full claims themselves were filed under seal .
It would be good to update the SCO Claim Table with this latest intelligence .
The ( less than a dozen ? )
SCO claims that were contested in this motion that remain did so because they were deemed specific enough .
Issues of contractual chattelry and negative knowledge will have to be dealt with at Summary Judgement time , even though they are highly questionable for a number of reasons .
( Wells labeled the negative knowledge argument as " tenuous " . )
Wells was careful , and treated the claims in question separately or in small groups .
That 's why she took a long time , I think .
This decision will almost certainly be supported by Judge Kimball .
All in all , the text of her decision is not a bad piece of work .
Not bad at all .

Although the court did not specifically say version and file in its orders , the court finds that this information was inherent within the court 's ordering of " specific lines . "
The court agrees with IBM 's argument that line information without version and file information is not very specific and makes identification of what is at issue much more difficult .
I have n't gone back to the original order to check but , if it really said " specific lines " , then that is not the same a " specific line numbers " .
IBM ( and hence Judge Wells ) could have avoided the whole problem by pointing this out .
If SCO just provided line numbers , IBM could say " we want lines i.e. the actual text of the line " .
That would make it much easier to identify regardless of file and version .
Although file , version , and line is even better !

" She also applauds lawyers for their civil conduct in her courtroom .
There is , however , one area that has surprised her .
 On the limited number of civil matters that I have had hearings on , I have been astounded at the sheer volume of paper which , when reduced to its principal elements , is much less in terms of what really is relevant to the topic . 
Her advice , particularly to civil litigators , is to cut to the chase in motion practice .
For lessons on trial practice , look to the criminal bar "
In a case I was an expert witness on , we got about 4 cases of half inch tapes ( 2400 ' ) and several cases of printouts from the other party in a civil matter .
I do n't think that much of it ended up being useful , as Judge Wells points out here .
Also , the " cut to the chase " is the best advice missed by SCO here , if this turns out to stick .

Even as a non-native English speaker I am struck by her effective use of colloquialisms where needed to emphasize how silly SCO has been at times .
Down to earth when in place .
Just one of a half a dozen examples :
" Certainly if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after walking out of Neiman Marcus they would expect to be eventually told what they allegedly stole .
It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that  you know what you stole I m not telling .

The precision is there . :)

If I understand correctly , counterclaim 10 is that Linux contains no code owned
by SCO or even unix code in general .
Are we in a position now where a summary
judgement on counterclaim 10 is almost automatic ?
" 173 .
IBM is entitled to a declaratory judgment pursuant to 28 U. C. 9 2201
that IBM does not infringe , induce the infringement of , or contribute to the

When discussing items 94 & 186 to 192 , which she left standing , Magistrate Wells provides a direct quote of " Under SCO 's interpretation of the contracts at issue , IBM is prohibited from having former Dynix / ptx developers write source code for Linux " .
A search for " ibm is prohibited from having former " fails to find any matches on Groklaw .
So a couple of questions :
Is this the first we have heard of this ?
;
Does anyone know where the quote comes from ?
( It is likely within the redacted portions of their memorandum ) ;
Do we have any idea what items 94 & 186 to 192 are ?

In short , no I am not happy .
Yes , I am very happy for this ruling in this situation , and I love seeing SCO
get trounced like this , but .....
What I * REALLY * wanted to see was SCO to move forward in December with a list of
thousands of claims against IBM and Linux , each one backed up with hundreds of
lines of source code ( with file , line and version information ) .
Then I wanted this to go to trial .
Then I wanted to see a jury and judge rule in IBM 's favor .
That is the * ONLY * way that Linux can put all this FUD behind it .
I think it is a foregone conclusion that IBM will prevail if anything survives
until trial , and it will win many a summary judgement .
** BUT ** there will still be the cloud hanging over all this that is SCOG saying
" IBM got away with something " .

SCO whined incessantly about how needed AIX and Dynix source cose - ALL of it -
in discovery , but thier final list of allegedly abused material supposedly cited
only 697 lines of code .
I wonder if this contributed to Wells ' decision .
I would think that the methods and concepts items could have been detailed much
earlier .
If SCO really DID need all that AIX and Dynix source to find these
items , they should have had no problem identifying the relevant code .
The
conclusion I reach is that SCO either :
1 ) Planned all along to claim the methods and concepts items , but deliberately
delayed revealing them until the last possible moment , or
2 ) Did find the methods and concepts in the AIX and Dynix code , and thus should
have had no problem identifying the code with the required specificity .
Either way , it looks like SCO was trying to avoid obeying the court 's orders .

history , and after giving SCO every opportunity to make its case , made the right
decision .
I laughed !
I cried !
It was beautiful .

In describing the Cargill report in IBM's Reply Memo in Support of Motion to Confine / Strike SCO 's Claims , IBM mentions that SCO 's Final Disclosures identify only 326 lines in total in the Linux kernel .
SCO has previously shown examples of what it claimed were lines improperly copied into Linux .
Has anyone gone back and counted the lines they 've previously cited to see if we 've now seen all the Linux kernel lines in the Final Disclosures ?
Of course , this exercise would be a bit error - prone , because many of the previous examples have been shown to come from BSD or elsewhere , so it is possible that SCO decided not to include them in the Final Disclosures .
On the other hand , they are still harping on JFS , ELF , etc. [ Reply to This | # ]

Based on this this ruling , can IBM get damages or reembersement for legal costs
related to all the items that are part of the sanction , due to the judge calling
SCO 's actions willful ?
Not asking if IBM will , just asking if they can .

Judge Wells says :
" This court further finds that Judge Kimball intended the same level of
specificity in his July 2005 order which provided what amounted to a date
certain for the parties to define their case . "
Does this signal that SCO will NOT be allowed to continue adding new charges at
any time , now that the " date certain " has passed ?
Will Judge Wells grant IBM 's latest motion to limit SCO 's expert reports , where
claims in excess of those from Dec 22 , 2005 were added ?

Okay 200 odd items are eliminated from this case as being too vague .
But Wells goes out of her way to say that she is n't ruling on the merits of
these items .
So question : Can SCO try to reintroduce these 200 odd items , into the other
cases , when the other cases ( AutoZone , RedHat , Novell ) eventually come back to
life ?

I noticed that this came out right after IBM turned in their rebuttal on the
contest expert witness testimony .
Might the judge have been waiting for that .
If
this ruling came out a few days ago , I bet IBM would have been awfully tempted
to refer to it in their rebuttal , but perhaps that is unfair because SCO had no
access to it when doing their reply .

IBM has contested both SCO 's list of misused materials and their expert witness
reports .
SCO does n't appear to be even attempting to do the same with IBMs
materials .
Yes , I know , IBM does n't make the same kinds of mistakes , but when has that
stopped SCO before ?
Is this more evidence of SCO's ( BSF's ) growing frugality on legal costs ? [ Reply to This | # ]

There has been lots of talk of SCO appealing the results of this trial .
If they
do , wo n't they have to post an appellate bond in the amount of any money 's
awarded to IBM ?
Lets say IBM gets awarded $ 100,000,000 for their counterclaims .
Wo n't SCO have
to do a $ 100,000,000 appellate bond ?
If so , how would they fund it ?
PIPE fairy ?
I guess they could appeal the findings on the claims but not the counter claims ,
but if , as everybody seems to expect , the counterclaim awards are large enough
to bankrupt SCO , will there be enough left of SCO to fight the findings on the
claims ?
Or will the big bankruptcy court in the sky have to decide such issues ?

3SCO submitted its alleged misappropriated materials on CD - ROM .
The court has reviewed all of the disputed items individually .
In other words , " Do n't try running to Judge Kimball and claiming that I did not review all if the items . " .

I 'm wondering if we 'll actually see any appeals .
Everyone expects appeals in any
long court case , but if SCO ultimately loses and then appeals , I do n't think it
will matter .
The gig will be up before the appeals are done .
Especially if all the judgements read like this !
Also , does their contract with the lawyers cover appeals ?

Judge Wells did a very thorough job .
It will be impossible for SCO to prevail on appeal .
SCO is being nailed to the wall .
Over 180 nails were just shot from the
nailgun .
Fantastic .
We are finally moving forward on this case .
I am waiting for the hearing on IBM 's motion to strike parts of SCO 's expert
witness reports .
IBM is again going to nail SCO for not following Judge Kimball 's and Judge
Well's
orders on discovery .
Hee hee hee .
This is fun .

... is that SCO will now begin crowing about these issues never having been
tested in court - that they were thrown out without discussion ( not " on the
merits " ? ) .
Will they try to use this action to feed their " IBM 's dirty tricks "
storyline ?
For sure , they 'll spin it somehow - we all know this case is n't about " the
case " ; it 's about smearing Linux , casting doubt on it .
All that said , they got what they deserved .
They never had a case - it was
always a tower of cards , and most of it just got blown down .
Now all they 've got
left are a few 2's and 3's - and maybe the jokers .
It 's not Red Dress Day yet , but maybe time to check out a few dry - cleaners in
preparation .
I just hope that this wo n't become one of those sad sequels where
the bad guy keeps coming back , despite having been " definitely killed "

" Certainly if an individual was stopped and accused of shoplifting after
walking out of Neiman Marcus , they would expect to be eventually told what they
allegedly stole .
It would be absurd for an officer to tell the accused that ' you
know what you stole I 'm not telling . '
Or , to simply hand the accused individual
a catalog of Neiman Marcus ' entire inventory and say 'its in there somewhere ,
you figure it out . '"
I love this analogy and it beautifully illustrates what SCO has been trying to
get away with .
To spoil this analogy slightly , but make it ring closer to the
truth , it could go something like this :
... Or , to simply tell the accused it is listed in one of the catalogs that
Neiman Marcus has issued to date , or one of the back - catalogs of a number of
related or unrelated stores , without giving the accused the aforementioned
catalog , letting the accused know which catalog to look for , or indicating where
said catalogs may be located ....

I 've got a legal question .
Had SCO been allowed to proceed and then lost these
motions , the questions would have been settled .
SCO would not be able to raise
them again in another case .
Is this the case now ?
Since these questions were not litigated , can SCO sue
someone else for these same things ?

So just how much of the mountains of code , to borrom a term from SCOX , ( Gee , I
hope they do n't sue me for using their hyperbole . ) that IBM delivered to them
was actually looked at , analyzed , or examined in any way ?
I am no expert , but I
suspect 99.99 % of it was never examined in any way .
I can't see how they could
have examined any sizeable portion of it without a massive number of bodies
being involved .
They only demanded all the code to annoy IBM , with no real
intent of using it .
I imagine this is a typical tactic in litigation .
Any speculation for someone more informed than myself ?

I applaud this decision as much as the next FOSS lover .
However I do n't see it as a vindication of the legal system .
Consider that a
competent , conscientious judge felt she had to endure 2 - 3 years of legal
shenanigans before she felt safe in issuing a substantive ruling .
SCO have no case .
Everyone knows they have no case and never did have .
The
judges have said as much .
Yet they still have the right to game the system , cost IBM miilions in legal
fees , spread FUD over a wonderful FOSS product , and blatanly ignore the court's
orders , and keep this up for THREE years .
Their penalty ?

" SCO spokesman Blake Stowell said Wells left strong claims asserting
line - by - line Unix code was dumped into Linux , dismissing the more generalized
claims that IBM misappropriated the architecture of Unix code . "
I have glanced at " the chart " and the only code copying that I see
remaining is JFS and NUMA ( items 1 and 2 ) .
These are based on the laughable
theory that anything included in AIX / PTX becomes tainted for all time .
But they do claim to have some SVR2 code that is copied in JFS .
Is this because
JFS was added to SVR2 ?
Or is it BSD code or otherwise released code ?
And are there any other points that refer to copied code ?
I do n't see any
obvious ones but if anybody does , please speak up .
As far as I can see , the remaining claims are :
- SCO claims that Sequent employees were prohibited from working on Linux
( I 'd like to see some evidence for that )
- SCO claims that anything in the world that has been in the same room as AIX
or Dynix is protected
- SCO claims that declining to repeat the mistakes of SYSV is a violation
I think all the " sco forum " stuff and the ABI stuff all got thrown
out .
Where 's this " line - by - line copying " claim that survives ?

CNN reporter slams Drudge 's charge that he ' heckled ' McCain ; Exclusive video confirms his claim Michael Roston and David Edwards
Published : Monday April 2 , 2007 Print This Email
This CNN reporter Michael
Ware this morning hit back at news aggregator Matt Drudge who accused him on Sunday of " heckling " Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham at a Baghdad press conference .
Video acquired by RAW STORY appeared to show a short press conference without any interruptions and with Ware himself asking no questions during the question and answer session .
On CNN this morning , Ware denied the Drudge Report " exclusive " which ran yesterday and questioned Drudge 's source .
" This is a report that was leaked by an unnamed official of some kind to a blog , to somewhere on the internet , " Ware told Soledad O'Brien this morning on CNN , according to an unofficial transcript posted at the conservative blog Power Line .
" No one has gone and put their name forward .
We certainly have n't heard Senator McCain say anything about it or any of his staff have come forward to say anything about it . "
Ware instead accused the officials running the press conference of preventing the CNN correspondent from even asking a question .
" Indeed , I did n't say a word .
I did n't even ask a question , " Ware added .
" In fact , when I raised my hand to ask a question , the press conference abruptly ended , so what I would suggest is that anyone who has any queries about whether I heckled , watch the videotape of the press conference . "
RAW STORY acquired the following video clip of the introductory remarks segment of the press conference on CNN , which did not appear to include any interruptions from Ware or other reporters .
This next video shows the Q&A , where Senator McCain and the other participants field questions from four reporters .
The Senators answer without interruption , and CNN's Ware , who appears to be sitting just in front of the camera in the full - room shots of the press conference , does not ask a question , although he does raise his hand toward the end of the clip when the Q&A is concluded .
Drudge alleged on his website yesterday that Ware had heckled the Senators during a live press conference .
" An official at the press conference called Wares conduct ' outrageous , ' saying , 'here you have two United States Senators in Bagdad [ sic ] giving first - hand reports while Ware is laughing and mocking their comments .
Ive never witnessed such disrespect .
This guy is an activist not a reporter , ' " according to Drudge 's article , which has circulated heavily on the internet .
( Screen capture here . )
Ware has criticized McCain heavily on CNN broadcasts since the Senator made his statement that certain neighborhoods of Baghdad were safe enough to walk through .
" Senator McCain 's credibility now on Iraq , which has been so solid to this point , has now been left out hanging to dry , " Ware said on CNN 's Situation Room on March 27 .
" To suggest that there 's any neighborhood in this city where an American can walk freely is beyond ludicrous .
I 'd love Senator McCain to tell me where that neighborhood is and he and I can go for a stroll . "
Michael Ware 's on air response to Drudge 's charge is included in this additional video clip from CNN's American Morning .
RAW STORY thanks MickWare.com for posting video of the press conference in question .
The Nova Scotia government is moving forward with the implementation of mandatory renewable electricity targets .
As a result of this announcement , by 2013 , almost 20 % of Nova Scotia ’s electricity will be generated by renewable energy .
In particular , they will only allow bids for renewable energy projects from independent power producers during the first target period .
With large fines planned , Nova Scotia power producers better take head , or risk paying 500,000 Canadian dollars A DAY .
â€ œCanWEA is very pleased that the government of Nova Scotia has moved to further develop the provinceâ€™s vast renewable energy resources , including wind energyâ€ says Sandra Schwartz , Policy and Government Relations Director for CanWEA ( Canadian wind energy association ) .
â€ œWind energy is a clean , low cost resource that is poised to make a substantial contribution to Nova Scotiaâ€™s future energy needs.â€ 
At present , Nova Scotiaâ€™s installed wind capacity 49.26 MW , is enough to power close to 150,000 homes .
The new regulations will cause this base to significantly increase over the next three years .
â€ œThe significance of the potential penalties for non-compliance should encourage electricity providers to obtain renewable energy at levels that exceed the mandated requirements to minimize any risk of penaltyâ€ adds Ms. Schwartz .
â€ œWe also hope the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board ( UARB ) and the Nova Scotia government will signal support for such an approach to give electricity providers comfort and encouragement to move aggressively now .
If positive steps are not immediately taken to recognize and respond to this penalty exposure , the cost of renewable energy provided to Nova Scotians may unnecessarily and sharply increase.â€ 
In addition to its environmental benefits , wind energy delivers substantial economic benefits to rural communities across Canada through investment and job creation , lease income for landowners , and a new tax base for municipal governments .
The Canadian Wind Energy Association ( CanWEA ) represents more than 280 companies involved in Canadaâ€™s wind energy industry , including wind turbine and component manufacturers , wind energy project developers , and service providers to the wind energy industry .
CanWEAâ€™s goal is to see 10,000 MW of wind energy capacity either contracted or installed in Canada by 2010 .
WASHINGTON , April 28 — Deborah Jeane Palfrey has not been at all shy about it : for more than a decade she ran an escort service that catered to upscale clients in the nation ’s capital , sending college - educated women to men ’s homes or hotel rooms .
For about $ 300 , she promised 90 minutes of what she has described as a discreet “ legal high - end erotic fantasy service . ”
But the discreet part is over , after federal authorities charged her with operating a prostitution ring .
“ The tentacles of this matter reach far , wide and high into the echelons of power in the United States , ” Ms. Palfrey wrote in a court filing last month , as she prepared to release a list of her clients ’ telephone numbers and vowed to subpoena her customers — some of whom she described as prominent Washington officials .
It is a defense strategy that had its first casualty Friday .
Randall L. Tobias , the top foreign aid adviser in the State Department , became the most prominent person on the list to be publicly identified when he resigned after acknowledging to ABC News that he was among Ms. Palfrey ’s clients .
The State Department ’s statement on Mr. Tobias ’s resignation said simply , “ He is returning to private life for personal reasons . ”
In a democracy , part of one 's civic duty is to give the government a good kick in the pants when needed .
With President Bush pursuing a growing and continued occupation of Iraq that serves only to fuel terrorism , and with Congress not yet doing what it takes to stop him , now seemed like a good time to help make the will of the people clear .
That 's why I got on a bus to the United for Peace and Justice march on Washington .
It was about 15 degrees Fahrenheit and windy in Boston when we gathered at Boston Common .
Already I was glad I 'd persuaded my wife to keep our three young children home while I represented us .
Since the buses had n't arrived yet , I told the other early arrivers about the shelter of the garage entrance where we could watch for the bus arrival without people getting frostbite .
These were dedicated people .
Sleeping on a bus is not easy , but everyone was in good spirits in the morning .
As we got out at the Greenbelt metro station , I met a family with three generations demonstrating , the youngest being 13 .
The station was already packed even though the rally was three hours away .
I managed to find a fast - moving line and had my metro ticket in twenty minutes .
People were friendly and excited with the anticipation of making a difference .
I ran into Caroline and Jessica , two of the Bostonians from Boston Common the night before .
The three of us went to the Washington Mall early to scope things out .
Already by 9:30 many had gathered with their signs for the 11:00 rally .
We took a look around until the museums opened at 10 , then visited the Air and Space museum .
I got my sign and drew my family on it in stick figure , so they could participate symbolically .
Crowds started to really pour in a little after 11 .
There were people from all generations .
Some were religious , some anti-religious .
There were communists , socialists , veterans and currently - serving military people .
Many signs urged impeachment .
Since I was with Caroline , I was allowed into an enclosed area with the speakers and their contingents .
I heard John Conyers giving an interview in which he emphasized that Congress is given the purse strings of war specifically to keep presidents like GW Bush in check .
I agree .
I got his autograph .
Sean Penn , Susan Sarandon , Tim Robbins , Jesse Jackson and other celebrities were milling about .
When the speakers finished , I handed my camera to one of the professional photographers on the raised stage to get a crowd photo .
He got one shot off and then my battery died .
I had hoped to get something that showed the magnitude of the crowd , but that turned out to be impossible .
The march began with a long period of standing .
Getting 100,000 ( my estimate ) people into a line takes time .
I started out near the Chinese - dragon - style backbone that read , " IMPEACH INDICT IMPRISON . "
This message to Congress about getting a backbone was carried all the way around the capitol building .
I saw several signs with " Mmm " and a picture of a peach .
I spent most of the march singing along with some musical Philadelphians , one of whom carried a mini banjo .
As I stood next to a strong - voiced black woman with dreadlocks , I was reminded of the movie Forrest Gump that features the awkward main character appearing in various historical scenes where he does n't belong .
I was still wearing my business - casual clothes and wool coat from the previous day , and felt like I was Forrest Gump .
We passed a group of counter - demonstrators ( estimates vary between 7 and 40 ) where the most prominent was someone with a gas mask and a sign that said " Hippies Smell . "
We chanted " Support the troops !
Bring them home ! " as we passed .
I found the entire experience exhilarating and would do it again .
The organizers estimated 500,000 at the event , which I guess might be counting everyone who made concrete plans to travel there .
CNN reported tens of thousands , a number I guess comes from a reporter looking around and saying , " I see tens of thousands . "
With the flat terrain and all the signs blocking view , any estimate based on what you personally see at one time will be low .
The police declined to estimate , presumably because of how politicized such numbers are .
For my estimate , I looked on the gmap - pedometer web site to find that the Washington Mall between 4th and 7th is about 200x400 meters .
At about 12:20 Caroline and I had walked from near 7th all the way to 4th through the crowd .
The crowd was sparse near 7th and thick near 4th , probably two people per square meter .
If I mentally push that crowd back until everybody has a comfortable 1 square meter space , I see them almost filling the rectangle .
I then mentally take the crowd that was on the other side of 4th , fill in the rest of the 200x400 rectangle to make 80,000 people in 80,000 square meters , and have roughly 20,000 people left over .
Obviously this method is imprecise , but I 'm confident enough to say that any estimate below 80,000 is too low , and any estimate above 200,000 is too high .

With gas prices hovering around $ 3 a gallon , a lot of people say they 're making big sacrifices so they can afford to fill their gas tanks .
They 're cutting back on travel , curtailing shopping expeditions , going out less often .
But hardly anyone is talking about -- or practicing -- a surefire way to save on gas :
Slow down .
Drive 55 .
" It 's amazing , is n't it ? " said Tim Castleman , a Sacramento Web site developer who runs the Drive 55 Conservation Project .
" People just do n't want to do it .
It 's hard . "
How hard ?
The drawbacks are n't measured just in terms of minutes lost .
There 's the feeling of inadequacy that comes from being flipped off by a 12 - year - old boy in another car .
From being tailgated by little old ladies and pickup trucks piled high with furniture .
From being passed by 830 vehicles , including an AC Transit bus , on a drive from the Bay Area to deep into the San Joaquin Valley .
" Is that all ? " said Officer Mike Panelli of the California Highway Patrol .
" It must have been a slow - traffic day . "
Traffic was a bit light when The Chronicle decided to take a 2001 Chevrolet Malibu for a 200 - mile spin from Emeryville to the dusty Interstate 5 stopover of Kettleman City -- sticking to 55 mph on the way down and going with the flow of traffic on the way back .
The idea was to test just how much better the six - cylinder Malibu ( EPA - estimated highway mileage : 29 miles per gallon ) could do at a speed imposed on the nation 's freeway drivers as a fuel - saving measure during the Arab oil embargo of the mid-1970s .
The limit became increasingly unpopular and was repealed in 1995 .
Now you can do 65 mph on most of Interstate 580 in the East Bay all the way down to I - 5 , where 70 mph is the rule and 80 mph a common practice .
But as a gas - saving device , 55 mph still works .
The Malibu got 35 mpg on the way down to Kettleman City ; coming back from the Kings County settlement of fast - food restaurants and gas stations at the flow of traffic , a bit over 70 mph , the mileage dropped sharply -- to 25 mpg .
" That 's pretty significant , " said Sean Comey , spokesman for AAA of Northern California .
" More than I would have expected . "
For every mile per hour faster than 55 mph , fuel economy drops by about 1 percent , said Jason Mark , clean vehicles program director for the Union of Concerned Scientists .
The drop - off increases at a greater rate after 65 mph .
The faster you go , the faster the fuel goes .
There are costs the slower you go , however .
It took 49 minutes longer to make the trip at 55 mph -- three hours and 36 minutes total -- but it seemed like forever .
Sitting in the slow lane , tapping the gas pedal to maintain a steady speed , the car felt like it was traveling at 25 .
Everything from Porsches and BMWs to big-rigs , the AC Transit bus and pickups towing boats -- and they 're supposed to keep their speeds under 55 -- cruised past in the left lane .
A lot of drivers cast curious glances at The Chronicle 's Malibu , and a woman in a black Volvo station wagon with three kids in the back seat glared .
One person -- a preteen boy in the passenger seat of a Dodge Stratus -- made an obscene gesture , raising both middle fingers somewhere in Merced County .
A handful of drivers came within a few inches of the rear bumper before jerking their cars into the fast lane and flying by , but most simply passed .
Actually , everybody passed sooner or later .
The 830 cars and trucks that went by the Malibu as it poked along at 55 mph was nearly 10 times the number that passed on the speedier trip home .
Officer Panelli said the CHP sees very few drivers cruising I - 5 at 55 .
It 's not illegal , however -- there 's no minimum speed limit on that stretch of road , and the Vehicle Code says only : " No person shall drive upon a highway at such a slow speed as to impede or block the normal and reasonable movement of traffic . "
" If you 're doing 55 in the right lane , " Panelli said , " you 're probably OK .
It would n't be like you 're the only one out there going that slow , since trucks and cars towing trailers have a 55 speed limit . "
Most motorists would n't dare try it , however .
" You want to go with the flow , " said Jihadda Govan of Delano , who was taking I - 5 back from a wedding in Humboldt County .
" You feel like a hazard doing 55 when everyone else is going between 70 and 90 . "
Comey said that even though the AAA encourages motorists to conserve fuel by lifting the right foot off the gas pedal , he would worry about going 55 on the wide - open highway .
" You would n't want to sacrifice safety for fuel economy , " he said .
" If you 're driving 55 , and the ambient traffic speed is much higher , you could be putting yourself in danger because the other drivers might not be paying attention and might crash into you . "
But Panelli said he would n't classify 55 as an unsafe speed .
" I 've never ( responded to ) a collision that occurred where someone said , ' This guy was driving 55 so I crashed into him , ' " he said .
" Usually , the cause is the opposite .
Someone 's driving too fast . "
Many motorists said time was more important than money .
" We 're coming from Seattle , " said Hugh Lee , a content provider for an Internet music service , bound for West Los Angeles with his friend , Leah Clarin , a Nordstrom merchandiser .
" So we just want to get to our destination as fast as we can . "
Seth Springer , an Oakland special - education teacher heading for the Grand Canyon in a Toyota Prius hybrid , said he was keeping a close watch on his mileage , which is recalculated and displayed on the dashboard display every five minutes .
It was at 44 mpg , a bit better than the 42 he usually gets commuting to work in Hayward .
He was trying to keep down his speed , he said , but was n't too worried about the effect on mileage .
" In a Prius , you do n't have to feel guilty , " he said .
Despite the significant fuel savings , there 's been no hue and cry to reinstate the national 55 - mph speed limit .
Castleman , who formed the Drive 55 Conservation Project as a way to lessen dependence on foreign oil after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , said he 's had trouble getting any politicians -- even his own state representatives -- to consider the idea .
" The 55 mph speed limit is not a number we 're stuck on , " he said .
" I 'd be willing to go to 60 .
" The idea is to get people to slow down ( and develop ) an attitude of conservation , " Castleman said .
That makes sense to Mark , who said the savings can add up by slowing down even on short trips .
He figures that a commuter making a 30 - mile drive to work at 65 mph instead of 75 mph would save about 30 cents in fuel costs per day -- or $ 150 a year -- and spend just 3 1/2 minutes more daily on the road .
" When we 're talking about changing driving habits , we 're not talking about driving like your grandmother , " Mark said .
" We 're talking about just easing off the gas pedal a bit . "
ON THE ROAD
With gas prices soaring and people searching for ways to reduce their energy costs , Chronicle reporter Michael Cabanatuan explored an old solution -- slowing down .
He drove from Emeryville to Kettleman City at 55 mph , then drove back at 70 mph and compared his gas mileage on the two trips .
Emeryville to Kettleman City
55.6 mph , 35 mpg
Gas consumed : 5.7 gallons
Travel time : 3 hours 36 minutes
Cost of gas : $ 17.04 ( $ 2.99/gallon )
Number of vehicles that passed driver : 830
Kettleman City back to Emeryville
70.8 mph , 25 mpg
Gas consumed : 7.8 gallons
Travel time : 2 hours 47 minutes
Cost of gas : $ 22.23 ( $ 2.85/gallon )
Number of vehicles that passed driver : 94
Don Bolles , drummer for the legendary punk rock band The Germs , was on his way to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting when he was pulled over by Newport Beach , California ’s finest .
For whatever reason ( they hate punk ? ) , they decide to search his car .
I ’m sure Bolles now wishes he had n’t consented .
He probably thought he had nothing to hide .
Ah , but he forget about ……. the soap !
Yes , soap .
For some odd reason , the police field - tested Bolles ’ bottle of Dr. Bronner ’s Magic Soap .
Using the handy - dandy Narcopouch 928 , the police determined that Bolles had GHB ( gamma hydroxyl butyrate – the “ date rape ” drug ) in his soap !
Never doubting for a second that the results could be erroneous , the Newport Beach police charged Bolles with a felony and took him to jail , where he spent the next 3 1/2 days .
The soaps maker came to his defense .
Ten days after being bailed out , a confirmation test done by the police crime lab came back negative , and the charges were dropped .
But that ’s not the end of it .
The soap ’s manufacturer has been using the Narcopouch 928 GHB test kit to test a variety of products .
So far , products from the following companies have produced false - positives : Neutrogena , Tom ’s of Maine , Johnson & Johnson , Palmolive !
Concerned about all of these false positives , Dr. Bronner ’s is calling for police departments across the United States to stop using the Narcopouch 928 .
You know something ?
Sometimes it only takes six damn words to destroy the credibility of an argument , and I think we 've run across an example worth preserving for the ages .
First They Came for the Jews
A prosecution under the Espionage Act threatens the First Amendment .
BY DOROTHY RABINOWITZ
Monday , April 2 , 2007 12:01 a.m. EDT
Ahem .
You see , back in 2004 , two AIPAC employees were indicted for receiving classified U.S. foreign policy information from the Rumsfeld / Feith / Wolfowitz / Leeden / Ghorbanifar connected Lawrence Franklin , who has since pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 12 + years in prison .
According to the author of this latest apologia for conservative criminality , the entire prosecution can be bundled as cruel scapegoating , part and parcel of all the other horrible offenses against conservatives that U.S. prosecutors have slung over the past few years , such as charging Libby with the crime that he was convicted of .
Now , I realize that it's one of the guiding principles of conservatism that Israel gets to violate whatever U.S. and international laws it wants under the diplomatic doctrine of " screw you " , and I realize further that espionage by friendly powers is so commonplace ( France 's industrial espionage efforts are at this point legendary ) as to hardly require a yawn , and I will even freely stipulate that all individuals are innocent until proven guilty , but comparing two AIPAC employees getting charged in an espionage investigation with The Holocaust is the sort of thing that tends to get you branded , very correctly , as a flaming nut , whether you are scribbling in blog comments or writing for the Wall Street Freaking Journal .
I mean , sweet merciful crap .
This is the exact sort of overpuffed , race - baiting bloviation that dulls people to ( 1 ) actual genocides , ( 2 ) actual racism , and ( 3 ) actual f-- king common sense .
In a tiny spark of probably misplaced graciousness , I 'm just going to assume here that whatever the rhetorical faults of the presented apologia ( and there are many ) , the author , Dorothy Rabinowitz , had nothing to do with that spectacularly dumb title , and that someone else horked it up for her .
Honestly -- did nobody on the entire WSJ 's editorial staff figure that title as being , forget inappropriate and crass , let 's just go with ill - chosen ?
Is it honestly the opinion of the Steadfastly Insane Wall Street Journal that two conservatives getting busted in an espionage sting is akin to genocide ?
Gawd , people , you 're one of the biggest newspapers in the country .
Show some class .
I 'll leave the rest of the editorial for others to pick apart ( you 'll notice , for example , that Rabinowitz has considerable disdain for Sandy Berger , whose Jewishness and need for a required race - based defense is apparently entirely cancelled out by his being a Democrat . )
Sometimes , you only need six words to discredit yourself .

previous post
IBD prepared the chart above for its , I wrote about the significant increase in household net worth in 2006 to a record $ 56 trillion .
prepared the chart above for its Friday edition editorial " Getting Richer " and made the following points :
1 . We 've added as much wealth in the last decade as we did in our nation 's first 220 years .
It 's an amazing boom — all the more so because hardly anyone talks about it .
2. $ 56 trillion dollars is 4 times the size of our economy , and nearly a quarter bigger than the size of the entire world economy .
3 . The average household in America owns about $ 487,095 worth of stuff , free and clear .
That 's a big jump from recent years .
As recently as 2001 , average household wealth was $ 373,170 .
So in five years we 've become a third richer — a truly amazing fact .
4 . A variety of recent readings on the economy show people surprisingly glum about the future .
We hear that we do n't ' save enough , ' that there 's a widening ' income gap ' and that the middle class is shrinking .
But we seem to be afflicted with what author Gregg Easterbrook recently dubbed ' abundance denial . '
Because the economic reality is something quite different .
5 . In addition to being richer , we live longer , healthier lives than ever .
Even people on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder have far more than they did a decade ago .
The fact is , we 've never had it so good .
This is the first time that I have seen a comparison of relative production rates between horizontal and vertical wells that were relatively close , so I thought I would pass it on .
More under the fold .
And then I got a bit more curious about the program and found that there is a Conference coming up there on February 9 - 10 dealing with the need to transition from carbon fuels to renewables .
While the current program looks fairly interesting , it is the second in the series .
And so I went back to see what they had on the program last year .
And there I found a paper on Natural Gas by Chris McGill , from which I took the following graph .
This post , in a way , is in homage to Connections , which I have just started to watch .
I noted today that Leanan had posted that Matt Simmons is giving a talk at UCSB tonight , and I suggested to the Engineer that he might go downstairs and listen .
( His report – among other things that the room was too small , but also that Matt did say that we at TOD do “ an excellent job ” – why thank you , kind sir ) .
One of the topics that has been a matter of some considerable debate on these pages , is the relative changes in well performance when the more advanced technology of horizontal well drilling is used , rather than more conventional extraction using vertical wells .
Aramco have noted the considerable increase in relative production rates , which , as they showed in the presentation to CSIS can be raised from perhaps 600 bd from a single vertical well , through 3,000 bd for a normal horizontal well , to some 10,000 bd with the newer maximum reservoir contact wells .
To borrow one of their pictures , that shows this :
Now this is the positive side of the coin .
By using an increased distribution of well laterals out from the main flow ( and subsequently adding valves along the line ) Aramco have been able to considerably increase the short - term production from a field , using a limited number of wells .
However , the question has to be , for how long can that production be sustained , given that there is only a limited quantity of fuel down there ?
And do you get the same amount of oil out in both cases ?
The plot from Chris McGill would seem to suggest that it might be possible to double the amount of oil coming from an individual well ( though it might beg the question as to whether the company might otherwise have sunk two wells rather than one ) .
But it also shows the dramatically shorter life at the higher production rate , in this case ( bearing in mind it is a gas well ) from almost 100 months of production down to 10 .
This would probably be a good place to stop , except that there continues to be debate as to the amount of recoverable oil in the different fields within Saudi Arabia , so I thought I would also post the figures that Aramco gave at the CSIS presentation , since a number of you may not have seen them .
And the Connections twist ?
Well James
Burke always seemed to start with one thing , wander around a whole host of related topics that all led back , in the end to the same thing .
And so , if Matt Simmons had not challenged Saudi Aramco , then they would not have produced the above graphs , which would not have led me to wonder about the change in well lifetimes , which would not have got me interested in the UCSB site and the fact that Matt happened to be talking there tonight .
( Yeah , I know - I should probably go back to reading books ! )
A Post By : Darren Rowse
The following tip on getting digital images to look like Lomo Images was submitted by DPS reader – Frank Lazaro .
You can see his photography at his Flickr page and see some of his Lomo shots here .
From the first time I saw a photo that looked like this , I wanted to shoot one of my own .
But , for the longest time I could n’t figure it out how people took photos look like this .
Then one day searching the web , I realized I needed a Lomo LC - A camera .
This is a Russian made camera that was a knock off of another camera .
It is poorly made and by Japanese camera standards , a bad picture taker too .
As the legend goes , somewhere in the 1990 ’s a cult following developed and has n’t stop since .
Low and behold I went out and bought 2 of these babies .
I love them , but I also had a digital SLR – a Canon 20D .
After shooting with the Lomo , I wanted to take photos from my 20D and give them the Lomo look and feel .
I searched and searched and after trying several different Photoshop methods , I finally came up with my own using a mix of different techniques .
By all means , there are probably other ways to do this , but this method has served me well .
Get Free Weekly Digital Camera Tips via Email
Here is my step by step on how I take a digital photo and make it Lomoified .
I do have one suggestion though , create an action script once get this down , it will save you a ton of time .
Getting Started – Creating a Vignette
The first thing you want to do is create the classic vignette that the Lomos are well known for and I achieve this by doing a freehand lasso of a circle around the photo .
It does n’t need to be perfect and to prevent hard edges , I set the feather to 80 - 90 px before creating the circle .
Once you have set the feather ( shown above ) and have drawn the circle , you must invert the selection .
You can do this one of two ways .
# 1 Shift - Ctrl - I ( Shift - cmd - I on the mac ) or # 2 Go to the menu Select > Inverse .
Now to achieve the vignette , I add a Levels layer .
Note : I still have the invert selected .
This will add a masked out layer on top of your original layer .
I then adjust the levels by moving the center arrow to the right .
This will darken the edges , giving me a vignette .
The amount is up to you and in this case I went from 1.00 to 0.50 on the center number highlighted in the image below .
Now you have a vignette .
On to making the photo look Lomo
Another key to a Lomo picture is the color contrast and saturation .
This occurs because people with real Lomos use color slide film and cross-process the film in C41 chemicals .
For those that do n’t know what cross - processing is , it ’s when you develop film in a chemical other then what it was made for .
Standard 35 mm film is usually processed in C41 chemicals and Color Slide film is usually processed in E6 chemicals .
Interesting results happen when you mix and match .
Typically , Lomo owners will take color slide film ( E6 ) and have it processed as standard 35 mm film ( C41 ) .
This results in over saturation of colors and at times some freaky results .
All of which make Lomo as special as they are .
To get a digital photo to look Lomo , we need to fake the cross- processing effect ( E6 film in C41 chemicals ) .
At this point I usually flatten the image using shift - ctrl-e ( shift - cmd-e on the mac ) or go to the menu and Layer > Merge Layers .
First , I add a curves layer and create a slanted S .
Then I create a new layer on top of the other two layers .
I select the paint bucket and pick the color black and fill the new layer with solid black .
Then I change the blending mode and set it to Hue and reduce the opacity to 40 % .
Sharpening and Saving
This has gotten us very close to be finished .
Again , I flatten the photo by using shift - ctrl-e ( shift - cmd-e on the mac ) or go to the menu and Layer > Merge Layers .
Before saving the photo as a JPG , you need to sharpen the photo .
I use the unsharp mask and Lab mode / lightness technique .
The purpose of this step is that it adds more contrast and darkens some of the areas as well .
Now you can use whatever sharpening technique you want , but the following method prevents the color halos that come with certain sharpening techniques .
Go to Image > Mode > Lab Color .
If you had n’t flattened the image yet , it will ask you if want to flatten , please do so .
Then select your channel window and click on the lightness channel .
The 3 other channels should deselect .
Then go to the menu , select Filter > Sharpen > Unsharp Mask .
I like sharpness , so I set the Amount to 50 % , Radius to 50 % and the Threshold to 0 .
Click Ok .
This is completely up to you on the settings .
Plus it will depend on the photo as well and use your best judgment / preference .
Go to Image > Mode > RGB Color .
You do not have to reselect the unchecked channels , when converting back to RGB , the channels will automatically turn back on and the photo will go back to be in color .
Now you are done , save the file and share .
Final step , save as a Jpeg .

Some things are annoying by their very nature -- spam , your in - laws , comedian Gilbert Gottfried .
But when the annoyances stem from stuff you 've paid for or products you rely on to get things done , that really takes the cake .
Unlike PC World 's 25 Worst Products of All Time , irksome products are n't necessarily bad , buggy , or dangerous .
But they all have one or two traits that make you want to wrap them in 200 pounds of steel cable and toss them off the side of a boat .
From stupid features and rude behavior to brain - dead design and poor corporate policies , these 20 products have truly annoyed us over the years , and some continue to do so .
This list hardly covers every annoying tech product ever made .
But where did this list of 20 come from ?
You picked the worst ones by voting in our Annoyances Poll , and you 'll see your Top 10 most annoying products flagged with icons .
Just for fun , we 've added 10 more products that did n't get enough votes from you in our poll but that we found particularly irksome .
It 's still possible , though , that a product not listed here or in our reader survey really got under your skin , so please post a comment below .
If nothing else , you might feel a little better .
AOL CDs ( 1993 to 2006 )
As our # 1 worst product of all time , America Online gave all of us plenty to be irked about over many , many years .
Photograph : Courtesy of Lydia's AOL Disk Collection
But the carpet bombing of free AOL discs was possibly the most annoying ( and environmentally irresponsible ) marketing campaign ever waged .
Estimates put the number of discs shipped between July 1993 and July 2006 at over 1 billion ; we feel like we received that many ourselves .
Your Take
BobMac says :
The biggest AOL annoyance shows up when you do the math .
They offered 1099 free hours , but you had only 50 days to complete your time .
50 days = 1200 hours - the 1099 free hours = 101 hours of free time , which is 2.02 hours per day of the 50 - day trial .
When you factor in the reboot time to get back on after AOL kicks you off , there is n't even enough time to go to the bathroom for 50 days .
No wonder so many people hate AOL .
argiiod says :
While I have no love for the thieving folks at AOL , I still have to thank them for all the free discs .
I use them to decorate everything from my computer room to the cockpit of my RV , and I make " computer " clocks out of them by simply adding battery - operated clockworks ( believe it or not , these kitschy items still sell like hotcakes at flea markets , swap meets , and yard sales ) .
10 のUNIX 小技
IBM のサイト で「 Learn 10 good UNIX usage habits 」 という記事が発表されていました。 面白かったので要約してみました。 変な部分があるかも知れないので詳細は原文をご覧下さい。
原文とは一部異なります。 本ページスペースなどの関係でコマンド引数などを短く省略しています。 原文のサンプルコマンドが間違っていたりするので、修正している部分もあります。
原文を修正しているのは、tar.gzをzオプションを使わないでxfvしようとしているところと、xargsにlsではなくls
- lを渡している部分です。 あと、説明文を短くしてしまっています。
1. ディレクトリの作成
良く使うコマンドの一つであるmkdirですが、面倒臭い使い方をしていませんか？
悪い例
~/ $ mkdir a ~/ $ cd a ~ / a $ mkdir b ~/a $ cd b ~/a/b/ $ mkdir c ~/a/b/ $ cd c ~/a/b/c $
良い例
mkdir -p a/b/c
良い例2：複雑な構造をコマンド一発で作る例
mkdir -p a/{lib,src,doc/{html , pdf,txt}}
mkdirに - pオプションがない場合
mkdirhierを使うと同様の事ができるそうです。
mkdirhier -p a/{lib,src,doc/{html , pdf,txt}}
2. tarの解凍先を指定する
tarを解凍するために目的のディレクトリまでtarファイルを移動するのも悪い慣習の一つです。 tarの-Cオプションを使えば好きなディレクトリへtarファイルを解凍できます。
tar xfv a.tar - C
/tmp/a/b
- Cオプションを使う方法は、tarファイルを移動して、cdでディレクトリを移動して、tarコマンドで解凍をするやり方よりも推奨されます。
特に、アーカイブファイルが自分ではない誰かのものである場合には。
3. コマンドを演算子で繋げる
「 ;」を使って複数のコマンドを1行で繋げられる事は知っていると思います。
これは複数のコマンドを実行するには便利ですが、万能ではありません。 例えば、 「 ;」を使って2つのコマンドを実行するとします。
二つ目のコマンドが一つ目のコマンドに依存する場合、一つ目のコマンドが失敗した場合には、二つ目のコマンドは必ず失敗します。
そのような場合には 「 ;」ではなく、より適切な演算子を使うと良いでしょう。
一つ目のコマンドが成功し た( return 0 ) 場合にだけ実 行
cd tmp/a/b/c && tar xvf ~/archive.tar
一つ目のコマンドが失敗し た( return 0以外 ) 場合にだけ実行
cd tmp/a/b/c || mkdir -p tmp/a/b/c
cd tmp / a/b || mkdir - p tmp / a/b && tar xvf - C tmp/a/b ~/a.tar
4. 変数と 「 " 」の組み合わせは慎重に
特別な理由が無い限り、変数は 「 " 」で囲う方が良いでしょう。 もし、変数名の直後に文字を使いたいのであれば、変数名を「{}」で囲いましょう。
これを忘れてしまうと、別の変数名として扱われてしまいます。
意図しない別の変数名になってしまった場合、大抵はnull値になるでしょう。
$ ls tmp/ a b $ VAR = " tmp / * " $ echo $ VAR tmp / a tmp / b $ echo " $ VAR " tmp /* $ echo $ VARa $ echo " $ VARa " $ echo " $ { VAR}a " tmp / *a $ echo $ {VAR}a tmp / a $
5. 長い入力にはエスケープシーケンスを利用
シェルスクリプト内で長いコマンドを表すために「\」が使われているを見た事がある人は多いと思われます。
しかし、手でコマンドを打つときに「\」を使う人は意外に少ないのではないでしょうか。
「\」を使って単一の行を複数行に分けて入力する方式は、ターミナルが複数行へのwrappingに対応していないときに便利です。
$ cd tmp/a/b/c || \ > mkdir - p tmp/a/b/c && \ > tar xvf - C tmp/a/b/c ~/archive.tar
$ cd tmp/a/b/c \ > || \ > mkdir -p tmp/a/b/c \ > && \ > tar xvf - C tmp/a/b/c ~/archive.tar
( 注意 ) 大抵のshellでは、上矢印などで履歴を利用すると複数行で入力したコマンドであっても1行として出てきてしまいます。
6. コマンドをグループ分けする
大抵のシェルには、コマンドをグループ分けして実行する機能を持っています。 一般的には、subshellで行う方法と、現在実行しているshellで行う2通りの方法があります。
subshell
subshellを使う方法は、環境変数を定義しなおしたい場合に有効です。 subshellで環境変数を変更しても、現在実行中のshellが保持する環境変数は維持されます。
$ ( cd tmp/a/b/c/ || mkdir - p tmp/a/b/c && \ > VAR=$ PWD ; cd ~ ; tar xvf - C $ VAR archive .tar ) \ > | mailx admin -S " Archive contents "
現在のshell
「{}」の前後にスペースが入るように注意しましょう。
スペースを入れないと正しく動作しないかも知れません。
また、「}」の前に来る最後のコマンドの後に「;」を入れるのを忘れないようにしましょう。
$ { cp $ {VAR}a .
&& chown - R guest . guest a && \ > tar cvf newarchive .
tar a ; } | mailx admin - S " New archive "
7. xargsをfind以外と組み合わせる
xargsはfindが出力するファイル名を使って他のコマンドを実行するために使われます。
例えば、以下のようにfindが発見したファイル名をxargsに渡して処理をさせます。
$ find 何か どこかへのパス | \ > xargs ファイル名を使う何らかのコマン ド
しかし、xargsは単なるfindの補助ツールではありません。
利用例
$ xargs a b c コントロールキー+p a b c
ファイル名を出力する他のコマンドと組み合わせる事も可能です。
$ ls | xargs December_Report.pdf README a archive.tar mkdirhier.sh $ ls | xargs file December_Report.pdf : PDF document , version 1.3 README : ASCII text a : directory archive .
tar : POSIX tar archive mkdirhier.sh : Bourne shell script text executable
複数行を一行にまとめる事も出来ます。
$ ls -l | xargs - rw - r--r-- 7 joe joe 12043 Jan 27 20:36 December_Report.pdf -rw-r--r-- 1 \ root root 238 Dec 03 08:19 README drwxr-xr-x 38 joe joe 354082 Nov 02 \ 16:07 a - rw-r--r-- 3 joe joe 5096 Dec 14 14:26 archive.tar - rwxr-xr-x 1 \ joe joe 3239 Sep 30 12:40 mkdirhier.sh
xargs利用上の注意
「 _（アンダースコア、下棒）」はEOFとして扱われます。 そのため、その文字がxargsに渡されると、それ以降の項目は無視されてしまいます。
この問題を回避するには-eオプションを利用してください。
8. grepに行数をカウントさせる
wc -l と組み合わせるのではなく、grep の-cオプションを使った方が行数の計算は速いです。
$ time grep PATTERN longfile.txt | wc -l 2811 real 0m0.097s user 0m0.006s sys 0m0.032s $ time grep -c PATTERN longfile.txt 2811 real 0m0.013s user 0m0.006s sys 0m0.005s
grepがカウントすべきではないとき
-cオプションは、マッチした行数のみをカウントします。 -oオプションは、マッチしたパターン自体を出力します。
単一行にマッチするパターンが複数回登場する時などには、-oオプションにより標準出力に出される行数と、-c
が行った結果のカウント数が異なってしまいます。 そのような場合には、wc -l を使いましょう。
grep -o PATTERN longfile.txt | wc -l
9. パターンマッチは行全体ではなくフィールドで
grepなどで行全体をマッチするのではなく、awkで特定のフィールドを指定してパターンマッチをすべきです。
grepで行全体をマッチさせてしまうと、意図しないものも結果に入ってしまうことがあります。
例えば、ファイル更新日が12月のものを探している時に、1月に更新したDecemberReport.pdfが結果に入ってしまう場合があります。
悪い例
ls -l | grep Dec -rw -r--r-- 7 joe joe 12043 Jan 27 20:36 December_Report.pdf -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 238 Dec 03 08:19 README -rw-r--r-- 3 joe joe 5096 Dec 14 14:26 archive.tar
良い例
ls -l | awk ' $ 6 == " Dec " ' - rw -r--r-- 3 joe joe 5096 Dec 14 14:26 archive.tar -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 238 Dec 03 08:19 README
10 . 無駄なcatとパイプは行わない
grepなどのコマンドを使う時に、catをパイプで繋げてgrepの標準入力に流し込むのは無駄です。 grepなどの大抵のコマンドには、ファイル名をオプションとして渡せる機能があります。
以下に速度の比較を示します。
$ time cat longfile . txt | grep PATTERN 2811 real 0m0.015s user 0m0.003s sys 0m0.013s $ time grep PATTERN longfile.txt 2811 real 0m0.010s user 0m0.006s sys 0m0.004s

“ You know , there ’s a new poll out that Muslims , the higher educated Muslims in the Middle East are more likely to be extremists ?
More and more Muslims now hate us all across the world , and it really has not a lot to do with anything other than our morals .
“ The things that they were saying about us were true .
Our morals are just out the window .
We ’re a society on the verge of moral collapse .
And our promiscuity is off the charts .
“ Now I do n’t think that we should fly airplanes into buildings or behead people because of it , but that ’s the prevailing feeling of Muslims in the Middle East .
And you know what ?
They ’re right . ”
Will the High Price of Oil Make Americans Skinnier ?
Not because higher gas prices will spur people to walk or ride bicycles instead of driving .
No , I ’m thinking it might work like this :
— Notwithstanding the recent drop , high oil prices have driven a demand for ethanol made from corn .
— Accordingly , the price of corn is rising fast , with July contracts at $ 4 / bushel , about 60 percent higher than last summer .
— With corn so much more expensive , food manufacturers who use corn in so many forms in so many foods will look for substitutes .
As the writer Michael Pollan puts it , “ Corn is the keystone species of the industrial food system …
If you are what you eat , and especially if you eat industrial food , as 99 percent of Americans do , what you are is corn . ”
— Because corn was so cheap for so long , high - fructose corn syrup has become a common substitute for cane sugar .
Pollan and others have argued that corn syrup is a great contributor to national obesity .
— Already , one boutique soda company has trumpeted its return to using cane sugar instead of corn syrup .
“ It ’s better for you , it ’s better - tasting and , overall , it ’s better for the environment , ” says the CEO of Jones Soda .
So , as higher oil prices continue to drive demand for corn - based ethanol , which drives the price of corn higher , which makes cheap corn syrup more expensive , which leads food manufacturers to seek out potentially less fattening sweeteners , will Americans get skinnier ?
There have been a lot of news stories since the announcement of the Apple iPhone touting multimedia or smartphone products from other companies as " iPhone killers " or some other label that suggests the device might beat the iPhone to it 's proverbial punch .
The only problem has been that these devices do n't stand up to what we know about the iPhone , or fall into another device genre altogether .
The announcement of a new line of products from Brevisys Technologies , a Boston , MA company , may change all of that .
Brevisys recently announced a trio of hand - held , touch screen multimedia devices named the Kiku , Menx , and Pi .
Of the three devices , only the latter is a cellular devices with the Kiku and Menx being a compact multimedia devices intended for music , video , and imagery - but not for use as a phone .
The beefiest of the three devices , the Pi , has obviously been inspired by the Apple iPhone , regardless of what the company might claim .
What does the company claim ?
Well , that 's largely subjective .
According to Brevisys , their devices " began their design and development process over a year before the recently unveiled Apple iPhoneÂ ® and LG Prada Phone . "
Not necessarily that hard to believe , considering their indication that the devices will be available to consumers this summer , not long after the launch of the iPhone .
Like the iPhone , the Pi offers itself up as an attractive , slim , touch screen device complete with WiFi , enhanced mobile web browsing , a music browser and player , Bluetooth , and more .
Unlike the iPhone , however , the Pi offers UWB ( Ultra Wideband ) connectivity , optional storage up to 60GB , and the Linux operating system - which Brevisys is happy to point out will allow the user to fully customize their device to suit their needs .
Also available for the devices is a line of product accessories which might raise a few eyebrows .
Brevisys is offering up an attachable keyboard , attachable joystick , and the " deeda Box " - a wireless multimedia interface unit which offers inputs and outputs such as S - Video , DVI , USB 2.0 , coaxial , and component - which would allow users to easily connect the deeda devices to any variety of home entertainment electronics as well as their PCs .
Brevisys is offering themselves up as a bastion of hope within the world of wireless device manufacturers .
The company writes , " A lot of our technology is designed to allow you to wirelessly stream and share your videos and digital media , as well as interact with your friends , family and groups through our devices in personal ways that have never been possible before .
From our social networking enabled devices to online interaction with personalized modal windows and widgets , we want you to be able to access all the amazing information stored online from the devices in your hand without having to use a traditional browser interface .
For all of this to work there are overlapping areas of trust that must be maintained , and we intend to maintain that trust from the beginning .
Our primary goal is to give you what you want while protecting your privacy and personal information .
Devices , hardware , software and online applications that let individuals control all forms of media , content and information is the future , and we are proud to be leading the charge . "
Are Brevisys and it's devices a new force in the ever changing world of wireless and mobile communications , or just another ill - fated experiment from high - minded tech junkies with too much capital ?
Either way , can their open source frame of thinking catch the spirit of even a handful of those of us caught up in the iPhone and it 's marketing frenzy ?
One this is for sure , it will be interesting to watch this line of devices and the company bringing them to market .

Daily Howler : Dowd is a cleaned - up version of Coulter .
Wikipedia offers some context
W IKIDOWDIA !
Dowd is a cleaned - up version of Coulter .
Wikipedia offers some context : // link // print // previous // next //
MONDAY , MARCH 5 , 2007
WHEN YOU READ DOWD , YOURE RIDING WITH COULTER :
The nations big papers and pundits have been exceptionally dainty about Ann Coulters latest .
On Friday , at a major conservative political gathering in DC , she called John Edwards a  f * ggot . 
This has produced little reporting or commentary in the mainstream press .
For example , Coulters comment has not been mentioned in any of the Washington Posts news reporting .
( It was mentioned , very briefly , in passing ,
But then , theres little new about Coulters conduct — or about the press corps silence .
In July 2006 , for example , Coulter called Al Gore a total fag on Hardball .
Chris Matthews — an endless Gore - trasher himself — didnt utter a peep of protest .
No , Matthews doesnt approve of Coulter .
But he was too weak — too afraid — to speak up .
Nor did the press corps offer a peep of complaint about Coulters ludicrous best - seller , Slander .
When it appeared in 2002 , the book simply brimmed with factual errors  — literally , from its first page to its last .
But the New York Times knew the easy way out !
Its reviewer ,  Janet Maslin , took a talking - point straight from Coulter .
In her review ,  Maslin cited the number of foot - notes in Slander , and used the footnotes as a marker of the vast research its author had so clearly conducted .
As we noted , if you simply checked out some of those footnotes , you would have quickly seen that Coulters book was a fraud ( see
Yep !
Our news orgs have long enabled Coulter .
If your nation goes up in the smoke in the process , these loathsome Antoinettes just dont care .
But then , why should pundits criticize Coulter when she describes Dem males as big f * ggots ?
It s very similar to the gender - based analysis their dauphine , the Comptesse Maureen Dowd , has long offered .
In Dowds work , John Edwards is routinely  the Breck Girl  ( five times so far — and counting ) , and Gore is so feminized that hes practically lactating .
Indeed , two days before we voted in November 2000 , Dowd devoted her entire column , for the sixth time , to an imaginary conversation between Gore and his bald spot .
 I feel pretty ,  her headline said ( pretending to quote Gores inner thoughts ) .
That was the image this idiot wanted you carrying off to the voting booth with you !
Such is the state of Maureen Dowds broken soul .
And such is the state of her cohort .
And now , in the spirit of fair play and brotherhood , she is extending this type of analysis to Barack Obama .
In the past few weeks , she has described Obama as legally blonde ( in her headline ) ; as  Scarlett OHara ( in her next column ) ; as a  Dreamboy ,  as  Obambi ,  and now , in her latest absurd piece , as a schoolboy ( text below ) .
Do you get the feeling that Dowd may have a few race - and - gender issues floating around in her inane , tortured mind ?
But this sort of thing is nothing new for the comptesse .
Indeed , such imagery almost defines the work of this loathsome , inane Antoinette .
Coulter has been visibly disturbed ever since hitting cable in the mid-90s .
But Dowd is a borderline nutcase too — a slightly cleaned up version of Coulter .
( Ah , we Irish !
Yes , each had an Irish Catholic dad . )
Coulter comes right out and calls
Dem men f * ggots  — but Maureen Dowd has always come close .
Just as Chris Matthews is a slightly cleaned - up William Donohue , Dowd is a more presentable Coulter .
For mainstream voters , Maureen is easier to take .
For that reason , she has done us more harm .
Coulter teaches contempt for gays , and tries to extend that contempt to Dem pols .
But thats what Dowd has done all these years !
And we liberals and Dems have been too weak to understand and address the problem .
We scream about Coulter — and give Dowd a pass .
But when you read Dowd , you re riding with Coulter !
When will we get our heads out of our keisters and take ourselves where the harm is the greatest ?
It makes us feel good to savage vile Coulter .
But what about simpering Dowd ?
HER LATEST INANITY :
Has there ever been a more tortured soul than that of the hapless , inane Dowd ?
Dowd is the badly - maimed semi-survivor of our mid-century Irish - Catholic cultural wars .
In her most recent column , on Saturday past , she pretty much begged us to see this .
The destructive themes of Dowds broken soul were on display in her first seven paragraphs .
First , the thinly - veiled contempt she directs toward all Big Dem male pols .
Heres the first paragraph of her column — a column in which she begs Obama to get in a big fight with Clinton : DOWD ( 3/3/07 ) :
As I sit across from Barack Obama in his Senate office , I feel like Ingrid Bergman in '' The Bells of St. Mary's , '' when she plays a nun who teaches a schoolboy who 's being bullied how to box .
It s no surprise to see that the nuns are still haunting Maureen Dowds dreams .
But note the instant description of Obama .
Let s say it again :
In the past few weeks , Dowd has described Obama as legally blonde ;  as  Scarlett OHara ;  as  Obambi ,  as a  Dreamboy ,  and now as a schoolboy . 
But as weve noted , Dowd persistently mocks
Dem males as a race of big girlie - men .
They feel pretty — and they re the Breck Girl .
Now , Obama is constantly some sort of boy  — or an iconic white woman .
Big Dem men are constantly girls .
And big Dem women ?
Keep reading : DOWD ( continuing directly — pgh 2 ) : I 'm just not certain , having watched the fresh - faced senator shy away from fighting with the feral Hillary over her Hollywood turf , that he understands that a campaign is inherently a conflict .
Big Dem women are feral !
Indeed , when we get to paragraph 4 through 6 , Dowd spells it out just as clear as a belle at a ball .
Added warning !
When Dowd refers to Obama as  Barry ,  its one more snide diminution : DOWD ( paragraph 4 - 6 ) : After David Geffen made critical comments about Hillary , she seized the chance to play Godzilla stomping on Obambi .
As a woman , she clearly feels she must be aggressive in showing she can '' deck ' ' opponents , as she put it — whether it 's Saddam with her war resolution vote or Senator Obama when he encroaches on areas that she and Bill had presumed were wrapped up , like Hollywood and now the black vote .
If Hillary is in touch with her masculine side , Barry is in touch with his feminine side .
Leave aside the persistent infantilism involved in images like  Godzilla and  Bambi . 
Here , Dowd states her endless — and vacuous — theme .
Big Dem males ( like  Barry ) are girls .
And big Dem women are men .
Dowd has pimped these inane , tortured theme for more than a decade .
For the record , though , one Dem male was not a girl in Saturdays column .
That would be Clinton aide Howard Wolfson .
In paragraph 7 , Dowd called him as a thug . 
So let s see .
Obama ( Obambi ) is just a boy .
Clinton ( Godzilla ) is a man — and shes feral .
And what led Dowd to cast this strange drama ?
Simple !
When David Geffen called Clinton every name in the book , Clinton called on Obama to denounce his statements !
Was this a good tactical move by Clinton ?
We have no idea — but its a very tame bit of political conduct .
But it is nt tame in the mind of Dowd , or in the scripts of her well - scripted cohort !
( More below . )
In Dowds mind , this unexceptional behavior made Clinton a thug — and , of course , it made her a man .
And when Obama didnt punch back hard enough , that made him a weak boy — a  Barry . 
Dowd goes on and on , throughout this column , trying to start a ( pointless ) fight among Dems .
But let s remember the basic theme : Every Democrat must be a loser !
When Clinton makes a fairly trivial move , she has fought Obama too hard !
When Obama doesnt name - call Clinton , he hasnt fought hard enough !
It would be hard to get dumber than this .
And its hard to imagine why grown men and women at the Times ( Andrew Rosenthal ) still put this embarrassing schlock into print .
But unfortunately , Maureen Dowd is an authority figure , writing at the top of our journalistic elite .
She has offered this tormented dreck for years .
During that time , Dems and liberals have suffered endlessly from her dumb , tortured conduct .
We are in Iraq today because of the work of these losers .
And oh by the way , its never her fault !
Go ahead !
Treat yourselves to a dark , morbid chuckle as Dowd , in paragraph 3 of this column , states an all - important part of her inane cohorts script : DOWD ( paragraph 3 ) :
The Democrats lost the last two excruciatingly close elections because Al Gore and John Kerry did not fight fiercely and cleverly enough .
Of course !
It cant be said often enough !
Right in paragraph 3 , Dowd re-schools us .
It was all Gores ( and Kerrys ) fault !
The nations big papers and pundits have been exceptionally dainty about Ann Coulters latest .
On Friday , at a major conservative political gathering in DC , she called John Edwards a  f * ggot . 
This has produced little reporting or commentary in the mainstream press .
For example , Coulters comment has not been mentioned in any of the Washington Posts news reporting .
( It was mentioned , very briefly , in passing , in Dana Milbanks Saturday sketch .  )
If Nexis is to be believed , it hasnt been mentioned in the Boston Globe or the Chicago Tribune at all .
This morning , USA Today skips it .
But then , theres little new about Coulters conduct — or about the press corps silence .
In July 2006 , for example , Coulter called Al Gore a total fag on .
Chris Matthews — an endless Gore - trasher himself — didnt utter a peep of protest .
No , Matthews doesnt approve of Coulter .
But he was too weak — too afraid — to speak up .
Nor did the press corps offer a peep of complaint about Coulters ludicrous best - seller , .

As we noted , if you simplysome of those footnotes , you would have quickly seen that Coulters book was a fraud ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 7/22/02 ) .
But praising Coulter for her research makes life much simpler for Manhattans swells .
It exempts them from all those hateful e-mails .
As such , it gets them to the Hamptons a bit earlier on Fridays .
Or possibly , on Thursday nights .
Yep !
Our news orgs have long enabled Coulter .
If your nation goes up in the smoke in the process , these loathsome Antoinettes just dont care .
But then , why should pundits criticizewhen she describes Dem males as big f * ggots ?

Of course !
Right in paragraph 3 , Dowd re-schools us .
It was all Gores ( and Kerrys ) fault !
So let s see : Dowd invented the punishing Love Story bull - roar .
She lied about the Naomi Wolf business — savaging Gore every step of the way .
She devoted six separate columns to the punishing image of crazy Gore holding conversations with his bald spot .
And , of course , she invented that laughable Kerry quotation — the quote that Kerry never actually spoke .
But always , Dowd returns to that key part of the script — what happened to them was all their own fault !
Those Dems are just such big girlie - men !
They didnt fight fiercely enough ! 
Dowd is one of the dumbest figures in a pitiful age of celebrity  journalism .
If you ve ever heard her trademark simpering on TV , youve heard the soul of our modern press elite .
But increasingly , her simpering style defines the state of American political  journalism . 
Question : Just how long do Democrats plan to put up with this absolute nonsense ?
WIKIDOWDIA : Inanity , thy name is Maureen Dowd !
Could American discourse possibly get dumber ?
Al and John and  Barry  wont fight .
But when Hillary offers a small peep of protest , that s it !
Shes denounced as a thug !
Yes , its hard to get dumber than Dowd .
In a saner era , the Times would cart her off to a high - class home  and pay the bills for some much - needed treatment .
But then , the empty souls of people like Dowd have always worked their will among us , thwarting progress and worming their way into the highest regions of power .
We thought of that story again last week — when we read Wikipedias entry on Marie Antoinette .
If you read the full entry , perhaps youll be struck by the way French politics of the era was driven by invented tales — invented tales spread by pamphleteers . 
( Insert talk show hosts  and columnists like Dowd ,  and you have a portrait of our own era . )
But then , we also read the following passage — this time , about Antoinette herself .
Omigod !
Who wouldnt think of Dowd , simpering queen of belle lettrists ?
WIKIPEDIA : Fulfilling Marie Antoinette 's determination to avoid boredom , conversation in her circle shied away from the mundane or intellectual .
According to Madame Campan , one of the queen 's ladies - in - waiting , " The newest songs from the Comédie , the most timely joke or pun or quip , the bon mot of the day , the latest and choicest titbit of scandal or gossip — these comprised the sole topics of conversation in the intimate group about the queen ; discussion on a serious plane was banished from her court . "
The queen 's circle of friends was very exclusive ...
Who wouldnt think of our own inane Dowd when reading that portrait of Antoinette ?
After all , Dowds circle of friends is exclusive too ; it includes an array of the jugglers and clowns who have done so much to degrade our discourse ( see Brills Content : JERVEY ( 6/99 ) : " Maureen is very talented , " observes Joe Klein of The New Yorker .
" But she is ground zero of what the press has come to be about in the nineties ... I remember having a discussion with her in which I said , ' Maureen , why do n't you go out and report about something significant , go out and see poor people , do something real ? '
And she said , ' You mean I should write about welfare reform ? ' "
Let them eat Ring - Dings , Dowd told Klein .
Heaven forbid that this fatuous loser should actually report about something significant .
Heaven forbid that our top Antoinette should care about real peoples lives .
Yep !
In the 90s , Dowd was ground zero of a fatuous press corps — and things are only worse today .
But then , the Dowds have always moved among us .
In turn , the Madame Campans have bustled about , shielding such queens from their own inner boredom .
And they themselves have done their best to visit their own inane , broken souls on a wider and suffering world .
TOMORROW :
The evil of the press corps  banality , Selma and slave - owner style .
VINTAGE DOWD :
One more part of Dowds latest column defines the great dauphines style : DOWD ( 3/3/07 ) : When the Tiger Woods of politics goes to a civil rights commemoration in Selma , Ala. , this weekend — just as the story breaks that his white ancestors had slaves — he will compete for attention with Hillary and the man billed as the first black president .
How does he feel about the Clintons double - teaming him ?
Talking about the woman he described at the Beverly Hills fund - raiser as smarter , better - looking and meaner then he is , he grins : '' My wife 's pretty tough . ''
Hiss !
Spit !
Hiss - spit !
Mee-ow !
Dowd , broken loser of silly cultural wars , has always written like a throwback survivor of mid-century womens pages . 
And so — Hiss !
Hiss - spit !
Meow !— she couldnt wait to alert her readers to this latest bit of biographical inanity .
More on this topic tomorrow .
According to Madame Campan ,  the latest and choicest titbit of scandal or gossip — these comprised the sole topics of conversation in the intimate group about the queen . 
And darlings !
According to a genealogical researcher , one of Obamas great - great - great - great grandfathers may have owned two slaves at one time !
For a brief moment , Dowds boredom had lifted .
So she rushed to transmit the new tidbit .
Whothink of our own inane Dowd when reading that portrait of Antoinette ?
After all , Dowds circle of friends is exclusive too ; it includes an array of the jugglers and clowns who have done so much to degrade our discourse ( see THE DAILY HOWLER , 2/23/07 ) .
And Dowds court is determined to help their queen avoid the boredom which presses out from her soul .
Once again , we recommend Gay Jerveys portrait of Dowds social conscience , as presented long ago inDowd told Klein .
Heaven forbid that this fatuous loser should actually report about something significant .
Heaven forbid that our top Antoinette should care about real peoples lives .
Yep !
In the 90s , Dowd was ground zero of a fatuous press corps — and things are only worse today .
But then , the Dowds have always moved among us .
In turn , the Madame Campans have bustled about , shielding such queens from their own inner boredom .

For a brief moment , Dowds boredom had lifted .
So she rushed to transmit the new tidbit .
THE ROLE THAT IS PLAYED BY ANN COULTER : Gore and Edwards are big girlie - men !
Dowd delivers this message to the New York Times crowd — and Coulter sends the message to losers .
Example : On Sunday mornings Washington Journal , C - SPAN devoted its first forty - five minutes to a discussion of Coulters remark .
And a string of Coulter - defenders called in to explain away her conduct .
This gave us a chance to understand the role Coulter plays in our world .
( Eventually , the clip will be posted here . )
The explanations  offered by Coulters fans simply beggar description .
About 35 minutes in , a broken soul from Vermont topped things off ; he explained that his dictionary has two definitions of  f * aggot ,  and until someone asks Coulter which one she meant , it s unfair to criticize her comment .
( And yes , he actually quoted the definition in which a faggot is a bundle of sticks . )
Host Steve Scully isnt allowed to comment , but he questioned the caller as to which definition he thought Coulter had meant .
But the caller kept explaining away Coulters comment .
There was no sign , of any kind , that his call was some sort of a put-on
These calls help us grasp a key point — one that s almost never discussed .
Many voters are breath - takingly stupid , and their tribalism will take them to the ends of the earth .
These are the people the GOP has learned to address and marshal through Coulter ( and through others like her ) .
Speaking in her famous direct way , she tells these people that Dem males are just big girlie - men ( f*ggots  ) .
Speaking in more mellifluous tones , Dowd sends this message to others .
Repeat : Dowd and Coulter have the same message .
They just send it to two different groups .
But if you listen to this full segment , you will note that most of the callers are somewhat less stupid than this utterly hapless Vermonter .
Most of Coulters defenders say something like this : Since Coulter was speaking in a comedic context ,  her statement was really A - OK .
But then , this has been a controlling RNC narrative at least since the spring of 1999 .
At that time , the factually bogus attacks on Gore were explicitly defended as examples of humor .
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha , they explained .
We re just enjoying some good solid satire .
This is why we find it so maddening ( but so typical ) when Keith Olbermann endlessly refers to  the comedian Rush Limbaugh on Countdown .
Plainly , Olbermann thinks hes delivering a zinger , but this is the explanation the other side favors !
Whenever Limbaugh gets into a factual jam , he says , But I m just an entertainer !
Since Olbermann wastes his afternoons talking sports , he apparently hasnt yet heard .
She said it in a comedic context !
The RNC has pimped this narrative since the first days of the War Against Gore .
If you listen to Sundays C- SPAN tape , you can hear Coulters army spouting it NOW .
Or you can just dial up Mr. O and hear us recite their tales for them .
Google , internet voice - call company Skype and leading venture capitalists have invested in a new user - run network of wi-fi hotspots , which they hope will become the biggest in the world by the end of the year .
Google , Skype , Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital will announce on Monday $ 21.7 m ( €18 m ) in first - round funding for Madrid - based Fon to build on its growing global band of “ foneros ” .
Foneros are users of the service and known as either “ Bill ” , “ Linus ” or “ Alien ” .
Bill members – after Bill Gates – download secure software from Fon that turns their home wi- fi network into a hotspot anyone within its range can use to connect to the internet for a fee .
Linus members – after Linus Torvalds , creator of the free Linux software – allow their hotspots and bandwidth to be shared for free and can use any other members ’ without charge .
Aliens pay to connect to the Fon network and do not share their own networks .
Fon and Bills will share the revenues earned from Aliens and other Bills .
The service went live in November and has registered 3,000 users in 53 countries in two months .
Fon says it is growing faster than T - Mobile , the biggest network , with 24,000 hotspots established over four years , and expects to exceed this as word spreads .
“ We think this is very disruptive technology and it ’s going to be global , very much like Skype , ” said Danny Rimer of Index Ventures .
“ It ’s another example of an incredibly innovative company coming out of Europe . ”
Internet service providers may object to their subscribers reselling the bandwidth being provided to them but Fon says some have already signed up as partners and can earn a share of Alien revenues from the venture .
The company was founded by Martin Varsavsky , who previously formed Ya.com and Jazztel , respectively the second - largest internet and publicly traded telecoms companies in Spain .
Taking the adversarial system to task with vigour and courage , Phil Factor gives us his view on how to handle the trials of litigation if all cannot be solved by a hearty pub lunch .
The Adversarial system
I was once taught the correct way to halt the attack of a charging bull terrier .
Stage one is to show no fear ; to stare straight into its eyes and dare it to proceed .
If that does n’t do the trick , then in stage two you grab its lower jaw so it cannot bite , and roll it on its back .
I once had cause to put this technique into practice and I can vouch for its efficacy .
It is a useful life - skill and a technique that can just as easily be applied to your dealings with lawyers .
In my dealings with the legal profession , I have never had to proceed to stage two , though I am yearning to give it a try and am confident that it would be effective .
It helps , with both dogs and lawyers , to handle them regularly and to engage in play fights so that you do not experience fear .
In my IT career , I have had several involvements in litigation , usually on the receiving end .
If I ’ve learned one thing , it ’s that that there is a yawning gap between law and justice .
My advice to anyone thinking of engaging in litigation is simple : do n’t .
Unfortunately , however , frustration and anger can sometimes override commonsense .
In the grip of adrenaline , the litigant can easily convince himself that , in his trusty lawyer , he has found an instrument of sweet and righteous revenge .
In fact , all he has found is a highly effective drain on his bank account .
Some time ago , I wrote a very fine commercial communications package .
It was for the secure encrypted communications of corporate data via X25 .
It included a special PCI card with a slave processor for managing the actual nuts and bolts of the rather complex synchronous serial communications , and a PC application for sending stuff and setting the various parameters .
It worked very well and I was enormously proud of it .
Then the company I wrote it for went bust , and the trouble started .
Some of the staff of the late - departed company took the source code and the design of the PCI card , started up a new company and began to market and sell my application under a new name .
This probably would n’t have mattered much , had it not been for the fact that a third company bought up the assets of the dead company , including the designs and code that I ’d written , and then engaged me to develop the product .
Very soon , there were two virtually identical products on the market .
The new owner was understandably aggrieved , especially after I obtained a copy of their product , disassembled it , and was able to prove that it was identical to mine .
It looked like an open - and - shut case and so off we went , full of confidence , to the solicitor ’s office , armed with a file of documents .
He smiled brightly , took our instructions , and briefed a leading London barrister .
After a while , we were summoned to the barrister ’s chambers , in Lincoln ’s Inn .
It was like a mediaeval cloister of Oxford College .
The barrister was articulate and affable , just as anyone would be on his hourly rate .
We went through the evidence , and he absorbed the technical intricacies as though he had been programming X25 all his life .
‘ Oh yes ’ , he admitted once we ’d finished , ‘ you have a case , a good case .
But …’ he paused for a few seconds , thereby adding a few more pounds to his charges .
‘ But what ? ’
‘ We could ask for an injunction to stop them selling the package … ‘
‘ Yes , yes , ‘ we agreed eagerly .
‘… but the problem with that is that you might lose the subsequent court case , and the other company would have unfairly lost all that business ; it would have suffered loss as a result of the injunction , for which you would then be liable . ’
‘ But we wo n’t lose ! ’ we protested .
‘ I ’m just telling you the system ’ , he explained .
‘ There have to be checks in place to prevent malicious and unreasonable injunctions being requested .
If you ask for a preliminary injunction to stop them using your product then , as a security , the Court will require you to deposit a sum of money equivalent to the amount of their subsequent losses , just in case the action goes against you .
The other party is not going to underestimate their losses are they ?
They will suffer enormous financial hardship , and might even go into liquidation .
I suspect that they will ask for around a million pounds .
That is money you have to find before you are awarded an injunction . ’
‘ But it is an open or shut case .
Surely , it is unfair to assume we are going to lose ? ’
He looked sheepish , ‘ Oh dear .
The legal system tends to decide fairly , of course .
But then , a court action is always a gamble .
Even the best case can go against you . ’
We looked at each other , hurriedly shook his hands and left the chambers .
Somehow the idea of gambling a million pounds did n’t seem such a good idea .
We have an adversarial legal system .
That means something like trial by combat .
It is a slight advance on dipping the plaintiff and defendant in the river to see which one floats the longest , but not by a large margin .
It is more like hiring a mediaeval knight to bash it out with an adversary hired by the other side .
If your knight is not on top form , or has neglected his sword training skills , then you will lose , however just your cause .
Our only option was to curse the wretched company that stole our property , and shake our fists at them .
This proved agreeably effective , because within a year they took their company and their unfortunate investor ’s money across the river Styx , and this time the liquidation was final .
As I write this , I am locked in a legal dispute with a large government organisation .
The details do n’t matter beyond the fact that ( of course ) I am entirely in the right .
However , any legal battle would be like entering a bleeding competition with a blood bank .
Legal victory generally goes to the party with the deepest pockets .
Legal
Aid used to be a wonderful instrument in allowing a small minority lucky enough to get it to win actions against those who did n’t .
Nowadays , however , the only mediaeval knight you can hire with legal aid is desperate , slow - witted or suffering mental hernias .
For the rest of us , guerrilla warfare is the only possible response .
Once , an IT company was foolish enough to attempt litigation with me over a dispute about a contract .
It could all have been settled over a beer in the pub , but tempers flared and they attempted a court claim .
I put in a counter claim and we settled down to trench warfare .
The only difference was that they hired an excellent but costly solicitor , and I settled down contentedly with a pile of legal textbooks .
I started to send in a steady stream of questions , clarifications , requests for discovery of documents , and so on .
This delighted the solicitor , as every request had to be acted on , and each letter he sent out in response meant another charge to his client .
We soon became good friends on first - name terms .
At one point , I got a bad bout of flu and was out of action for a few weeks .
He anxiously contacted me , and even gave me a few tips on the sort of questions I should be asking , or points that should be clarified .
After a while , the initial passions cooled , and any court action was still months or years away .
Meanwhile , their bills mounted steadily and alarmingly .
They began to put out peace feelers , which I ignored .
Then , out - of - the - blue , another company expressed an interest in taking them over .
Of course , nobody is interested in purchasing , or investing in , a company that has court proceedings against them , or who are engaged in litigation .
It is an unquantifiable .
They looked through the file , saw the legal expenses , and told the company that they had to settle before any deal could be reached .
Their solicitor was delighted and leaked the information to me .
It is a rare but delightful experience to sit around a table , smiling affably at people who are grinding their teeth with bottled - up anger , at being forced to offer me a substantial sum of money to settle a claim .
The whole experience did , however , convince me that in the world of commerce , litigation is just a means of feeding lawyers .
And they are always hungry .
Negotiation is the answer .
Much can be achieved at a pub lunch ; and if that fails , then a vile , blood - curling , curse can , in my experience , be most effective .
" Every array symbol is actually a pointer , so you can do both a [ i ] and *( a+i ) "
" A string is the string of characters between the pointer and the ' \0 ' "
There is always this occupying debate about what constitutes computer science .
Alongside is usually a prescription for the students of the discpline : " If you do n't know X , you can't call yourself a programmer " .
Joel Spolksy is the latest entrant with his need - to - know - list : recursion and ... pointers .
Yeah , you heard that right .
Weird as it seems , Joel considers pointers as a first - class concept in computer science and something that gives you a deep insight into programming techniques .
The list that I am familiar with ( and agree with ) is recursion and abstraction .
These two concepts seem to be the core constructs of the way we organize instructions for the computer .
Recursion allows the programmer to define a task in terms of itself only with a decreasing amount of input .
Iteration , which is recursion turned inside out , is what enables us to instruct the computer once and ask it to keep repeating itself .
Abstraction , on the other hand allows us to build a virtual machine by adjusting the view of the computer as seen by the user .
This is the basis of UI design , programming language constructs , object - oriented programming , functional programming and almost any clever idea in computer science .
But pointers ..?
Those unassuming memory location references ?
What concepts do they hold or represent ?
Why would anyone claim that you had to know pointers to be worth your salt , when there 's so little to learn about them .
Even as I had these questions , I realized what Joel was getting at when I looked at the " Test Yourself " examples which required pointer manipulation .
What Joel was actually talking about was the C tricks involved in pointer manipulationorBut these are merely constructs in the C language and are ( atleast in the opinions of some people ) just needlessly kludgy .
They do not demonstrate any first - class concepts that can be described independant of a computer and the way memory is usually organized etc .
Compare this to a lisp concept like closure which can be explained in terms of mathematical concepts .
These do not stretch the student 's mind anymore than a database concept like join or referential integrity does ( " Imagine that the foreign key value actually points to the primary table " ) and are only as difficult to master .
Pointer is just an abstraction introduced in a language to make memory - management more controlled by the programmer .
So it is not sufficient for a computer science student to understand one abstraction , namely the pointer .
They need to study the way abstractions work and become proficient in creating them , not just working with one .
In some cases , programmers are impaired without the ease with which abstractions need to be dealt with .
For example , conside how an XML schema ( which describes the structure of an XML document ) can itself be expressed in XML , called XSD .
Now , since the schema is an XML document , its structure should be described in yet another schema .
The beauty of this Moebius strip lies in abstraction concepts .
One more for the road :
In the Smalltalk language , everything is an Object ( even the Compiler ) .
If every Smalltalk object is of type Object , then what type is the object Object of ?
Think all you want , but pointers wo n't get you out of this one :-)
Mr. Carter said he realized his use of the word “ apartheid ” “ has caused great concern in the Jewish community . ”
He said he had used it “ knowing that it would be provocative . ”
He said he had intended to describe conditions not in Israel but in the occupied Palestinian territories , and had not meant to “ equate Zionism with racism , ” but to point out “ that this cruel oppression is contrary to the tenets of the Jewish religious faith and contrary to the basic principles of the state of Israel . ”
But he said a sentence in which he seemed to suggest that Palestinians would not have to end their suicide bombings and acts of terrorism until Israel withdraws from the territories “ was worded in a completely improper and stupid way , ” adding : “ I have written my publisher to change that sentence immediately .
I apologize to you personally , to everyone here . ”
While many students and professors said they disagreed with elements of the book , they said they welcomed the opportunity to hear Mr. Carter .
“ I ’m happy to have a contrary viewpoint , I ’m happy to have a former president , I ’m happy to have controversy , ” said Daniele Kohn , 21 , a fine arts major , who asked Mr. Carter why , in a television interview , he had seemed to suggest that the Palestinian condition was worse than the Rwandan genocide .
( Mr. Carter responded that he had not meant to suggest that . )
“ I think this school has n’t gotten publicly upset in far too long . ”

Critics have said the book contains errors and misrepresentations of the roles of both the Israelis and the Palestinians .

Mr. Carter ’s book has prompted criticism from many American Jews and some Middle East experts , who say it contains factual errors and misrepresents the role of both the Israelis and the Palestinians .
In addition to the word apartheid , with its implication that Israel ’s actions resemble the racist policies of South Africa , these critics object to Mr. Carter ’s assertion that Israel has committed human rights abuses against the Palestinians , that pro-Israel lobbyists have stifled debate in the United States and that American newspaper editorials are overwhelmingly pro-Israel .
For 18 months now , the George W. Bush administration has periodically raised the charge that Iran is supplying anti-coalition forces in Iraq with arms .
But in the past , high administration officials have always admitted that they have no real evidence to support it .
Now , they are going further .
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice told reporters on her current Middle Eastern trip , " I think there is plenty of evidence that there is Iranian involvement with these networks that are making high - explosive IEDs [ improvised explosive devices ] and that are endangering our troops , and that ’s going to be dealt with . "
However , Rice failed to provide any evidence of official Iranian involvement .
The previous pattern had been that U.S. and British officials suggest that Iranian government involvement in the use by Sunni insurgents or Shiite militias of " shaped charges " that can penetrate U.S. armored vehicles is the only logical conclusion that could be drawn from the facts .
But when asked point blank , they admit that they have no evidence to support it .
That charge serves not just one administration objective but two : it provides an additional justification for aggressive rhetoric and pressures against Tehran and also suggests that Iran bears much of the blame for the sectarian violence in Baghdad and high levels of U.S. casualties from IEDs .
The origins of the theme of Iranian complicity strongly suggest that it was a propaganda line aimed at reducing the Bush administration ’s acute embarrassment at its inability to stop the growing death toll of U.S. troops from shaped charges fired at armored vehicles by Sunni insurgents .
The U.S. command admitted at first that the Sunnis were making the shaped charges themselves .
On Jun. 21 , 2005 , Gen. John R. Vines , then the senior U.S. commander in Iraq , told reporters that the insurgents had probably drawn on bomb - making expertise from former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein ’s army .
A Pentagon official involved in combating the new IEDs also told the New York Times that the first such bombs examined by the U.S. military had required considerable expertise , and that well - trained former government specialists were probably involved in making them .
The use of infrared detonators was regarded as a tribute to the insurgents ’ " resourcefulness , " according to the Pentagon source .
But sometime in the next six weeks , the Bush administration made a decision to start blaming its new problem in Iraq on Tehran .
On Aug. 4 , 2005 , Pentagon and intelligence officials leaked the story to NBC and CBS that U.S. troops had " intercepted " dozens of shaped charges said to have been " smuggled into northeastern Iraq only last week . "
The NBC story quoted intelligence officials as saying they believed the IEDs were shipped into Iraq by Iranian Revolutionary Guards or Hezbollah , but were " convinced it could not have happened without the full consent of the Iranian government . "
These stories were leaked to coincide with public accusations by then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and U.S. Ambassador to Iraq Zalmay Khalilzad that Iran was meddling in Iraqi affairs .
A few days after the stories appeared , Rumsfeld declared that these shaped charges were " clearly , unambiguously from Iran " and blamed Tehran for allowing the cross - border traffic .
But the administration had a major credibility problem with that story .
It could not explain why Iran would want to assist the enemies of the militant Shi’ite parties in Iraq that were aligned with Iran .
British troops in Shi’ite southern Iraq , where the shaped charges were apparently used by Shi’ite militias , had an equally embarrassing problem with the IEDs penetrating their armored vehicles .
An unnamed senior British official in London told BCC on Oct. 5 , 2005 , that the shaped charges that had killed British troops in southern Iraq had come from Hezbollah in Lebanon via Iran .
The following day , British Prime Minister Tony Blair took the occasion of a joint press conference with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani to declare that the circumstances surrounding the bombs that killed British soldiers " lead us either to Iranian elements or to Hezbollah . "
But Blair conceded that he had no evidence of such a link .
Privately British officials said that the only basis for their suspicions was that the technology was similar in design to the shaped charges used by Hezbollah in its war to drive Israel out of southern Lebanon in the 1980s .
Anthony Cordesman , a highly respected military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington , explained why the story line blaming Iran for the IED problem in Iraq did n’t hold water .
" A lot of this is just technology that is leaked into an informal network , " he told Associated Press .
" What works in one country gets known elsewhere . "
The Blair government soon dropped that propaganda line .
The Independent reported Jan. 5 , 2006 , that government officials acknowledged privately that there was no " reliable intelligence " connecting the Iranian government to the more powerful IEDs in the south .
However , the U.S. administration continued to push that accusation , and Bush himself raised the theme for the first time at a press conference Mar. 13 , 2006 .
" Some of the most powerful IEDs we ’re seeing in Iraq today , " he said , " came from Iran . "
Bush quoted the director of national intelligence , John Negroponte , as testifying , " Tehran has been responsible for at least some of the increasing lethality of anti-coalition attacks by providing Shia militia with the capability to building improvised explosive devices . "
No reporter has followed up on what Negroponte meant by providing the " capability " to build such devices or why the militias would need to go outside Iraq to find that know - how .
The day after Bush ’s press conference , Gen. Peter Pace , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , admitted at a Pentagon news conference that he had no evidence of the Iranian government sending any military equipment or personnel into Iraq .
Rumsfeld , appearing with Pace , said , " All you know is that you find equipment in a country that came from the neighboring country . "
Last November , as the release of the Iraq Study Group report approached , administration officials again planted the story of intercepted Iranian - made weapons and munitions it had leaked in mid-2005 .
ABC News reported Nov. 30 that a " senior defense official " had told them of " smoking - gun evidence of Iranian support for terrorists in Iraq : brand new weapons fresh from Iranian factories . "
The new twist in the story was that the weapons allegedly had manufacturing dates in 2006 .
The story continued , " This suggests , say the sources , that the material is going directly from Iranian factories to Shia militias , rather than taking a roundabout path through the black market . "
The assumption underlying the anti-Iran defense department spin that a private market for weapons or , more likely , components , could not move them from Iran across the porous border to Iraq in a few months is far - fetched .
At about the same time Bush apparently gave orders that the U.S. military should seize any Iranians in the country in an effort to get some kind of evidence to use in support of its propaganda theme .
The first such operation came in central Baghdad just before Christmas , and a second raid against Iranian diplomats in Irbil was carried out to coincide with the president ’s speech last Wednesday .
These raids , presented to the public as part of a campaign against targets supposedly identified through good intelligence , were clearly aimed at trying to substantiate an anti-Iran line for which the administration has no credible evidence .
Those raids now create a requirement to produce something new to justify them .

What H.V.N. does dispute is that the psychological anguish caused by hearing voices is indicative of an overarching mental illness .
This argument , disseminated through a quarterly newsletter , numerous pamphlets and speeches and alternative mental - health journals , are as voluminous and diverse as its membership .
But H.V.N. ’s brief against psychiatry can be boiled down to two core positions .
The first is that many more people hear voices , and hear many more kinds of voices , than is usually assumed .
The second is that auditory hallucination — or “ voice - hearing , ” H.V.N. ’s more neutral preference — should be thought of not as a pathological phenomenon in need of eradication but as a meaningful , interpretable experience , intimately linked to a hearer ’s life story and , more commonly than not , to unresolved personal traumas .
In 2005 , Louise Pembroke , a prominent member of H.V.N. , proposed a World Hearing Voices Day ( held the next year ) that would “ challenge negative attitudes toward people who hear voices on the incorrect assumption that this is in itself a sign of illness , an assumption made about them that is not based on their own experiences , is stigmatizing , isolating and makes people ill . ”
H.V.N. ’s insistence that it is not just the psychotic who hear voices does not , in fact , contradict psychiatric orthodoxy .
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , the so - called bible of psychiatry , auditory hallucinations are only a potential symptom of mental illness — they must appear with other symptoms , persist for a specified length of time and impede day - to - day functioning in order to become part of a diagnosable syndrome .
In a 2001 debate on whether voices are by definition pathological , Tony David , a neuropsychiatrist at the Institute of Psychiatry in London , noted that a “ voice - hearer who is not in any distress , who lives a fruitful and productive life according to commonsense criteria , would never enter the arena in which the possibility of mental illness was up for discussion . ”
Nor does psychiatry insist that the syndrome in question when a voice - hearer is in distress is invariably schizophrenia .
Approximately 20 percent of patients suffering from mania and 10 percent of patients suffering from depression hear voices .
Auditory hallucinations can also be caused by “ organic ” conditions , like Parkinson ’s , Alzheimer ’s , temporal - lobe epilepsy , hyperthyroidism and migraine headaches , and have long been known to occur in the twilight consciousness between wakefulness and sleep .
That said , H.V.N. ’s insistence that voice - hearers should attend carefully to what their hallucinations say is far from traditional .
Prolonged exposure to untreated psychosis is held by many experts to be damaging to an individual ’s ability to hold down a job or to maintain a meaningful relationship and by others to be damaging to brain function — what clinicians refer to as “ psychosocial toxicity ” and “ neurotoxicity , ” respectively .
And though psychiatrists acknowledge that almost anyone is capable of hallucinating a voice under certain circumstances , they maintain that the hallucinations that occur with psychoses are qualitatively different .
“ One should n’t place too much emphasis on the content of hallucinations , ” says Jeffrey Lieberman , chairman of the psychiatry department at Columbia University .
“ When establishing a correct diagnosis , it ’s important to focus on the signs or symptoms ” of a particular disorder .
That is , it ’s crucial to determine how the voices manifest themselves .
Voices that speak in the third person , echo a patient ’s thoughts or provide a running commentary on his actions are considered classically indicative of schizophrenia .
Interpreting voices in relation to a patient ’s past has a checkered history in the treatment of psychosis .
Though Freud discouraged the application of psychoanalysis to psychotic patients , it nonetheless became , for 25 years after World War II , a widespread treatment for schizophrenia in the English - speaking world .
This episode in psychiatry is now widely acknowledged to have been a medical and moral disaster ; crippling psychoses were routinely blamed on insufficiently nurturing and “ schizophrenogenic ” mothers .
“ The psychoanalytic approach to psychosis was toxic , ” says Peter Weiden , a professor of psychiatry at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn .
“ Clinicians of that time were often highly antagonistic toward family members .
They blamed the parents , left them out of the treatment process and isolated the patient from his family . ”
Over the past 30 years , the biomedical model displaced the psychoanalytic one , bolstered by advances in pharmacology , modern genetic and neurological research and the completion of large - scale empirical studies that concluded that psychoanalysis was useless at best and actively destructive at worst .
Today , medication is typically prescribed to extinguish , or at least mitigate , voices ( about 80 percent of patients experience a reduction in voices , Weiden says , from medication alone , though this does not always translate into an equal improvement in day - to - day functioning ) ; psychotherapy is usually admitted as an adjunct , to deal with issues of social functioning and stigma .
There are signs , however , that psychotherapy is again encroaching on the biomedical paradigm in the treatment of psychoses .
Since the 1990s , a growing number of researchers and clinicians , predominantly based in England , have been comparing voice - hearing in psychotic patients with voice - hearing in nonpatients , measuring the incidence of hallucinations in the general population , and using cognitive behavioral therapy ( C.B.T. ) , a popular , short - term treatment for depression and anxiety , to help them manage their responses to the voices they continue to hear .
C.B.T. typically asks patients to scrutinize how they interpret their symptoms rather than focusing on an illness as an underlying cause .
“ The matter of whether it ’s effective , and to what extent , ” Lieberman says , is still being investigated .
So far , the use of C.B.T. in the treatment of psychoses is much more prevalent in the U.K. than in the U.S.
In large part , Lieberman says , this is because “ the motivation to research the treatment has mostly come from investigators in England . ”
But , he added , “ you could also read into the situation the influence of a strong antipsychiatry or antimedication movement in England — there ’s more of an interest in getting nonmedication treatments into clinical use . ”
In England , this new cognitive approach to psychosis and the efforts of Hearing Voices Network are independent of each other , and are sometimes at odds .
H.V.N. ’s leading members , for instance , frequently criticize even sympathetic academic researchers for being insufficiently political .
Yet both approaches share a similar purpose in seeking to place voice - hearing within the continuum of normal human experience — one , in order to better treat patients , the other , out of a firm conviction that hearing voices need not interfere with leading an otherwise “ normal ” life .
Over the years , they have forged something of an alliance ; psychologists , though they may not embrace H.V.N. ’s more polemical views , frequently refer their patients to H.V.N. groups , while H.V.N. frequently cites the research of psychologists .
And both H.V.N. and the cognitive approach to psychosis can be traced , to varying degrees , to the same radical figure .
When H.V.N. is accused of being hostile to psychiatry , its members sometimes point out that the organization was , in effect , founded by a psychiatrist — albeit a singularly unorthodox one .
In 1986 , Marius Romme , a professor of psychiatry at Maastricht University in the Netherlands , was referred a patient , Patsy Hage , who suffered from chronic auditory hallucinations and fell into a deep , suicidal depression .
Hage took comfort only from reading “ The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind , ” an eccentric book , published in 1976 , by Julian Jaynes , a Princeton psychologist , in which he argues that before around 2,000 B.C. , all humans were guided by hallucinated verbal commands caused by a physical split between the right and left hemispheres of the brain .
40 Detained for Protesting Coca -Cola On Water Day
Over 40 Detained for Protesting Coca - Cola on World Water Day
Protests Against Coca - Cola and Pepsico for Creating Water Shortages
For Immediate Release
March 22 , 2007
New Delhi ( March 22 ) : Over 40 people protesting Coca - Cola ’s operations in India have been detained by police authorities in the capital city of New Delhi , India , today .
More than three hundred people had marched to the government of India offices of the Planning Commission to seek action from the government on water issues on World Water Day .
As of this writing , details of the police actions are still coming in and it is not clear what charges , if any , will be filed .
Protesters were demanding that the Planning Commission ( chaired by the Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh ) take immediate action to curb the severe water shortages being experienced by communities across India as a result of Coca - Cola and Pepsico ’s mining of groundwater .
“ We are here on World Water Day to bring attention to one of the world ’s worst abusers of water , the Coca - Cola company , ” said Nandlal Master of Lok Samiti and National Alliance of People ’s Movements , one of the organizers of the march and also detained .
“ The Coca - Cola company has destroyed the lives of thousands of people in India as a result of its thirst for water . ”
Carrying signs such as “ Coca - Cola Pani Chor ” – “ Coca - Cola Water Thief ” , the protesters were indignant that the government of India has not taken actions to ameliorate the bleak water conditions facing thousands of Indians who live around Coca - Cola and Pepsico bottling plants .
Also detained was Medha Patkar , leader of the National Alliance of People ’s Movements .
Coca - Cola 's operations in India have come under intense scrutiny as many communities are experiencing severe water shortages as well as contaminated groundwater and soil , directly as a result of Coca - Cola 's bottling operations .
The company has also been found to sell products in India with dangerously high levels of pesticides .
“ The world needs to know that the Coca - Cola company has an extremely unsustainable relationship with water , its primary raw material .
Drinking Coca - Cola contributes directly to the loss of lives , livelihoods and communities in India .
On this World Water Day , we encourage people around the world to think before they drink Coca - Cola , ” said Amit Srivastava of the India Resource Center , an international campaigning organization .

element is better for semantics .
Since you know the element will contain video you can then easily do specific things with it .
Since the element is separate you can design a specific video API on top of it that scripts can use .
This is quite different from XHTML 2 where every element can potentially embed video using the src attribute .
I suppose this approach is appealing to some people , but it makes it much more complex to provide an API as currently that API is available on all elements .
And all elements would also have a drawing API ( < canvas > ) , grid API ( < datagrid > ) et cetera .
Maybe to solve that problem you would use the magical role attribute with values such as canvas , video and datagrid .
Besides that it would be in my opinion very confusing if the API changed on an attribute value why not just use a dedicated element ?
Having a dedicated element also allows attributes specific to the functionality it provides .
For instance , a ui attribute is considered for the < video > element that would let authors say that they want the user agent to provide the user interface .

How to be an expert
The only thing standing between you - as - amateur and you - as - expert is dedication .
All that talk about prodigies ?
We could all be prodigies ( or nearly so ) if we just put in the time and focused .
At least that 's what the brain guys are saying .
Best of all - - it 's almost never too late .
Seriously .
How many people think they 've missed their opportunity to be a musician , or an expert golfer , or even a chess grand master because they did n't start when they were young ?
Or because they simply lacked natural talent ?
Those people are ( mostly ) wrong .
According to some brain scientists , almost anyone can develop world - class ( or at least top expertise ) abilities in things for which they are n't physically impaired .
Apparently God -given talent , natural " gifts " , and genetic predispositions just are n't all they 're cracked up to be .
Or at least not in the way most of us always imagined .
It turns out that rather than being naturally gifted at music or math or chess or whatever , a superior performer most likely has a gift for concentration , dedication , and a simple desire to keep getting better .
In theory , again , anyone willing to do what 's required to keep getting better WILL get better .
Maybe the " naaturally talented artist " was simply the one who practiced a hell of a lot more .
Or rather , a hell of a lot more deliberately .
Dr. K. Anders Ericsson , professor of psychology at Florida State University , has spent most of his 20 + year career on the study of genuises , prodigies , and superior performers .
In the book The New Brain ( it was on my coffee table ) Richard Restak quotes Ericsson as concluding :
" For the superior performer the goal is n't just repeating the same thing again and again but achieving higher levels of control over every aspect of their performance .
That 's why they do n't find practice boring .
Each practice session they are working on doing something better than they did the last time . "
So it 's not just how long they practice , it 's how they practice .
Basically , it comes down to something like this :
Most of us want to practice the things we 're already good at , and avoid the things we suck at .
We stay average or intermediate amateurs forever .
Yet the research says that if we were willing to put in more hours , and to use those hours to practice the things that are n't so fun , we could become good .
Great .
Potentially brilliant .
We need , as Restak refers to it , " a rage to master . "
That dedication to mastery drives the potential expert to focus on the most subtle aspects of performance , and to never be satisfied .
There is always more to improve on , and they 're willing to work on the less fun stuff .
Restak quotes Sam Snead , considered one of the top five golfers of the twentieth century , as saying :
" I know it 's a lot more fun to stand on the practice tee and rip your driver than it is to chip and ptch , or practice sand shots with sand flying back in your face , but it all comes back to the question of how much you 're willing to pay for success . "
There 's much more to the brain science around this topic , of course -- I 'm just doing the highlights .
And a lot of the research is new , made possible today by how easy it is for researchers to get time with an fMRI or PET scan .
And I stretched just a little ... there is some thought that to be , literally , THE best in the world at chess , or the violin , or math , or programming , or golf , etc. you might indeed need that genetic special something .
But ... that 's to be THE best .
The research does suggest that whatever that special sauce is , it accounts for only that last little 1 % that pushes someone into the world champion status .
The rest of us -- even without the special sauce -- could still become world ( or at least national ) class experts , if we do the time , and do it the right way .
Where this ties into passionate users is with the suck threshold and kick - ass ( aka " passion " ) threshold .
Your users will typically fall into one of the three categories in the graphic : expert , amateur , or drop - out .
The drop - outs decide that during that " I suck at this " phase , it is n't worth continuing .
They give up .
Is that something you can work on ?
Do you know what your attrition rate is ?
But the most troubling -- and where we have the most leverage -- is with the amateur who is satisfied with where they are .
These are the folks who you overhear saying , " Yes , I know there 's a better way to do this thing , but I already know how to do it this [ less efficient , less powerful ] way and it 's easy for me to just keep doing it like that . "
In other words , they made it past the suck threshold , but now they do n't want to push for new skills and capabilities .
They do n't want to suck again .
But that means they 'll never get past the kick - ass threshold where there 's a much greater chance they 'll become passionate about it .
The further up that capability curve they are , the higher - res the user experience is !
Can we help make it easier for them to continue on the path to becoming expert ?
Remember , being better is better .
Whatever you 're better at becomes more fun , more satisfying , a richer experience , and it leads to more flow .
This is what we 're trying to do for our users .
Oh yes , about that never too late thing ... most of us can kiss that Olympic ice skating medal good - bye .
And at 5 ' 4 " , my basketball career is probably hopeless .
But think about this ... actress Geena Davis nearly qualified for the US Olympic archery team in a sport she took up at the age of 40 , less than three years before the Olympic tryouts .
And if the neuroscientists are right , you can create new brain cells -- by learning ( and not being stuck in a dull cubicle ) -- at virtually any age .
Think about it ... if you 're 30 today , if you take up the guitar tomorrow , you 'll have been playing for TWENTY years by the time you 're 50 .
You 'll be kicking some serious guitar butt .
And if you 're 50 today , there 's no reason you can't be kicking guitar butt at 70 .
What are you waiting for ?

I always though that I 'd picked up guitar too late , even at the young age of 17 , but now at the ripe old age of 31 I 've been at it for almost 15 years .
( Wow ... 5 away from 20 ! )
And now for some reason I barely have to work at it at all to get better each year .
People keep noticing new little riffs and sounds and say how much I 've progressed .
But I barely practice at all ( mostly RSI puts a stop to it quick smart ) .
All I do is play with the band once a week or so and I go from strength to strength .
Not that I 'm complaining , I think it 's great .
I guess just " doing " your craft once your into the kick ass level is enough to propel you along .

J. Michael ,
I too find myself taking up something new , getting bored or just losing interest in it when I see something else I might like to try .
It is irritating because I want to just latch onto something , but yet I can't seem to do that .
Instead I am always starting projects but never finishing .
I think it is lack of attention , I always find myself getting easily distracted .

J. Michael , Bradleyscott ,
I too had this problem , but just lately I recognized a pattern to a lot of stuff ( not all ) I ’ve been doing over the year : communication .
Writing , theatre , teaching , marketing , layout , graphics , brain / mind , creativity etc .
Facing the close - down of my employer , I really got to look at those things and what drove me to it and away from it .
In the end , I came to the conclusion , that my overarching passion was communication ( as in one - to - one or one - to - a few , not mass communication ) .
Perhaps there is a deeper pattern to all the things you do and did ?
And if not , finde peace of mind in the fact that with every thing you do , you learn a bit more about your self , eliminating all the things that you ’re not passionate about .
Just enjoy the ride !

Most people never say that * they * suck : Always * it* or * this * sucks ... never themselves .
Posted by : gmlk | Mar 4 , 2006 5:56:03 AM
But how do we reconcile this approach with Buckingham 's " go with your strengths " approach you posted on previously ?
On the surface they seem contradictory : to move from amateur to expert , Ericsson and Restak want us to practice the no-fun areas we suck at .
But Buckingham wants us to focus on what we 're good at , not what we suck at .
For the Ericsson approach , it 's not that you select your domain using your strengths ( e.g. Geena Davies ) .
And it 's not that you then manage " acquiring " domain mastery by focusing on strengths ( e.g. Sam Snead quote ) .
So where does that leave Buckingham ?
Maybe a solution is that you need to recognize weak areas , and work on avoiding having your overall performance depend on these areas ( you touched on this in your Strengths post : " I suggest taking a very hard look at the " areas of improvement " list and see if we can rearrange the context so that those things become less important " ) .
And , at the same time , focus on the no-fun practice on improving weaker areas ...?
But that solution does n't really resolve the Ericsson vs. Buckingham issue , does it ?
In my profession ( language teaching ) there are interminable debates on methodology and the " right way " to do things .
I think the solution to our debate here is the same as how we should approach any learning methodology issue : both can be “ right ” sometimes for some people in some circumstances .
Every learner is unique : brain chemistry , family / social / cultural network , school or work environment – so any “ this is how to do it ” is affected by so many variables that it is tenuous as a generalization .
In teaching , recognizing and helping learners understand their uniqueness , and how they can best learn with it , is the essence of being learner - centered .
So , if we want to be active , autonomous and accountable learners , we have to be aware of both the Ericsson and Buckingham approaches and how they could affect our individual situation .
Both approaches are tools in our toolbox , we have to select the right one for each job , and each learner is the best judge of his / her tools , as long as they understand the tool .
Any ideas here Kathy , other than my " it all depends " sidestep ?

This post rings true in a lot of ways .
What I 'd like to add , without downplaying natural talent which is a real thing , is that it 's very likely that the people who are perceived as having natural talent have the natural inclination to enjoying that activity .
I play the piano and program computers .
I love doing both of these things , and I would consider myself in the expert stage of both .
I probably have natural talent in these areas , but more importantly I have passion for them .
I 've heard enough sob stories from people who stopped taking piano lessons too soon to know that the primary difference between me and them is I practiced and did n't quit .
Actually , I did hate practicing when I was a kid and did quit , but luckily I was good enough that I could play interesting things and a couple of years later I started up again , of my own accord , and that 's when I took off .
So " naturals " have not only some talent , but the natural passion to keep at it .
I completely agree about the not too late point .
Most of us have things we feel we would really enjoy being good at , so let 's start making progress .
I like how the expert curve is steep through the amateur phase .
You can really whip through that phase if you 're dedicated enough .
Posted by : Hans | Mar 4 , 2006 9:00:23 AM
When you 're a beginner then any learning no matter how badly targetted is likely to increase your skills and pique your interest ; when you 're an expert you know exactly what you need to learn and you can spend your time well .
In between it 's difficult to find the right thing to work on , to find a class that 's not too easy and not too hard , and it 's difficult to see progress from class to class : the graph might be going upward when you look at it from a distance , but when you zoom on it there are ups and downs and plateaus .
I took up drawing a year ago at the age of 30 , and I 'm following a course that avoids the suck threshold by forcing you to always use your eyes , so if you 've found a suck threshold trick say for drawing hands , it 'll force you to unlearn it by say spending an hour drawing the pattern of wrinkles on the second knuckle of your little finger .
I gave up drawing when I was ten , so by the argument of ' the next ten years will go by anyway ' , if I keep it up till I 'm 40 I could have the skills of a 20 year old art student , and that 's the plan .
The difficulty at the moment is that I 'm a 31 year old with the skills of a moderately talented eleven year old ; if I was eleven I could show off , people would think I was gifted , this would encourge me to practise more , and a virtuous circle would begin ; at my age I 'm judged by standards of adult competence , I 'll have nothing I can show off for another four or five years , so my motivation has to be internal .
Posted by : dl | Mar 4 , 2006 9:15:08 AM
and here I thought that the expert use of bullshit and assertiveness played a role in one becoming an expert , tells you what I know , lol .
Seriously though , any ideas ( be it Kaizen or whatever ) that focus on continual improvement are good ones .
When it comes to excellence in any pursuit there are an endless supply of rungs on the ladder ; the dilema for some folks however is there are also an endless supply of attractive ladders to climb .
Will you be successful if you choose to climb as many ladders as you can in the limited time you have rather than just one ladder in order to be considered an " expert " ?
The answer to that question lies of course in what your definition of success is .

If you aspire to be a kick - ass golfer , you work on the ugly stuff , too , because you can't stand sucking at ANY aspect of the game .
On the other hand , if you aspire to be the World 's Far-est Hitting Driver , you will spend alot of time whacking long soaring drives , but you will also work on ' ugly ' stuff like shaft dynamics , core - strengthening exercises , grip materials . . and all sorts tweaks and nuances that other golfers never think about .

This relates to the Satir Change Model and the " Unconsciously Incompetent to Consciously Competent " idea .
I just blogged about it here : http://homepage.mac.com/keithray/blog/2006/03/04#SatirChangeModelComptency
Most people are unwilling to pass into the " chaos " stage of learning a skill ( " Consciously Incompetent " ) .

Considering the weaknesses / strengths problem :
Think about plants and fertilizers .
Liebig discovered that there the growth of a plant is limited by the chemical that is not supplied in sufficient quantity , forming a bottleneck for the growth , the " performance " of the plant .
Add the chemical , and the plant performs better .
And another chemical now becomes the bottleneck .
So , your weak areas are not necessarily the ones you need to work on .
This is only the case if you a ) consider your performance to be too low , if b ) your weak area is the bottleneck and if c ) you want to enhance your performance .
Then you would have to broaden that bottleneck , i.e. work on your weak area until your overall performance increases .
Over time , the same conditions a , b and c could again apply , this time perhaps with another weak area .

Hey Kathy .
I took a course once where it was stated that the idiom " Practice makes perfect " is somewhat flawed and at best mediocre and it should be better expressed " PERFECT practice makes perfect " .
Funny , I 've always remembered that .

I 'm good at a lot of things .
I 'm very good at quite a few .
Becoming an absolute expert in area has not been my goal in life .
Or at least I 've not found that one passion yet .
Being a generalist has it's advantages - it 's amazing how much trivia I 've learned in different subjects :-)
My goal is to keep learning new things .
Great blog !!

I both play and coach women ’s ice hockey and I ’ve noticed that many female skaters tend to have a good idea of the level that they want to play at .
Once they reach that level , they stop trying to get better and just enjoy the game .
In ice hockey it ’s easy to see who is competitive and who is just happy to be on the ice .
When I first noticed this phenomenon it frustrated me because I could not understand why everyone did n’t want to improve .
I ’ve come to realize that some folks are just happy to be able to participate .
That for them hockey is not an activity that they are driven to compete in .
The activity fills some other need , be it exercise , social , or something else .
My athletic experiences support the idea that one of the differences between an expert and an amateur is the expert ’s emphasis on the fundamentals .
But one other difference is the expert ’s emotional desire to go to the next level .
An expert is often passionate about their activity of choice and they enjoy the challenges the activity presents .
And just a tip for those folks who want to be experts but find some of the fundamentals boring ... make it into a game .
In the post “ Do n’t forget square one ... ”
Kathy talks about the Go master reading a fundamental book and trying to do the exercises faster than in the past .
He made practicing the fundamentals fun .
I suspect that the ability to make the practice of those boring , tedious skills fun is one of the big differences between an amateur who tries to become an expert and can’t , and the amateur who succeeds .
We learn better when we are having fun and we learn deeper when we share the learning with others .
And how many experts do you know who do n’t share their passion for the chosen activity ?
Not many .

You are so right , it ’s never too late to change .
I once asked a fellow cyclist , on a South Island New Zealand tour , how long he ’d been biking .
Since he was over 80 , and still happily riding 80 km + per day , I expected the answer to be in decades …
“ About 5 years ” was the reply .

Stick at it and eventually you will begin to enjoy it / get better at it .
That sounds a lot like what my parents say when I complain about certain lessons in school .
Somehow your article makes it sound a lot more appealing and a lot like good advice !

Keep looking for new ground .
Keep pushing yourself .
I do n't know what I will be doing next ( so much to choose from and so many possibilities ) , that is already such a kick !
I always say it to myself " Tarry , You 're doing it now , why not do it all the way ! "
Life is short .
Stop dying all the time and go ahead and do something great starting today .

Mmmm .
This is good thinking fodder .
Great comment thread , too .
Reminds me that I need to re-read George Leonard 's " Mastery . "
Anybody enjoying this post or thread would probably dig it -- it 's a classic text on the subject of becoming an expert .
He frames his arguements , in large part , through the lens of his akido practice .
Good stuff .

I 've lived this post .
When I was in the ninth grade , I could n't pass the academically gifted test and had an IQ of 104 .
Shortly before graduating from college , I had my IQ tested again and finished with a 161 .
The psychologist was astounded .
The difference ?
Over that time period , my health declined considerably , and all I could really do to entertain myself was read .
In school , I was reading 2 - 3 books per week , in addition to my assignments .
In college , I was reading at least one book per day .
I moved from subject to subject , reading every major book in the industry .
Then I journaled about it , frequently writing 5 - 10 pages per day .
In other words , I was thinking and reflecting almost all the time .
It was like a bodybuilding plan for the brain .
And the results were profound .
So yes , dedication is the secret to becoming an expert , regardless of whether it 's forced on you , such as in my case , or not .
That being said , I know two prodigies .
I 'll never , ever be as good as them on certain subjects .
But that 's fine with me .
Being the best results in a lot of expectations , and it 's enough to drive someone insane .
Most prodigies are also savants , losing every day competencies in exchange for their extraordinary abilities .
I would rather be ( fairly ) normal and second best .

Very true , we can pick up any skill at any age .
But behind the new skill and becoming an expert , is the discipline of discipline .
Unless there is discipline , can we learn anything ?
Can we learn discipline at a later age ?

Would really like to hear your thoughts on this .

The comments to this entry are closed .
If I am to take any solace from the troubles in Northern Ireland and the perplexing answers my own parents gave me , it is that — on occasion and sometimes against all expectations — a certain amount of endurance brings about a possibility of hope .
The questions about Northern Ireland are different this week .
Today , the 108 - member Assembly is scheduled to enter a historic power - sharing agreement between Sinn Fein and the Democratic Unionist Party .
In the past , the two parties sat at the province ’s most distant extremes .
The Democratic Unionist leader , the Rev. Ian Paisley , once said that he would be ready for talks only “ when you marry Christ to Beelzebub . ”
So what happened ?
Did he and Sinn Fein ’s Gerry Adams just grow up ?
Were they able to understand the terror of fathers and grandfathers — that our children might one day become as bad , or as conflicted , or as confused , as us ?
Is today ’s swearing - in ceremony the final , inevitable triumph of reason over hatred ?
Hardly .
The victories of peace are n’t as immediate as those of war .
It is difficult to imagine the members of the Assembly ’s opposing parties shaking hands and agreeing on the colors of the flowers for the Easter parade .
It will be a long , rocky road .
Parts of the North are still separated by 50 - foot - high “ peace ” walls .
More than 90 percent of public housing is segregated , and research has shown that even 3 - year - olds still display sectarian instincts .
But in the aftermath of so many decades of violence , children are out in East Belfast scrubbing the walls free of political graffiti .
Fierce enemies are shaking hands .
Prisons , like the infamous H - Block , have been torn down .
There is no greater moment in war than the end of it .
The vague dream of getting older , for politicians and terrorists and even children , is that we can somehow still become better people .
As much as anything , the move toward devolution is a glimmer of hope for the rest of the world — if it can happen in Northern Ireland , it ’s possible that it can happen anywhere .
Palestine .
Sri Lanka .
Iraq .
One of the reasons that center holds is that no one politician , or party , or popular figure is trying to own the peace .
It is an international agreement that owes as much to the vision of political leaders as it does to the thousands of mothers and fathers who have brokered it from the inside .
The questions of this generation of children are yet to be shaped .
With luck and vision , the “ Why ? ” will be said with a bewildered look backward rather than with a horrified glance about .
For a nation that has shouldered so much for so long , the possibility of no more needless small white coffins is almost answer enough .

Mysterious red cells might be aliens By Jebediah Reed
Popular Science
Scientists have yet to identify these unusual red particles .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Popular Science or or Create Your Own ( PopSci.com ) --
As bizarre as it may seem , the sample jars brimming with cloudy , reddish rainwater in Godfrey Louis 's laboratory in southern India may hold , well , aliens .
In April , Louis , a solid - state physicist at Mahatma Gandhi University , published a paper in the prestigious peer - reviewed journal Astrophysics and Space Science in which he hypothesizes that the samples -- water taken from the mysterious blood - colored showers that fell sporadically across Louis 's home state of Kerala in the summer of 2001 -- contain microbes from outer space .
Specifically , Louis has isolated strange , thick - walled , red - tinted cell - like structures about 10 microns in size .
Stranger still , dozens of his experiments suggest that the particles may lack DNA yet still reproduce plentifully , even in water superheated to nearly 600 degrees Fahrenheit .
( The known upper limit for life in water is about 250 degrees Fahrenheit . )
So how to explain them ?
Louis speculates that the particles could be extraterrestrial bacteria adapted to the harsh conditions of space and that the microbes hitched a ride on a comet or meteorite that later broke apart in the upper atmosphere and mixed with rain clouds above India .
If his theory proves correct , the cells would be the first confirmed evidence of alien life and , as such , could yield tantalizing new clues to the origins of life on Earth .
Last winter , Louis sent some of his samples to astronomer Chandra Wickramasinghe and his colleagues at Cardiff University in Wales , who are now attempting to replicate his experiments ; Wickramasinghe expects to publish his initial findings later this year .
Meanwhile , more down - to - earth theories abound .
One Indian government investigation conducted in 2001 lays blame for what some have called the " blood rains " on algae .
Other theories have implicated fungal spores , red dust swept up from the Arabian peninsula , even a fine mist of blood cells produced by a meteor striking a high - flying flock of bats .
Louis and his colleagues dismiss all these theories , pointing to the fact that both algae and fungus possess DNA and that blood cells have thin walls and die quickly when exposed to water and air .
More important , they argue , blood cells do n't replicate .
" We 've already got some stunning pictures -- transmission electron micrographs -- of these cells sliced in the middle , " Wickramasinghe says .
" We see them budding , with little daughter cells inside the big cells . "
Louis 's theory holds special appeal for Wickramasinghe .
A quarter of a century ago , he co-authored the modern theory of panspermia , which posits that bacteria - riddled space rocks seeded life on Earth .
" If it 's true that life was introduced by comets four billion years ago , " the astronomer says , " one would expect that microorganisms are still injected into our environment from time to time .
This could be one of those events . "
The next significant step , explains University of Sheffield microbiologist Milton Wainwright , who is part of another British team now studying Louis 's samples , is to confirm whether the cells truly lack DNA .
So far , one preliminary DNA test has come back positive .
" Life as we know it must contain DNA , or it 's not life , " he says .
" But even if this organism proves to be an anomaly , the absence of DNA would n't necessarily mean it's extraterrestrial . "
Louis and Wickramasinghe are planning further experiments to test the cells for specific carbon isotopes .
If the results fall outside the norms for life on Earth , it would be powerful new evidence for Louis 's idea , of which even Louis himself remains skeptical .

DRM Crippled CD : A bizarre tale in 4 parts
DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE : Ever come across something that only gets stranger and stranger the deeper you delve into it ?
That was my experience when I almost purchased a new CD -- a DRM crippled CD -- this weekend .
This tale is part of a larger struggle within the recording and digital download industry -- not of P2P or piracy -- but one of innovation and competition .
As you follow this odd story ( broken into 4 increasingly strange parts ) , you will note that as it gets weirder , Artists and Consumers are the collateral damage .
It makes one wonder just what the hell the Recording Industry is thinking about these days :
< spacer >
Part I
A friend with whom I frequently swap Music and Film suggestions ( as well as mixed CDs ) asks me if I have ever heard of the band " My Morning Jacket . "
I have not .
She suggests checking out the album Z .
The album is very well reviewed .
So I fire up iTunes , go to the music store .
The band is rather interesting , not your typical pop fare .
Sounds like a cross between Morcheeba and The White Stripes .
( Rolling Stone heard elements of Radiohead , The Who and Lynyrd Skynyrd ) .
Lush , ethereal , offbeat music , mixed with some electronica , but mostly straightforward fuzzbox - driven rock - n- roll .
My kind of stuff .
I hop over to Amazon to read some reviews ( mostly positive ) .
I am about to purchase the disc , when I notice the DRM info .
( See Amazon DRM reviews below . )
The reviewers note that Sony has crippled the disc with Sunncomm 's latest DRM software .
( You may remember Sunncomm 's infamous shift key incident ) .
The key restriction of this particular DRM is that it renders a disc nontransferable to the iPod .
Nor can you make a backup copy , or travel discs , or a copy for the weekend house , or use any of the songs on a mixed disc .
Oh , and it wo n't work with my iTunes Music software ( and that also means no shuffle play ) .
Since the CD is incompatible with Apple iTunes , and the music cannot be transferred to an iPod , it eliminates about half of my legal uses for it .
So I do n't buy the CD , ' cause it wo n't do what I need it to do .
Chalk up a lost sale to DRM .
< spacer >
Part II
Here 's where our tale takes a turn for the bizarre : According to the Band / Label 's website , these DRM restrictions were put on the CD without their knowledge or permission :
Information Regarding Our Artists ' Music , Copy - Protected CDs and your iPod
We at ATO Records are aware of the problems being experienced by certain fans due to the copy - protection of our distributor .
Neither we nor our artists ever gave permission for the use of this technology , nor is it our distributor 's opinion that they need our permission .
Wherever it is our decision , we will forego use of copy - protection , just as we have in the past .
That 's simply a stunner .
The loss of good will and fan support must be significant to the band .
That 's a very real monetary damage to the band .
( I wonder what their legal options are ) .
It becomes even more absurd when you consider that " ATO Records permits audiotaping at our artists ' performance . "
So this is a very forward looking , copyright - friendly bunch of folk .
I would hope that in the future , music agents and attorneys remember to address this in label contracts on the band 's behalf .
< spacer >
Part III
As odd as the story is so far , its about to get a whole lot weirder :
It turns out that all Engadget ( quoting Variety ) notes that this DRM is not at all about making the CD immune to piracy .
Instead , its part of a pissing contest between Sony and Apple : Variety writes that " the new copy protection scheme — which makes it difficult to rip CDs and listen to them with an iPod — is designed to put pressure on Apple to open the iPod to other music services , rather than making it dependent on the iTunes Music Store for downloads . "
You mean to tell me that this is n't even about P2P and unauthorized downloading ?
How annoying is that ?
Sony has their panties in a bunch cause Apple has been kicking their arses all over the innovation and digital music schoolyard ?
So the mature response from a major global conmsumer electronics corporation is to take their ball and go home ?
DRM is now being used as a competitive economic weapon -- not as an anti-piracy tool .
As a music consumer , I find this ridiculous .
Why I cannot use a legally purchased CD -- because Sony is miffed at Apple for creating the 2000's version of their Walkman -- is beyond absurd .
I am very , very annoyed at this .
In fact , I am so perturbed at this act of wanton stupidity , that two imminent purchases -- a Sony Bravia LCD big screen TV and the Sony Vaio notebook -- are now put on hold .
So far , Sony 's lost business with me is now one CD ( $ 10.99 ) , one flat panel TV ( $ 3,499 ) and one laptop ( $ 3,199 ) .
That 's lost sales of approximately $ 6,710 .
If you are a Sony shareholder , you should be as annoyed as I am .
< spacer >
Part IV
I saved the absolutely weirdest part for last .
I write Suncomm to complain about this DRM .
Their website encourages people to write Apple and request them to " Open up their proprietary technology . "
Yeah , spare me your lectures .
Just because your client failed to create a digital music player and legal downloading store , does n't mean that I have to get conscripted in your lobbying ploy .
Just tell me where CD purchasers should send this crippled disc back for a refund , I ask them .
UPON RECEIPT , THEY SEND ME AN EMAIL TELLING ME HOW TO WORK AROUND THE DRM :
" If you have a PC place the CD into your computer and allow the CD to automatically start .
If the CD does not automatically start , open your Windows Explorer , locate the drive letter for your CD drive and double - click on the LaunchCD.exe file located on your CD .
Once the application has been launched and the End User License Agreement has been accepted , you can click the Copy Songs button on the top menu .
Follow the instructions to copy the secure Windows Media Files ( WMA ) to your PC .
Make a note of where you are copying the songs to , you will need to get to these secure Windows Media Files in the next steps .
Once the WMA files are on your PC you can open and listen to the songs with Windows Media Player 9.0 or higher .
You may also play them in any compatible player that can play secure Windows Media files , such as MusicMatch , RealPlayer , and Winamp , but it will require that you obtain a license to do so .
To obtain this license , from the Welcome Screen of the user interface , click on the link below the album art that says
If your music does not play in your preferred player , click here .
Follow the instructions to download the alternate license .
PLEASE NOTE :
This license is only necessary for playing the copied songs in a media player other than iTunes or Windows Media Player .
If you are just trying to use iTunes , simply continue with these instructions .
Using Windows Media
Player only , you can then burn the songs to a CD .
Please note that in order to burn the files , you need to upgrade to or already have Windows Media Player 9 or greater .
Once the CD has been burned , place the copied CD back into your computer and open iTunes .
iTunes can now rip the songs as you would a normal CD . "
So this entire rigamarole wo n't even protect the CD contents -- its merely a very annoying interference with my ability to enjoy the legal uses of a product I actually wanted to purchase .
But wait , there 's more !
As if that 's not absurd enough , they remind me that none of this is necessary at all .
As noted above , its nothing more than a swipe at Apple :
" Please note an easier and more acceptable solution ( to who ? ) requires cooperation from Apple , who we have already reached out to in hopes of addressing this issue .
To help speed this effort , we ask that you use the following link to contact Apple and ask them to provide a solution that would easily allow you to move content from protected CDs into iTunes or onto your iPod rather than having to go through the additional steps above . "
http://www.apple.com/feedback/ipod.html
If you think that this cannot get any dumber , you would be wrong .
The coup de grace of this exercise in corporate stupidity is this :
" If you have a Mac computer you can copy the songs using your iTunes Player as you would normally do . "
Words simply fail me . . .

POSTSCRIPT : October 31 , 2005 6:08 am
I am a buyer of CDs , and only rarelydo I download tracks from Apple 's iTunes Music Store due to sound quality .
I did n't spend an obscene amount of money on a home audio system to listen to the mediocre audio quality of MP3s .
The not - even - remotely - as - lossless - as - advertised - compression algorithms are hardly any better .
MP3s and iPod quality music is fine for the beach or my commute on a train , but its something else entirely in my living room .
My fair use :
When I get a new CD , I rip it to iTunes , then transfer the music to my iPods ; I make a backup copy ( in case of loss ) .
If I really like a disc , I make a copy for the car or the weekend house .
If the disc is " youth - friendly , " I 'll make a copy for my wife 's classroom .
She teaches art , and I refuse to let her take any more original discs to school -- they have all gotten destroyed .
Incidentally , I am what the marketing people like to call an " influencer " ( i.e. , think of Netflix , TiVo or Macintosh ) .
I do not copy entire CDs for people , but I like to expose frinds to news music -- I will give them a song or two , with the recommendation that if they like it , they purchase the artist 's disc .
I use P2P to check out stuff not available elsewhere , or to see if I want to purchase a full CD .
I also like to make mixed playlists , which get burned for the car or for friends who are looking to hear new music , now that radio is dead .
I believe all of the above is well within my rights as a consumer of the CDs that I legally purchased ;
If someone wants to try to convince me otherwise , please take your best shot .

UPDATE : October 31 , 2005 7:02 am
This morning , I did a Google News search on " My Morning Jacket : Z , " and I found 147 mainstream news articles from the past 30 days .
One -- only one -- mentions the DRM issue :

There is a large and potentially fascinating story here that you folks in the tech press / music media are overlooking . . .

UPDATE : November 10 , 2005 1:38 pm
Here 's the biggest joke of all : I actually got the disc , and ripped it to iTunes and the iPod -- on my G5 iMac . . .

The Amazon reviewers DRM comments are below . . .

Amazon Reviews of My Morning Jacket : Z CONTENT / COPY - PROTECTION
Reviewer 1 : GRT ( New York City ) October 25 , 2005
Buy it on iTunes
Whatever the merits of the music , I tossed this disk in the garbage .
Why ?
1. Upon insertion in the computer , requires you to agree to a contract that restricts usage to approved devices etc and inserts software on your hard drive to monitor usage .
2 . After agreeing it launches a goofy proprietary application to play the music instead of a media player .
3 . You cannot play the files in iTunes
4 . You cannot rip the files to you computer
5 . You cannot play the songs on you iPod .
This attempt to restrict legal usage of the music is outrageous and should be tolerated .
Is the band aware of this ?
Do they support it ?
It is bad business , bad publicity and done in bad faith .
~~~~~~~~~~~~
What a rip - off
Reviewer 2 : redbank2 ( Red Bank , NJ ) October 26 , 2005
Repeating one other reviewer , if you want this on your iPOD , do NOT buy this ... Plus on a PC the only way to play it is with it 's own built in CD player ... I like Winamp , sorry , it does n't work with Winamp ...
Oh well ...
the music is fine , but does not make up for the nonsense of putting up with this egregious display of lack of marketing skill ...
If someone wanted to copy and distribute it , they could , what foolishness on the part of Sony / BMG / ATO and RCA Music ... And they wonder why corporate music is dying ...
~~~~~~~
DO NOT buy this if you own an iPod
Reviewer 3 : David Klingenberger ( Chicago , IL ) - October 17 , 2005
I 'm not some 20 - year - old music thief .
I 'm a 46 - year - old guy who spends thousands of dollars a year on CDs .
Thousands .
( It used to be vinyl , 8 - tracks , real to reels ) .
And I 'm being treated like a criminal .
How wrong .
How wrong .
Do n't support the criminals who sell you " copy protected " CDs .
Do n't buy this CD .
Get it some other way .
And how sad .
This may be the best CD of the year .
( It 's absolutely amazing . )
~~~~~~~
BEWARE - Copy Protected
Reviewer 4 : Scott Dyer ( San Francisco , CA ) October 4 , 2005
Note that this CD is copy protected .
The most significant implication of this is that you can only rip it to WMA which will not play on most portable music players including the iPod .
There is no way around this .
This CD relies on a much tigher version of copy protection than other CD 's so tricks such as the ole ' holding down the shift key to avoid autoplay do not work .
If you want to be able to listen to this album on your iPod , purchase it from iTunes .
The other advantage to this is that you get a bonus track not available on the CD version .

Normally I might email this , but ....
I 've been using this site for ages , and occasionally publish many of my collection of ( legally ) recorded live shows .
A quick search for " My Morning Jacket " turned up 6 live recordings .
No DRM .
Also , a good link to an excellent example of people using torrents legally .

Null Hypothesis casts a wry eye over the world of science
But these are no ordinary academics and this is no ordinary office .
Disillusioned with the prospect of spending their lives in dusty laboratories , writing paper after paper for high - brow journals , they decided to create their own publication .
Dr Andrew Impey , Dr Mark Steer and Dr David Hall founded The Null Hypothesis - The Journal of Unlikely Science .
Talent ' showcase '
It is refreshingly simple , unique , and the secret lies in its inclusivity - a worldwide community sharing light - hearted science - related stories .
One up for the knowledge economy
Dr Steer and Dr Impey also hope the website will go some way to create a revival of interest in science .
" If you highlight the lighter side of science , then maybe you will draw people back into science , " explained Dr Impey .
" The government has shown that uptake for science in school kids is falling .
The CBI said that less that 5 % of people had a clear understanding of science , " Dr Steer added .
Truth and spoof
The Null Hypothesis began life as a magazine in 2004 and was an overnight success .
Copies were sold in some of the UK's leading bookshops , and subscriptions were taken in America , Australia , and Sweden .
Armed with a number of prestigious business awards , the three men soon decided to re-launch their print version exclusively online .
The scientists won an award for their alternative approach
Around 60 % of the content is provided by contributors .
Research is still an important part of their day - to - day working lives , although worlds away from the doctoral research they used to undertake .
Recent projects involved investigating the dunk - ability of biscuits and flipping toast to see whether it lands buttered side down .
These charming entrepreneurs talk excitedly about the future of the site .
Plans include building an inventor forum and developing their online shop , which currently stocks wacky items such as banana guards , flying alarm clocks , and global warming mugs .
They also talk about the importance of awareness .
" We just need people to know we 're out there , " says Dr Impey .
" The people who know we 're out there love it , but it 's getting that national exposure , letting people know it 's there . "
I was writing this blog on the tube going home in Japanese so that I could put my thoughts down first .
Sometime in my head many thing happen but when I write here I cannot write them correctly .
The woman beside me was looking at me when I write and I do not know if she understood or see was just looking at my writing so I stopped .
I have to write this evening because I will not write tomorrow .
I am looking forward to going out with Mark 's friends , he invited me and I think it will be good for me .
Meet new people and meet friends of Mark .
So I begin .
I have taken off my clothes too many times for a girl of my age .
There are three reason I do so .
One , for money , Two , for excitement and Three , because I like the person .
All have been good for me and I never had a very bad experience .
Money is good , so is excitement and because you want to is the best .
I take me clothes off for Mark because he is kind and gentle to me .
Makes me feel happy , but I am not in love with him .
It is I have a special relationship with him .
He is gay has a boyfriend but sleeps with me .
I think I have more fun than he does but he likes other things I do like massage and make him coffee in the morning .
If I ask for something he will do for me , but he does not ask anything from me .
Last night I gave him beer when he came home and asked him to have sex with me like he does with boys .
Because I like him I want him to release in my pussy , mouth and ass .
It is strange for you to understand but I think that I will do anything for him when he has done this .
All men are different with anal sex , some are violent and do not care if it hurts too hard .
some do not like it and think it is disgusting .
some are careful and kind and know how a girl is feeling .
I expected Mark to be kind and I was right .
For so long he made me relax when he used toys , so gentle that I wanted to orgasm .
He was perfect and when he was finished he cleaned me .
He is a perfect gentleman .
Tonight when he will come home we go to pub for drinks and tomorrow we meet his friends .
I will not write till the weekend .
happy neko

Here is an alphabetical list of famous real estate investment gurus and seminar organizations along with information about them which investors may find of interest .
Where I have a relevant product , it is mentioned and linked to the appropriate page .
The Federal Trade Commission has a similar page although they are reluctant to name names , but they do identify red flags to watch for at FTC.gov .
By clicking on the guru in question , you can move quickly to the entry in question .
When I got into real estate in 1967 , there would only have been about ten gurus , all book authors , and all recommended .
The all - recommended status continued until Nothing Down author Robert Allen came on the scene in 1979 .
Ever since , there has been an endless parade of B.S. artists coming into the real - estate - investment - advice field .
Fake stories on infomercials .
It is an embarrassment to the good people in the business .
If you want me to rate a guru , your best chance is to send me something he or she has written .
I will not return it and I cannot guarantee to rate the guru .
NEW !
Every guru page now has this button in the sidebar to allow you to share or bookmark any of my guru articles on sites like Facebook , Stumbleupon , MyYahoo , Twitter , etc .
Here is a link to three emails I received .
The first guy refused to give me his name , so I changed the names of the gurus he mentioned .
But some of the things he says I heard from other sources .
Guru John
Beck then saw it and confirmed it so I added his version of the story , which has the actual names of the gurus .
Robert J. Abalos
I read his book on Investing in Land and generally liked it a lot .
See the entry below regarding Bill Bronchick for mention of a lawsuit by Abalos against Bronchick .

John Adams — Unknown
John Alexander
Ridiculous prices ( $ 5,000 ) and numerous too - good - to - be - true promises .
F'get about it .
Robert G. Allen ( San Diego , CA )
Author of best - selling books Nothing Down , Creating Wealth , and The Challenge .
One - time seminar guru and founder of many Robert Allen Nothing Down clubs around the U.S. Allen ’s advice is generally terrible .
Although I did like a chapter he wrote on property - wanted ads .
Otherwise , he is little more than a financial publicity stunt man .
My book How to Buy Real Estate for Little or No Money Down photographically reproduces documents from his famous “ Send me to any city ” nothing - down deals .
The L.A. Times accepted his “ challenge ” and made him do them in San Francisco which is near where I live .
I went there and got all the documents on each of the seven deals .
Some were also done in the county where I live .
On one , which was apparently typical , the documents seem to show that Allen lied to the first - mortgage lender — Bank of America — about whether there was any secondary financing ( there was — a seller mortgage ) and about his intention to occupy the San Francisco condo as his principal residence ( He lived in Provo , UT at the time and never occupied the SF unit ) .
At that time , June , 1981 , when home mortgage interest rates were at 18 % , Bank of America would only make loans to owner occupants and prohibited all secondary financing .
I have their loan policy for the date in question in the book , too .
My wife was a loan officer for Bank of America at the time .
[ Note to bogus gurus : do not brag about deals that you do not want me to look into — especially in the San Francisco area .
John T. Reed ] .
At best , you would have negative cash flow following his books .
At worst , you would go bankrupt and wind up in jail .
He does n’t put it this way , but his nothing - down techniques almost all require you to mislead an institutional lender or take advantage of an unsophisticated seller or both .
The president of his Atlanta Robert Allen Nothing Down Club literally went to federal prison ( at Eglin AFB , FL ) for doing illegal nothing - down deals .
There is virtually nothing in his material about how to make a profit .
Rather he simply assumes that real estate goes up so much every year that you need only buy it to cash in .
Click here for a little story about his association with probate guru Jim Banks .
Allen himself got into financial difficulty with the IRS as early as 1984 .
In 1986 , IRS filed a $ 346,395.79 lien against Allen .
In September of 1987 , when I wrote an article exposing his financial difficulties , he also had :
another $ 65,649.90 IRS lien
more than $ 76,000 of delinquent tax warrants filed by the State of Utah
lawsuits and judgments regarding over $ 100,000 in unpaid fees to fellow gurus who spoke at his meetings
Allen declared Chapter 7 ( total liquidation used when the bankrupt has a negative net worth ) bankruptcy in San Diego on July 10 , 1996 ( Bankruptcy Petition # 96-09323-LA ) .
Bankruptcy creditors sometimes get pennies or nickels on the dollar .
According toAllen ’s bankruptcy papers , his creditors got nothing .
The Initial Meeting of Creditors was held on August 9 , 1996 .
A lawyer tells me that Allen would have been asked quesitons under oath about his assets during that meeting .
A copy of the transcript of that meeting would be interesting .
It would typically be in the case folder .
See my 8/96 article .
The Allen ’s attorney , Richard V. Vermazen , got $ 2,000 to handle their bankruptcy according to court papers .
The Allen ’s were discharged from their debts on 10/17/96 .
The case was closed with no distribution to the creditors on 10/31/96 .
American Express Optima CardThe creditors who were stiffed in the bankruptcy file were :
Bank of New York
Citibank Visa
Farmers InsuranceGroup ( San Diego )
Ferrette & Slater ALLC ( San Diego )
Franchise Tax Board ( California income tax )
Internal Revenue Service
John Graff ( Highland , UT )
Mark IV Properties ( San Diego )
McKay , Burton , Thurman ( Salt Lake City )
Neiman Marcus
Nordstrom
Robinson - May
Saks
Scalley & Reading APC ( Salt Lake City )
Scott Meredith Agency ( New York city )
Shirl and Gail Loveless ( Provo , UT )
Simon & Schuster ( New York City )
The Broadway ( Phoenix )
The Allens may have had other creditors .
These were the only ones listed in the bankruptcy court files .
Now that Allen is running full - page ads touting his financial skills in the Twenty - First Century , one wonders if he has gone back and paid these creditors like his fellow Provo guru Howard Ruff did after his post - bankruptcy financial rebirth .
No one has contacted me to say that he did pay off the creditors he stiffed in the bankruptcy .
In what must have been a weak moment when I was interviewing him for the ’ 87 article , Allen told me I , “ do a great job and that I keep guys like him honest . ”
I have it on tape ( with his knowledge and permission ) .
I wo n’t take credit for keeping him honest — or give anyone else credit for doing that .
Later , he was sending out an e-mail soliciting customers for a business opportunity that has “ nothing to do with real estate . ”
As far as I ’m concerned , nothing he has ever done had anything to do with real estate .
It was merely about making Bob Allen rich and famous .
I am told that his former associate Marc Stephen Garrison once had a private conversation with Allen that went something like this .
I think Allen has an interesting story to tell .
But it ’s not the one he sells .
He should speak about real estate investment the way a reformed alcoholic speaks about drinking .
For cheaper , accurate information on real estate finance , see my books on How to Use Leverage to Maximize Your Real Estate Investment Return and my newsletter articles on finance .
Garrison : “ I m concerned that our students are not using the real estate investment information we ’re teaching them after the course is over . ”
Allen : ( wearily )
“ We ’re not in the real estate investmet information business , Marc .
This is show business . ”
If you paid thousands of dollars for one or more of Allen ’s courses , I hope you enjoyed the “ show . ”
Although I suspect you could have gotten more entertainment at the hottest play or musical on Broadway for a lot less .
Click here to read an email from one of his seminar graduates .
On 9/4/02 , a reader told me Allen was back to 65 % real estate in his current seminar .
I asked him what kind of real estate genius , as he was claiming to be at the time , would fail to insure his home .
He said he did have insurance against the avalanche .
“ Did you file a claim ? ” “ Yes . ” “ Did the insurance company pay it ? ” “ Yes . ”
“ So how did the avalanche cause your financial difficulties if it was fully insured ? ”
He then mumbled something about a deductible .
Gimme a break .
At the time , he was claiming to be a multi-millionaire .
Millionaires are not bankrupted by the deductible on their homeowners insurance .
Plus there is still the pesky fact that he was in financial difficulty before the avalanche ever happened .
And then there is the question of why he was building a mansion in the mountains when he was not paying his state and federal taxes like the rest of us .
I also heard that Allen was telling people his bankruptcy was caused by an avalanche that destroyed an expensive home he and his wife were building .
He tried to pawn that story off on me , too .
Here are the details as I recall them .
The avalanche occurred around February .
But the IRS and the State of Utah had filed liens against him for non-payment of taxes months before the avalanche .
Furthermore , I interviewed him by phone about all this and recorded the conversation with his approval .

Jim Banks
A visitor to this Web site sent me the following : " I had found a 6 - tape seminar by J.G. Banks entitled " Treasure Hunting Probate Real Estate " for $ 1.98 in a Sacramento thrift shop and it piqued my interest , particularly when he talks about $ 20,000 to $ 40,000 profit per deal .
Jim Banks is not a polished speaker and he did n't use a quality tape production company .
There were two copies of tape 6 in the package , one of them labeled as tape 2 .
I do n't know why the original purchaser in 1987 , at $ 317.70 ( the VISA receipt was still in the package ) , did n't get it replaced .
" Probate speaker .
I heard his free come - on speech .
I talked to him afterward .
He struck me as a first - class jerk — gratuitously hostile and belligerent .
I do not recall ever discussing him with anyone who disagreed with that assessment or who valued his probate advice .
I do not recommend him .
I recommend Gary DiGrazia 's probate book instead .
Also , there is a chapter on probate in my How to Buy Real Estate for at Least 20 % Below Market Value .
Click here for a humorous anecdote about Banks having to remove pages criticizing Robert Allen from Banks ' Treasure Hunting book after Banks started appearing at Allen events .
A recent caller said Banks is now charging $ 6,000 for his seminar .
Lord , that 's a lot of money !
This caller said there were two phone numbers of satisfied customers in Banks ' free presentation .
My caller called both and found they were both " no longer in service . "
He asked Banks for the names and phone numbers of other satisfied customers and Banks flatly refused to give him any .
If you want names of my satisfied customers , along with cities , states , and , in many cases , e-mail links , see the reader comments listed under my various book titles and my newsletter .

Yet another flim - flam medicine - show guru selling " Elixir of Real Estate Investment . " 98 % salesmanship and 2 % real estate knowledge , only half of which is valid .
John Beck — I do not recommend his TV infomercial tax lien products or services
I love John the person , the writer , and the speaker .
However , I have received an unacceptable number of complaints and nothing but complaints about Genesis Media Group , Inc. or Family Products , LLC or whatever .
The company that sells the Free and Clear program through the infomercial and a “ mentoring ” or coaching program in which John trained the mentors , provides material that the mentors and mentorees use , and is on call to to help them .
In the past , I relied heavily on John for his expertise on real estate investment .
His 1970s and 1980s books , newsletters , and speeches were excellent .
However , there is no longer a lot of reason to mention them because they are now unavalaible and were written years ago .
In the Twenty - First Century , he has gone the TV - infomercial - out - of - Utah route .
There is not now and never has been a worthwhile Utah - based TV infomercial product .
In fact , there are few , if any , worthwhile infomercial products from anywhere with the possible exception of record collections .
I have tried to dissuade John from the Utah approach .
I presume his other friends have as well .
To no avail .
Here is an item I published in my newsletter , Real Estate Investor 's Monthly in January of 2002 :
John Beck ’s ‘ Free and clear ’ infomercial
I had long heard of John Beck ’s infomercial for his “ Free and clear ” course on investing in tax - lien certificates , but I had never seen it — until recently .
John is a long - time real estate investor and guru .
He is also a lawyer and a friend of mine .
My articles and books have often featured John ’s adventures and opinions .
I was channel surfing around 12:15 AM recently when I heard the name “ John Beck . ”
It was freaky .
We tend to regard TV as another world .
But when they kept saying John Beck and writing his name on the screen , I thought , “ Hey , I know him !
He ’s a real person , not a TV character ! ”
The infomercial features a young man and woman who finish each other ’s breathless sentences about how wonderful John ’s course is .
They are as energized and enthused as only TV pitchmen can be .
From time to time , the scene changes to some guy interviewing John .
But it was not the John I know .
He is rumpled , low - key , laid back , thoughtful , slow to speak — sort of an intellectual Jimmy Stewart without the stuttering .
What I saw on TV was what I would expect if you gave him a dress - for - success makeover , made him double - park his car in downtown San Francisco , and had him drink diuretics for three hours without letting him go to the bathroom .
He seemed to be sitting on the front of his chair and almost shouting his lines with a tremendous sense of urgency .
The guy who interviewed him behaved the same .
Apparently the producers of the infomercial , Genesis Media , have found through focus - group research or something , that the way to market a book on investing in tax - lien certificates is to say over and over how cheap such purchases are — often under $ 1,000 in the examples in the infomercial — and that those who buy such houses have no mortgage or mortgage payments .
I am not sure they ever mentioned the phrase tax - lien certificates .
It was cheap , free and clear , cheap , free and clear , cheap , etc .
One bit of John ’s influence was apparent .
The commercial was honest .
John repeatedly held up color photos of houses and stated the price at which they sold via delinquent - property - tax procedures .
If John says it , it ’s true .
There were testimonials , but they , too , were honest as far as I could tell .
For one thing , they claimed far less success than the outlandish nonsense you hear on other real - estate infomercials .
The testimonial givers were not identified , but one was Ron Starr , an investor and guru who has co-authored books with John and who has often been featured in my books and newsletter .
Somehow , they made Ron look ten years younger in the infomercial — which I guess is not surprising after they made John look like an investment banker .
The infomercial appeared to have been part John insisting that it be honest and part Genesis insisting that everyone act like carnival barkers .
From the emails I have received , the problem arises after you buy the $ 39.95 course , then start receiving calls from boiler - room salesmen who pressure you into buying far more expensive services .
I pass the complaining emails I get along to John and he seems to win most of them over when he contacts them .
[ 2005 note :
This is no longer the case . ]
I surmise that he is also asking Genesis to behave in such a way that fewer complaints are generated .
I have never seen the $ 39.95 course .
I love John ; have no use for Genesis .
I was asked to do an infomercial about an exchanging course many years ago .
I refused in part because I felt the infomercial format had been used almost universally by sleazeballs .
Although it would theoretically be possible to do an honest infomercial , the mere fact that I was using that medium would make me look like a sleazeball .
I said I might do it if I could make it look totally different , but when I described some ways I would want to do that , the producer rejected them out of hand .
The only way they would do it was a fake talk show format .
The only identification that it was a commercial that they would allow was a fine - print written disclaimer at the beginning and end of the half hour .
No way , I said .
After years of recommending John ’s pre-infomercial stuff , I must now reluctantly categorize him as a “ do not recommend . ”
I do not recall ever having done that before with any guru .
It is rare for someone to change his stripes so late in life .
If anyone knows how to bring back the old John Beck , I would support the effort strongly .
On 7/22/09 , I heard that the FTC sued Beck and others for $ 300 million .
I was not surprised .
When John got involved in the infomercial - Utah telemarketer world , I strongly urged him to reconsider .
To no avail .
And on 5/17 / 12 , I received this :
Grand Scale Deception
The FTC has won a judgment against a massive infomercial scam that allegedly deceived almost a million people out of more than $ 450 million .
The marketers behind infomercials for John Beck 's Free & Clear Real Estate System , John Alexander 's Real Estate Riches in 14 Days , and Jeff Paul 's Shortcuts to Internet Millions promised big returns for the price of $ 39.95 , the FTC said .
But fewer than one percent of the buyers made any profit , and many people found themselves enrolled in programs that charged them every month , the court found .
The defendants also pitched personal coaching services for up to $ 14,995 , claiming people would easily earn back the cost .
But almost everyone who paid for coaching lost money .
Read Ads for Business Opportunities : How To Detect Deception .
I received this on 6/3/12
It says the FTC won their case against John and others on summary judgment ( no need for a trial )
http://www.ftc.gov/os/caselist/0723138/index.shtm
And here is the FTC media release summarizing the case and its result .
Here is a Reuters story saying that John Beck has been ordered to pay a fine of $ 113 million .
Most of us who knew John are very sad about this .
He was a great guy before he got involved with Utah .
On 2/9/16 , he disappeared .
Here is what I said on Facebook :
John N. Beck II mysteriously disappeared 2/9 around noon at Land ’s End in San Francisco .
Land ’s
End is the shoulder of land that juts out into the Pacific Ocean from the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge .
This has been in the local print and TV media since 2/9 .
A reader asked me to comment .
.
I have known Beck since 1977 as a friend , colleague , and , until about 2005 , a quiet ally in my crusade against the get - rich - quick , real - estate investment , infomercial crowd .
In 2005 , he went over to the other side and became one of the infomercial guys .
After talking to him about it a number of times , I was forced to reverse my strong recommendation of him and recommend that my readers NOT purchase his infomercial stuff .
See my guru - rating page : http://www.johntreed.com/…/61653315-john-t-reed-s-views-of-…
Generally , neither the media nor the prosecutors do enough against this crowd .
But they do go after a few of them .
Ironically , Beck , who was one of the good guys from the mid-seventies to the mid-2000s , was one of the ones they went after hard .
The FTC won a $ 479 million judgment against Beck and some related defendants .
Beck was required to pay $ 133 million of the judgment personally .
He promptly declared bankruptcy .
He is also appealing the summary judgment verdict in the FTC matter .
If I understand correctly , he is about to lose the home he lived in for the last 40 years or so in Alameda , CA .
The media seems to speculate that he was discombobulated by the suit and bankruptcy proceedings .
Give me a break !
Beck had a JD and an MBA in management and accounting .
He wrote multiple books and taught classes on various distress sales opportunities including foreclosures and bankruptcies .
For years , he had a newsletter titled The Distress Sales Report .
He is the last guy in CA who would get rattled by this stuff .
There is concern that he committed suicide , but no suicide note .
There is suspicion he disappeared to avoid paying the $ 113 million debt .
As his friend and a friend of his wife Joyce — not that we ’ve had any contact since the mid-2000s — I hope he is alive and well .
That causes me to be disinclined to believe the suicide theory .
Also , there are two photos of him going to Land ’s End on 2/9 , In both , he is carrying a bulging shoulder bag .
You do n’t need a bulging shoulder bag to commit suicide .
You WOULD need such a bag full of a change of clothes and maybe a facial disguise to disappear perhaps leave the country .
If the bankruptcy court knows about all his assets , which he is supposed to tell them about by law , then he has no need to flee the country .
He gets the exempt home equity ( $ 175,000 in CA for a married senior ) , his pension plans , and assorted smaller items like workman ’s tools when the bankruptcy is finalized .
Whether he owes $ 113 Million or $ 113 Billion is utterly irrelevant .
It all disappears in bankruptcy .
But back in the day , Beck extensively researched asset protection by use of offshore havens .
He visited Europe investigating some and the South Pacific investigating others .
He decided not to write a book about it because he said only multimillionaires could afford the hassles of doing it .
But that does n’t mean he forgot all his research taught him , especially when he came into multimillions as an infomercial star .
The family and media seem to take comfort from the fact that his US passport is still in his desk at home .
I take no comfort from that .
If he fled the country , using that passport would get him arrested immediately .
He would use a fake ID and passport to flee the country and this sort of stuff would have come up in his research of offshore asset - protection havens .
See my guru rating of Bill Greene , another guru who disappeared during dealings with the legal authorities .
I hope he is currently sipping a mai tai on the beach of some asset - protection - haven island .
Not that I condone either infomercial millions or disappearing to avoid paying your creditors , I just do n’t want him dead and this seems to be the only scenario to explain his disappearance that leaves him alive .
Guru William McCorkle — see my guru rating on him — pulled this off , after he got out of jail .
Here is a

Note that Beck is the FOURTH guru on my list to disappear under similar circumstances .
The others are Michael Martin , Richard Gardiner , and Bill “ Tycoon ” Greene .

John Behle ( Salt Lake City )
Here is an item I posted on Behle on 4/16/99 :
" Behle once tried to rent my mailing list .
I refused to let him because I thought the advertising piece he wanted to send was misleading .
It was made to look like a newspaper article and had a post - it note on it that looked like it came from a friend .
It was signed " John B . " I had received the same piece myself previously and called my friend John Beck to ask if he had sent it .
That 's when I first heard of John Behle . "
“ Stabbed ! -
The latest victim I had been so thrilled to stay off John T. Reed 's hit list .
He does n't have a competing book about paper , so I thought I might be safe .
Apparently someone inquired and now his faulty memory and facts have colored me too .
It 's not a big deal , just not true .
I left a message on his voice mail which since it was n't ‘ worshipful ’ will probably lead to further attacks .
I guess I knew it was just a matter of time .
Here 's the scoop - I mean poop .
I ’ve never tried to rent John 's list .
He has nothing to do with paper and would n’t be an interesting list for me anyway .
The only list I 've ever rented in my life is Creative Real Estate Magazine ( a couple times ) .
I doubt John cares about facts , but the letter / ad he is referring to was developed and marketed by a company named Unicorp or Millionaire Consulting Service .
They marketed a consulting service for Bob Allen and Mark Haroldsen .
I sued them and won over the fact that they used their infamous “ John B ” letter as they called it .
Nothing in the letter ever mentioned me or referred to me , yet in a marketing script that we uncovered it mentioned that if they thought it was a friend or relative that had sent it to not disagree with that .
If they were upset or enquired ( sic ) as to who sent it , the marketer was told to say that it came from John Behle in their marketing department .
I never had anything to do with their marketing department .
For a few months I helped out in doing some training for their consulting staff and handling the most difficult consulting situations .
I sued them because many people did assume the letter came from me .
At that time about 100,000 people per month had been reading the magazine articles I wrote for many different publications and my name was the first to come to many people 's minds .
They mailed out tens of thousands of these ads per week and just about anyone with the name “ John B ” paid the price .
Chuck Abbot , Doug Holmes and Richard Allen that developed the ad said that they chose that name because almost anyone knew a " John B " .
I sued for $ 750,000 in damages and because they did n't have a leg to stand on , they settled .
I just wanted an apology , the cessation of any use of my name and just to rub Doug 's nose in it a little , I received rights to use his mailing list ( total junk ) , the Unicorp mailing list and had him sign a letter to clear up falsehoods that they had spread among their employees .
I 'm not a real vindictive person , so I did n't mail the letter .
I guess I should have .
Anybody want a 10 year old 30,000 name mailing list from a consulting service ?
Once again , John T. Reed ’s facts are messed up .
Hopefully he will show his intentions are honorable and clear it up .
What do you wanna bet ?
JOHN T. REED - I DO NOT RECOMMEND HIS RECOMMENDATIONS
From what I ’ve heard , his books are very worthwhile reading , his opinions of others in many cases are flawed . ”
I stand corrected .
I was wrong .
My apologies to John .

I recommend that you use my Real Estate B.S. Artist Detection Checklist to evaluate this guru .
Scott Britton — University of Real Estate Letter
According to a promotional mailing I received , he sells a video in which you learn how to " make $ 10,000 in 98 days . "
$ 10,000 divided by 98 = $ 102.04 per day or $ 102.04 divided by eight hours = $ 12.76 per hour .
According to my local want ads , you can make that much in jobs like the following : driver , chauffeur , customer service , child care site supervisor , carpet cleaner .
Britton 's way of making the $ 12.76 a hour is rehabbing buildings that you must buy , rehab , then sell to get your money .
There is far less risk and effort in a customer - service job .
Bill Bronchick
I disagree with him on due - on - sale clauses .
See my article on the subject .
I also reviewed a book he co-authored on flipping .
Abalos v. BronchickHere is an item that relates to Bronchick from my 6/07 Real Estate Investor ’s Monthly newsletter .
For years , I have been receiving communications that denounced Investing in Land author Robert Abalos , whose book I review favorably at my Web site guru rating page .
Also , various things have been posted on the Internet denouncing him and denouncing me for refusing to denounce Abalos .
Other gurus have received the same stuff and some turned against Abalos as a result .
Bill Mencarow of www.papersourceonline.com and I did not .
The communications I received seemed part of an odd , orchestrated campaign rather than spontaneous communications from independent individuals , although they had the names of various seemingly obscure persons on them .
I said so years ago at my Web site .
I received a snail - mailed envelope with no return address .
Inside was a credit report on Robert Abalos and nothing else .
The person or entity that ordered the credit report was redacted .
I did not read the credit report , but I thought it was illegal for it to have been ordered for the purpose of injuring Abalos and equally improper for it to be sent to me and others .
I sent Abalos an email about it asking if he wanted me to mail it to him .
He did .
Abalos contacted the credit bureau in question .
Although the entity ordering it had been redacted , the company was easily able to tell Abalos who ordered it from the date and time , which had not been redacted .
As a direct result of the credit report , Abalos , who is a lawyer , tells me he has now filed federal suit number 2:2007cv00844 on June 4 , 2007 in Washington Western U.S. District Court ( Seattle ) , Honorable Robert S. Lasnik presiding .
The name of the suit is Robert J Abalos versus William Bronchick and Flamingo West Ltd .
William Bronchick is a well - known real estate guru and is himself a lawyer .
You can see information about the suit at http://dockets.justia.com/docket/court-wawdce/case_no-2:2007cv00844/case_id-144087/.
The cause of action is violation of the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681 ) .
If you want more details about the dispute , I refer you to the U.S. District Court files on this case and to the parties to the suit .
Bronchick sent me an email on 7/18/07 , but asked me not to publish it .
In it he says he did not send me the credit report he obtained and does not know who did .
He also said he had a legal reason for ordering it , refused to say what it was , and invited me to guess what it was .
He said that as of 7/18/07 he had not been served with the suit summons in spite of Abalos knowing where to serve him .
Bronchick was reportedly served on 8/2/07 .
Abalos says he was awarded a default judgment against Bronchick in 2007 or early 2008 .
Bronchick says the default judgment against him was vacated and that he won a defamation judgment against Abalos .
Abalos says the preceding sentence is inaccurate .
Fun couple .
Bronchick says his motion to dismiss was granted in Civil Case CO7 - 844RSL in Seattle on 6/23/08 .
That is the third case number I have seen in Bronchick / Abalos litigation .
I ma not familiar with the case .
On 4/8/08 , Bronchick sent me an email containing a “ findings of fact and conclusions of law ” against Abalos in Arapahoe County Court in Colorado that found Abalos made false allegations that Bronchick violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other criminal laws .
( Case No. 07CV1463 Div. 202 ) Note that this is different from the federal court in which Abalos filed his suit against Bronchick .
The Colorado court said it made these findings of fact based upon “ the testimony of William Bronchick and documentary evidence presented ... ”
No mention was made of any testimony or evidence from Abalos .
The Colorado court said that Bronchick suffered noneconomic damages of $ 20,000 .

Here are two accounts of Bronchick being sued by the State of Colorado on 6/2/17 :

Louis Brown — I do not recommend
Bob Bruss died 9/26/07
Nationally syndicated real estate columnist , author of occasional books , publisher of California Real Estate Law newsletter and a national real estate advice newsletter .
Solid investor with a law degree and extensive experience .
He and I did not agree on everything , but I recommend his books , newsletter , and column without hesitation .
You can still buy his stuff after his death .
Three things he said , and his material will still say , that I disagree with are :
• He repeatedly recommended the book Nothing Down .
Not a single technique in that book is ethical and legal .
They all require either deceiving an institutional lender or taking advantage of an unsophisticated seller or both .
• He urged use of single - family lease options which , in most cases , works by bamboozling would - be howmeowners into paying large extra rent and front money for a home - purchase route that rarely results in homeownership and leaves the would - be homeowners far worse off .
Bruss himself did not appear to do that to people but he said little about the distinction between doing it in a way that actually results in home ownership most of the time versus just using it to enrich the lanldord and leave the would - be homeowner out in the cold .
• In one of his weekly Q&A columns .
he said it was OK to fudge the truth on a mortgage application .
No it ’s not .
It ’s a federal felony as well as immoral .
In general , however , his writing are rock solid .
Larry Burkett died 7/4/03
Author of Business By The Book , The Complete Guide of Biblical Principles for the Workplace and Using Your Money Wisely , Biblical Principles Under Scrutiny .
Many people believe the Bible is the word of God .
It turns out , there is considerable discussion of financial matters in the Bible .
Larry Burkett is a sort of combination Bible fan and personal finance / business guru .
His books give his interpretation of what the Bible says about various financial issues .
I do not disclose my religious beliefs .
Nor do I tell other people what religion they should join .
I leave that to people like Robert “ Did I tell you I was a missionary ” Allen .
( A missionary is someone who tells you that you are in the wrong religion , he is in the right one , and that you should switch to his .
That ’s Part I .
In Part II , he tells you that you must send 10 % or some such of your income to his religion ’s headquarters for the rest of your life if you buy Part I . )
Having said that , however , I must add that I welcome ethical analysis of the various approaches to real - estate investment .
There is far too little ethical discussion in the real estate business .
Whether the Bible is THE Good Book is something for you to decide .
However , I do not think there is any question that it is A good book in many respects as far as ethics are concerned .
The code of ethics I recommend is
Tell the truth Keep your promises
Treat others the way you want to be treated
Also , in real - estate transactions , I believe you are not ethical unless you require that persons with whom you do deals meet appropriate suitability standards .
Almost no one does and most of the nothing - down and lease - option approaches now being pushed by various gurus fail those ethical standards .
My Real Estate B.S. Artist Detection Checklist also offers detailed ethical standards for real - estate gurus .
In short , while I may not agree with every point Burkett makes , in general , most investors would benefit from study of the ethical implications of various real estate and business techniques whether it be based on the Bible , the Koran , or other popular religious or secular teachings .

Says he “ retired ” at age 32 .
So what ’s with the making speeches in Australia and selling products and “ boot camps ” off a Web site .
He ’s hustling a buck pretty hard for a retired guy .
Few retired people have Web sites , and those that do only have family news and photos .

I took the Certified Commercial - Investment Member of the Realtors ® National Marketing Institute seminars in the mid-1970s .
The ones on income - tax law and the time value of money were excellent .
I did not much care for the one that taught how to do a feasibility study .
Although it has been many years since I took those seminars , I have heard nothing since that would cause me to believe the current versions are any less excellent .
The name of the Institute has changed to Commercial Investment Real Estate Institute .

Best information I know of on trust deed investing .
Those of you who do not live in California are foolish to wait for your state to produce a George Coats .
Other states are generally not large enough to warrant the writing of real estate investment books aimed just at one state .
Even if they were , guys as good as Coats are probably a once - in - a - lifetime occurrence .
You have to modify Coats ' California book with your own local research if you want to invest outside California .

Wade Cook ( Seattle , WA )
Real Estate Money Machine author .
He has declared bankruptcy multiple times , has unpaid fines levied against him by state attorneys general , has been the subject of cease - and - desist orders from attorneys general , has taken the Fifth Amendment in court , and has been indicted .
Smart Money magazine did an extensive article ( “ Wade ’s World ” ) on his financial and legal difficulties in October 1996 .
Call 800-925-0485 for a copy .
The State of Texas went after Cook on 5/1/98 .
While you are at the FTC Web site , you may want to search around for other pertinent information .
I suggest you bookmark my site before you do so you do not have to hit “ back ” a zillion times to find your way back .
Reader ’s Digest did a story about Cook and other gurus ( the link is no longer active ) .
There is a devastating article from the Wall Street Journal at the Motley fool Web site .
The Street.com has an article with a nose - diving graph showing the performance of Cook ’s trades and another by a staffer who attended Cook ’s seminar .
Investors who did not earn back from stock - market trading at least what they paid for the seminar ( up to $ 6,295 ) are eligible for refunds .
Shares in Wade Cook Financial Corp sold for as much as $ 5.30 in 9/97 .
Last I heard , they sold for 18 ¢ .
Although neither Cook ’s students nor his shareholders have done very well ( he owned 64.5 % of Wade Cook Financial Corp. on 4/30/00 ) , Cook himself took $ 22 million out of the corporation in compensation — more than triple corporate earnings for the period .
On 10/5/00 , Bloomberg News accounts said Wade Cook Financial Corp. would offer refunds to thousands of investors who attended Wade Cook stock - market seminars .
This was to settle action brought against Wade Cook Financial Corp. by the Federal Trade Commission .
Cook was also sued by the attorneys general of the states of AL , AZ , CA , ID , IL , KS , MO , NC , NM , OK , OR , PA , TX , and WA .
Cook told investors they would learn how to double their money every 2 1 / 2 to 3 months and claimed “ We do it all the time . ”
Cook ’s corporation ’s stock market investments lost 42 % of their value in the first half of 2000 .
Cook is a best - selling author ( Wall Street Money Machine ) and also wrote Real Estate Money Machine previously .
He is one of a number of best - selling financial authors who make that list , in large part , a rogue ’s gallery .
The many people who buy Cook ’s books and attend his seminars are idiots .
I have talked to some on the phone .
When they ask about him , I recite all his legal troubles , including his bankruptcies .
They then ask what I think of his latest book .
Like I said , idiots .
On 12/19/02 , Wade Cook Financial Services was put into involuntary Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy ( Case No. 02-25434 ) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Western District of Washington .
On 1/17/03 , this was converted to a Chapter 22 reorganization bankruptcy on 1/17/03 .
When I did a search to confirm this , I typed Wade Cook bankruptcy into Google and immediately got the pertinent Web page of the Western District of Washington U.S. Bankruptcy Court Web site .
There is a story about it at http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134686071_wadecook30.html.
Here is an article I wrote about Cook ’s being indicted for tax fraud in 2005 .
On 2/20/07 , a federal jury in Seattle found Cook guilty on seven of eight criminal charges of not paying taxes due on $ 8.9 million of income from 1998 to 2000 .
The jury was unable to come a verdict on the eighth charge , tax fraud , and on any of the charges against Cook ’s wife .
At the time of the verdicts , the U.S. Attorney ’s office was unable to say whether they would retry Cook ’s wife or the tax fraud count against Cook .
On August 2 , 2007 , U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly sentenced Wade Cook to seven years and four months in prison and his wife Laura to 18 months in prison .
Laura pled cuiilty to obstruction of the IRS to avoid a second trial .
The judge also ordered the Cooks to pay $ 3.75 million in back taxes .
See the Seattle Times story at http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003819531_wadecook03m.html.
The federal judge noted that Wade Cook had previously had to pay more than $ 500,000 in fines and restitution for investment fraud in Arizona , $ 4 million in back taxes in a prior case , and $ 2.7 million in judgments because of Federal Trade Commission action against him in 14 states .
At one point , Cook had four financial advice books on the New York Times best seller list .
See my article about the rogues gallery that is the financial best seller list .

Oscar Awards held twice in 1930
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was established in May 1927 as a non-profit corporation to promote the art of movie making .
In the first year , the Academy had 36 members , with Douglas Fairbanks Sr as president .
The first Academy Awards , now better known as the Oscars , were presented at a private dinner in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel , with less than 250 persons attending .
Today , the Academy has over 6 000 honorary members – the Oscar Awards are viewed by more than a billion people on television .
The first television broadcast of the Oscars took place in 1953 – on black and white TV , telecasted throughout the US and Canada .
Telecasting in colour begun in 1966 , and since 1969 , the Oscars have been telecast throughout the world .
By the mid-1990s it was telecast in over 100 countries .

The first Oscars
At the first Acadamy Awards , held in May 1929 , Best Director awards went to Lewis Milestone for Two Arabian Knights and Frank Borzage for 7th Heaven .
The first award for Actor in a Leading Role went to Emil Jannings for his roles in The Last Command and The Way of All Flesh .
The first Best Actress award was won Janet Gaynor for her roles in 7th Heaven , Street Angel and Sunrise .
The first Best Picture award went to WINGS .
All those films were screened in 1927 .
Those were the days of the silent movies , thus WINGS was the only silent to have won a Best Picture Oscar .
It also featured Gary Cooper in a minor role .
Swiss - born Jannings grew up in Germany and had a heavy German accent which , with the advent of sound in movies , basically put an end to his Hollywood movie career .
The most popular night in the world
The Academy Award ceremony basically was a non-public affair in 1927 and 1928 .
But it had created such public interest that the Oscar Presentation Night was introduced in 1929 .
Until 1954 the Oscars were presented mostly on a Thursday .
From 1955 to 1958 , they were presented on a Wednesday .
From 1959 until 1998 the Oscars were , with a few exceptions , presented on a Monday night .
Only since 1999 did the Awards ceremony take place on a Sunday ( in March ) .
In total up to 2005 , the famous statuettes have been handed out on 32 Monday nights , 21 Thursday nights , 8 Wednesdays , 6 Tuesdays , 2 Fridays , once on a Saturday ( 1948 ) , and four times on a Sunday .
In 1930 , the Academy Awards were held twice : on 3 April and on 5 November .
No ceremony was held in 1933 .
Since 1940 people have been kept on the edge of their seats with the familiar phrase “ The envelope please . ”
The Envelope Please
The record for most acting nominations without a single win is shared by Peter O’Toole and Richard Burton with seven .
The most nominated actors for Best Actor and Best Supporting Roles are Jack Nicholson ( 11 ) , Laurence Olivier ( 10 ) , and Spencer Tracy ( 9 ) .
No male performer has yet won three Best Actor awards .
Only one actress has won the Best Actress award four times : Katharine Hepburn is the only actress to have won the Best Actress award four times , for Morning Glory ( 1932/3 ) , Guess Who ’s Coming to Dinner ? ( 1967 ) , The Lion in Winter ( 1968 ) , and On Golden Pond ( 1981 ) .
In 1968 Katherine Hepburn was tied with and Barbra Streisand for the Best Actress award .
Anthony Quinn ’s performance as painter Paul Gaugin in Lust for Life ( 1956 ) is the shortest ever to win a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award .
He was on screen for only 8 minutes .
Judi Dench made the an equally short performance , winning Supporting Actress for her potrayal of Elizabeth I in “ Sheakespeare in Love ” ( 1999 ) .
More Oscar factoids
In 1997 James Cameron ’s Titanic received 11 Oscars , sharing the record of the most Oscars awards for a single film with William Wyler ’s Ben Hur ( 1959 ) .
The closest runner - up is West Side Story with 10 Oscars in 1961 .

In this entry , we shall first present conceptual issues of definition and classification ( Sections 1 and 2 ) and then the arguments put forward in the debate ( Section 3 ) , dedicating more space to the arguments in favor of nationalism than to those against it in order to give the philosophical nationalist a proper hearing .
In the last part we shall turn to the new constellation and sketch the new issues raised by nationalist and trans - nationalist populisms and the migration crisis .
In the last two decades , migration crisis and the populist reactions to migration and domestic economic issues have been the defining traits of a new political constellation .
The traditional issue of the contrast between nationalism and cosmopolitanism has changed its profile : the current drastic contrast is between populist aversion to the foreigners - migrants and a more generous , or simply just , attitude of acceptance and Samaritan help .
The populist aversion inherits some features traditionally associated with patriotism and nationalism , and the opposite attitude the main features of traditional cosmopolitanism .
One could expect that the work on nationalism will be moving further on this new and challenging playground , addressing the new contrast and trying to locate nationalism in relation to it .
Nationalism came into the focus of philosophical debate three decades ago , in the nineties , partly in consequence of rather spectacular and troubling nationalist clashes .
Surges of nationalism tend to present a morally ambiguous , and for this reason often fascinating , picture .
“ National awakening ” and struggles for political independence are often both heroic and cruel ; the formation of a recognizably national state often responds to deep popular sentiment but sometimes yields inhuman consequences , from violent expulsion and “ cleansing ” of non-nationals to organized mass murder .
The moral debate on nationalism reflects a deep moral tension between solidarity with oppressed national groups on the one hand and repulsion in the face of crimes perpetrated in the name of nationalism on the other .
Moreover , the issue of nationalism points to a wider domain of problems related to the treatment of ethnic and cultural differences within democratic polity , arguably among the most pressing problems of contemporary political theory .
( 1 ) raises questions about the concept of a nation ( or national identity ) , which is often defined in terms of common origin , ethnicity , or cultural ties , and specifically about whether an individual ’s membership in a nation should be regarded as non-voluntary or voluntary .
( 2 ) raises questions about whether self - determination must be understood as involving having full statehood with complete authority over domestic and international affairs , or whether something less is required .
1 . What is a Nation ?
1.1 The Basic Concept of Nationalism
Although the term “ nationalism ” has a variety of meanings , it centrally encompasses two phenomena : ( 1 ) the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their identity as members of that nation and ( 2 ) the actions that the members of a nation take in seeking to achieve ( or sustain ) some form of political sovereignty ( see for example , Nielsen 1998 – 9 : 9 ) .
Each of these aspects requires elaboration .
raises questions about the concept of a nation or national identity , about what it is to belong to a nation , and about how much one ought to care about one ’s nation .
Nations and national identity may be defined in terms of common origin , ethnicity , or cultural ties , and while an individual ’s membership in the nation is often regarded as involuntary , it is sometimes regarded as voluntary .
The degree of care for one ’s nation that nationalists require is often , but not always , taken to be very high : according to such views , the claims of one ’s nation take precedence over rival contenders for authority and loyalty .
[ 1 ] raises questions about whether sovereignty requires the acquisition of full statehood with complete authority over domestic and international affairs , or whether something less than statehood suffices .
Although sovereignty is often taken to mean full statehood ( Gellner 1983 : ch. 1 ) , [ 2 ] possible exceptions have been recognized ( Miller 1992 : 87 ; Miller 2000 ) .
Some authors even defend an anarchist version of patriotism - moderate nationalism foreshadowed by Bakunin ( see Sparrow 2007 ) .
There is a terminological and conceptual question of distinguishing nationalism from patriotism .
A popular proposal is the contrast between attachment to one ’s country as defining patriotism and attachment to one ’s people and its traditions as defining nationalism ( Kleinig 2014 : 228 , and Primoratz 2017 : Section 1.2 ) .
One problem with this proposal is that love for a country is not really just love of a piece of land but normally involves attachment to the community of its inhabitants , and this introduces “ nation ” into the conception of patriotism .
Another contrast is the one between strong , and somewhat aggressive attachment ( nationalism ) and a mild one ( patriotism ) , dating back at least to George Orwell ( see his 1945 essay ) . [ 3 ]
Despite these definitional worries , there is a fair amount of agreement about the classical , historically paradigmatic form of nationalism .
It typically features the supremacy of the nation ’s claims over other claims to individual allegiance and full sovereignty as the persistent aim of its political program .
Territorial sovereignty has traditionally been seen as a defining element of state power and essential for nationhood .
It was extolled in classic modern works by Hobbes , Locke , and Rousseau and is returning to center stage in the debate , though philosophers are now more skeptical ( see below ) .
Issues surrounding the control of the movement of money and people ( in particular immigration ) and the resource rights implied in territorial sovereignty make the topic politically central in the age of globalization and philosophically interesting for nationalists and anti-nationalists alike .
In recent times , the philosophical focus has moved more in the direction of “ liberal nationalism ” , the view that mitigates the classical claims and tries to bring together the pro-national attitude and the respect for traditional liberal values .
For instance , the territorial state as political unit is seen by classical nationalists as centrally “ belonging ” to one ethnic - cultural group and as actively charged with protecting and promulgating its traditions .
The liberal variety allows for “ sharing ” of the territorial state with non-dominant ethnic groups .
Consequences are varied and quite interested ( for more see below , especially section 2.1 ) .
1.2 The Concept of a Nation
In its general form , the issue of nationalism concerns the mapping between the ethno- cultural domain ( featuring ethno - cultural groups or “ nations ” ) and the domain of political organization .
In breaking down the issue , we have mentioned the importance of the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their national identity .
This point raises two sorts of questions .
First , the descriptive ones :
( 1a ) What is a nation and what is national identity ?
( 1 b ) What is it to belong to a nation ?
( 1c ) What is the nature of pro-national attitude ?
( 1d ) Is membership in a nation voluntary or involuntary ?
Second , the normative ones :
( 1e ) Is the attitude of caring about national identity always appropriate ?
( 1 f ) How much should one care ?
This section discusses the descriptive questions , starting with ( 1a ) and ( 1 b ) ; the normative questions are addressed in Section 3 on the moral debate .
If one wants to enjoin people to struggle for their national interests , one must have some idea about what a nation is and what it is to belong to a nation .
So , in order to formulate and ground their evaluations , claims , and directives for action , pro-nationalist thinkers have expounded theories of ethnicity , culture , nation , and state .
Their opponents have in turn challenged these elaborations .
Now , some presuppositions about ethnic groups and nations are essential for the nationalist , while others are theoretical elaborations designed to support the essential ones .
The definition and status of the social group that benefits from the nationalist program , variously called the “ nation ” , “ ethno- nation ” , or “ ethnic group ” , is essential .
Since nationalism is particularly prominent with groups that do not yet have a state , a definition of nation and nationalism purely in terms of belonging to a state is a non-starter .
Indeed , purely “ civic ” loyalties are often categorized separately under the title “ patriotism ” , which we already mentioned , or “ constitutional patriotism ” .
[ 4 ]
This leaves two extreme options and a number of intermediates .
The first extreme option has been put forward by a small but distinguished band of theorists .
[ 5 ]
According to their purely voluntaristic definition , a nation is any group of people aspiring to a common political state - like organization .
If such a group of people succeeds in forming a state , the loyalties of the group members become “ civic ” ( as opposed to “ ethnic ” ) in nature .
At the other extreme , and more typically , nationalist claims are focused upon the non-voluntary community of common origin , language , tradition , and culture : the classic ethno-nation is a community of origin and culture , including prominently a language and customs .
The distinction is related ( although not identical ) to that drawn by older schools of social and political science between “ civic ” and “ ethnic ” nationalism , the former being allegedly Western European and the latter more Central and Eastern European , originating in Germany . [ 6 ]
Philosophical discussions centered on nationalism tend to concern the ethnic - cultural variants only , and this habit will be followed here .
A group aspiring to nationhood on this basis will be called an “ ethno- nation ” to underscore its ethno- cultural rather than purely civic underpinnings .
For the ethno -( cultural ) nationalist it is one ’s ethnic - cultural background that determines one ’s membership in the community .
One cannot choose to be a member ; instead , membership depends on the accident of origin and early socialization .
However , commonality of origin has become mythical for most contemporary candidate groups : ethnic groups have been mixing for millennia .
Sophisticated , liberal pro-nationalists therefore tend to stress cultural membership only and speak of “ nationality ” , omitting the “ ethno - ” part ( Miller 1992 , 2000 ; Tamir 1993,2013 ; Gans 2003 ) .
Michel Seymour ’s proposal of a “ socio- cultural definition ” adds a political dimension to the purely cultural one : a nation is a cultural group , possibly but not necessarily united by a common descent , endowed with civic ties ( Seymour 2000 ) .
This is the kind of definition that would be accepted by most parties in the debate today .
So defined , the nation is a somewhat mixed category , both ethno- cultural and civic , but still closer to the purely ethno- cultural than to the purely civic extreme .
Let us now turn to the issue of the origin and “ authenticity ” of ethno- cultural groups or ethno-nations .
In social and political science one usually distinguishes two kinds of views , but there is a third group , combining element from both .
The first are modernist views that see nationalism as born in modern times , together with nation - states .
[ 7 ]
In our times the view was pioneered by Ernst Gellner ( see his 1983 ) . [ 8 ]
Other modernist choose similar starting points with century or two of variation . [ 9 ]
The opposite view can be called , following Edward Shils ( 1957 ) “ primordialist ” .
According to it , actual ethno- cultural nations have either existed “ since time immemorial ” .
The third , quite plausible kind of view , distinct from both primordialism - ethno - symbolism and modernism , has been initiated by W. Connor ( 1994 ) . [ 10 ]
A nation is a politicized and mobilized ethnic group rather than a state .
So , the origins of nationalism predate the modern state , and its emotional content remains up to our times ( Conversi 2002 : 270 ) , but the actual statist organization is , indeed , modern .
However , nation - state is a nationalist dream and fiction , never really implemented , due to the inescapable plurality of social groups .
So much for the three dominant perspectives on the origin of nationalism .
Indeed , the older authors — from great thinkers like Herder and Otto Bauer to the propagandists who followed their footsteps — took great pains to ground normative claims upon firm ontological realism about nations : nations are real , bona fide entities .
However , the contemporary moral debate has tried to diminish the importance of the imagined / real divide .
Prominent contemporary philosophers have claimed that normative - evaluative nationalist claims are compatible with the “ imagined ” nature of a nation . [ 11 ]
They point out that common imaginings can tie people together , and that actual interaction resulting from togetherness can engender important moral obligations .
Let us now turn to question ( 1c ) about the nature of pro-national attitudes .
The explanatory issue that has interested political and social scientists concerns ethno- nationalist sentiment , the paradigm case of a pro-national attitude .
Is it as irrational , romantic , and indifferent to self - interest as it might seem on the surface ?
The issue has divided authors who see nationalism as basically irrational and those who try to explain it as being in some sense rational .
Authors who see it as irrational propose various explanations of why people assent to irrational views .
Some say , critically , that nationalism is based on “ false consciousness ” .
But where does such false consciousness come from ?
The most simplistic view is that it is a result of direct manipulation of “ masses ” by “ elites ” .
On the opposite side , the famous critic of nationalism Elie Kedourie ( 1960 ) thinks this irrationality is spontaneous .
A decade and a half ago Liah Greenfeld went as far as linking nationalism to mental illness in her provocative 2005 article ( see also her 2006 book ) .
On the opposite side , Michael Walzer has offered a sympathetic account of nationalist passion in his 2002 .
Authors relying upon the Marxist tradition offer various deeper explanations .
To mention one , the French structuralist Étienne Balibar sees it as a result of the “ production ” of ideology effectuated by mechanisms which have nothing to do with spontaneous credulity of individuals , but with impersonal , structural social factors ( Balibar & Wallerstein 1988 [ 1991 ] ) . [ 12 ]
Some authors claim that it is often rational for individuals to become nationalists ( Hardin 1985 ) .
Can one rationally explain the extremes of ethno-national conflict ?
Authors like Russell Hardin propose to do so in terms of a general view of when hostile behavior is rational : most typically , if an individual has no reason to trust someone , it is reasonable for that individual to take precautions against the other .
If both sides take precautions , however , each will tend to see the other as increasingly inimical .
It then becomes rational to start treating the other as an enemy .
Mere suspicion can thus lead by small , individually rational steps to a situation of conflict .
( Such negative development is often presented as a variant of the Prisoner ’s Dilemma ; see the entry on prisoner ’s dilemma ) .
It is relatively easy to spot the circumstances in which this general pattern applies to national solidarities and conflicts ( see also Wimmer 2013 ) .
Finally , as for question ( 1d ) , the nation is typically seen as an essentially non-voluntary community to which one belongs by birth and early nurture and such that the belonging is enhanced and made more complete by one ’s additional conscious endorsement .
Not everyone agrees : liberal nationalists accept the idea of choice of one ’s national belonging and of possibility for immigrants to become nationals by choice and intentional acculturation .
2. Varieties of Nationalism
2.1 Concepts of Nationalism : Classical and Liberal
We pointed out at the very beginning of the entry that nationalism focuses upon ( 1 ) the attitude that the members of a nation have when they care about their national identity , and ( 2 ) the actions that the members of a nation take when seeking to achieve ( or sustain ) some form of political sovereignty .
The politically central point is ( 2 ) : the actions enjoined by the nationalist .
To these we now turn , beginning with sovereignty and territory , the usual foci of a national struggle for independence .
They raise an important issue :
( 2a ) Does political sovereignty within or over a territory require statehood or something weaker ?
The classical answer is that a state is required .
A more liberal answer is that some form of political autonomy suffices .
Once this has been discussed , we can turn to the related normative issues :
( 2b ) What actions are morally permitted to achieve sovereignty and to maintain it ? ( 2c ) Under what conditions is it morally permitted to take actions of this kind ?
Consider first the classical nationalist answer to ( 2a ) .
Political sovereignty requires a state “ rightfully owned ” by the ethno-nation ( Oldenquist 1997 ) .
Developments of this line of thought often state or imply specific answers to ( 2b ) , and ( 2 c ) , i.e. , that in a national independence struggle the use of force against the threatening central power is almost always a legitimate means for bringing about sovereignty .
However , classical nationalism is not only concerned with the creation of a state but also with its maintenance and strengthening .
Classical nationalism is the political program that sees the creation and maintenance of a fully sovereign state owned by a given ethno- national group ( “ people ” or “ nation ” ) as a primary duty of each member of the group .
Starting from the assumption that the appropriate ( or “ natural ” ) unit of culture is an ethno-nation , it claims that a primary duty of each member is to abide by one ’s recognizably ethno- national culture in all cultural matters .
Classical nationalists are usually vigilant about the kind of culture they protect and promote and about the kind of attitude people have to their nation - state .
This watchful attitude carries some potential dangers : many elements of a given culture that are universal or simply not recognizably national may fall prey to such nationalist enthusiasms .
Classical nationalism in everyday life puts various additional demands on individuals , from buying more expensive home - produced goods in preference to cheaper imported ones to procreating as many future members of the nation as one can manage ( see Yuval - Davies 1997 , and Yack 2012 ) .
Besides classical nationalism ( and its more radical extremist cousins ) , various moderate views are also now classified as nationalist .
Indeed , the philosophical discussion has shifted to these moderate or even ultra-moderate forms , and most philosophers who describe themselves as nationalists propose very moderate nationalist programs .
Nationalism in this wider sense is any complex of attitudes , claims , and directives for action ascribing a fundamental political , moral , and cultural value to nation and nationality and deriving obligations ( for individual members of the nation , and for any involved third parties , individual or collective ) from this ascribed value .
The main representative of this group of views is liberal nationalism , proposed by authors like Miller , Tamir , and Gans ( see below ) .
Nationalisms in this wider sense can vary somewhat in their conceptions of the nation ( which are often left implicit in their discourse ) , in the grounds for and degree of its value , and in the scope of their prescribed obligations .
Moderate nationalism is less demanding than classical nationalism and sometimes goes under the name of “ patriotism . ”
( A different usage , again , reserves “ patriotism ” for valuing civic community and loyalty to state , in contrast to nationalism , centered on ethnic - cultural communities ) .
Let us now turn to liberal nationalism , the most discussed kind of moderate nationalism .
Liberal nationalists see liberal - democratic principles and pro-national attitudes as belonging together .
One of the main proponents of the view , Yael Tamir , started the debate in her 1993 book and in her recent book talks about the nation - state as “ an ideal meeting point between the two ” ( 2019 : 6 ) .
Of course , some things have to be sacrificed : we must acknowledge that either the meaningfulness of a community or its openness must be sacrificed to some extent as we cannot have them both .
( 2019 : 57 ) .
How much of each is to give way is left open , and of course , various liberal nationalists take different views of what precisely the right answer is .
Tamir ’s version of liberal nationalism is a kind of social liberalism , in this respect similar to the views of David Miller who talks about “ solidaristic communities ” in his 1999 book Principles of Social Justice and also takes stance in his 1995 and 2008 books .
They both see the feeling of national identity as a feeling that promotes solidarity , and solidarity as means for increased social justice ( Tamir 2019 , in particular ch.20 ; compare Walzer 1983 , Kymlicka 1995a , 2001 , and Gans 2003 , 2008 ) .
Liberal nationalists diverge about the value of multiculturalism .
Kymlicka takes it as basic for his picture of liberalism while Tamir dismisses it without much ado : multicultural , multiethnic democracies have a very poor track record , she claims ( 2019 : 62 ) .
Tamir ’s diagnosis of the present day political crisis , with politicians like Trump and Le Pen coming to the forefront , is that “ liberal democrats were paralyzed by their assumed victory ” whereas “ nationalists felt defeated and obsolete ” ( 2019 : 7 ) .
Tamir lists two kinds of reasons that guarantee special political status to nations .
First kind , that no other political entity “ is more able than the state to promote ideas in the public sphere ” ( 2019 : 52 ) , and the second kind that nation needs continuous creative effort to make it functional and attractive .
The historical development of liberalism turned it into a universalistic , anti-communitarian principle ; this has been a fatal mistake that can be and should be corrected by the liberal nationalist synthesis .
Can we revive the unifying narratives of our nationality without sacrificing the liberal inheritance of freedom and rights ?
Liberal nationalism answers in the affirmative .
From its standpoint , national particularism has primacy : “ The love of humanity is a noble ideal , but real love is always particular … ” ( 2019 : 68 ) .
Interestingly , Tamir combines this high regard of nation with an extreme constructivist view of its nature : nations are mental structures that exist in the minds of their members ( 2019 : 58 ) .
Is liberal nationalism implemented anywhere in the present world , or is it more of an ideal , probably end - state theory , that proposes a picture of a desirable society ?
Judging by the writings of liberal nationalists , it is the latter , although presented as a relatively easily reachable ideal , combining two traditions that are already well implemented in political reality .
The variations of nationalism most relevant for philosophy are those that influence the moral standing of claims and of recommended nationalist practices .
The elaborate philosophical views put forward in favor of nationalism will be referred to as “ theoretical nationalism ” , the adjective serving to distinguish such views from less sophisticated and more practical nationalist discourse .
The central theoretical nationalist evaluative claims can be charted on the map of possible positions within political theory in the following useful but somewhat simplified and schematic way .
Nationalist claims featuring the nation as central to political action must answer two crucial general questions .
First , is there one kind of large social group that is of special moral importance ?
The nationalist answer is that there certainly is one , namely , the nation .
Moreover , when an ultimate choice is to be made , say between ties of family , or friendship , and the nation , the latter has priority .
Liberal nationalists prefer a more moderate stance , which ascribes value to national belonging , but do n’t make it central in this way .
Second , what are the grounds for an individual ’s obligations to the morally central group ?
Are they based on voluntary or involuntary membership in the group ?
The typical contemporary nationalist thinker opts for the latter , while admitting that voluntary endorsement of one ’s national identity is a morally important achievement .
On the philosophical map , pro-nationalist normative tastes fit nicely with the communitarian stance in general : most pro-nationalist philosophers are communitarians who choose the nation as the preferred community ( in contrast to those of their fellow communitarians who prefer more far - ranging communities , such as those defined by global religious traditions ) . [ 13 ]
Before proceeding to moral claims , let us briefly sketch the issues and viewpoints connected to territory and territorial rights that are essential for nationalist political programs . [ 14 ]
Why is territory important for ethno- national groups , and what are the extent and grounds of territorial rights ?
Its primary importance resides in sovereignty and all the associated possibilities for internal control and external exclusion .
Add to this the Rousseauian view that political attachments are essentially bounded and that love — or , to put it more mildly , republican civil friendship — for one ’s group requires exclusion of some “ other ” , and the importance becomes quite obvious .
What about the grounds for the demand for territorial rights ?
Nationalist and pro-nationalist views mostly rely on the attachment that members of a nation have to national territory and to the formative value of territory for a nation to justify territorial claims ( see Miller 2000 and Meisels 2009 ) .
This is similar in some respects to the rationale given by proponents of indigenous peoples ’ rights ( Tully 2004 , but see also Hendrix 2008 ) and in other respects to Kolers ’ 2009 ethno - geographical non-nationalist theory , but differs in preferring ethno- national groups as the sole carriers of the right .
These attachment views stand in stark contrast to more pragmatic views about territorial rights as means for conflict resolution ( e.g. , Levy 2000 ) .
Another quite popular alternative is the family of individualistic views grounding territorial rights in rights and interests of individuals . [ 15 ]
On the extreme end of anti-nationalist views stands the idea of Pogge ) that there are no specific territorial problems for political philosophy — the “ dissolution approach ” , as Kolers calls it .
2.2 Moral Claims , Classical Vs. Liberal : The Centrality of Nation
We now pass to the normative dimension of nationalism .
We shall first describe the very heart of the nationalist program , i.e. , sketch and classify the typical normative and evaluative nationalist claims .
These claims can be seen as answers to the normative subset of our initial questions about ( 1 ) pro-national attitudes and ( 2 ) actions .
We will see that these claims recommend various courses of action : centrally , those meant to secure and sustain a political organization for the given ethno- cultural national community ( thereby making more specific the answers to our normative questions ( 1e ) , ( 1f ) , ( 2b ) , and ( 2 c ) ) .
Further , they enjoin the community ’s members to promulgate recognizable ethno- cultural contents as central features of the cultural life within such a state .
Finally , we shall discuss various lines of pro-nationalist thought that have been put forward in defense of these claims .
To begin , let us return to the claims concerning the furthering of the national state and culture .
These are proposed by the nationalist as norms of conduct .
The philosophically most important variations concern three aspects of such normative claims :
The normative nature and strength of the claim : does it promote merely a right ( say , to have and maintain a form of political self - government , preferably and typically a state , or have cultural life centered upon a recognizably ethno- national culture ) , or a moral obligation ( to get and maintain one ) , or a moral , legal , and political obligation ?
The strongest claim is typical of classical nationalism ; its typical norms are both moral and , once the nation - state is in place , legally enforceable obligations for all parties concerned , including for the individual members of the ethno-nation .
A weaker but still quite demanding version speaks only of moral obligation ( “ sacred duty ” ) .
The strength of the nationalist claim in relation to various external interests and rights : to give a real example , is the use of the domestic language so important that even international conferences should be held in it , at the cost of losing the most interesting participants from abroad ?
The force of the nationalist claim is here being weighed against the force of other claims , including those of individual or group interests or rights .
Variations in comparative strength of nationalist claims take place on a continuum between two extremes .
At one rather unpalatable extreme , nation - focused claims take precedence over any other claims , including over human rights .
Further towards the center is the classical nationalism that gives nation - centered claims precedence over individual interests and many needs , but not necessarily over general human rights ( see , for example , MacIntyre 1994 , Oldenquist 1997 ) .
On the opposite end , which is mild , humane , and liberal , the central classical nationalist claims are accorded prima facie status only ( see Tamir 1993 , Gans 2003 , and Miller 2013 ; and for applications to Central Europe Stefan Auer 2004 ) .
For which groups are the nationalist claims , classical or liberal , meant to be valid ?
What is their scope ?
One approach claims that they are valid for every ethno-nation and thereby universal .
An example would be the claim “ every ethno - nation should have its own state ” .
To put it more officially Universalizing nationalism is the political program that claims that every ethno-nation should have a state that it should rightfully own and the interests of which it should promote .
Alternatively , a claim may be particularistic , such as the claim “ Group X ought to have a state ” , where this implies nothing about any other group : Particularistic nationalism is the political program claiming that some ethno-nation should have its state , without extending the claim to all ethno-nations .
It claims thus either by omission ( unreflective particularistic nationalism ) , or by explicitly specifying who is excluded : “ Group X ought to have a state , but group Y should not ” ( invidious nationalism ) .
The most difficult and indeed chauvinistic sub-case of particularism , i.e. , ( B ) , has been called “ invidious ” since it explicitly denies the privilege of having a state to some peoples .
Serious theoretical nationalists usually defend only the universalist variety , whereas the nationalist - in - the - street most often defends the egoistic indeterminate one .
The nationalist picture of morality traditionally has been quite close to the dominant view in the theory of international relations called “ realism ” .
Put starkly , the view is that morality ends at the boundaries of the nation - state ; beyond there is nothing but anarchy . [ 16 ]
It nicely complements the main classical nationalist claim about the nation - state , i.e. , that each ethno-nation or people should have a state of its own , and suggests what happens next : nation - states enter into competition in the name of their constitutive peoples .
3. The Moral Debate
3.1 Classical and liberal nationalisms
Recall the initial normative question centered around ( 1 ) attitudes and ( 2 ) actions .
Is national partiality justified , and to what extent ?
What actions are appropriate to bring about sovereignty ?
In particular , are ethno-national states and institutionally protected ( ethno - ) national cultures goods independent from the individual will of their members , and how far may one go in protecting them ?
The philosophical debate for and against nationalism is a debate about the moral validity of its central claims .
In particular , the ultimate moral issue is the following : is any form of nationalism morally permissible or justified , and , if not , how bad are particular forms of it ? [ 17 ]
Why do nationalist claims require a defense ?
In some situations they seem plausible : for instance , the plight of some stateless national groups — the history of Jews and Armenians , the historical and contemporary misfortunes of Kurds — lends credence to the idea that having their own state would have solved the worst problems .
Still , there are good reasons to examine nationalist claims more carefully .
The most general reason is that it should first be shown that the political form of the nation - state has some value as such , that a national community has a particular , or even central , moral and political value , and that claims in its favor have normative validity .
Once this is established , a further defense is needed .
Some classical nationalist claims appear to clash — at least under normal circumstances of contemporary life — with various values that people tend to accept .
Some of these values are considered essential to liberal - democratic societies , while others are important specifically for the flourishing of creativity and culture .
The main values in the first set are individual autonomy and benevolent impartiality ( most prominently towards members of groups culturally different from one ’s own ) .
The alleged special duties towards one ’s ethno- national culture can and often do interfere with individuals ’ right to autonomy .
Liberal nationalists are aware of the difficulties of the classical approach , and soften the classical claims , giving them only a prima facie status .
They usually speak of “ various accretions that have given nationalism a bad name ” , and they are eager to “ separate the idea of nationality itself from these excesses ” ( Miller 1992 , 2000 ) .
Such thoughtful pro-nationalist writers have participated in an ongoing philosophical dialogue between proponents and opponents of the claim . [ 18 ]
In order to help the reader find their through this involved debate , we shall briefly summarize the considerations which are open to the ethno- nationalist to defend their case ( compare the useful overview in Lichtenberg 1997 ) .
Further lines of thought built upon these considerations can be used to defend very different varieties of nationalism , from radical to very moderate ones .
For brevity , each line of thought will be reduced to a brief argument ; the actual debate is more involved than one can represent in a sketch .
Some prominent lines of criticism that have been put forward in the debate will be indicated in brackets ( see Miscevic 2001 ) .
The main arguments in favor of nationalism will be divided into two sets .
The first set of arguments defends the claim that national communities have a high value , sometime seen as coming from the interests of their individual member ( e.g. , by Kymlicka , Miller , and Raz ) and sometimes as non-instrumental and independent of the wishes and choices of their individual members , and argues that they should therefore be protected by means of state and official statist policies .
The second set is less deeply “ comprehensive ” , and encompasses arguments from the requirements of justice , independent from substantial assumptions about culture and cultural values .
The first set will be presented in more detail since it has formed the core of the debate .
It depicts the community as the source of value or as the transmission device connecting its members to some important values .
For the classical nationalist , the arguments from this set are communitarian in a particularly “ deep ” sense since they are grounded in basic features of the human condition .
The general form of deep communitarian arguments is as follows .
First , the communitarian premise : there is some uncontroversial good ( e.g. , a person ’s identity ) , and some kind of community is essential for acquisition and preservation of it .
Then comes the claim that the ethno- cultural nation is the kind of community ideally suited for this task .
Then follows the statist conclusion : in order for such a community to preserve its own identity and support the identity of its members , it has to assume ( always or at least normally ) the political form of a state .
The conclusion of this type of argument is that the ethno-national community has the right to an ethno-national state and the citizens of the state have the right and obligation to favor their own ethnic culture in relation to any other .
Although the deeper philosophical assumptions in the arguments stem from the communitarian tradition , weakened forms have also been proposed by more liberal philosophers .
The original communitarian lines of thought in favor of nationalism suggest that there is some value in preserving ethno- national cultural traditions , in feelings of belonging to a common nation , and in solidarity between a nation ’s members .
A liberal nationalist might claim that these are not the central values of political life but are values nevertheless .
Moreover , the diametrically opposing views , pure individualism and cosmopolitanism , do seem arid , abstract , and unmotivated by comparison .
By cosmopolitanism we refer to moral and political doctrines claiming that
one ’s primary moral obligations are directed to all human beings ( regardless of geographical or cultural distance ) , and political arrangements should faithfully reflect this universal moral obligation ( in the form of supra- statist arrangements that take precedence over nation - states ) .
Confronted with opposing forces of nationalism and cosmopolitanism , many philosophers opt for a mixture of liberalism - cosmopolitanism and patriotism - nationalism .
In his writings , B. Barber glorifies “ a remarkable mixture of cosmopolitanism and parochialism ” that in his view characterizes American national identity ( Barber 1996 : 31 ) .
Charles Taylor claims that “ we have no choice but to be cosmopolitan and patriots ” ( Taylor 1996 : 121 ) .
Hilary Putnam proposes loyalty to what is best in the multiple traditions in which each of us participates , apparently a middle way between a narrow - minded patriotism and an overly abstract cosmopolitanism ( Putnam 1996 : 114 ) .
The compromise has been foreshadowed by Berlin ( 1979 ) and Taylor ( 1989 , 1993 ) , [ 19 ] and in the last two decades it has occupied center stage in the debate and even provoked re-readings of historical nationalism in its light . [ 20 ]
Most liberal nationalist authors accept various weakened versions of the arguments we list below , taking them to support moderate or ultra-moderate nationalist claims .
Here are then the main weakenings of classical ethno- nationalism that liberal , limited - liberal , and cosmopolitan nationalists propose .
First , ethno-national claims have only prima facie strength and cannot trump individual rights .
Second , legitimate ethno-national claims do not in themselves automatically amount to the right to a state , but rather to the right to a certain level of cultural autonomy .
The main models of autonomy are either territorial or non-territorial : the first involves territorial devolution ; the second , cultural autonomy granted to individuals regardless of their domicile within the state . [ 21 ]
Third , ethno- nationalism is subordinate to civic patriotism , which has little or nothing to do with ethnic criteria .
Fourth , ethno-national mythologies and similar “ important falsehoods ” are to be tolerated only if benign and inoffensive , in which case they are morally permissible despite their falsity .
Finally , any legitimacy that ethno- national claims may have is to be derived from choices the concerned individuals are free to make .
3.2 Arguments in favor of nationalism , classical vs. liberal : the deep need for community
Consider now the particular pro-nationalist arguments from the first set .
The first argument depends on assumptions that also appear in the subsequent ones , but it further ascribes to the community an intrinsic value .
The later arguments point more towards an instrumental value of nation , derived from the value of individual flourishing , moral understanding , firm identity and the like .
The Argument From Intrinsic Value .
Each ethno-national community is valuable in and of itself since it is only within the natural encompassing framework of various cultural traditions that important meanings and values are produced and transmitted .
The members of such communities share a special cultural proximity to each other .
By speaking the same language and sharing customs and traditions , the members of these communities are typically closer to one another in various ways than they are to the outsiders .
The Argument from Flourishing .
The ethno-national community is essential for each of its members to flourish .
In particular , it is only within such a community that an individual can acquire concepts and values crucial for understanding the community ’s cultural life in general and the individual ’s own life in particular .
There has been much debate on the pro-nationalist side about whether divergence of values is essential for separateness of national groups .
The Canadian liberal nationalists Seymour ( 1999 ) , Taylor , and Kymlicka pointed out that “ divergences of value between different regions of Canada ” that aspire to separate nationhood are “ minimal ” .
Taylor ( 1993 : 155 ) concluded that it is not separateness of value that matters .
The Argument from Identity .
Communitarian philosophers emphasize nurture over nature as the principal force determining our identity as people — we come to be who we are because of the social settings and contexts in which we mature .
This claim certainly has some plausibility .
The very identity of each person depends upon his / her participation in communal life ( see MacIntyre 1994 , Nielsen , 1998 , and Lagerspetz 2000 ) .
Given that an individual ’s morality depends upon their having a mature and stable personal identity , the communal conditions that foster the development of personal identity must be preserved and encouraged .
Therefore , communal life should be organized around particular national cultures .
The Argument from Moral Understanding .
A particularly important variety of value is moral value .
Some values are universal , e.g. , freedom and equality , but these are too abstract and “ thin ” .
The rich , “ thick ” moral values are discernible only within particular traditions ; as Charles Taylor puts it , “ the language we have come to accept articulates the issues of the good for us ” ( 1989 : 35 ) .
The nation offers a natural framework for moral traditions , and thereby for moral understanding ; it is the primary school of morals .
The Argument from Diversity .
Each national culture contributes uniquely to the diversity of human cultures .
The most famous twentieth century proponent of the idea , Isaiah Berlin ( interpreting Herder ) , writes :
The ‘ physiognomies ’ of cultures are unique : each presents a wonderful exfoliation of human potentialities in its own time and place and environment .
We are forbidden to make judgments of comparative value , for that is measuring the incommensurable .
( 1976 : 206 )
Assuming that the ( ethno - ) nation is the natural unit of culture , the preservation of cultural diversity amounts to institutionally protecting the purity of ( ethno - ) national culture .
The plurality of cultural styles can be preserved and enhanced by tying them to ethno-national “ forms of life ” .
David Miller has developed an interesting and sophisticated liberal pro-national stance over the course of decades from his work in 1990 to the most recent work in 2013 .
He accepts multicultural diversity within a society but stresses an overarching national identity , taking as his prime example British national identity , which encompasses the English , Scottish , and other ethnic identities .
He demands an “ inclusive identity , accessible to members of all cultural groups ” ( 2013 : 91 ) .
miller claims such identity is necessary for basic social solidarity , and it goes far beyond simple constitutional patriotism .
A skeptic could note the following .
The problem with multicultural society is that national identity has historically been a matter of ethno-national ties and has required sameness in the weighted majority of cultural traits ( common language , common “ history - as - remembered ” , customs , religion and so on ) .
However , multi-cultural states typically bring together groups with very different histories , languages , religions , and even quite contrasting appearances .
Now , how is the overarching “ national identity ” to be achieved starting from the very thin identity of common belonging to a state ?
One seems to have a dilemma .
Grounding social solidarity in national identity requires the latter to be rather thin and seems likely to end up as full - on , unitary cultural identity .
Thick constitutional patriotism may be one interesting possible attitude that can ground such solidarity while preserving the original cultural diversity .
3.3 Arguments in favor of nationalism : issues of justice
The arguments in the second set concern political justice and do not rely on metaphysical claims about identity , flourishing , and cultural values .
They appeal to ( actual or alleged ) circumstances that would make nationalist policies reasonable ( or permissible or even mandatory ) , such as ( a ) the fact that a large part of the world is organized into nation - states ( so that each new group aspiring to create a nation - state just follows an established pattern ) , or ( b ) the circumstances of group self - defense or of redressing past injustice that might justify nationalist policies ( to take a special case ) .
Some of the arguments also present nationhood as conducive to important political goods , such as equality .
The Argument from the Right to Collective Self - determination .
A group of people of a sufficient size has a prima facie right to govern itself and decide its future membership , if the members of the group so wish .
It is fundamentally the democratic will of the members themselves that grounds the right to an ethno-national state and to ethno- centric cultural institutions and practices .
This argument presents the justification of ( ethno - ) national claims as deriving from the will of the members of the nation .
It is therefore highly suitable for liberal nationalism but not appealing to a deep communitarian who sees the demands of the nation as independent from , and prior to , the choices of particular individuals . [ 22 ]
The Argument from the Right to Self - defense and to Redress Past Injustices .
Oppression and injustice give the victimized group a just cause and the right to secede .
If a minority group is oppressed by the majority to the extent that almost every minority member is worse off than most members of the majority simply in virtue of belonging to the minority , then nationalist claims on behalf of the minority are morally plausible and potentially compelling .
The argument establishes a typical remedial right , acceptable from a liberal standpoint ( see the discussion in Kukathas and Poole 2000 , also Buchanan 1991 ; for past injustices see Waldron 1992 ) .
The Argument from Equality .
Members of a minority group are often disadvantaged in relation to the dominant culture because they have to rely on those with the same language and culture to conduct the affairs of daily life .
Therefore , liberal neutrality itself requires that the majority provide certain basic cultural goods , i.e. , granting differential rights ( see Kymlicka 1995 b , 2001 , and 2003 b ) .
Institutional protections and the right to the minority group ’s own institutional structure are remedies that restore equality and turn the resulting nation - state into a more moderate multicultural one .
The Argument from Success .
The nationstate has in the past succeeded in promoting equality and democracy .
Ethno-national solidarity is a powerful motive for a more egalitarian distribution of goods ( Miller 1995 ; Canovan 1996 , 2000 ) .
The nation - state also seems to be essential to safeguard the moral life of communities in the future , since it is the only form of political institution capable of protecting communities from the threats of globalization and assimilationism ( for a detailed critical discussion of this argument see Mason 1999 ) .
Andreas Wimmer ( 2018 ) presents an interesting discussion of the historical success of nation - state ( discussed in Knott , Tolz , Green , & Wimmer 2019 ) .
These political arguments can be combined with deep communitarian ones .
However , taken in isolation , their perspectives offer a “ liberal culturalism ” that is more suitable for ethno- culturally plural societies .
More remote from classical nationalism than the liberal one of Tamir and Nielsen , it eschews any communitarian philosophical underpinning . [ 23 ]
The idea of moderate nation - building points to an open multi-culturalism in which every group receives its share of remedial rights but , instead of walling itself off from others , participates in a common , overlapping civic culture in open communication with other sub-communities .
Given the variety of pluralistic societies and intensity of trans-national interactions , such openness seems to many to be the only guarantee of stable social and political life ( see the debate in Shapiro and Kymlicka 1997 ) .
In general , the liberal nationalist stance is mild and civil , and there is much to be said in favor of it .
It tries to reconcile our intuitions in favor of some sort of political protection of cultural communities with a liberal political morality .
Of course , this raises issues of compatibility between liberal universal principles and the particular attachments to one ’s ethno- cultural nation .
Very liberal nationalists such as Tamir divorce ethno- cultural nationhood from statehood .
Also , the kind of love for country they suggest is tempered by all kinds of universalist considerations , which in the last instance trump national interest ( Tamir 1993 : 115 ; 2019 : passim , see also Moore 2001 and Gans 2003 ) .
There is an ongoing debate among philosophical nationalists about how much weakening and compromising is still compatible with a stance ’s being nationalist at all . [ 24 ]
There is also a streak of cosmopolitan interest present in the work of some liberal nationalists ( Nielsen 1998 –99 ) . [ 25 ]
In the last two decades , the issues of nationalism have been increasingly integrated into the debate about the international order ( see the entries on globalization and cosmopolitanism ) .
The main conceptual link is the claim that nation - states are natural , stable , and suitable units of the international order .
A related debate concerns the role of minorities in the processes of globalization ( see Kaldor 2004 ) .
Moreover , the two approaches might ultimately converge : a multiculturalist liberal nationalism and a moderate , difference - respecting cosmopolitanism have a lot in common . [ 26 ]
3.4 Populism and a new face of nationalism
“ Populism ” is an umbrella term , covering both right - wing and left - wing varieties .
This section will pay attention to right - wing populist movements , very close to their traditional nationalist predecessors .
This corresponds to the situation in the biggest part of Europe , and in the US , where nationalist topics are being put forward by the right - wing populist . [ 27 ]
However , it has become quite clear that nationalism is only one of the political “ isms ” attracting the right - wing populists .
The migration crisis has brought to the forefront populist self - identification with linguistic - cultural communities ( “ we , French speaking people ” for the former , “ we Christians ” for the later ) that goes beyond nationalism .
Jan-Werner Müller ( 2016 ) and Cas Mudde ( 2007 ) note that the form common to all sorts of populism is quite simple and describe it as “ thin ” .
Mudde explains : “ Populism is understood as a thin - centered ideology that considers society to be ultimately separated into two homogeneous and antagonistic groups , ‘ the pure people ’ versus ‘ the corrupt elite ’ , and which argues that politics should be an expression of the volonté générale ( general will ) of the People ” ( 2007 : 23 ) .
Populism , so defined , has two opposites : elitism and pluralism .
First , there is the elite vs. people ( “ underdog ” ) contrast .
Second , it is possible to distinguish two ways of characterizing “ the people ” : either in terms of social status ( class , income - level , etc. ) or in terms of ethnic and / or cultural belonging ( see also de Cleen 2017 ) .
Elite ↓ Social ( class ) ← People → ethnic , cultural
The second , horizontal dimension distinguishes the predominantly left - wing from the predominantly right - wing populisms and leaves a place for a centrist populist option .
Take classical strong ethnic nationalism .
The relation between right - wing populism and such a nationalism is very tight .
This has led some theoreticians ( Taguieff 2015 ) to present “ nationalist populism ” as the only kind of populism .
The term captures exactly the synthesis of populism and the strong ethnic nationalism or nativism .
From populism , it takes the general schema of anti-elitism : the leader is addressing directly the people and is allegedly following the people ’s interest .
From nationalism , it takes the characterization of the people : it is the ethnic community , in most cases the state - owing ethnic community , or the ethno-nation .
In his work , Mudde documents the claim that purely right - wing populists claim to represent the true people who form the true nation and whose purity is being muddied by new entrants .
In the United States , one can talk about populist and reactionary movements , like the Tea Party , that have emerged through the recent experience of immigration , terrorist attacks , and growing economic polarization .
We have to set aside here , for reasons of space , the main populist alternative ( or quasi- alternative ) to national populism .
In some countries , like Germany , some populist groups - parties ( e.g. , German AfD party ( Alternative for Germany ) ) , appeal to properties much wider in their reach than ethno- national belonging , typically to religious affiliations .
Others combine this appeal with the ethno-national one .
This yields what Riva Kastoryano ( 2006 ) calls “ transnational nationalism ” .
Interestingly , liberal nationalism is not very attractive to the populists .
On the theoretical side one can note that Tamir ( 2019 ) sees her liberal nationalism as a good recipe against the threat of demagogues like Trump and Boris Johnson ( she avoids the use of the label “ populist ” , e.g. , 2019 : 31 ) .
The rise of populism is changing the political playfield one must work with .
The tolerant ( liberal nationalist or anti-nationalist ) views are confronting new problems in the populist age marked by migration crisis , etc .
The dangers traditionally associated with military presence are gone ; the national populists have to invent and construct a presumed danger that comes into the country together with foreign families , including those with children .
In short , if these conjectures hold , the politicians and theoreticians are faced with a change .
The traditional issue of the contrast between patriotism / nationalism and cosmopolitanism has changed its profile : the current drastic contrast is between the populist aversion to the foreigners - migrants and a more generous attitude of acceptance and Samaritan help .
Finally , the populist understanding of “ our people ” ( “ we - community ” ) encompasses not only nationalist options but also goes way beyond it .
The important element is the promiscuous character of the populist choices .
It is probable that the future scholarship on nationalism will mainly focus on this new and challenging playfield , with an aim to address the new contrast and locate kinds of nationalism in relation to it . [ 28 ]
3.5 Nation - state in global context
The migration crisis has made the nation - state in global context the central political topic concerning nationality .
Before moving on to current events , the state of art before the crisis should be summarized .
First , consider the debates on territory and nation and issues of global justice .
Liberal nationalists try to preserve the traditional nationalist link between ethnic “ ownership ” of the state and sovereignty and territorial control , but in a much more flexible and sophisticated setting .
Tamar Meisels thus argues in favor of “ taking existing national settlements into account as a central factor in demarcating territorial boundaries ” since this line “ has both liberal foundations ” ( i.e. , in the work of John Locke ) and liberal - national appeal ( 2009 : 159 ) grounded in its affinity with the liberal doctrine of national self - determination .
She combines it with Chaim Gans ’ ( 2003 : Ch. 4 ) interpretation of “ historical right ” claims as “ the right to formative territories ” .
She thus combines “ historical arguments , understood as claims to formative territories ” , with her argument from settlement and insists on their interplay and mutual reinforcement , presenting them as being “ most closely related to , and based on , liberal nationalist assumptions and underlying ideas ” ( Meisels 2009 : 160 ) .
She nevertheless stresses that more than one ethnic group can have formative ties to a given territory , and that there might be competing claims based on settlement . [ 29 ]
But , given the ethno-national conflicts of the twentieth century , one can safely assume that culturally plural states divided into isolated and closed sub-communities glued together merely by arrangements of modus vivendi are inherently unstable .
Stability might therefore require that the pluralist society envisioned by liberal culturalists promote quite intense intra-state interaction between cultural groups in order to forestall mistrust , reduce prejudice , and create a solid basis for cohabitation .
But where should one stop ?
The question arises since there are many geographically open , interacting territories of various sizes .
Consider first the geographical openness of big continental planes , then add the modern ease of interaction ( “ No island is an island any more ” , one could say ) , and , finally and dramatically , the substantial ecological interconnectedness of land and climate .
Here , the tough nationalistic line is no longer proposed seriously in ethical debates , so the furthest pro-national extreme is in fact a relatively moderate stance , exemplified by Miller in the works listed .
Here is a typical proposal of his concerning global justice based on nation - states : it might become a matter of national pride to have set aside a certain percentage of GDP for developmental goals — perhaps for projects in one particular country or group of countries ( 2013 : 182 ) .
This brings us to the topic of migrations , and the heated debate on the present scene . [ 30 ]
In Europe immigration is probably the main topic of the present day populist uproar , and in the United States it is one of the main topics .
So , immigration plus the nationalist - populist reactions to it are in the current decade the main testing ground for nationalist and cosmopolitan views .
Let ’s look at the pro-national side in the debate .
Liberal nationalists , in particular Miller , have put forward some thoughtful pro-nationalist proposal concerning immigration .
Miller ’s proposal allows refugees to seek asylum temporarily until the situation in their country of origin improves ; it also limits economic migration .
Miller argues against the defensibility of a global standard for equality , opportunity , welfare , etc. , because measures of just equality are context - bound .
People do have the right to a minimum standard of living , but the right to migrate only activates as a last resort after all other measures within a candidate - migrant ’s country of origin have been tried .
However , he also ( particularly in his book on “ Strangers in our midst ” , 2016 ) , claims that national responsibility to accept immigrant refugees is balanced by considerations of the interest of would - be immigrants and the interests that national communities have in maintaining control over their own composition and character .
If we agree with the liberal nationalists on the positive side , we can ask about the dynamics of the help required for the immigrants .
Distinguish at least three stages , first , the immediate emergency ( starvation , freezing , urgent medical problems ) and catering to it , second , settlement and learning ( on the host and the immigrant newcomer side ) , and third , the stage of ( some kind of ) citizenship , of relatively stable life in the host country .
In the first phase , the immediate help comes first , both normatively and causally : just accept the would - be refugees ( indeed , the would - be refugees should be helped in leaving their countries and travelling to the host country ) .
In longer term , staying should involve opportunity for work and training .
But there is more .
The Samaritan obligation can and should function as a preparation for wider global activity . [ 31 ]
So , we have two theoretical steps , first , accepting Samaritanism and second , agreeing with deeper trans-national measure of blocking distant causes , like poverty and wars in the Third world .
Let us call this “ Samaritan - to - deeper - measures model ” .
The model is geared to the dramatically changed playground in which the nationalism issues are played out in the context of populism and refugee crisis , raising issues that were not around two decades ago .
4. Conclusion
In presenting the claims that the pro-nationalists defend , we have proceeded from the more radical towards more liberal nationalist alternatives .
In examining the arguments for these claims , we have presented metaphysically demanding communitarian arguments resting upon deep communitarian assumptions about culture , such as the premise that the ethno- cultural nation is the most important community for all individuals .
This is an interesting and respectable claim , but its plausibility has not been established .
The moral debate about nationalism has resulted in various weakenings of culture - based arguments , typically proposed by liberal nationalists , which render the arguments less ambitious but much more plausible .
Having abandoned the old nationalist ideal of a state owned by a single dominant ethno- cultural group , liberal nationalists have become receptive to the idea that identification with a plurality of cultures and communities is important for a person ’s social identity .
They have equally become sensitive to trans-national issues and more willing to embrace a partly cosmopolitan perspective .
Liberal nationalism has also brought to the fore more modest , less philosophically or metaphysically charged arguments grounded in concerns about justice .
These stress the practical importance of ethno- cultural membership , ethno- cultural groups ’ rights to have injustices redressed , democratic rights of political association , and the role that ethno- cultural ties and associations can play in promoting just social arrangements .
The events in the current decade , the refugee crisis and the rise of right - wing populism , have dramatically changed the relevant practical and theoretical playground .
The traditional nationalism is still relevant , but populist nationalism attracts much more attention : new theories are being produced and debated , coming to occupy the center stage .
On the other hand , migration crisis has replaced the typical cosmopolitan issue of solidarity - with - distant - strangers with burning issues of helping refugees present at our doors .
Of course , the causes of the crisis are still the same ones that cosmopolitans have been worrying about much earlier : wars and dramatically unequal global distribution of goods , and of threats , like illnesses and climate disasters .
The task of the theory is now to connect these deeper issues with the new problems occupying the center - stage of the new playground ; it is a challenge now formulated in somewhat different vocabulary and within different political conceptual frameworks than before .
Soil bacteria could be used to help steady buildings against earthquakes , according to researchers at UC Davis .
The microbes can literally convert loose , sandy soil into rock .
When a major earthquake strikes , deep , sandy soils can turn to liquid , with disastrous consequences for buildings sitting on them .
Currently , civil engineers can inject chemicals into the soil to bind loose grains together .
But these epoxy chemicals may have toxic effects on soil and water , said Jason DeJong , an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at UC Davis .
The new process , so far tested only at a laboratory scale , takes advantage of a natural soil bacterium , Bacillus pasteurii .
The microbe causes calcite ( calcium carbonate ) to be deposited around sand grains , cementing them together .
By injecting bacterial cultures , additional nutrients and oxygen , DeJong and his colleagues found that they could turn loose , liquefiable sand into a solid cylinder .
" Starting from a sand pile , you turn it back into sandstone , " DeJong said .
Similar techniques have been used on a smaller scale , for example , to repair cracks in statues , but not to reinforce soil .
The new method has several advantages , DeJong said .
There are no toxicity problems , compared with chemical methods .
The treatment could be done after construction or on an existing building , and the structure of the soil is not changed -- some of the void spaces between grains are just filled in .
DeJong and his collaborators are working on scaling the method up to a practical size , and applying for funds to test the method in the earthquake - simulating centrifuge at UC Davis ' Center for Geotechnical Modeling .
The centrifuge is part of the national Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation , funded by the National Science Foundation .
A paper describing the work has been published in the Journal of Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering .

Monitoring server health by clock speed variations Back in 2003 when I set up my " new " old computer server , I wanted to make sure that its time was set correctly all the time .
This sort of thing is normally done with the NTP ( Network Time Protocol ) daemon .
But that would have been too easy , and I wanted even less traffic than I assumed NTP would cause , and all I cared about was to have my computer within a few seconds of actual time at all times .
So I set up a " cron job " that would , at an odd time of night , sync the local clock with a time server via the command " ntpdate " .
This command , interestingly , indicates how much of an adjustment is actually made when its run .
I decided to log this to a file to see how my server was doing .
Getting ready to upgrade this server to newer hardware , I , out of curiosity , graphed the daily adjustments versus time .
There was quite a few missing data points , due to NTP not working at random times , for reasons I did not investigate .
There was also large " spikes " in the graph for the times that my computer was rebooted and set its initial time to the CMOS clock , rather than keeping it off the main crystal .
There were various interesting features on this graph , including seasonal variations .
So I graphed this together with daily average temperature from the local weather station .
Daily clock adjust and average daily temperature vs. date , 2004 -2005
Removing the data points for after a reboot , there are still residual smaller spikes , which may have been caused by network delays .
I can see the graph go up and down in approximate trends .
Given the seasonal nature , I was pretty sure this was caused by changes in temperature .
Comparing this to outside temperature I can see that at least for the summer , temperature changes are reflected in daily clock adjustments with a bit of lag .
I keep the server in the basement , so the temperature variations that it experiences are only perhaps a third of the temperature variation outside .
For the winter , there is little correlation because the furnace regulates the inside temperature .
But , seeing that I do n't have air conditioning , outside temperatures do reflect temperatures in my basement during the summer .
Even more interesting was a discontinuity in the daily adjustment amount after the 24'th of April ( A ) , and before and after July 17 ' th of 2005 ( B , C ) .
See notations on graph of 2005 below : Daily clock adjust and average daily temperature vs. date in 2005
So I looked into what could have caused that change .
It turned out that on April 25 'th 2005 ( A ) , I replaced the power supply in the computer with another old power supply with a somewhat quieter variable speed fan .
This power supply made a difference in cpu speed , of about 0.1 seconds per day , or around 1 part per million .
I assume this was caused either by a slight change in supply voltage , or by reduced airflow from the quieter fan .
While I was travelling in Europe three months later , my server ended up dying of a power supply failure ( B ) .
When I got back , I put the old power supply back in on July 24 'th ( C ) , causing another change in CPU speed , back to the characteristics of the original power supply .
Also interesting is that the power supply failed during a heat wave .
Looking at the heat wave from around Jun 10 'th , we can see that this was reflected in the server CPU speed with maybe two days of lag .
So probably , the computer got as warm as it ever got when the power supply failed .
High temperature probably was what put the quieter power supply over the edge .
So what can I conclude from this ?
Well , CPU speed does show interesting variations , and may give clues as to why a computer may have failed , especially after the fact .
I think this sort of thing might be interesting if you have a server that you keep offsite to monitor whether something may be up with it without adding extra hardware .
I figure that sort of thing might be useful if you are somebody like Google , with thousands of cheap computers that fail on a regular basis .
Also , if temperature can indeed drive a system over the edge , this might be usefulfor testing servers at times where failure is more acceptable .
As for me , its an interesting curiosity worth sharing .

Scientists working at a British laboratory have achieved one of the most controversial breakthroughs ever made in the field of stem cell science by taking cells from dead embryos and turning them into living tissue .
The technique could soon be used to create treatments for patients suffering from diseases such as Alzheimer 's and Parkinson's , the researchers say .
The breakthrough has been hailed by many scientists and ethical experts because it could circumvent opposition to stem cell experiments .
' This should get round opposition to stem cell science because live embryos will no longer need to be used in all experiments , ' said Professor Miodrag Stojkovic , the researcher who carried out the experiments at the Centre for Stem Cell Biology at Newcastle University last year .
But other experts last night warned that the use of dead embryo cells could lead to more ethical dilemmas , not fewer .
' How do you know when an embryo is dead ? ' said Eric Meslin , director of the Indiana University center of bioethics .
Stem cells extracted from embryos are prized by scientists because they are capable of turning into any cell or tissue type in the body .
Ultimately they could be used as treatments for heart disease and diabetes and other diseases , researchers argue .
But the technology involves creating and destroying living embryos to extract stem cells .
Usually these embryos are made at fertility clinics when couples go for in vitro fertilisation ( IVF ) .
However , Stojkovic 's work suggests it may be possible to avoid using live embryos ; instead , scientists use those that have died naturally during IVF .
It would also mean that many more embryos were available for research and eventual treatment of the diseases , speeding up advancements in the cutting - edge science .
Stojkovic 's experiments were carried out while he was working at the Centre for Stem Cell Biology at Newcastle last year .
In a paper , published last week online on the website of the journal Stem Cells , Stojkovic reveals he and his colleagues took 13 embryos , created by IVF .
All 13 had stopped developing a few days after conception .
' They were in a very early stage of development , ' said Stojkovic , now head of Sintocell , the Serbian medical research centre .
The team then waited 24 hours to check that the embryos were no longer dividing before beginning their experiments .
' These were all deemed to be arrested embryos , ' said Stojkovic .
' In other words , they were dead .
[ But ] they had the capacity to develop any different type of cell you could think of , including kidney cells , liver cells , and skin cells . '
' I think this is a very important development , although stem cells created this way should not be seen as an alternative to those made from live embryos .
They should be seen as an additional source . '
Last night right - to - life campaigners called for caution .
' In theory if an embryo is obtained ethically and a stem cell can be derived after that embryo has died naturally , then that will remove all ethical objections as there is no destruction of a living organism , ' said Josephine Quintavalle , of Comment on Reproductive Ethics , a Catholic campaign group .
' We do not have objections to the use of donated tissue and organs in other areas of medicine . '
But Quintavalle warned that the case for the use of dead embryo cells had not been proved .
' There is the critical question of how you know when an embryo is dead or not . '
George Daley , of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute , said the paper 's approach raised scientific concerns .
' If there was something wrong with the embryo that made it arrest , is n't there something wrong with these cells ?
We do n't know . '
However , Stojkovic 's work was given strong backing by Donald Landry , at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York , who called the work an important addition to the field .
' Regardless of how you feel about personhood for embryos , if the embryo is dead , then the issue of personhood is resolved , ' Landry said .
' This then reduces the ethics of human embryonic stem cell generation to the ethics of , say , organ donation .
So now you 're really saying , " Can we take live cells from dead embryos the way we take live organs from dead patients ? " '
What they do
· Embryonic stem cells have the ability to develop into any type of cell in the human body , from brain cells to skin and kidney cells .
· By creating cloned embryos of patients , it might one day be possible to grow their stem cells in the laboratory , say scientists .
These could use then be used as transplants .
· Diseases such as diabetes , Alzheimer 's and Parkinson 's - in which particular organs or pieces of tissue have been destroyed - are thought to be the best candidates for treatments
